40|$|<b>Segment</b> <b>mirror</b> phasing, a {{critical}} step of <b>segment</b> <b>mirror</b> alignment, requires {{the ability to}} sense and correct the relative pistons between segments from up to a few hundred microns to a fraction of wavelength {{in order to bring}} the mirror system to its full diffraction capability. When sampling the aperture of a telescope, using auto-collimating flats (ACFs) is more economical. The performance of a telescope with a <b>segmented</b> primary <b>mirror</b> strongly depends on how well those primary <b>mirror</b> <b>segments</b> can be phased. One such process to phase primary <b>mirror</b> <b>segments</b> in the axial piston direction is dispersed fringe sensing (DFS). DFS technology can be used to co-phase the ACFs. DFS is essentially a signal fitting and processing operation. It is an elegant method of coarse phasing <b>segmented</b> <b>mirrors.</b> DFS performance accuracy is dependent upon careful calibration of the system as well as other factors such as internal optical alignment, system wavefront errors, and detector quality. Novel improvements to the algorithm have led to substantial enhancements in DFS performance. The Advanced Dispersed Fringe Sensing (ADFS) Algorithm is designed to reduce the sensitivity to calibration errors by determining the optimal fringe extraction line. Applying an angular extraction line dithering procedure and combining this dithering process with an error function while minimizing the phase term of the fitted signal, defines in essence the ADFS algorithm...|$|R

50|$|<b>Segmented</b> <b>mirrors</b> do {{have the}} {{drawback}} that each segment may require some precise asymmetrical shape, and rely on a complicated computer-controlled mounting system. All of the segments also cause diffraction effects in the final image.|$|R

50|$|All {{proposed}} {{designs for}} the OWL are variations on a <b>segmented</b> <b>mirror,</b> {{since there is no}} technology available to build, and transport along large distances, a monolithic 60- or 100-meter mirror. The operation of a <b>segmented</b> <b>mirror</b> is somewhat more complicated than a monolithic one, requiring careful alignment of the segments (a technique called cophasing). Experience gained in existing segmented mirrors (for example, the Keck telescope) suggests that the mirror proposed for the OWL is feasible. However, the projected cost (of around €1.5 billion) was considered too high, so the ESO is now building the smaller European Extremely Large Telescope around 39 m in diameter.|$|E

40|$|One {{approach}} to the adaptive control of large <b>segmented</b> <b>mirrors</b> involves sending tilt commands to each segment and allowing each segment to minimize the distance between its edges and those of (all or some of) its neighbors. This approach has been adopted in the Phased Array Mirror, Extendible Large Aperture (PAMELA) testbed now located at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL. This approach minimizes (1) the communication between the sensors and the segment actuators and (2) computations required by the central controlling computer. This report discusses issues that large <b>segmented</b> <b>mirrors</b> built around the PAMELA concept (such as SELENE) will face when they migrate to integrated, and presumably to digital, on-segment computational ability and high bandwidth response...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} adjust the poses of the <b>segment</b> <b>mirrors</b> and give the correct surface shape to a large {{aperture}} telescope, an active adjusting platform for <b>segment</b> <b>mirror</b> with a novel 3 CPS parallel manipulator as core module is proposed. The platform has 6 degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) including three translational freedoms and three rotational freedoms. Its kinematics are analysed systematically. By means of the Rodrigues parameters method, the formulae for solving the inverse/forward displacement, the inverse/forward velocity, and the inverse/ forward acceleration kinematics are derived. A numerical simulation of the kinematics model is then carried out combining the topological structure characteristics of the manipulator. The correctness of the kinematics model is verified by an experiment in which the pose of moving platform is measured using a photogrammetric method...|$|R

40|$|The <b>mirror</b> <b>segments</b> for the E-ELT and TLT {{are nearly}} equal {{in size and}} shape (hexagonal, 1. 2 m over flat sides).

TNO has designed and build (together with VDL-ETG) three identical prototypes for supporting the <b>mirror</b> <b>segments</b> of the E-ELT. These <b>mirror</b> <b>segments</b> vary in size.
