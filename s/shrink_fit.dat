When the jacket is in position, it is cooled to form a tensioned <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> over the tube. Then the next hoop (either B2 or C1) is similarly heated so the assembled A tube and B1 jacket can be lowered into position for a successive <b>shrink</b> <b>fit.</b> The assembled unit may be machined prior to fitting a new hoop. The process continues as remaining tubes are heated sequentially and cooled onto the built-up unit until all elements have been assembled.

50|$|Cylinder walls {{can become}} very worn or damaged from use. If {{the engine is}} not {{equipped}} with replaceable sleeves {{there is a limit}} to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced. In such cases where the use of a sleeve or liner can restore proper clearances to an engine. Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable. A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop. The engine block is mounted on a precision boring machine where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference fit. The sleeves can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a <b>shrink</b> <b>fit.</b> This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily. When the engine block cools down it shrink fits around the sleeve holding it into place. Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine. When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system. Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and honed to match the piston. Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper ring seating at break in.|$|E
40|$|Thermal <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> chucks {{are widely}} used in high {{performance}} machining where excellent concentricity and high torque transmission are required. It was reported that in those milling operations, severe damage of tools, workpieces, and also machine tools occurs due to an extraction of the milling tool out of the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> chuck during the process. Although, theoretically the interference fit assembly should withstand certain process forces, milling tools are apparently pulled out under special process conditions. The resulting increase of the cutting depth often leads to tool overload and breakage. So far, the phenomenon of tool extraction could not be explained. This paper presents an experimental approach of {{the investigation of the}} phenomenon of axial tool extraction. Therefore, a unique type of test rig for main spindles and tool interfaces is used. Experimental investigations on dynamic force and torque combinations leading to tool extraction are described.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} experimental and theoretical study of subsynchronous rotordynamic instability in rotors caused by interference and <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interfaces. The experimental studies show {{the presence of}} strong unstable subsynchronous vibrations in two different rotor setups with interference and <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interfaces that were operated above their first critical speeds. The unstable vibrations occur at the first natural frequency of the rotor-bearing system. The instability caused complete wreckage of the test rig {{in one of the}} setups showing that these vibrations are potentially dangerous to the safe operation of rotating machines. The two different rotor setups that are studied are a single-disk rotor mounted on a uniform diameter shaft and a two-disk rotor with an aluminum sleeve shrink fitted to it at the outer surface of the two disks. In the single-disk rotor, an adjustable interference arrangement between the disk and the shaft is obtained through a tapered sleeve arrangement, which acts as the interference fit joint. The unstable sub-synchronous vibrations originate from slippage in the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> and the interference fit interfaces that develop friction forces, which act as destabilizing cross-coupled moments when the rotor is operated above its first critical speed. The unique contribution offered through this work is the experimental validation of a physically correct model of internal friction which models the destabilizing mechanism as a system of cross-coupled internal moments at the <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interface. The dissertation describes stability simulations of various test rotor setups using the correct internal moments model. A commercial finite-element based software called XLTRCTM is used to perform rotordynamic simulations for stability studies. The method of stability study is the computation of eigenvalues of the rotor-bearing system. A negative real part of the eigenvalue indicates instability. The simulations include the test rotors that were experimentally observed as stable and unstable with shrink and interference fit interfaces in their assemblies. The dissertation also describes the simulations of various imagined rotor configurations with <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> interfaces, and seeks to explain how configurations differ on rotordynamic stability depending upon several rotor-bearing parameters such as geometry and elastic properties, as well as upon the amount of internal friction parameters, which differ from configuration to configuration...|$|E

40|$|In some powder {{metallurgy}} part forming, when high compacting loads {{would require a}} too large single <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> die, or the inner die diameter is very large but the compaction area is modest, twice <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> dies, which are relatively expensive and complex to build, should be used. In both cases, at any given compacting load, the design should minimise dimensions and stresses. The design targets are minimum die size, optimum intermediate diameter and optimum interference, with maximum stresses on each die item lower than those allowable for the selected materials. In dual mode, for fixed overall dimension, intermediate diameters and shrink fitting interference should enable to maximise the compacting load without exceeding the allowable maximum stresses. In {{the first part of}} this work, for cylindrical shapes (circular profile dies) and axisymmetric plane stress problems, dimensions, interferences and stress–strain states have been analytically calculated to optimise doubly <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> dies in the abovementioned sense. In the second part, the same evaluations for axisymmetric generic problems have been carried out by finite element method (FEM) approach integrated in an optimisation procedure. The minimum overall dimensions of the die are presented as a function of the ratio between applied load and maximum allowable stress. Corresponding interferences and optimum diameters have been calculated. Some approximate equations for a quick and handy optimisation are presented. The differences between analytical and numerical results obviously depend on the consideration of the actually stressed length, or compact height, and total die height. The comparison indicates that FEM analyses are needed since analytical calculations generally give low approximations, especially for some die geometries...|$|R

40|$|To {{assemble}} the fulcrum of bascule bridges, a trunnion is immersed into liquid nitrogen {{so that it}} can be <b>shrunk</b> <b>fit</b> into the hub. This is followed by immersing the resulting trunnion-hub assembly into liquid nitrogen {{so that it can}} be then <b>shrunk</b> <b>fit</b> into the girder. On one occasion in Florida, when the trunnion-hub assembly was put into liquid nitrogen, development of cracks on the hub was observed. Experimental and numerical studies conducted since 1998 at University of South Florida show that the cracking took place due to combination of high interference stresses in the trunnion-hub assembly, low fracture toughness of steel at cryogenic temperatures, and steep temperature gradients due to sudden cooling. In this study, we are studying the benefit of staged cooling to avoid cracking in the trunnion-hub assembly when it is cooled down for shrink fitting. We looked at three cooling processes - 1) Direct immersion into liquid nitrogen 2) Immersion into a refrigerated chamber, then liquid nitrogen 3) Immersion into a refrigerated chamber, then a dry-ice/alcohol bath, and finally liquid nitrogen. The geometry of the trunnion-hub assembly was approximated by a composite made of two infinitely long hollows cylinders. The transient problem of temperature distribution and the resulting stresses was solved using finite difference method. Using critical crack lengths and Von-Mises stress as failure criteria, the three cooling processes were compared. The study showed that the minimum critical crack length and stress ratio is increased by as much as 200 % when cooling first in refrigerated air followed by liquid nitrogen. However, there is little benefit from adding dry-ice/alcohol as an intermediate step in the cooling process...|$|R
