This is because sediment grain size analysis throughout a profile allows inference into the erosion or accretion rates possible if shore dynamics are modified. Planners and managers should also be aware that the coastal environment is dynamic and contextual science should be evaluated before implementation of any <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> modification. Thus theoretical studies, laboratory experiments, numerical and hydraulic modelling seek to answer questions pertaining to littoral drift and sediment deposition, the results should not be viewed in isolation and a substantial body of purely qualitative observational data should supplement any planning or management decision.|$|E
5000|$|The null-point {{hypothesis}} {{explains how}} sediment is deposited throughout a <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> {{according to its}} grain size. This {{is due to the}} influence of hydraulic energy, resulting in a seaward-fining of sediment particle size, or where fluid forcing equals gravity for each grain size. The concept can also be explained as [...] "sediment of a particular size may move across the profile to a position where it is in equilibrium with the wave and flows acting on that sediment grain". This sorting mechanism combines the influence of the down-slope gravitational force of the profile and forces due to flow asymmetry, the position where there is zero net transport is known as the null point and was first proposed by Cornaglia in 1889. Figure 1 illustrates this relationship between sediment grain size and the depth of the marine environment.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{principle}} {{underlying the}} null point theory {{is due to}} the gravitational force; finer sediments remain in the water column for longer durations allowing transportation outside the surf zone to deposit under calmer conditions. The gravitational effect, or settling velocity determines the location of deposition for finer sediments, whereas a grain's internal angle of friction determines the deposition of larger grains on a <b>shore</b> <b>profile.</b> The secondary principle to the creation of seaward sediment fining is known as the hypothesis of asymmetrical thresholds under waves; this describes the interaction between the oscillatory flow of waves and tides flowing over the wave ripple bedforms in an asymmetric pattern. [...] "The relatively strong onshore stroke of the wave forms an eddy or vortex on the lee side of the ripple, provided the onshore flow persists, this eddy remains trapped in the lee of the ripple. When the flow reverses, the eddy is thrown upwards off the bottom and a small cloud of suspended sediment generated by the eddy is ejected into the water column above the ripple, the sediment cloud is then moved seaward by the offshore stroke of the wave." [...] Where there is symmetry in ripple shape the vortex is neutralised, the eddy and its associated sediment cloud develops {{on both sides of the}} ripple. This creates a cloudy water column which travels under tidal influence as the wave orbital motion is in equilibrium.|$|E

The quantification of dune growth due to aeolian processes has received some attention but uncertainty remains on where the dune sand, which accommodates growing dunes, originates from in the coastal profile.

No significant erosive trend due to aeolian processes was found at the upper beach at this temporal resolution.

40|$|Because the Yukon coast {{along the}} Beaufort Sea {{has the highest}} ground ice {{contents}} in the Canadian Arctic and, in addition, faces the direction of most effective storms, this section of coast {{is considered to be}} highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In order to gain insight into the regional coastal dynamics, a quantification of coastal change was undertaken that allowed the determination of spatial and temporal variability of coastal change along a 35 km long section of coast, stretching from Komakuk to the international border. Shorelines from several years between 1951 and 2009 were digitized from georeferenced aerial photographs and an ortho-rectified SPOT image. Shoreline change statistics were subsequently calculated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) extension for Esri ArcGIS. Theodolite and real-time kinematic GPS data that was collected during several surveys between 1991 and 2012 at two Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) monitoring sites (Border site and Komakuk site) were analysed to provide higher temporal resolution of coastal change for the last two decades. Additionally, the field survey data enabled an assessment to be made of the contribution of geomorphic variables (i. e. beach slope, beach width, cliff slope, absolute cliff height, relative cliff height) towards explaining changes of coastal erosion. According to the findings, the mean annual erosion along the western Yukon coast has been - 1. 2 ± 0. 4 m/a over the entire period of study, with the rates decreasing through time from - 1. 4 ± 0. 6 m/a between 1951 and 1972, to - 1. 2 ± 0. 5 m/a between 1972 and 2009. However, site specific investigations show that there are differences in the mean erosion rates and in temporal trends. To the west at the Border site, the mean annual erosion rate is - 1. 3 ± 0. 3 m/a, and the rates have recently accelerated, while at Komakuk in the east of the study area, the mean annual erosion rate is - 0. 9 ± 0. 2 m/a, with the rates decelerating over time. A comparison of these findings to erosion rates from the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast indicates that there is a general spatial pattern of decreasing erosion rates from the west to the east. The quantified erosion rates also enabled the calculation of mean annual land loss between 1951 and 2009, which amounted to 4. 5 ha/a. An analysis of the influence of <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> parameters on mean annual erosion rates showed a statistically significant correlation between beach widths and erosion rates (r= 0. 84) at the Border site.

40|$|Recently an {{innovative}} nourishment method {{has been applied}} as a counter measure for coastal recession in the Netherlands. This soft engineering solution, {{also known as the}} Sand Engine, consists of a shoreline perturbation of 21. 5 Mm 3 sand which will be redistributed along the shore by the natural forces of waves, tides and winds over a stretch of 10 km to prevent coastal retreat. It is expected that this multifunctional 'building with nature' solution has several economical, ecological and recreational advantages compared to the traditional nourishment approaches. The mega nourishment intervention may therefore become one of the common nourishment methods to combat beach erosion. The international potential is assessed by determining the relative influence of wave climate parameters and nourishment dimensions on the lifetime of a mega nourishment for a straight alongshore uniform sandy shore. The Mega Nourishment tool has been developed to obtain a first estimate of the lifetime for a geographical location in the world by computing the nourishment redistribution and the cross shore erosion of the shore using wave climates from two global wave models. The redistribution of the nourishment is caused by gradients in the LST and is simulated with the Unibest-CL+ coastline model. For the coastal erosion two process are taken into account: The erosion due to a rising sea level and the landward directed sediment loss during a storm simulated with a 1 D Xbeach model. A comparison has been made between the tool results and an other model simulation of the Sand Engine. All simulations estimated different redistribution rates for the Sand Engine depending on the wave climate used. The lifetime predictions for the simulations were however similar. The Sand Engine is estimated to be sufficient to protect 10 km of coast for a period of about 50 years. The tool is furthermore used to simulate many cases with different wave climates, nourishment dimensions, cross <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> shapes and sediment sizes. Using these results several conclusions are drawn. The redistribution rate is predominantly determined by the wave energy. A larger directional spreading and wave steepness also slightly increases the redistribution rate. The spreading of the nourishment is found to be less sensitive to different shapes of the cross <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> and grain sizes larger than 250 μm. For smaller grain sizes the redistribution however rapidly increases. The erosion rate calculated by the tool can only be used as an indicative estimate. Based on the model results several empirical relations and a design graph are derived to estimate the redistribution and the lifetime of a mega nourishment. These equations can be used for an initial design of a mega nourishment. To obtain an accurate lifetime prediction it is recommended to pay sufficient attention {{to the quality of the}} wave data and the estimation of the shoreline erosion.

Abrasion mainly occurred at Tanjung Bunga (head land) where the coast retreat 181. 1 m. Accretion occur in the bay area (Tanjung Merdeka) where the coast advance to the sea for about 59. 8 m.

40|$|The highly dynamic {{nature of}} some sandy shores with {{continuous}} morphological changes require {{the development of}} efficient and accurate methodological strategies for coastal hazard assessment and morphodynamic characterisation. During the past decades, the general methodological approach {{for the establishment of}} coastal monitoring programmes was based on photogrammetry or classical geodetic techniques. With the advent of new geodetic techniques, space-based and airborne-based, new methodologies were introduced in coastal monitoring programmes. This paper describes the development of a monitoring prototype that is based on the use of global positioning system (GPS). The prototype has a GPS multiantenna mounted on a fast surveying platform, a land vehicle appropriate for driving in the sand (four-wheel quad).

40|$|Stabilization of the Yaquina Bay {{shoreline}} {{along the}} northeastern {{edge of the}} Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) campus in Newport, Oregon became necessary to halt erosion that threatened both HMSC critical infrastructure (seawater storage tank) and public access to the HMSC Nature Trail. A Dynamic Revetment (gravel beach) was installed in November, 2011 on 260 feet of shoreline to mitigate erosion. Shoreline topographic and biological monitoring was initiated before and has continued after the project completion. Monitoring of beach profiles indicated that as of January 2016 the 2011 Dynamic Revetment Project (DRP) has generally successfully stabilized the shoreline in the project area. Beach profile data also indicated that a 200 -ft DRP constructed in 2007 continued {{to be successful in}} stabilizing further retreat of the shoreline. In both areas, some loss of gravel {{at the top of the}} <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> due to overtopping of the beach during highest tides was noted, and some additional placement of gravel at these locations is recommended. As a result of the rapid erosion that continued through much of 2015 in the adjacent Reference beach area, an extension of the 2011 DRP project to the south was completed during February 2015. This extension converted the Reference area used for monitoring the 2011 project into an additional gravel beach area (DRP 2015), which clearly differed from its previous characteristics. However, given the highly eroded condition of the Reference area in 2013 - 2014, the transition may have actually improved conditions for some monitored parameters (e. g. wrack invertebrates). Monitoring of beach wrack invertebrates, fish, and vegetation was conducted in 2015 for the fifth and last year. The Reference (DRP 2015) area had significantly higher abundance per unit dry wt versus both the DRP (2011) and DRP Reference (2007) samples. In contrast to previous years when the total amount of beach wrack was much sparser in the Reference area due to the eroded <b>shore</b> <b>profile,</b> there was little apparent difference in wrack accumulation along the shoreline. As has been a consistent pattern, fish were significantly more abundant in the Reference area compared to the DRP. However, this pattern was present in the pre-project sampling, and the Reference area may have a higher degree of physical habitat complexity. This was certainly true after the completion of the DRP 2015, where in addition to the root masses of trees that have been eroded onto the shore, six additional tree root masses were emplaced along the shoreline as an experiment. As has consistently been observed, vegetation coverage was significantly greater and presence of non-living substrata was significantly less in the Reference (DRP 2015) area as compared to the DRP. These differences are consistent with the pre-DRP 2011 project site differences, probably resulting from a low area of the shoreline which allows increased flooding and associated disturbance in the DRP back shore area. Fish and wrack invertebrates, such as beach hoppers, continue to utilize the DRP project area. Biological differences in fish and vegetation observed in the monitoring in 2015 tended to reflect differences in habitat that were present before the DRP 2011 project was implemented...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} geomorphic modelling of {{the main}} Norfolk study area, the 50 km of the coast between Blakeney Spit and Winterton Ness, specifically the eroding cliffs, shore platforms, beaches, dunes and coast protection structures. The models represent both the natural eroding coastal system and past and future management interventions. Numerical experiments are also used to explore the possible dynamics of this coast if it were in a natural state. The ‘reduced complexity’ modelling tool Soft Cliff and Platform Erosion (SCAPE) is core to the analyses. It is described, along {{with the development of}} the quasi-three-dimensional Norfolk model. This model links marine hydrodynamic models to those of cliff failure, coastal flooding and economic risk. These links are described, along with the cliff instability module, the representation of beach fluctuation and beach nourishment (both natural and artificial). Results are shown to illustrate processes operating at a range of scales, including (millennial scale) emergence of the <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> and beach volumes; (century scale) foreshore lowering, sensitivity to variations in rock strength, sediment transport potential and rate of sea-level rise; and (decadal scale) growth of wave impact forces, emergence of large-scale sand waves, probability density functions of beach volume, probabilistic cliff recession and the effects of beach nourishment. The benefits of such ‘reduced complexity’ modelling in general are highlighted. These include {{a deeper understanding of the}} coastal geomorphology, improved predictability, long-term model stability and ready coupling to other models. The approach is also relatively quick to apply and so can be implemented in practitioner studies, and the results are informing coastal planning in North Norfolk. Important features of the work include its large scale, which the coastal management process greatly needs, and the potential to use probabilistic methods, which allow economic risk to be derived to inform management decision-making. In terms of the Tyndall Coastal Simulator, the SCAPE model was a key element in linking the offshore conditions to human consequences (flood and erosion risk). It stresses the mediating role of coastal geomorphology in this link. Depending on how the coast is managed, those geomorphic processes can enhance (via erosion) or reduce (via accretion) these risks. The beach volumes were a direct input to the inundation analysis (Chap. 8), which together with the clifftop position informed the risk analysis (Chap. 9) ...|$|E

The wave erosion model is driven by a suite of relative sea-level (RSL) curves for the last 16000 years produced from four glacial rebound models. Multiple runs are performed with different initial shore profiles and rock resistances to investigate shoreline evolution and the significance of inherited morphology on the resultant profile shape. The simulated profiles, which encompass supratidal, intertidal and subtidal environments, are then compared with mapped profiles from three areas of the north of Ireland with different lithological and hydrographic properties. The mapped profiles are compiled from detailed analysis of high resolution (1 m) swath bathymetry and backscatter data, which {{is used to}} compile a database of seafloor morphology, submerged shore platform location, depth and characteristics. Modelled profiles generally replicate the overall mean shoreline gradients observed across the region when rock resistance is relatively high and erosion rates correspondingly low. In these profiles, breaks in mean slope are observed at depths comparable to the RSL minima in several of the RSL scenarios (at c. - 10 m, - 15 m and - 20 m for North Antrim, Derry and Donegal respectively). At Portrush and Portballintrae (Derry), profiles may be influenced by structural controls relating to the underlying basalt surface and the removal of overlying glaciogenic sediments. All RSL scenarios replicate the observed eastward increase in cliff-platform junction height, reflecting the differential glacioisostatic rebound experienced along the coast. However, the precise elevation at which the simulated cliff base occurs is sensitive to the choice of RSL scenario, suggesting that this parameter may prove useful in evaluating glacial rebound model performance. Several of the RSL scenarios generate raised shore platforms or terraces in North Antrim and Derry at heights comparable to raised shoreline features reported in the literature. However, no single curve or combination of parameters is capable of generating the range of platform and terrace features observed in the bathymetric and topographic data. Notably, a wide sub-horizontal platform at - 7 to - 8 m {{in the western part of}} Ballycastle Bay could not be simulated satisfactorily. These misfits are consistent with the idea that many rock platform or terrace features are inherited from an earlier phase or phases of RSL.

However, the shoreline {{to the north of the}} last structure began eroding just two years after the completion of this project. The objective of this study was to set up and calibrate a mathematical model of shoreline change to understand this erosion and to evaluate options for future protection. The one-line model GENESIS was selected and an extensive sensitivity analysis carried out to assess the reliability of the results. Available data - which includes shoreline surveys before, during and after the CRMP project and long term wave data recorded at Colombo - was augmented by measurements of the shoreline north of the last structure. <b>Shore</b> <b>profiles</b> and grain sizes were also obtained. The model was applied to the shoreline changes observed between and northwards of the last seven groynes of the CRMP project both during and after construction. The model results were in reasonable agreement with observations. The high erosion rates north of the last structure were due to the reduced sand supply from the south, i. e. the structures to the south were trapping more of the nourished sand than expected in the design of the CRMP project. The model was used to assess options - including the groynes constructed recently - for the protection of this shoreline. While different options were able to stabilize specific areas, erosion will continue somewhere until the sand supply is augmented by further sand nourishment.

At the other shores they are originated from adjacent sea cliffs, but at Miura shore, they are supplied both from the Ohse river and from sea cliff.

(2) In these areas, there is longshore drift of sediments in each shore. And main moving particles are below 32 mm, for the particles 32 mm have high roundness by compared with those above 32 mm. (3) In these shores, the sediments have lower roundness of sediments than Kumanoura shore (NAKAYAMA, 1965) and Atsumi shore (YAMANOUSHI, 1967).

40|$|Additional thesis - The {{exchange}} and transport of sediment between intertidal zone and backshore are subject of ongoing research {{in order to}} assess the dynamic behaviour of sandy coastal systems. How the sediment moves in the coastal system is relevant knowledge for e. g. the Dutch coastal nourishment programme. It is a scientific challenge to describe and predict the transport of sediment. There is recent progress in describing the aeolian transport. De Vries et al (2014 a) gives a new model approach for describing aeolian sediment transport in supply limited situations. The state of the art AeoLiS model covers the aeolian domain only and is not capable of describing the exchange between the shore face and the intertidal zone (de Vries, personal communication 2016). The aim of this additional graduation work is to assess the effect of variability in topography and grain size distribution on aeolian processes in the intertidal zone. It is hypothesised that there is a measurable daily variability of the topography and grain size distribution along the cross <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> and that these factors {{have a significant effect on}} aeolian transport. Detailed measurements of the intertidal zone are needed to describe the topographic change of the intertidal zone and the variability in grain size distribution. From 11 till 15 October 2016 fieldwork was done at the intertidal zone near Kijkduin. With use of a laser scanner the daily topographical changes were monitored. Sediment samples were taken along the beach profile to assess the variability in grain size distribution. The gathered laser scan data was processed and a variability in topography was measured. The sediment samples were sieved in the lab to find the mean grain size, d 50 per sample. A variability in d 50 was measured along the profile. The influence of the variability in topography and grain size distribution on the aeolian sediment transport on a daily scale, is assessed using the AeoLiS model. The results of the simulations show that the measured variability in topography does not has a significant influence on the predicted aeolian transport. The influence of the variability in grain size distribution is illustrated with 3 sediment samples (with increasing d 50 values). The sample with the smallest d 50 gave surprising low results for the predicted aeolian transport. It appeared that this sample had a significantly higher fraction of coarse sediment (small pebbles/shell fractions) compared to the other samples. This was considered an outlier. After removing the outlier from the sample, the aeolian transport increased. Now, the results show that the predicted aeolian transport decreases with increasing grain sizes. The removing of the outlier shows the potential of armouring; a small fraction of coarser material in the bed can have a significant effect on the aeolian transport.

40|$|This {{series of}} studies assesses spatial and {{temporal}} changes to the dune/beach system at Fire Island, New York. This dissertation presents three chapters in manuscript format. The first manuscript provides a comprehensive literature review of existing sediment budget estimates at Fire Island to better understand sediment supply influences on behavior and evolution of the island. The manuscript finds agreement among all existing sediment budgets for Fire Island which estimate that approximately 200, 000 m 3 /yr more sediment is leaving the system to the west than is entering the system to the east. This amount of loss is {{in spite of a}} relative lack of overall landward migration along the western reach of the island. The lack of migration coupled with the loss of sediment from the western reach indicates that a sediment source not quantified in the existing estimates must be present and contributing sufficient sediment for this part of the island to maintain position. A number of possible sediment sources are explored, with the most likely source identified as a series of shoreface-attached sand ridges found west of Watch Hill. These ridges are composed of texturally and mineralogically compatible beach sand of sufficient quantity to serve as a viable source to western Fire Island. ^ The second manuscript assesses morphologic change over the last decade at two Fire Island study sites to better understand specific subaerial expressions of east-west differences and responses to anthropogenic modifications. The sites are situated in eastern and western reaches of the island where antecedent geology and long-term landward island migration patterns are known to differ. High resolution topography from 13 surveys spanning a decade is used to measure elevation change, volume differences, shoreline, dune crestline, and dune toe positional change rates, as well as beach width and profile slope. Results show that western beaches are wider, dunes are lower, with more gradual cross <b>shore</b> <b>profile</b> slopes than areas further east. The differences in profile configurations from east to west are attributed to differences in antecedent geology and the offshore geologic framework. These results are compounded by impacts from a western beach replenishment project completed during the study period. A more dissipative cross shore morphology to the west may be better able to attenuate storm wave energy than the eastern portion of the island; the addition of replenishment material to the western dunes and beaches may therefore only add to a profile morphologically predisposed to a dissipative state. ^ The final manuscript assesses long-term morphologic change over 10, 30, and 40 year intervals along the entire dune/beach system at Fire Island to determine the relative importance of storm events, modifications, and geologic controls on long-term change. High resolution surfaces from 1969, 1999, and 2009, are supplemented by more temporally dense datasets in several sites along the coast. Topography is used to determine elevation change, net movement of dune crestlines and shorelines, and to isolate areas of persistent elevation loss and gain over 10 and 30 year intervals, both along-island and in morphologically defined zones of coast. In addition, spatial patterns of change, correlation among features, and significance were assessed to better understand behavior and response to natural events and human modifications to the coast. Results show that a series of storm events in the early 1990 s had long-term impacts on the system, and that post-storm recovery of the dune crestline along the island is ongoing. Although a number of replenishment projects have been conducted over the last half century, and particularly over the last decade, clear evidence of morphologic change attributable to these modification impacts was not evident to extract in the long-term signal. Zonal patterns of change and correlation are closely linked with existing morphology; differences in morphology and landward migration patterns from east to west are distinctive and likely related to morphologic controls such as antecedent and offshore framework geology. ^ The three manuscripts demonstrate that although anthropogenic modifications have helped to shape the coast at Fire Island, more distinctive signatures in morphology and coastal change are attributable to geologic controls and storm events. Future attempts to control or manage the system, particularly with climate-driven increasing storm intensities, may be expected to offer {{little in the way of}} protection to island residents or resources.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of Como Beach in the Swan River Estuary, Western Australia, is described. Como Beach is in a microtidal {{estuarine environment}} in which modal wave conditions are extremely low and nontidal fluctuations in water level are principally determined by storm surges and low-frequency changes in ocean water levels. Detailed descriptions of sandy beaches in very sheltered locations, such as Como, are uncommon in the literature, although these beaches are a common feature of coastal environments. In contrast to beaches in wave-dominated environments, those in very sheltered, low-energy locations may support subtidal terraces and beach profiles that differ in form and scale from the bars and intertidal flats in wave- and tide-dominated environments. At Como, beach profiles are superimposed on a subtidal terrace rising steeply from waters several metres deep to − 1. 5 m (Australian Height Datum; AHD), then with a low gradient to approximately − 0. 3 m (AHD) at the <b>shore.</b> The <b>profiles</b> range from planar forms on which very small waves (Hb less than 0. 1 m) are dissipated to curvilinear forms that reflect higher waves (Hb > 0. 2 m) from the beachface. A transitional form with a segmented profile comprising a steep beachface and flat inshore occurs, particularly where littoral drift is apparent...|$|R
40|$|Submarine {{permafrost}} {{is usually}} {{created by the}} inundation of terrestrial permafrost by seawater. The inundation of permafrost follows coastal erosion or relative sea level rise. Low modern sea level rise rates in Siberia mean that coastal erosion is the main mechanism of formation of submarine permafrost. Coastal sections composed of fine-grained sediments that have high ground-ice contents, such as the long Yedoma coastline of eastern Siberia, are especially vulnerable to mechanical and thermal erosion processes [Romanovskii et al., 2004]. When such frozen soft sediments thaw and/or erode, then {{the state of the}} permafrost is determined by the transition from sub-aerial to submarine conditions, and the processes that accompany this transition. These include removal of the upper horizons of material, sediment dynamics along the beach and <b>shore</b> face <b>profile,</b> saltwater diffusion, changing thermal regime and sea ice dynamics. For example, driven by the influence of warm and salty seawater, permafrost begins to thaw once inundated due to thermal and chemical degradation. As a result, submarine permafrost degradation may be rapid near the coast, and shows a spatially variable dependence on this set of processes [Overduin et al., 2007]. Our objectives are to investigate changes in coastal geomorphology in combination with geophysical investigations of submarine permafrost distribution in the near-shore zone (< 10 m water depth), in order to infer which processes dominate permafrost degradation in this highly dynamic coastal setting...|$|R
40|$|The paper analyses, compares and {{contrasts}} cross-shore morphodynamic behaviour of four diverse beaches {{that have}} very different regional settings, wave climates and sediment characteristics, {{with the aid of}} rarely available long term measurements of beach profiles and incident waves. The beaches investigated are Narrabeen Beach, New South Wales, Australia; Milford-on-Sea Beach, Christchurch Bay, UK; Hasaki Coast, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan; and Joetsu-Ogata Coast, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. A statistical analysis, equilibrium beach profile analysis and Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis are used to investigate, compare and contrast spatial and temporal variability of cross <b>shore</b> beach <b>profiles</b> of the selected beaches at short-, medium- and long-term timescales. All beaches show evidence of multi-timescale morphodynamic change. Narrabeen Beach profile has the highest sensitivity to local weather patterns. Milford-on-Sea, Joetsu-Ogata and Hasaki profiles are sensitive to seasonal variation of the wave climate however, they also show some correlations with regional climate variabilities. The nature of sediment exchange across the profile, which contributes to profile shape change with time, is found to be related to sediment characteristics across the profile. At Milford-on-Sea and Joetsu-Ogata, both of which have composite profiles, sediment exchange between the upper beach and the inter-tidal zone dominates profile change, irrespective of the distinct differences in sediment composition found in the two beaches. On the other hand in Narrabeen and Hasaki where beach sediment comprises medium to find sand, sediment exchange and hence profile change occur mainly in intertidal and subtidal zones...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{coastal area}} under {{investigation}} stretching from Al Hu-raydah {{in the northwest}} to Itwad in the southwest. It lies about 6 oo km south of Jeddah on the southern Red Sea coast. It extends inland more than 40 km and is bordered by the shield escarpment. The geomorpho-logic features, shoreline configuration, sediment characteristics and dynamics has been established for understanding the processes that in-fluence the coastal environments. The shoreline of the studied area is not linear and smooth, instead it is complexed by arcuate beaches, sharms, inlets, lagoons, barriers and rocky hills. The width of the coastal plain varies widely, it is wide and featureless towards south of Ash Shuqayq while being narrow and bounded by resistant sea cliffs towards the north. Ash Shuqayq coastal landforms include; marsh system, inlet and swamps, wave swash, dunes, shoreline processes, beach bars, spit sys-tem, wadi systems and sabkha systems. Conditions on such beaches change rapidly. In conclusion, the coastal area of Ash Shuqayq {{can be divided into}} two principal geomorphic zones: (i) The northern zone stretching from Al Huraydah is characterized by rocky highlands, very rugged with high sea cliffs and small pocket beaches that disrupt wave in-duced longshore sand transport. (ii) The middle and southern zone stretching from Ash Shuqayq to Itwad southward, is generally broad low relief depositional coastal plain. The <b>shore</b> zone <b>profile</b> is feature-less-wide beaches backed by extensive and longitudinal foredunes fixed by coastal vegetation. Sediment cover is thick with numerous wadis drained in the area and contributed {{the vast majority of the}} total input of sediments to the coastal zone...|$|R
40|$|Monthly cross <b>shore</b> beach <b>profiles</b> {{measured}} at the Ogata Wave Observation pier located in Joetsu-Ogata Coast, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, was analysed to investigate multi-scale morphodynamic beach behaviour. The Ogata beach, facing the Sea of Japan, is subjected to high energy wave conditions with that has a strong winter/summer seasonal signature. The measured beach profiles at the beach show very significant variability where cross-shore movement of shoreline position and lowering of the beach {{at the location of}} measurements exceed 20 m and 4 m respectively. The shoreline position seems to follow the seasonal variability of incident wave climate where a correlation coefficient of 0. 77 was found between monthly averaged incident significant wave height and the measured monthly shoreline position. During the summer months, the beach variability mostly concentrated to in the sub-tidal part of the profile, while a significant amount of upper beach change was observed during the winter months. The beach profile shape was found to rotate between three different beach states in time; (i) concave reflective profile; (ii) profile with sub-tidal berm; and (iii) gentle, dissipative profile. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the profiles show that the variability of beach profile shape is dominated by (a) upper shoreface steepening; (b) sub tidal berm development and dissipation; and (c) variability of the overall profile slope, which have some longer than seasonal cyclic signatures. Comparison of temporal EOFs with climate indices such as Southern Oscillation Index and Pacific Decadal Oscillation index shows notable some correlations between profile change and climatic variability in the region. The analysis also shows that the morphological variability of Joetsu-Ogata Coast has similarities and some distinct spatial and temporal differences to beaches of similar kind found elsewhere...|$|R

Advances in modern processors, memories, and networks mean that today’s computers are vastly {{different from those of}} 30 years ago, such that many OLTP databases will now fit in main memory, and most OLTP transactions can be processed in milliseconds or less. Yet database architecture has changed little. Based on this observation, we look at some interesting variants of conventional database systems that one might build that exploit recent hardware trends, and speculate on their performance through a detailed instruction-level breakdown of the major components involved in a transaction processing database system (Shore) running a subset of TPC-C. Rather than simply <b>profiling</b> <b>Shore,</b> we progressively modified it so that after every feature removal or optimization, we had a (faster) working system that fully ran our workload. Overall, we identify overheads and optimizations that explain a total difference of about a factor of 20 x in raw performance. We also show that there is no single “high pole in the tent ” in modern (memory resident) database systems, but that substantial time is spent in logging, latching, locking, B-tree, and buffer management operations.

40|$|Using an {{original}} rock profiling technique especially adapted to locally common smooth and irregular / deeply weathered (karstic) rocky <b>shores,</b> 38 base-line <b>profiles</b> were established at 19 rocky-shore sites to investigate surface-denudation characteristics exhibited by natural rock surfaces {{found on the}} Maltese coast. The latter were identified as being representative of actual or potential bathing platforms, thus offering a valuable alternative to otherwise scarce beach environments on the tourist rich Islands of Malta. Observations on shore surface denudation over a 3 – 5 year period were subsequently related to degree of exposure, erosion and weathering processes considered active at each site. Identification of distinct surface-denudation characteristics for sub-divisions within the Globigerina Limestone and similar surface-lowering rates for Lower Coralline Limestone and the Lower Globigerina Limestone sub-division were considered to qualify otherwise subjective interpretation of local bedrock resistance to marine erosion and weathering. The design of an innovative 'Rock Profiler', was identified as an improvement to traditional profiling techniques, allowing surface elevation measurements over both smooth and indented rock surfaces, achievements of more representative rock surface profiling over extended sample areas (with a 95 consecutive point line-transect), accurate assessments of rock surface micro-relief and of carrying out profiling independent of rock surface plane. This study provided for the first time, accurate and distinct surface-denudation rates for the main geological formations exposed on the Maltese coast, these being 1. 38 mm/yr for Upper Coralline Limestone, 9. 16 mm/yr for Middle Globigerina Limestone, 0. 74 mm/yr for Lower Globigerina Limestone and 0. 77 mm/yr for Lower Coralline Limestone. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Madsen, John A. A {{method is}} {{developed}} for taking older analog seismic profiles {{and building a}} database of depths to significant reflection events that can be entered into GIS software to create models of subsurface features. Subsequent maps and three-dimensional (3 -D) images of the subsurface can then be visualized allowing for more accurate analysis and interpretation. This methodology is applied to paleochannel networks present in the subsurface beneath the lower portion of Delaware Bay and the bordering Mid-Atlantic inner continental shelf. The project uses older analog seismic profiles to model these paleochannels in ArcGI(TM) and as a 3 -D model in ArcScene(TM). To constrain optimal parameters {{to be used in}} the subsurface modeling, seafloor depths were determined from the seismic profiles, input into the Geostatistical Analyst routines, and then correlated to existing NOAA DEM bathymetry. Simple kriging for extended areas and Universal Kriging using anisotropy, for paleochannels channels gave the best statistical and visual results. The models of the paleochannels were then entered into ArcScen(TM) to create 3 -D views allowing the subsurface geology to be analyzed and interpreted. The modeling results provide better constraints on the geometry of the paleochannels and can be used to better understand the recent geologic evolution of the region in response to sea-level fluctuations. Located under the lower Delaware Bay are three buried drainage systems of the Delaware River the Northern, Central and Southern as suggested by Knebel and Circ?? (1988). On the inner continental shelf four major subsurface paleochannels of the Delaware River were identified in several seismic profiles collected by Belknap and Kraft (1985), and McGeary et al., 1991; Krantz et al., 1993; 1994). This study improves the understanding of the stratigraphy underlying Delaware Bay and the inner shelf and examines the correlation to the paleochannels within bay and determines the relative ages. The Central paleochannel is the youngest and continues on the shelf as the Blue paleochannel, heading southeast 50 km, where it turns to the east and extends toward Baltimore Canyon. The Southern paleochannel extends as the Orange and appears also to extends toward Baltimore Canyon, is the next oldest. The oldest paleochannel is the Northern which is suggested to connect to the Green on the inner shelf. During the analysis of the seismic profiles along the inner continental shelf, a deeper reflection (40 m to 60 m below sea level) was observed in many of the profiles. This reflection was modeled in the same manner with ArcGIS(TM) Geostatistical Analysis and correlated with onshore strata. Two models were produced: the first used the seismic data above to model a surface, and the second used onshore well data to model surfaces of two likely candidates. Then each of the onshore surface models is projected to connect with the offshore surface model. The best match was the Beaverdam Formation with the overlying Omar Formation. This was then confirmed by using near <b>shore</b> seismic <b>profiles</b> and associated core data. The Beaverdam Formation underlies much of the state of Delaware and Atlantic inner continental.

40|$|Discussions {{related to}} the adverse impacts {{associated}} with shore armor (i. e. seawalls and riprap) are a common topic within the coastal community. While many agree that the installation of these structures alters the shores geomorphic response, there is disagreement in the type and degree of response. Furthermore, studies that have delved into this topic have been conducted in numerous settings but have been confounded {{by a lack of}} data regarding shore morphologies prior to installation of these structures. At Yellowstone National Park, there is an opportunity to assess the impacts of shore armor quantitatively because the National Park Service requires detailed surveys in advance of all infrastructure improvement projects in an effort to determine the overall impacts of these projects on park environments relative to their benefits to park visitors and employees. The purpose of this study then was to contribute to this ongoing discussion of adverse impacts from shore armor by monitoring several non-engineered and engineered shore segments along the shore of Yellowstone Lake. For the purposes of this study, all shore segments that possessed shore armor (i. e. a seawall or riprap) were referred to as an engineered beach while any shore lacking a seawall or riprap was classified as a non-engineered shore segment. This study began with an effort to determine if there were geomorphic differences between several non-engineered and engineered shore segments located along the western and northern shore of Yellowstone Lake. This effort was accomplished by measuring cross-shore profiles, dry-beach widths and conducting a grain size analysis of the dry-beach sediments. Results from the initial survey conducted in July-August 2005 established that there were significant geomorphic differences between the non-engineered and engineered shore segments of Yellowstone Lake. Visual observations combined with surveyed cross-shore profiles, grain size analyses and dry-beach width measurements revealed that the non-engineered shore segments were indeed geomorphically different from the engineered segments. That is, the non-engineered shore segments displayed relatively wider beaches composed of sand to fine gravel with gently sloping profiles whereas the engineered shores were typified with angular L-shaped profiles with narrow dry-beach faces. In addition to the geomorphic differences, visual observations and analysis of the data revealed that the engineered shores were indeed adversely impacted by the shore armor through the processes of placement loss and profile deflation. A repeat survey was then conducted in the summers of 2006 and 2007 to determine the short-term variability of these non-engineered and engineered shore segments. Three years of data with a two-year interval indicated that there was a consistent difference in the geomorphology of the non-engineered and engineered shore segments. These differences were reflected in the cross-shore profile, the volume, and the dry beach width for all four study sites. In addition to these consistent differences, analysis of the data showed that the non-engineered <b>shore</b> cross-shore <b>profiles</b> fluctuated about a mean shape, whereas the volumetric calculations and dry-beach measurements showed that both the non-engineered and engineered shores experience annual variability in their shore morphologies. Insight into the short-term variability was an essential component for the third portion of the study, which was an investigation into the long-term response of the shore to the engineering efforts along the shore of Yellowstone Lake. The third and final phase of this research was a long-term study of the shore responses to shore armor at Yellowstone Lake. This aspect of the study was intriguing because very few long-term studies focused specifically on shore responses to shore engineering exist. The methodology of this study incorporated the use of Historical GIS techniques to extract quantifiable data from construction drawings in order to be compared with the contemporary data collected from 2005 to 2007. Results revealed that, while both the non-engineered and engineered shore segments experienced a decrease in volume, the volumetric decrease was more pronounced for the non-engineered shores. The engineered shores indicated a smaller amount of volumetric change, suggesting that passive erosional processes and placement loss has had a long-term impact on the engineered shores in that the engineered structures have fixed the shoreline at these segments while the non-engineered shores are still able to adjust to changing conditions. Upon completion of this dissertation research, it was concluded that the engineered shore segments of Yellowstone Lake exhibit morphological features similar to those associated with hard stabilization of marine and Great Lakes coastal settings and are suggestive of enhanced erosion and shore degradation at engineered shore sites when compared to adjacent non-engineered shore segments. Ongoing monitoring and repeat annual surveys of study sites enhance understanding of shore zone processes at Yellowstone Lake. Furthermore, results from this study may also aid in developing alternative strategies for protecting lakeside infrastructure {{while at the same time}} conserving lakeshore resources and preserving the quality of visitor experiences at Yellowstone Lake...|$|R
