40|$|Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt., Atriplex polycarpa (Torr.) Wats., and Atriplex lentiformis (Torr). Wats. {{have been}} {{considered}} candidate perennial shrubs for revegetation of abandoned farmlands in southern Arizona. Objectives of the 1992 - 1994 field studies were to investigate the establishment characteristics of populations of these species and to estimate water requirements for establishing transplants and/or seedlings under a line-source sprinkler irrigation system. During the summer on a sandy loam soil, seedling establishment occurred at total water amounts greater than 200 mm but was absent at amounts less than 150 mm The poor stand establishment was attributed to high soil temperatures at 1 to 3 -cm depth which were not optimum for seed germination. Transplant survival percentages were greater than 89 % except for accessions of A. canescens var. linearis (S. Wats.) Munz, which were affected by rabbit herbivory. Transplants were successfully established by planting into a wet soil profile followed by cumulative precipitation amounts of 60 to 70 -mm. Establishing Atriplex taxa during the summer using transplants was more promising than direct-seeding. On a silt loam soil during the 1993 winter, stand establishment was not increased under cumulative precipitation and irrigation amounts greater than 100 mm compared to 66 mm of precipitation. On a clay loam soil during the 1994 winter, <b>supplemental</b> <b>irrigations</b> increased the probability of seedling emergence and stand establishment was higher under total water amounts greater than 100 mm. Differences between years {{in response to the}} line-source irrigation gradient were attributed to the number of consecutive days when soil moisture at 1 to 3 -m depth was high for optimal seedling emergence. During the winter, plant heights were not affected by total water amounts between 182 to 248 -mm (1993) and between 119 to 150 -mm (1994), whereas heights were reduced at total water amounts less than 100 nun in 1993, and less than 90 mm for all species in 1994 except A. polycarpa.

25|$|In the 20th century, the {{expanding}} wine industries of California, Australia and Israel were greatly enhanced by advances in irrigation. With {{the development of}} more cost efficient and less labor-intensive ways of watering the vines, vast tracts of very sunny but dry lands were able to be converted into wine-growing regions. The ability to control the precise amount of water each vine received, allowed producers in these New World wine regions to develop styles of wines that could be fairly consistent each year regardless of normal vintage variation. This created a stark contrast to the Old World wine regions of Europe where vintage variation, including rainfall, had a pronounced effect on the potential wine style each year. Continuing research explored the way that controlled (or <b>supplemental)</b> <b>irrigation</b> could be used to increase potential wine quality by influencing how the grapevine responds to its environment and funnels resources into developing the sugars, acids and phenolic compounds that contribute to a wine's quality. This research lead to the development of ways to measure the amount of water retention in the soil, so that individual irrigation regimes could be plotted for each vineyard that maximized the benefits of water management.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture is most {{commonly}} found in Mediterranean, continental and maritime climates with each unique climate providing its own challenges in providing sufficient water at critical times during the growing season. In Mediterranean climates irrigation is usually needed during the very dry periods of the summer ripening stages where drought can be a persistent threat. The level of humidity in a particular macroclimate will dictate exactly how much irrigation is needed {{with high levels of}} evapotranspiration more commonly occurring in Mediterranean climates that have low levels of humidity such as part of Chile and the Cape Province of South Africa. In these low humidity regions, primary irrigation may be needed, but in many Mediterranean climates the irrigation is usually supplemental. The amount of precipitation that occurs during spring and summer months is also important. For example, Tuscany receives an average of 8inches (200mm) of rainfall during the months of April through June - the period that includes flowering and fruit set, when the water is most crucial. While fluctuations in rainfall do occur, the amount of natural precipitation, combined with water holding capacity of soil, is typically sufficient to result in healthy harvest. In contrast, Napa Valley only gets 2.4inches (60mm), on average, during the same period of time, often in an erratic pattern (some years seeing more, some years seeing only trace amounts of rain), and most appellations in Central and Southern California (both along the coast and inland) receive even less than that, necessitating <b>supplemental</b> <b>irrigation.</b>|$|E
40|$|When cotton is {{irrigated}} at long intervals, {{the root}} systems become less effective at absorbing water during heavy fruiting, {{even when the}} soil is moist. That ineffectiveness, if not counteracted by frequent watering can exaggerate water stress responses during fruiting and promote early cutout. Deltapine 90 cotton was grown at the Maricopa Agricultural Center in 1988 and watered either by daily drip irrigation or by level -basin flooding. In the flood-irrigated plots, various schedules for applying water during fruiting were compared with minimal differences in total water applied. The check treatment (9 postplant irrigations) yielded approximately 2 bales of lint per acre. Small <b>supplemental</b> <b>irrigations</b> on 13 July and 22 July, splitting the normal irrigation cycles, increased yield 45 % for only 6 % more applied water.

Predicting the impacts of climate change (CC) on food and fiber production systems {{in the future is}} essential for devising adaptations to sustain production and environmental quality. We used the CSM-CROPGRO-cotton v 4. 6 module within the RZWQM 2 model for predicting the possible impacts of CC on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) production systems in the lower Mississippi Delta (MS Delta) region of the USA. The CC scenarios were based on an ensemble of climate projections of multiple GCMs (Global Climate Models/General Circulation Models) for climate change under the CMIP 5 (Climate Model Inter-comparison and Improvement Program 5) program, that were bias-corrected and spatially downscaled (BCSD) at Stoneville location in the MS Delta for the years 2050 and 2080. Four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) drove these CC projections: 2. 6, 4. 5, 6. 0, and 8. 5 (these numbers refer to radiative forcing levels in the atmosphere of 2. 6, 4. 5, 6. 0, and 8. 5 W·m− 2), representing the increasing levels of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios for the future, as used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR 5). The cotton model within RZWQM 2, calibrated and validated for simulating cotton production at Stoneville, was used for simulating production under these CC scenarios. Under irrigated conditions, cotton yields increased significantly under the CC scenarios driven by the low to moderate emission levels of RCP 2. 6, 4. 5, and 6. 0 in years 2050 and 2080, but under the highest emission scenario of RCP 8. 5, the cotton yield increased in 2050 but declined significantly in year 2080. Under rainfed conditions, the yield declined in both 2050 and 2080 under all four RCP scenarios; however, the yield still increased when enough rainfall was received to meet the water requirements of the crop (in about 25 % of the cases). As an adaptation measure, planting cotton six weeks earlier than the normal (historical average) planting date, in general, was found to boost irrigated cotton yields and compensate for the lost yields in all the CC scenarios.

The average simulated water non-limiting pod yield of groundnut for the locations was 5440 kg ha) 1, whereas the water limiting yield was 2750 kg ha) 1 indicating a 49 % reduction in yield because of deficit soil moisture conditions. As against this, the actual pod yields of the locations averaged 1020 kg ha) 1, which was 4420 and 1730 kg ha) 1 less than the simulated water non-limiting and water limiting yields, respectively. Across locations, the simulated water non-limiting yields were less variable than water limited and actual yields, and strongly correlated with solar radiation during the crop season (R 2 = 0. 62, P £ 0. 01). Simulated water limiting yield showed a significant positive, but curvilinear relationship (R 2 = 0. 73, P £ 0. 01) with mean crop season rainfall across locations. The relationship between actual yield and the mean crop season rainfall across locations was not significant, whereas across seasons for some of the locations, the association was found to be significant. Total yield gap (water non-limiting minus actual yields) ranged from 3100 to 5570 kg ha) 1, and remained more or less unaffected by the quantity of rainfall received across locations. The gap between simulated water non-limiting and water limiting yields, which ranged from 710 to 5430 kg ha) 1, was large at locations with low crop season rainfall, and narrowed down at locations with increasing quantum of crop season rainfall. On the other hand, the gap between simulated water limiting yield and actual farmers yield ranged from 0 to 3150 kg ha) 1. It was narrow at locations with low crop season rainfall and increased considerably at locations with increasing amounts of rainfall indicating that type of interventions to abridge the yield gap will vary with the rainfall regimes. It is suggested that improved agronomic management (such as high yielding cultivars, balance crop nutrition and control of pest and diseases) in high rainfall regimes and rainfall conservation and <b>supplemental</b> <b>irrigations</b> in low rainfall regimes will be essential components of the improved technologies aimed at abridging the yield gaps of groundnut...|$|R
