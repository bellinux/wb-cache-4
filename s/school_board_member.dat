40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} perceptions of <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and superintendents in the State of Iowa, assignment of leadership responsibilities in specific areas, and responsibility congruence and suitability. Demographic characteristics of gender, size of communities, size of school district, levels of education, occupation, and years of experience were also analyzed to identify relationships and determine what effects these characteristics had on perceptions of school leadership;After examining the literature it was evident that there are no universally accepted definitions of responsibilities for <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> or superintendents. It was determined that this investigation was needed in order to determine the inconsistencies of the two groups of school system leaders and to provide guidance for improved performance in public schools;Methodology used involved an assessment instrument, which was distributed to 364 <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> and 192 superintendents in the State of Iowa during the 1999 [...] 2000 school year.

A sample population of <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> who were serving at a school that had an opening for a superintendent during the 2007 – 2008 school year was used. A survey with 24 questions was e-mailed to <b>school</b> <b>board</b> <b>members.</b> Results from this group indicated that there were no major differences between large school corporations and small school corporations when it came to personal characteristics and professional skills for a superintendent.
