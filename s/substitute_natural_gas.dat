500|$|Daniels {{announced}} in October 2006 that a <b>substitute</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> company intended {{to build a}} facility in southern Indiana that would produce pipeline quality <b>substitute</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (SNG). [...] The lead investor was Leucadia National, which proposed a $2.6 billion plant in Rockport, Indiana. [...] Under {{the terms of the}} deal endorsed by Daniels, the state would buy almost all the Rockport gas and resell it on the open market throughout the country. If the plant made money from the sale, excess profits would be split between Leucadia National's Indiana subsidiary, Indiana Gassification, and the state. If it lost money from the sale, then 100% of the losses would be passed onto Indiana consumers. [...] Leucadia agreed to reimburse the state for any losses, up to $150 million over 30 years. [...] Gas from the plant would make up about 17 percent of the state's supply. Critics feared that if gas prices fell over the next 30 years, the costs of the lost profits would be passed onto the bills of residents once the $150 million guarantee by Leucadia was used up. The deal also received criticism due to government intrusion in the energy markets. Questions were also raised due to Leucadia National hiring Mark Lubbers to promote the deal. Lubbers is a former aide and close friend of Daniels. [...] The Daniels administration maintained that the plant would create jobs in an economically depressed part of the state and offer environmental benefits through an in-state energy source.

The hydrogen is then combined with CO2 to create synthetic or <b>substitute</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> SNG and stored in the natural gas network. The natural gas is used to create electrical energy (and the heat used as well in CHP) on demand when there is not enough sun (photovoltaic, CSP...) or wind (turbines) or water (hydro, ocean current, waves,...).
