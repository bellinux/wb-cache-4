50|$|In the Second World War, an {{aircraft}} repair organisation at Bracebridge Heath, managed by A V Roe and Co Ltd, recovered 'battle damaged' Avro Lancaster bomber parts, which {{would otherwise have}} been <b>scrapped,</b> <b>returning</b> them to service and making a contribution to the bomber offensive against Nazi Germany. An MAP B.1 type aircraft hangar from this period survived in 2014.|$|R
50|$|While <b>scrapping</b> <b>returns</b> {{inventory}} to a {{state of}} raw materials, Partner-Optimized Inventory Management (PIM) returns inventory to the market as intermediate goods to be used in production of other goods or non-capital spare parts. An organization that uses the PIM model mitigates the immediate pinch point caused by inventory reduction by retaining as-needed mutual access to inventory through the marketplace for an indeterminate time rather than losing access immediately and irrevocably through scrapping or discarding the inventory as waste.|$|R

50|$|The {{ships of}} the class were {{considered}} obsolete as the war ended, and were decommissioned and scrapped within seven months of the surrender of Japan (with the exception of , which had been loaned to the Soviet Navy, and was <b>scrapped</b> when <b>returned</b> to US Navy control in 1949).|$|R
5000|$|By 1938, {{believing he}} could turn the Mutual Home concept into reality, Westbrook left the US {{government}} (where {{he could not find}} enough support for his ideas) to develop a privately financed, 1000-unit, [...] "Park living housing development" [...] in Duval County, Florida. The design, by David Williams and modernist architect Richard Neutra, echoed many of the innovative design elements of the planned community of Radburn, New Jersey including pedestrian focused designs with unit front doors facing away from streets and toward park areas and other units across a common yard. [...] However, financial support for this project was never fully found, and the development had to be <b>scrapped.</b> <b>Returning</b> to the government, Westbrook submitted the Mutual Home plan to the Government's Temporary National Economic Committee, where it was filed away until 1940.|$|R

Oh, yes! I'm fond of Keats. Don't you know him?" ...|$|R
50|$|Around {{the early}} 1960s {{there was a}} {{shortage}} of wagons for carrying superphosphate. Due {{to the lack of}} alternatives, even with over 24,000 wagons running at the time, 70 cattle wagons were lined with tarpaulins on the inside, and loaded by hand. They were reclassed as the MS wagons. By the 1970s they were either <b>scrapped</b> or <b>returned</b> to M wagon status.|$|R
50|$|Smith and Mekas fell out, with Smith accusing Mekas of {{stealing}} the original Flaming Creatures print {{on behalf of}} Anthology Film Archives. Smith was opposed to giving his works a fixed form, preferring to continue re-editing his films. The print was lost until 1978, when Jerry Tartaglia found it in a discarded pile of <b>scrap</b> and <b>returned</b> it to Smith.|$|R
50|$|During WWI, the United States bought, {{borrowed}} or commandeered {{vessels of}} various types, ranging from pleasure craft to ocean liners {{to transport the}} American Expeditionary Force to Europe. Many of these ships were <b>scrapped,</b> sold or <b>returned</b> to their owners after the war.|$|R

50|$|The others {{convince}} <b>Scraps</b> to <b>return</b> to the Emerald City, {{where she}} can be magically repaired. Scraps agrees, but she hides herself under a sheet as she walks through the city streets (like Ojo in The Patchwork Girl of Oz); she causes a panic when she is mistaken for a ghost. Yet Ozma has no trouble in restoring Scraps to normal (if that term applies) with her Magic Belt. Popla and Alexample are welcomed into the ever-growing circle of Ozma's followers.|$|R
50|$|EWS {{has been}} selling off the sub-class. Four were {{purchased}} by West Coast Railway Company for overhaul and main line charters; these are 37706, 37710, 37712 and 37717. 37717 has since been sold for <b>scrap</b> while 37712 <b>returned</b> to traffic before a serious internal fire.|$|R
50|$|The {{line through}} Meadowhall closed {{completely}} from Friday, 31 July 1987 having {{not seen any}} traffic since 3 April when Class 20 20150 worked from Tinsley yard to Roe Brothers <b>scrap</b> yard and <b>return.</b> The line, from Tinsley South Junction to Meadowhall, was lifted during the following year.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{following}} the Great Depression in 1936, the Tasmanian Government Railways found itself unable {{to manage the}} increased tonnages it was being made to handle. Many older locomotives which had been withdrawn and were due to be <b>scrapped</b> were <b>returned</b> to service but a shortage of locomotives remained. The Chief Mechanical Engineer, H. J. Bennett, wrote to the CME of the New Zealand Government Railways, P. R. Angus, requesting a book of engineering drawings of NZR locomotives, and also asking if the NZR had any locomotives it could sell to TGR, enquiring in particular to the WW class 4-6-4T tank locomotives.|$|R

5000|$|The {{title was}} a carry {{over from the}} Soviet era, where {{citizens}} of various professions were honored by the national and subnational governments for their long contributions to a specific field or to the nation. When {{it was part of}} the Soviet Union as Byelorussia SSR, had titles of their own to award their citizens. One those titles was [...] "Honored Educator of the Byelorussia SSR" [...] (Заслуженный учитель БССР). When Belarus left the Soviet Union in 1991, the awarding of the title was <b>scrapped.</b> The <b>return</b> of the title, with its present name, occurred with the passage of Resolution N 3726-XII, titled [...] "System of State Awards for the Republic of Belarus," [...] on April 13, 1995.|$|R

In August 2008, she appeared as a houseguest on the Indian version of Big Brother, Bigg Boss, but left on day 2 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Her show returned months later showing her progress until February 2009 when she was told her illness was terminal and that she had months to live. Goody died one month later on 22 March 2009, leaving behind her two children and newly married husband, Jack Tweed.|$|R

5000|$|During the {{development}} of what would become Godzilla vs. Destoroyah, it was proposed to have Godzilla face off with the original 1954 Godzilla, whose spirit would possess Godzilla Junior and force it to fight Godzilla, though this idea was <b>scrapped.</b> Hurricane Ryu <b>returned</b> as Godzilla Junior and portrayed it via traditional suitmation techniques, though because the Junior suit was almost {{the same size as}} the main Godzilla one, a small animatronic prop was used in scenes where Junior interacts with its [...] "father".|$|R
5000|$|In all, an {{estimated}} 300 to 400 trucks were transformed in this way. Senior officers saw the 5-ton gun truck {{as a temporary}} solution until enough V-100 armored cars arrived. However, by 1970 it became obvious to all - except the Military Police - that the V-100 was a death trap if the armor was penetrated. Furthermore, the V-100 had problems with its power train. So the gun trucks continued to serve until the last American truck company was inactivated in Vietnam in 1972. With {{the end of the}} Vietnam War, the need for such vehicles disappeared and most were either <b>scrapped</b> or <b>returned</b> to cargo carrying. One truck, an M54 named by its crew [...] "Eve of Destruction," [...] was brought back intact and is on display at the Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, Virginia.|$|R
50|$|The split was {{condemned}} by opposition party BNP, some citizens, and even {{by members of}} the incumbent government. Incumbent mayor Khoka (who lost his seat) of BNP promised that he would not contest the next city elections if the government would let the city not be split. He also promised that the split will be <b>scrapped</b> once BNP <b>returns</b> to power. Incumbent councillors as well as staff of the former City Corporation went on strike if the bill was passed. Protesting staff of the Corporation were met with an armed police force.|$|R
50|$|Initially, Wakeman {{wanted to}} perform the album on the Spanish island of Tenerife, as close to Mount Teide as possible, with the Orquesta Sinfónica de Tenerife, but the {{difficulties}} in performing around such an ecological area led to the idea being <b>scrapped.</b> Material from <b>Return</b> to the Centre of the Earth was performed live {{for the first time}} as part of Wakeman's 25-date Half a Century Tour, playing a selection of material across his career in churches and cathedrals across the United Kingdom from May 1999. A tour of the album, complete with a stage set designed by Dean, was shelved.|$|R
60|$|There {{might have}} been more pork on the knucklebone,--which knucklebone the carver at the cook's shop had assuredly not {{forgotten}} in carving for previous customers--but there was no stint of seasoning, and that is an accessory dreamily suggesting pork, and pleasantly cheating the sense of taste. The pease pudding, too, the gravy and mustard, like the Eastern rose in respect of the nightingale, if they were not absolutely pork, had lived near it; so, upon the whole, there was the flavour of a middle-sized pig. It was irresistible to the Tetterbys in bed, who, though professing to slumber peacefully, crawled out when unseen by their parents, and silently appealed to their brothers for any gastronomic token of fraternal affection. They, not hard of heart, presenting <b>scraps</b> in <b>return,</b> it resulted that a party of light skirmishers in nightgowns were careering about the parlour all through supper, which harassed Mr. Tetterby exceedingly, and once or twice imposed upon him the necessity of a charge, before which these guerilla troops retired in all directions and in great confusion.|$|R
5|$|During the 1980s, NSB started leasing SJ T44-locomotives from Sweden to {{supplement}} the Di 3. In 1992, {{the decision was made}} to order 12 Di 6 and 20 Di 8 to replace the Di 3. The former was based on the Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3. The Di 8 was slightly more powerful than the Di 3, and were intended for freight trains. Both series were put into service in 1996, but the Di 6 proved to have so many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998. The Di 3 units had been set aside and some had been <b>scrapped,</b> but the <b>return</b> of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1970 and 1972, Canada traded the 56 {{survivors}} of the original CF-101 fleet back to the USAF for 66 replacements under Operation Peace Wings. The [...] "new" [...] replacement aircraft were actually manufactured earlier than the original fleet, but the [...] "new" [...] airframes had a lower number of hours, plus the [...] "new" [...] Voodoos received updates which the original Canadian Voodoos had not received (including the addition of an IR tracking system). Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, Manitoba, performed modifications on the incoming fleet, which involved transferring some specifically Canadian items of equipment, including engines, from the “old” aircraft to the “new.” Many of the “old” Canadian Voodoos were <b>scrapped</b> when they <b>returned</b> to the U.S., but 22 were converted to RF-101B photo-reconnaissance versions and flew with the Nevada Air National Guard until 1975.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a network of foreign businessmen in Japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war, it was suggested by his commander, Colonel Burnett, that Mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in Tokyo himself, {{in order to put}} the M-Plan in effect. Consequently, Mashbir resigned in 1923 to pursue business interests and undercover secret intelligence operations, under the impression that he could be reinstated in the Army when his work was done. However the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923 bankrupted him and, when he sought reinstatement in the military, discovered that it was not possible, because the reinstatement clause of the law under which he had resigned was no longer valid. Neither Mashbir nor Colonel Burnett, who had urged Mashbir to resign, was aware of this, and it become a sticking point for Mashbir in later life, noting that even in 1926 the law was still being reprinted without the correct clause. Consequently, the M-Plan to establish an intelligence network in Japan was <b>scrapped.</b> Mashbir <b>returned</b> to the United States in 1926 under the impression that his military career was over, and sought employment selling refrigerators. He managed to rejoin the Military Intelligence Division G-2 Reserves, but only spent one year in active duty beginning in the summer of 1927 during which time he updated the Order of Battle documentation on Japan. For the next ten years he returned to his original profession of engineering, including some government work on technical standards.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2012, the Daily Mail {{published}} leaked {{plans to}} <b>scrap</b> GCSE examinations, <b>return</b> to O-level exams and allow less able {{students to take}} less academic qualifications. The Liberal Democrats claimed that the plans had not been discussed with the Deputy Prime Minister and were subsequently heavily criticised by some teachers, trade unions and Labour Party MPs; they had been discussed with the Prime Minister at Cabinet level, and a subsequent YouGov/Sunday Times poll suggested that the public supported this policy {{by a margin of}} 50% to 32%. They received praise from the Mayor Boris Johnson, who said that he [...] "could be... singing a hymn of praises for my old chum Gove and his brilliant new Gove-levels." [...] The leaked documents also suggested that Gove was intending to create a single exam board to organise all exams, and to scrap the National Curriculum in its current form. However, there were [...] "rebukes" [...] from both the Welsh and Northern Ireland Education ministers who said it was important to communicate before making announcements on proposed changes to jointly owned qualifications.|$|R
40|$|We study an {{optimization}} problem associated with product returns initiated as a manage-ment decision. Returns {{are made from}} multiple stores to a centralized return facility in a retail network and eventually transported to the original manufacturer for refunds. Such returns are called strategic returns and the manufacturer accepts only a single shipment from the retailer. Therefore, the centralized return facility {{has to make a}} decision on how long it has to wait before making a shipment to the original manufacturer to claim refunds. The objective is to minimize the total cost minus the revenue: the cost is due to inventory, transportation to the manufacturer, and <b>scrapping</b> items not <b>returned,</b> while the revenue is due to the refund from the manufacturer. We consider two operational strategies: sta-tic and dynamic. Under the static strategy a shipment is made to the manufacturer at a predetermined time regardless of the number of items returned, whereas under the dynamic strategy such decisions are made adaptively depending on the number of items actually re-turned. Numerical studies are performed to gain managerial insights as well as compare the performance of the static and the dynamic approaches...|$|R
5000|$|Yang also {{translated}} into Chinese three major European works of picaresque fiction: Lazarillo de Tormes (1951), Gil Blas (1956) and Don Quixote (1978). Her Chinese translation of Don Quixote is, as of 2016, still considered the definitive version. After deeming several English and French translations unsuitable, she taught herself Spanish. “If I {{wanted to be}} faithful to the original, I had to translate directly from the original,” she wrote in 2002. Ms. Yang had completed almost seven out of eight volumes of the translation when Red Guard student militants confiscated the manuscript from her home in Beijing. “I worked with every ounce of energy I could muster, gouging at the earth with a spade, but the only result was a solitary scratch on the surface,” Ms. Yang wrote. “The youngsters around me had quite a laugh over that.” As the Cultural Revolution subsided, Ms. Yang returned to Beijing to work on “Don Quixote.” The nearly completed draft that had been confiscated by Red Guards {{is said to have been}} discovered in a pile of <b>scrap</b> paper and <b>returned</b> to Ms. Yang. Published in 1978, it remains widely regarded as the definitive translation of “Don Quixote” in China.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, real {{options are}} used to {{identify}} the optimal model for the reverse logistics process of a technology company in the circuit board business. Currently, customers return defective boards and the company repairs the boards and sends them back. Now that the new product cost is falling {{below the level of}} the repair cost, the company is considering an alternative operational model, which is to <b>scrap</b> the <b>returned</b> boards and swap them with new products. As the product cost declines, it is also widely fluctuating, and it is this fluctuation that makes the switching option between the repair and swap model valuable. The repair and swap models (with and without switching options) will each produce different cost saving amounts with different degrees of risk. As a result of real options analysis, the swap model with the switching option to repair is determined to be optimal and has only modest risk. Specifically, the costs would be reduced by $ 1. 3 million (of which $ 0. 9 million is the option value) and by 18 % compared to the costs under the current model, and the volatility will only moderately increase from 8 % to 11 %. However, {{it should be noted that}} the model is sensitive to both volatility and switching cost. Unlike the traditional methodologies, such as optimization or discounted cash flow analysis, real options quantifies the option value as well as the risk and hence shows the maximum investment necessary to obtain the option. That being said, in this thesis, optimization (the news vendor approach), simulation (Monte Carlo simulation), and discounted cash flow analysis take complementary roles to real options analysis. The option value is significant when the key uncertainties (e. g., the product cost, repair cost, and volume) are volatile(cont.) because the option allows businesses to capture upside opportunities while protecting them from downside risks. by Akihiro Kaga.
