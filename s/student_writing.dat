25|$|While {{most studies}} of {{dialogue}} journals {{focus on the}} development of <b>student</b> <b>writing,</b> several researchers have explored their use and value for developing and assessing students' reading competence, especially students acquiring English as a second language. Some teachers use dialogue journals as an opportunity for students and a teacher to discuss books that students are reading. In dialogue journal interactions, {{regardless of whether or not}} the topic is about reading assignments, reading and writing are integrated as communicative activities.|$|E
25|$|A {{dialogue}} journal {{allows students}} and a teacher to together use authentic communication (including questioning, complaining, complimenting, apologizing, and requesting) to communicate honestly and openly and “get things done”. This distinguishes it from most <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> assignments, which are restricted to monologic description, explanation, or narrative. This aspect of everyday language use is known in philosophy as speech acts (John Searle) and in linguistics as pragmatics. (J.L. Austin) Dialogue journal conversation, unlike academic writing, opens up opportunities to use almost {{the full range of}} these natural functions of language.|$|E

This is a class action research in which 20 elementary students of grade III as subject. Data were obtained through observation, interview, and test of writing skill. There is improvement in each cycle. In cycle I, average score of <b>student’s</b> <b>writing</b> skill is 68 or 55 %. Meanwhile in cycle II, average score of <b>student’s</b> <b>writing</b> skill is 77, 5 or 80 %.

25|$|Radical expressivism {{evolved from}} the {{pedagogical}} ideals of moderate expressivism, and its primary difference lies in its focus on group, rather than individual, development and expression. For example, In 1966, Susan Sontag published {{a collection of essays}} in which she stresses the importance of Happenings, “a cross between art exhibit and theatrical performance,” in order to facilitate a sense of group identity, community, and engagement with audience through a shared, unique artistic experience. Radical expressivists Charles Deemer and William Lutz also suggest that English composition should be taught as and considered a sort of Happening. Deemer locates the problem with the composition course in its lack of subject content and asserts that writing demands inspiration that can be attained from teacher-induced Happenings, as “clear writing and clear thought follow only after clear experiences.” Lutz’ claims {{are similar to those of}} Deemer, noting the need for creative inspiration in the classroom, a typically stagnant environment in which he claims nothing creative can be taught; he argues for the employment of Happenings in the English classroom in order to “make the student respond directly to his own experience and not someone else’s.” Other such pedagogues include Marshall McLuhan, who presents the idea of using hot, engaging media when teaching rather than cold, sterile media in the classroom, and Geoffrey Sirc, who promotes an avant-garde approach to composition pedagogy by encouraging students’ exuberant, unpolished expressions in writing. Sirc can almost be considered a “post-social turn” theorist; his 1980s research claims that the traditional classroom space is confining and argues that the language of “Main Street” should be encouraged in <b>student</b> <b>writing,</b> attacking the idea of suitable “academic” writing presented by theorists like David Bartholomae. Furthermore, in his own English classroom, Sirc employs the study of rap music and its cultural and racial implications; he views rap music as “loaded with language, desire, style, and humanity” and imbued with poetry he describes as “blunt narratives of the human heart,” teaching students about truth, communication, and reality and effectively strengthening their writing. Thus, while retaining many of the ideals of individuality and uninhibited expression associated with Moderate Expressivism, the composition pedagogy of radical expressivism is distinguished by its focus on group reality and community experience, belief in the art and inspirational potential of the Happening, and view that popular media can potentially be used as a pedagogical tool.|$|E

[...] Jeff Smith argues that students want to gain, rather than to critique, positions of privilege, as encouraged by critical pedagogues.

50|$|Indirect writing {{assessments}} typically {{consist of}} multiple choice tests on grammar, usage, and vocabulary. Examples include high-stakes standardized tests {{such as the}} ACT, SAT, and GRE, which are most often used by colleges and universities for admissions purposes. Other indirect assessments, such as Compass and Accuplacer, are used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses. Direct writing assessments, like the timed essay test, require at least one sample of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> andare viewed by many writing assessment scholars as more valid than indirect tests because they are assessing actual samples of writing. Portfolio assessment, which generally consists of several pieces of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> written {{over the course of}} a semester, began to replace timed essays during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Portfolio assessment is viewed as being even more valid than timed essay tests because it focuses on multiple samples of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> that have been composed in the authentic context of the classroom. Portfolios enable assessors to examine multiple samples of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> and multiple drafts of a single essay.|$|E
