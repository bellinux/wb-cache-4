5000|$|A fixed {{platform}} {{is a type}} of offshore platform used for the production of oil or gas. These platforms are built on concrete and/or steel legs anchored directly onto the seabed, supporting a deck with space for drilling rigs, production facilities and crew quarters. Such platforms are, by virtue of their immobility, designed for very long-term use. Various types of structure are used, steel jacket, concrete caisson, floating steel and even floating concrete. Steel jackets are vertical sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed.

50|$|Initially, the LZ 130 {{design was}} {{intended}} to be largely identical to the Hindenburg, with a few minor improvements. The tail fins were 60 cm shorter and the number of intermediate ribs was reduced to save weight and reduce stress on the trailing edge of the fin. The lower fin had an upward curve similar to the Hindenburgs final design (after the fin was damaged during a propaganda flight), giving more clearance with the ground. To further reduce weight, the girder shape and riveting were changed slightly. The four engine car gondolas were designed and installed to have same pusher configuration as the Hindenburg. After the Hindenburg disaster, however, the engine pods were completely redesigned and reinstalled, using diesel engines powering tractor propellers. These new pods were larger and better insulated than those used on the Hindenburg and engine noise was noticeably quieter. In later flights, the airship used variable-pitch three-bladed propellers on both of its rear engines; trials were run on the forward port engine car as the ship neared completion, but only the aft-port engine car had a three-bladed propeller on its first flight. Unlike the wooden propellers of the Hindenburg, which had problems with moisture absorption causing imbalance, these three-bladed propellers were made of plastic wood and individual blades were assembled onto a main hub. The engines had a water recovery system which captured the exhaust of the engines, recovering water vapor present in the exhaust gases and condensing it for <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> aboard the airship, to compensate for the fuels weight lost during flight such that helium would not need to be valved.|$|E

40|$|Void {{fraction}} is {{an important}} process variable for the volume and mass computation required for transportation of gas–liquid mixture in pipelines, <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>tanks,</b> metering and custody transfer. Inaccurate measurement would introduce errors in product measurement with potentials for loss of revenue. Accurate measurement is often constrained by invasive and expensive online measurement techniques. This work focuses {{on the use of}} cost effective and non-invasive pressure sensors to calculate the gas void fraction of gas–liquid flow. The differential pressure readings from the vertical upward bubbly and slug air–water flow are substituted into classical mathematical models based on energy conservation to derive the void fraction. Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) and Wire-mesh Sensor (WMS) are used as benchmark to validate the void fraction obtained from the differential pressure. Consequently the model is able to produce reasonable agreement with ERT and WMS on the void fraction measurement. The effect of the friction loss on the mathematical models is also investigated and discussed. It is concluded the friction loss cannot be neglected, particularly when gas void fraction is less than 0. 2...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in {{the perspective of a}} hydrogen economy is the development of a storage system both safe and with high weight capacity. Among the most promising systems are the storage in metals and chemical hydrides and the high pressure <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> made of composite materials. Both these technologies allow volumetric densities equal or higher than that of liquid hydrogen. The present work deals with the results obtained in a Italian national project, whose objectives have been the development of innovative technologies in specific applications: large scale energy storage, stationary applications in distributed generation, and automotive (with a particular attention to the fluvial and the sea transportation in protected areas). The theoretical, modellistic and experimental activities have been oriented to the development of innovative high capacity metal hydrides, the study of a regeneration method for chemical hydrides, the integration of intermediate pressure electrolyzers with advanced compressors and, finally, the development of thermomechanical models for executive design of storage systems.

This problem {{is found in}} beverage production, foundry, glass industry, and electrofused grains, where the production processes have usually two interdependent levels with sequence-dependent setups in each level.

A synchronization problem occurs because the production in lines and the <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> have to be compatible with each other throughout the time horizon. The SITLSP and its mathematical model are described in detail by this paper. The lack of similar models in the literature has led us to also propose a set of instances for the SITLSP, based on data provided by a soft drink company. Thus, a set of benchmark results for these problem instances are established using an exact method available in an optimization package. Moreover, results for two relaxations proved that the modeling methodology could be useful in real-world applications...|$|E

Managing the tank wastes and site cleanup activities requires understanding of the chemistry of organics in aqueous basic solutions that contain high nitrate and nitrite concentrations under the field of g and b irradiation.

In this research, three options for LNG evaporation have been investigated: using the waste heat from a power plant, integrating the LNG terminal with an air separation unit and an oxy-fuel power plant, and combining the evaporation process with an Organic Rankine Cycle to produce electricity. The research consisted of an environmental life cycle assessment, calculation the life cycle costs, conducting a social life cycle assessment and determining the cumulative exergy extracted from the natural environment (CEENE). The option in which the LNG terminal is integrated with an air separation unit and an oxy-fuel coal power plant appeared to be preferable.

As a result, the waste contained in the ORNL storage tanks has similarities to waste found at other sites, but is typically 10 to 100 times less radioactive. It is estimated that nearly 4. 9 million liters of legacy of waste is stored {{on the site of}} ORNL. Of this volume about one-fifth is transuranic sludges. The remainder of the waste volume is classified as low-level waste. The waste contains approximately 130, 000 Ci, composed primarily of {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr, and small amounts of other fission products. The wastes were originally acidic in nature but were neutralized using Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }, NaOH, or CaO to allow their <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> constructed of carbon steel or concrete (Gunite).

The first phase of the overall remediation effort is a demonstration of treatment concepts, and the second phase includes treatment of the remaining tank wastes. The demonstration phase, Phase 1 of the project, is further subdivided into two parts, A and B. During Phase 1 A, the vitrification contractors are to establish the technical, operational, regulatory, business, and financial elements required to provide treatment services on a fixed unit price basis. Phase 1 A deliverables will be evaluated by RL to determine whether it {{is in the best interest}} of the government to have one or more vitrification contractors proceed with Phase 1 B, in which 6 % to 13 % of the tank waste would be treated in the demonstration.

Prior theraml evaluations in support of Project W- 320 safety analysis assumed the availability of 2000 to 3000 CFM, as provided by Tank Farm Operations, for tank floor cooling channels from the secondary ventilation system. As this flow availability has no technical basis, a detailed Tank 241 -AY- 102 secondary ventilation and floor coating channel flow model was developed and analysis was performed. The results of the analysis show that only about 150 cfm flow is in floor cooLing channels. Tank 241 -AY- 102 thermal evaluation was performed to determine the necessary cooling flow for floor cooling channels using W- 030 primary ventilation system for different quantities of Tank 241 -C- 106 sludge transfer into Tank 241 -AY- 102. These sludge transfers meet different options for the project along with minimum required modification of the ventilation system. Also the results of analysis {{for the amount of}} sludge transfer using the current system is presented. The effect of sludge fluffing factor, heat generation rate and its distribution between supernatant and sludge in Tank 241 -AY- 102 on the amount of sludge transfer from Tank 241 -C- 106 were evaluated and the results are discussed. Also transient thermal analysis was performed to estimate the time to reach the steady state. For a 2 feet sludge transfer, about 3 months time will be requirad to reach steady state.

40|$|Natural and {{synthetic}} zeolites are extremely versatile materials. They can adsorb {{a variety of}} liquids and gases, and take part in cation exchange reactions. Zeolites are relatively easy to synthesize {{from a wide range}} of natural and man-made materials. One such combination is a mixture of metakaolinite and concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. Once mixed and cured at elevated temperatures, these ingredients react to form a hard, dense, ceramic-like material that contains significant amounts of crystalline tectosilicates (zeolites and feldspathoids) imbedded in an X-ray amorphous sodium aluminosilicate hydrate matrix. This rather unique composite material has been termed a ''hydroceramic. '' The crystalline phases in the hydroceramic have the ability to sequester alkali, alkaline earth and a variety of higher valance cations in lattice positions or within networks of channels and voids. The matrix plays host to the crystallites and to residual amounts of insoluble hydroxide phases. Due to its gel-like character, the matrix also provides considerable strength. A previous publication has established the fact that a mixture of a calcined equivalent ICPP waste (sodium aluminate/hydroxide solution containing {approx} 3 : 1 Na:Al) and fly ash and/or metakaolinite could be cured at various temperatures to produce a monolith containing Zeolite A (80 C) or Na-P 1 plus hydroxy sodalite (130 C) dispersed in the alkali aluminosilicate hydrate matrix. Dissolution tests (PCT type) have shown these materials have superior retention of alkali, alkaline earth and heavy metal ions. The zeolitization process is a simple one. Metakaolinite is mixed with a calcined sodium-bearing waste and enough water to make a thick paste. The paste is transferred to a metal canister and ''soaked'' for a few hours at 90 C prior to conventional oven heating or steam autoclaving at - 200 C for varying periods of time.

40|$|The rising energy {{consumption}} worldwide {{is leading to}} significant increases in energy production with fossil fuels being the major energy source. The negative environmental impact of fossil fuel use and its finite nature {{requires the use of}} alternative sources of energy. Solar energy is a clean alternative energy source; however, its intermittent nature is a major impediment that needs to be reduced or eliminated by the development of cost effective energy storage. Thermal <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> filled typically with molten salt at elevated temperatures is widely used in concentrating solar power plants to generate electricity during periods of low daytime solar radiation or night time. Similarly, electrical storage in batteries, etc. is used in conjunction with photovoltaic solar power plants. Electrochemical supercapacitors can be effectively used for electrical storage, either alone or in a hybrid configuration with batteries, for large scale energy storage as well as in electric vehicles and portable electronics. Unlike batteries’, supercapacitor electrodes can be made of materials that are either less toxic or biodegradable and can provide almost instantaneous power due to their unique charge storage mechanism similar to conventional capacitors found in most electronics. Unfortunately, the same storage mechanism prevents supercapacitors from having high energy density. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate organic and inorganic electrode materials that can increase the specific capacitance and energy density of supercapacitors. Additionally, certain types of supercapacitor electrode materials store the charges at the electrode/electrolyte interface preventing any deformation of the material and thus increasing its cycle life by two to three orders of magnitude. Transition metal oxides, layered transition metal chalcogenides, and their composites with graphene and conducting polymers have been synthesized, characterized, and their electrochemical performances evaluated for suitability as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Morphology and crystalline structure characterization methods used, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), were used throughout this work. Electrochemical characterization involved cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant current charge and discharge (CCCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in two and three electrode configuration using aqueous and organic electrolytes. Ruthenium oxide-graphene (RuO 2 -G) electrodes were tested in the two-electrode cell configuration and exhibit an areal capacitance of 187. 5 mF cm- 2 in 2 M H 2 SO 4 at a RuO 2 :G ratio of 10 : 1. Due to RuO 2 high toxicity, scarcity, and high cost, manganese oxide-graphene (MnO-G) was used as an alternative but its low specific capacitance remains a major stumbling block. The electrodes’ mass loading was studied in detail to understand the effects of thickness on the measured specific capacitance. Layered transition metal chalcogenides are structurally similar to graphene but possess different characteristics. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS 2) is a two-dimensional material that has lower conductivity than graphene but larger sheet spacing making it easy for other materials to intercalate and form composites such as molybdenum sulfide-polyaniline (MoS 2 -PANI). MoS 2 -PANI electrodes, with different thicknesses, were measure in a three-electrode cell configuration resulting in gravimetric capacitance of 203 F g- 1 for the thinnest electrode and areal capacitance of 358 mF cm- 2 for the thickest electrode; all measurements performed using 1 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte. Attempts were also made to reduce the supercapacitor self-discharge by depositing on the electrode a blocking thin layer of barium strontium titanate (BST). The results were rather inconclusive because of the large thickness of the deposited BST layer. However, they strongly suggest that a very thin BST layer could improve the overall capacitance because of the very large dielectric constant of the BST material.

40|$|<b>Storage</b> of {{rainwater}} <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> {{has been}} recognized to be useful for sustainable supply of water. Especially, heavy rains are frequently caused by typhoons in Japan. Although rainwater is clean when it is newly formed, little information has been obtained {{about the quality of}} rainwater during its <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> water <b>tanks.</b> Investigation of microorganisms <b>in</b> the <b>tank</b> is important <b>in</b> using the water for toilet flush, shower, drinking water, and so on if possible. In the current study, as the first trial, we collected six samples stored in two connected rainwater <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> Higashi-ago Elementary School, Fukui, Japan, and then investigated microorganisms in each sample. We could finally identify six kinds of microorganisms based on their rDNA sequences. We also measured total numbers of bacteria in each fraction...|$|R
