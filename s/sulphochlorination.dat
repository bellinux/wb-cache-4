40|$|Gas chromatographic {{analyses}} of several sulphonyl chlorides were performed without derivatization. Optimized conditions {{for this analysis}} were selected and the results controlled by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results obtained were compared with data reported for gas chromatography using derivatization. This method was extended to the simultaneous analysis of isomeric mixtures of n-heptyl chlorides and n-heptanesulphonyl chlorides obtained by the photochemical <b>sulphochlorination</b> of n-heptane...|$|E
