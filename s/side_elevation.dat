25|$|Tappen House, 106–122 Green Street. Built ca. 1670, this {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be the oldest extant house in Kingston. Like the Roggon House, it was modified in the 19th century. It has a distinctive saltbox-style <b>side</b> <b>elevation.</b>|$|E
500|$|On each <b>side</b> <b>elevation</b> {{there are}} central canted bay windows. [...] The middle floor has arched {{windows on the}} west front, while the {{corresponding}} windows on the east front are blind. [...] On {{each side of the}} house are two-storey pavilion wings joined to the main block by quadrant (curved), single-storey corridors. [...] Each pavilion is symmetrical and identical, built in brick with stone dressings. [...] Each is in three bays, the central bay forming a canted bay window. Again, the windows are sashes.|$|E

2500|$|These three houses rise {{to three}} storeys {{and form a}} {{slightly}} outward-curving nine-bay composition whose outermost bays (containing the entrances for numbers 1 and 3) are recessed. [...] The curved effect is much less pronounced than in {{the centre of the}} crescent. [...] At first-floor level, a cast iron balcony supported on brackets spans the other seven bays. [...] The houses are topped by a parapet which is supported on a [...] cornice and which continues round the <b>side</b> <b>elevation</b> of number 1, which faces Clifton Hill. [...] Each house has a three-window range; those at first-floor level have architraves of various styles (flat cornices, curved pediments and triangular pediments), while at the top floor original sash windows survive. [...] The doors, which are four-panelled and have decorative fanlights, are set in porches flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature. [...] The ground-floor walls are heavily rusticated. [...] The roof has chimneys at the sides and is hidden behind the continuous parapet.|$|E
2500|$|The nacelle was, most unusually for the time, an {{all-metal}} structure – being {{framed in}} steel tube {{and covered with}} duralumin. The prototypes were fitted with large streamlined spinners on the propellers, although these were removed, and the production F.E.8s were built without them. The wings had a narrow chord, giving them a high aspect ratio. They featured dihedral outboard of the wide centre section, and the ailerons were of unusually long span - occupying the entire wing trailing edge outboard of the tail booms. The booms themselves were attached to the main spar of the tailplane, rather than the rudder post, giving them taper in <b>side</b> <b>elevation</b> rather than in plan, as more usual in a [...] "Farman" [...] style pusher. This allowed the fitting of a variable incidence tailplane, although this was not adjustable in flight, but only on the ground. A single 100hp (75kW) Gnome 9 [...] "Type B2" [...] Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four-bladed propeller powered the aircraft, with the capability of taking the lower-powered Le Rhône 9C 80hp, nine-cylinder rotary.|$|E
2500|$|The five-story Renaissance style {{limestone}} {{town house}} {{was designed by}} Carrère and Hastings, who were also responsible {{for the design of}} the New York Public Library, and is regarded as one of their finest residences. The design of the limestone-clad building, which unusually for a Manhattan town house offers a finished <b>side</b> <b>elevation</b> as well as its street front, is strongly influenced by 16th- and 18th-century Italian palazzo details. The ground floor has pronounced banded rustication, a motif which is taken through the three floors above in the pilaster-like [...] quoining at each corner of the building. The first floor piano nobile is evident by its large casement windows proportionately taller than those below or above. On the principal facade these aedicular windows have segmental pediments supported on the flanking Ionic columns; they are given extra prominence by the small wrought iron balconies supported by limestone corbels. The windows of the second floor clearly denote it as containing secondary accommodation, while the windows of the third and top floor are smaller still, clearly indicating a lower status than those below. The upper floor contains masonry panels and is intended to complement the enriched entablature, frieze and boldly projecting cornice immediately above it. [...] Interior photos from the early 20th century display a [...] "rich series of Louis XVI-style rooms with elaborate marbles, carving, tapestries and furnishings." [...] The house had two elevators and a regulation size squash court on the fifth floor, which two generations of Hammond children found ideal for roller skating.|$|E
