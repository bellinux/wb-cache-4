Tibbets IV {{graduated from}} the United States Air Force Academy in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the 393d Bomb Squadron, flying the B-2 Spirit at Whiteman AFB, Missouri.

Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America's <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> forces. On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the 509th Bomb Wing.|$|E

25|$|The Skywarrior {{is one of}} {{only two}} U.S. Navy attack {{aircraft}} intended as a strategic bomber to enter full-scale service (the other being its predecessor, the North American AJ Savage). The carrier-based supersonic North American A-5 Vigilante was also originally designed for <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> strike missions and initially, very briefly, supplanted the A-3 in that role beginning in the early 1960s. However, with the removal of aircraft carriers from the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), the realization that very high altitude penetration of the Soviet Union was no longer feasible, and the transfer of the U.S. Navy's <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> deterrence mission to the Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine force, the Vigilante saw its mission changed to carrier-based tactical air reconnaissance.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Air Force also {{operates}} a <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> bomber fleet. The bomber force consists of 93 B-52 Stratofortresses, and 20 B-2 Spirits. All 64 B-1s were retrofitted {{to operate in}} a solely conventional mode by 2007 and are no longer counted as nuclear platforms.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, the Swedes {{dismissed}} {{the opportunity to}} acquire their own <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> forces that could reach an adversary's major population centers, because Sweden had no strategic bombers. Instead, the Swedish Government sought to develop tactical nuclear weapons to be used against militarily significant targets in Sweden's neighboring countries, {{in the event of}} war. The prime example of such a target could be enemy ports on the Baltic Sea, another such target could be enemy air bases. As most ports were located in close proximity to civilian population centers, they too would suffer if Swedish nuclear weapons were used. With this in mind, the Ministry of Defense arrived at the conclusion that any such use would have major political consequences, even if the device employed was a tactical rather than <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the Soviet Union {{had reached a}} rough parity with the United States in some {{categories}} of strategic weaponry, {{and at that time}} offered to negotiate limits on <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons deployments. The Soviet Union wished to constrain U.S. deployment of an antiballistic missile (ABM) system and retain the ability to place multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).|$|E

25|$|The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a {{proposed}} {{missile defense system}} intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons (intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles). The system, which was to combine ground-based units and orbital deployment platforms, was first publicly announced by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983.

25|$|Tactical F-111s were {{fitted with}} {{shoulder}} rails {{on the four}} inner swiveling pylons to mount AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for self-defense. Australian F-111Cs were equipped to launch the Harpoon anti-ship missile, and the Popeye stand-off missile. FB-111As could carry the same conventional ordnance as the tactical variants, but their wing pylons were more commonly used for either fuel tanks or <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> gravity bombs. They could carry up to four AGM-69 SRAM nuclear missiles on the pylons.|$|E
25|$|Chapelcross {{produced}} tritium for the Polaris and Trident <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon {{systems from}} about 1980 until 2005.

This facility was managed by BNFL {{on behalf of the}} Ministry of Defence (MoD). The material was transferred to Aldermaston via secure road convoys. Because of its involvement in the nuclear weapons programme, the site was not subject to international safeguards until 1998.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the Cold War and fears of an attack by the Soviet Union led to {{increasing}} interest in Sweden possessing its own nuclear arsenal. They were only interested in tactical nuclear weapons {{that would be used}} in a defensive role on Swedish territory or nearby seas. For reasons not directly related to security, Sweden never considered <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons that could reach the Soviet Union. British and U.S. ideas heavily influenced the Swedish Armed Forces’ doctrinal thinking at that time.|$|E

The nuclear power of the boat also meant that, like Nautilus, George Washingtons patrol length was limited only by the amount of food the boat could carry. Ballistic missile submarines, carrying Polaris missiles, eventually superseded all other <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> systems in the Navy. Deterrent patrols continue to this day, although now with s and Trident II missiles.|$|E
