40|$|Although {{the edge}} {{response}} of nonlinear filters {{has been the}} topic of much research, the behavior of many filters at two-dimensional structures such as sharp corners is not as well understood. We introduce a new technique that defines the response of a two-dimensional filter at corners of any angle. The response measure may be expressed either as fractional preservation or as an attenuation in decibels. Plotting the response measure in polar form illustrates the corner response of a filter both intuitively and quantitatively. The corner response may be computed for a particular size and <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> window on a discrete lattice, or may be determined in continuous space for a filter with a specific window shape. The continuous space response measure gives {{the response of the}} filter to corners in general, and usually corresponds closely with that determined for the filter on a discrete lattice. The corner responses of several widely used filters (median, averaging, and morphological) are compared...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{quality of}} surface {{finishing}} of manufactured parts {{is influenced by}} material and texture of the cutting edge as well as cutting parameters. To characterize the surface texture of a cutting tool standardized statistical roughness parameters are used as provided by inspection tools, i. e. profilers and microscopes. A topography scan undergoes several data analysis steps to detrend roughness from waviness and form before the standardized procedures (ISO 4287 and ISO 13565 - 2) are applied to estimate the statistical parameters of the roughness profile. A new series of ISO-standards (16610 -xx) has been developed {{during the past decade}} that provide besides the Gaussian filtration method alternative filter algorithms. Each filter has a different kernel characteristics delivering slightly different curvatures of the waviness profile. This article shows the influence of the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> kernels on roughness parameters and investigates possible estimation of the uncertainty of roughness amplitude density distributions accordingly. The filtration dependence of roughness parameters will be illustrated for a typical cutting tool, as example one of uncoated carbide...|$|E

This paper presents a novel approach of skeletonization for gray-scale images directly from original image based on anisotropic Gaussian filter. To deal with the non-uniform width of natural object parts, we adapt the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> kernel to local gradient feature. The orientation of filter is firstly estimated based on local structure tensor, and then the scale {{is calculated based on}} gradient vector flux. After that, the anisotropic Gaussian filter is performed on the image. The skeleton strength map is defined by the gradient vector flux measure. Finally, thin and binary skeleton is obtained by non- maximum suppression the skeleton strength map. Our method performs well on both binary and gray image in skeleton extraction even for clutter image. Copyright 2014 ACM...|$|E

In this paper, several comparison experiments are done to find a best implementation. The traditional MFCC calculation excludes the 0 th coefficient for the reason that it is regarded as somewhat unreliable. According to the analysis and experiments, the authors find that it can be regarded as the generalized frequency band energy (FBE) and is hence useful, which results in the FBE-MFCC. The authors also propose a better analysis, namely the auto-regressive analysis, on the frame energy, which outperforms its 1 st and/or 2 nd order differential derivatives. Experiments across the 863 Speech Database show that, compared with the traditional MFCC with its corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients, the FBE-MFCC and the frame energy with their corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients form the best combination, reducing the Chinese syllable error rate (CSER) by about 10. 0 %, while the FBE-MFCC with the corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients reducing CSER by 2. 5 %.
