40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>Sensory</b> Motor <b>Therapy</b> on {{the manifestation of}} stereotypic {{behaviors}} in autistic preschoolers were examined. The study was conducted at two preschool special education programs for Children with autism, and examined pre and post measurements of stereotypic activities or behaviors {{both before and after}} a daily period of <b>Sensory</b> Motor <b>Therapy</b> given by an occupational therapist on school premises. Although the original proposal described the treatment as <b>Sensory</b> Integration <b>Therapy,</b> upon closer examination, variation in treatment warranted a change in the way the treatment was described. The treatment will therefore be described as <b>Sensory</b> Motor <b>Therapy.</b> ^ There were two groups of twelve children each.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{developed}} a rehabilitation system utilising a haptic device. This system aims to integrate motion and <b>sensory</b> <b>therapy</b> ensuring that the patient’s interest is maintained and to establish a quantitative assessment {{of the level of}} disorder. This system consists of a haptic device, a computer and a LCD monitor. The user moves the grip of the haptic device according to the training program, which is displayed on the computer screen. The haptic device provides a virtual force to the grip. Various types of force can be applied, e. g. resistance, assistance, viscosity and friction. The basic and applied training programs are prepared for training and evaluation including training with simple motion and games. Suitable training can be chosen from the different types of training programs according to the patient’s disability. An experiment was carried out with normal healthy subjects and patients who have upper limb dysfunction. The results indicated that this system could be used for quantitative assessment and provide tailor-made training programs for individual patients. I...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sensory</b> {{integration}} <b>therapy</b> (SIT) is {{a controversial}} intervention that {{is widely used}} for people with disabilities.

This soundscape is composed to include the users’ own idiosyncratic anxiety triggers as a form of habituation, and to provoke psychological catharsis, as a non-verbal, visceral and enveloping exposure. To accurately pinpoint the most effective sounds and to optimally compose the soundscape we will monitor the participants’ physiological responses such as electroencephalography, respiration, electromyography, and heart rate during exposure. We hypothesize that such physiologically optimized sensory landscapes will aid the development of future immersive therapies for various psychological conditions, Sound is a major trigger of anxiety, and auditory hypersensitivity is an extremely problematic symptom.
