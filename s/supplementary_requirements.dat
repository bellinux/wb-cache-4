The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effict of pre-incisional vs. post-incisional intravenous low dose of racemic ketamine in postoperative pain in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair. Seventy-five children aged 1 - 6 years who were scheduled for inguinal herniorrhaphy were included in a prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly allocated to three groups (pre-incisional, post-incisional and control). Patients in pre-incisional group received an intravenous bolus of racemic ketamine (0. 25 mg/kg) before surgical incision and patients in post-incisional group received the same dose of racemic ketamine after surgical incision. Children of control group received intravenous boluses of normal saline. In post anesthesia care unit and pediatric surgical ward, the degree of pain and sedation, additional analgesic requirements and side effects were evaluated. There were no differences between groups with respect to demographic and hemodynamic parameters. Pain and sedation scores were not statistically different between groups during 24 h study.

40|$|Fermentation and {{anaerobic}} digestion of organic waste and wastewater is broadly studied and applied. Despite widely available results and data for these processes, {{comparison of the}} generated results in literature is difficult. Not only due to the used variety of process conditions, {{but also because of}} the many different growth media that are used. Composition of growth media can influence biogas production (rates) and lead to process instability during {{anaerobic digestion}}. To be able to compare results of the different studies reported, and to ensure nutrient limitation is not influencing observations ascribed to process dynamics and/or reaction kinetics, a standard protocol for creating a defined growth medium for anaerobic digestion and mixed culture fermentation is proposed. This paper explains the role(s) of the different macro- and micronutrients, as well as the choices for a growth medium formulation strategy. In addition, the differences in nutrient requirements between mesophilic and thermophilic systems are discussed as well as the importance of specific trace metals regarding specific conversion routes and the possible <b>supplementary</b> <b>requirement</b> of vitamins. The paper will also give some insight into the bio-availability and toxicity of trace metals. A remarkable finding is that mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes are quite comparable at their optimum temperatures. This has consequences for the trace metal requirements of thermophiles under certain conditions. Under non-limiting conditions, the trace metal requirement of thermophilic systems is about 3 times higher than for mesophilic systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} of capital adequacy ratios as indicators of bank performance with major focus on determining effectiveness of these capital adequacy ratios in indicating performance of banks. Twelve commercial banks formed the research population with secondary dataset obtained from end of year financial statements and annual reports for the period 2009 to 2012 based on judgemental technique. An explanatory research design was {{used in conjunction with}} an econometric panel regression model to establish the relationships between capital adequacy ratios and bank performance as well as to empirically investigate whether non-risk based capital ratios outperform their risk-weighted counterparts in indicating performance. Panel data obtained was presented in form of tables and was analyzed using regression analysis with the aid of an econometric statistical package. The GLS method used revealed that leverage ratio is more related to commercial bank performance than the risk-weighted ratio and gross revenue ratio is statistically insignificant in indicating bank performance. This relationship brought a revelation that simple measures of capital adequacy have better indicative power and provide useful financial information that regulators can use as a starting point in assessing financial condition of banks. For the period under investigation, non-risk based CARs; particularly leverage ratio outperformed the risk-weighted ratio in indicating bank performance in Zimbabwe. Bank regulators and commercial banks themselves can therefore derive substantial benefits from the use of simple capital ratios as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>requirement.</b> Overall, capital adequacy ratios alone were to a lesser extent effective in indicating bank performance pointing to the need to consider other variables that explain performance of banks. Therefore, policymakers should exercise great care not to too heavily rely on a single tool, but balance the benefits and costs of any indicator to leverage other policies at regulatory disposal...|$|R

Fifty-three preterm infants (45 infants with a median gestational age of 28 weeks, range 24 - 34 weeks completed the protocol) were randomized to receive either theophylline (loading dose 4 mg/kg followed by 4 mg/kg/day) or caffeine (loading dose 10 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg/day). Compliance of the respiratory system (CRS), strength of Hering Breuer reflex and the inspired oxygen concentration requirement were measured immediately prior to, 24 h and 7 days after commencing therapy. There was no statistically significant difference in the patient characteristics of the two groups, but only the theophylline group contained immature infants (i. e. < 26 weeks gestational age (n = 7)). At 24 h, there was a significant improvement in CRS and reduction in <b>supplementary</b> oxygen <b>requirements</b> in the caffeine group (p < 0. 01), in the theophylline group no such significant effects were seen. In the study population overall, after 7 days of treatment in both the theophylline and caffeine groups there was an improvement in CRS (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01 respectively) and a reduction in the inspired oxygen concentration (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01 respectively). There was, however, a significant reduction in the strength of the Hering Breuer reflex only in the caffeine group (p < 0. 05) and this was a decrease which related to the change in CRS (p < 0. 05). The only statistically significant difference in the magnitude of change in CRS, reflex strength or <b>supplementary</b> oxygen <b>requirements</b> between the two groups was that the reduction in inspired oxygen requirement in the caffeine group was greater than that in the theophylline treated infants at 24 h (p < 0. 05).

40|$|For a {{class of}} {{uncertain}} nonlinear systems (UNSs), the flow-invariance of a timedependent rectangular set (TDRS) defines individual constraints for each component of the state-space trajectories. It is shown {{that the existence of}} the flowinvariance property is equivalent to the existence of positive solutions for some differential inequalities with constant coefficients (derived from the state-space equation of the UNS). Flow-invariance also provides basic tools for dealing with the componentwise asymptotic stability as a special type of asymptotic stability, where the evolution of the state variables approaching the equilibrium point (EP) { 0 } is separately monitored (unlike the standard asymptotic stability, which relies on global information about the state variables, formulated in terms of norms). The EP{ 0 } of a given UNS is proved to be componentwise asymptotically stable if and only if the EP{ 0 } of a differential equation with constant coefficients is asymptotically stable in the standard sense. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>requirements</b> for the individual evolution of the state variables approaching the EP{ 0 } allow introducing the stronger concept of componentwise exponential asymptotic stability, which can be characterized by algebraic conditions.

40|$|Common {{aggregation}} predicates have natural definitions in logic, {{either as}} rst order sentences (min, max, etc.), or with elementary induction over a data structure {{that represents the}} relation (sum, count, etc.). The well-founded semantics for logic programs provides an interpretation of such definitions. The interpretation of rst-order aggregates seems to be quite natural and intuitively satisfying, even {{in the presence of}} recursion through aggregation. Care is needed to get useful results on inductive aggregates, however. A basic building block is the "subset" predicate, which states that a data structure represents a subset of an IDB predicate, and which is definable in the well-founded semantics. The analogous "superset" is also definable, and their combination yields a "generic" form of ndall. Surprisingly, findall must be used negatively to obtain useful approximations when the exact relation is not yet known. Extensions to the semantics, restrictions on the input, and other <b>supplementary</b> <b>requirements</b> proposed in earlier studies appear to be unnecessary for the purpose of attaching a meaning to a program that involves recursion through aggregation. For example, any reasonable definition of "shortest paths" tolerates negative weight edges, correctly computes shortest paths that exist, and leaves tuples undefined where negative-weight cycles cause the shortest path not to exist. Other examples exhibit similarly robust behavior, when defined carefully. Connections with the generic model of computation are discussed briefly...|$|E

When optimizing field traffic, it is most significant to minimize the {{time spent in the}} headlands. Therefore the behavior of tractor-trailer combination in a headland is studied in this paper. The tractor-trailer combination is modelled as a differential equation system or dynamic model with six states and two inputs. The movement is restricted into 2 D-plane. The <b>supplementary</b> <b>requirements</b> for the model are the ability to reverse driving, allowing the switch-back turning and the standard formulation of optimal control problem. The dynamic model is parametrized in terms of mechanical parameters of the vehicle. Optimal control theory and tools are reviewed. The minimum-time optimal control problem of headland turning with tractor-trailer vehicle is presented. Vehicle's mechanical and field's geometrical constraints are considered. The optimal control problem is highly nonlinear so it cannot be solved analytically. Numerical algorithms for solving this kind of optimal control problems demand high computational cost and cannot be solved in real-time even with modern desktop computers. The optimal control problem is solved with fixed vehicle parameters and varying headland parameters, headland angle and width. In order to use optimal control problem solutions in real-time applications, the solutions in variable headland cases are approximated with simple trajectories. The rules for selecting a turning method with fixed vehicle parameters and certain headland parameters are presented...|$|E

40|$|Achieving optimal {{pain relief}} after lung {{transplantation}} (LT) is often difficult, because both systemic analgesics and regional techniques have specific advantages and disavantages. Uncontrolled pain impedes repeated powerful coughs and hinders valid respiratory excursions and graft expansion; these consequences markedly {{increase the risk}} of pulmonary complica- tions. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is a universally accepted method of pain management after unilateral or bilateral thoracotomy, and in clinical experience it has proven to be the best option after LT. The combination of epidural local anesthetic plus opioid is associated with significant reduction in pain scores and/or <b>supplementary</b> analgesic <b>requirement</b> compared with parenteral opioid analgesia. Even though the benefits of epidural techniques in reduction of respiratory morbidity and protection from stress response to surgery have to be weighted against the risk of spinal bleeding, a well functioning thoracic sensory blockade provides satisfactory pain control and avoids the excessive sedation associated with systemic opiates. Multiple factors determine the quality of postoperative assistance, and a clear relationship between “adequate” or “high-quality” postoperative analgesia and improved outcome is difficult to establish. However, an individualized perimedullary analgesic regimen may certainly contrib- ute to greater cooperation with physical maneuvers, avoid noxious limitations to graft expansion, and possibly decrease overall morbidity...|$|R
