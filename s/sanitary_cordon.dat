When Billings and his colleagues attempted to revive the idea of a National Board as a new Bureau of Health within the Department of the Interior, Hamilton announced that during August 1887 MHS had established a Hygienic Laboratory (predecessor to the National Institutes of Health), where Dr. Joseph J. Kinyoun and his staff were applying the new science of bacteriology to examine cholera. In the end, the National Board of Health lost both funding and support from Congress, which gave the Board's enlarged authorities, and its quarantine stations, to MHS.|$|E
500|$|The Board of Health {{was led by}} Chief Health Officer Walter R. Nursey. All matters {{regarding}} quarantine {{within the}} district were handled by Edmund A. Struthers. The board was established to confine and treat the smallpox epidemic in the territory, and had wide powers {{to carry out this}} mission. The Board of Health established vaccination programs among native populations in the District of Keewatin based on legislation that continued well after the Council was dissolved.

60|$|This {{impoverishment}} of {{aims and}} depravation of principles by {{the triumph of}} the political spirit outside of its proper sphere, cannot unfortunately be restricted to any one set of people in the state. It is something in the very atmosphere, which no <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon</b> can limit. Liberalism, too, would be something more generous, more attractive--yes, and more practically effective, if its professors and champions could allow their sense of what is feasible to be refreshed and widened by a more free recognition, however private and undemonstrative, of the theoretic ideas which give their social creed whatever life and consistency it may have. Such ideas are these: That the conditions of the social union are not a mystery, only to be touched by miracle, but the results of explicable causes, and susceptible of constant modification: that the thoughts of wise and patriotic men should be perpetually turned towards the improvement of these conditions in every direction: that contented acquiescence in the ordering that has come down to us from the past is selfish and anti-social, because amid the ceaseless change that is inevitable in a growing organism, the institutions of the past demand progressive re-adaptations: that such improvements {{are most likely to be}} secured in the greatest abundance by limiting the sphere of authority, extending that of free individuality, and steadily striving after the bestowal, so far as the nature of things will ever permit it, of equality of opportunity: that while there is dignity in ancestry, a modern society is only safe in proportion as it summons capacity to its public counsels and enterprises; that such a society to endure must progress: that progress on its political side means more than anything else the substitution of Justice as a governing idea, instead of Privilege, and that the best guarantee for justice in public dealings is the participation in their own government of the people most likely to suffer from injustice. This is not an exhaustive account of the progressive doctrine, and we have here nothing to say as to its soundness. We only submit that if those who use the watchwords of Liberalism were to return upon its principles, instead of dwelling exclusively on practical compromises, the tone of public life would be immeasurably raised. The cause of social improvement would be less systematically balked of the victories that are best worth gaining. Progress would mean something more than mere entrances and exits on the theatre of office. We should not see in the mass of parliamentary candidates--and they are important people, because nearly every Englishman with any ambition is a parliamentary candidate, actual or potential--that grave anxiety, that sober rigour, that immense caution, which are all so really laughable, because so many of those men are only anxious lest they should make a mistake in finding out what the majority of their constituents would like them to think; only rigorous against those who are indiscreet enough to press a principle against the beck of a whip or a wire-puller; and only very cautious not so much lest their opinion should be wrong, as lest it should not pay.|$|E
25|$|Two {{national}} epidemics framed Hamilton's tenure: {{the yellow}} fever epidemic of 1878 that raged along the Mississippi River Valley and the Asiatic cholera epidemic of 1892, which hit New York City with particular ferocity. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>cordons,</b> or quarantine, {{were the primary}} response to yellow fever, to block the progress of disease believed to be conveyed not only on boats and foot traffic but also now by railroad. Instituting quarantines, however, meant Federal intervention into what was widely held to be state police powers and met resistance in the southeastern United States where the issue of yellow fever, {{and its impact on}} trade, were most critical.|$|R
50|$|Many Soviet critics saw {{the events}} of The Fatal Eggs as a {{critique}} of Soviet Russia. Indeed, there is a {{case to be made}} for Professor Persikov's identification with Vladimir Il'ich Lenin (note the similarity in names), as both of them can be said to have unleashed destruction on Russia, and there seem to be similarities between them both in appearance and character. Chicken plague and the <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordons</b> that foreign countries established against it were seen as a parody of the ideas of internationalism and the policy of Antanta against it. Although Bulgakov was not repressed, from 1925 he was questioned by the GPU several times and was never allowed to leave the Soviet Union, possibly {{as a result of his}} negative image which was at least partly due to the publication of The Fatal Eggs. Although there were positive responses, upon the whole the novel was viewed as dangerous and anti-Soviet.|$|R
40|$|From {{the onset}} of the Black Death in 1347 - 48, Italian cities which faced the Mediterranean, an {{epidemic}} sea, constructed a complex and articulated health defence system which was an example to all other western countries. The cornerstones of this health defence system lay in quarantine, <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordons,</b> lazarets, disinfection, and in the social regulation of the population at risk. Medicine played no part. Its impotence in dealing with epidemic diseases left health defence to the initiative of the civil authorities who rigorously fought the repeated incursions of plague, which from the end of Middle Ages severely tried and tested social organisation, economic life and public order, all of which were threatened by reactions of fear and aggression. From the fifteenth century onwards the public authorities instituted health magistracies which perfected policing and hygiene strategies based on isolation, separation and social control. This progressively extended to individuals in the community through 'health certificates'. This paper follows the evolution and crises of the conceptual, cultural adn institutional response to epidemics through the centuries up to the appearance of the plague of cholera and its disappearance...|$|R
50|$|The {{occupation}} {{was originally}} implemented under pretext {{of the need}} for the Habsbrg Empire to upkeep the <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon,</b> as to protect the Kingdom of Hungary from an outbreak of the plague. Between 1670 and until 1672, the starostwa of Nowy Targ, Czorsztyn and Stary Sącz were also under Austrian occupation.|$|E
50|$|After being {{replaced}} {{as prime minister}} in August and before the presidential elections in March 2000, Sergei Stepashin, in separate discussions with three different journalists, {{made a number of}} references to the planning of the invasion of Chechnya by the Kremlin which started in March 1999. According to Stepashin, the aim in March 1999 was to place a <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon</b> around Chechnya but in July this was broadened to seize territory north of the Terek. In John Dunlop's view, Russian forces would have entered Chechnya even if there had been no invasion of Dagestan and no acts of terrorism in Moscow.|$|E
5000|$|The Venezuelan president's {{antipathy}} for nondemocratic {{rule was}} reflected in the so-called Betancourt Doctrine, which denied Venezuelan diplomatic recognition to any regime, right or left, that came to power by military force. Betancourt always defended, and represented, democratic values and principles in Latin America. This put him at odds with the military strongmen who came to dominate and define political perception of the region.During his first message to Congress as President of Venezuela, on 12 February 1959, Betancourt said:"...Regimes disrespectful of human rights, violating their citizens´ freedom, tyrannizing them with the backing of totalitarian political police, should be submitted to a rigorous <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon</b> and eradicated, through collective pacification, from the Inter-American juridical community" ...|$|E
50|$|The role of {{the head}} of state was also {{considerably}} modified. From 1808, Prussia was divided into districts. The different governments of these districts were set up according to the principle of portfolios, as with the national ministers of state. Each region was given an Oberpräsident for the first time, directly subordinate to the national ministers and with the role of stimulating public affairs. Their rôle, which even went as far as putting up <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordons</b> {{in the event of an}} epidemic, was similar to that of French prefects - that is, to represent regional interests to the central government. The post was abolished in 1810 but revived in 1815 to play an important part in political life. It was in this context that justice and administration were separated once and for all. On the establishment of administrative acts, the people concerned thus had a right of appeal. Nevertheless, there was no judicial control on the administration. Aiming to reduce any influence on the administration, this was reinforced by different administrative acts. The organisation that the reformers put in place served as a model for other German states and to major businesses.|$|R

Through our text we intend to present and to highlight the main ideas and plans of Eurasian inspiration regarding Romania, as well as the interesting predictions made, in certain moments, by some representative characters for the Eurasian paradigm, like Aleksandr Dugin, for instance, who is its main ideologist and promoter. At the same time, one must not neglect the signals of discontent from Moscow about the need of dissipating the so-called <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon</b> of the Western powers, in which the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania are included – another aspect bearing a particular importance for understanding certain gestures, attitudes and statements related to the role and the place of the Eurasian Union...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{continuation}} from Volume one, page 59. During the 1743 plague precautions, boats were prohibited from approaching part of the Valletta wharf extending from Lascaris Tunnel to the Barriera. Ships from places south of Catania and Palermo were placed in quarantine for twenty-four days. On the 11 th June a more vigorous surveillance was imposed along the shores of Malta, a <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon</b> was stretched {{from north to south}} along the eastern seaboard. The Order of St. John took no risks with regard to Malta and it was only on the 23 rd February, 1746, that the Grand Master considered that the threat of plague had vanished, that it was safe to call off the extraordinary quarantine restrictions. We are bewildered by the lack of purely medical provisions and by the absence of physicians among the Commissioners. Notwithstanding, we are impressed by the soundness of their principles of public health prophylaxis, the rationality of the methods employed and the welding into an integrated sanitary system of their naval, military and economic resources. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidemic}} of cholera {{that took place}} in the Neretva basin in 1886 was part of the fifth pandemic wave that was spreading throughout Europe. Based on the death records, vital statistics and the newspaper articles from that period, in this paper we present the emergence and the course this epidemic. In the context of analysis and experience of the {{epidemic of}} cholera in the lower Neretva basin, the newspaper articles have been recognized as a sensitive register of the changes of behavioural patterns, the way of speaking, the mechanisms of reacting and adjusting to the spreading epidemic, but also the resistance to it. It is based on this material that we can make conclusions about the relationship between the individual and the collective in the time of danger, as well as about the particularities of historical events that have been left out in other sources. Two potential paths for cholera to enter the area of the lower Neretva basin have been identified: one from the sea and the other from land, via the neighbouring country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Quarantine measures had been taken in order to prevent the onslaught of the epidemic, a <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon</b> was organized, disinfection of the land was carried out and a cholera hospital organized in Metković. However, despite the undertaken measures, an inefficiency of the government organs was obvious, because their actions mainly applied to formal fulfilment of anti-epidemic measures and they quite easily handed over individual initiatives to physicians. The analysis of strategies concerning the application of anti-epidemic measures in the past can be useful for learning more about the multilayered nature of social mechanisms in the time of epidemics, which makes it convincing and valuable even in the present day...|$|E
40|$|The Habsburg monarchy was {{conceived}} in 1527 as a borderland when the Ottoman march into the Pannonian plain united the Austrian, Bohemian and Hungarian lands. The latter’s vulnerability encouraged a consensual {{relationship between the}} Habsburg court and domestic elites that positioned Hungary’s political system between “western” European absolutism and the anarchical “royal republicanism” of Poland. The Habsburg claim to the entire kingdom helped sustain {{the vision of a}} united patrimony, ultimately realized following the triumph over the Ottomans and definitively confirmed in 1867. The combination of Hungary’s borderline character and competing jurisdictions contributed to political instability during the 16 th and 17 th centuries. Only after the Habsburgs had pushed the Ottomans from the Hungarian plain, did the frontier begin a more conventional evolution. In a move that was a clear break with previous frontier arrangements, the Habsburgs and Ottomans clearly separated their territorial jurisdiction by drawing and demarcating the boundary that pacified the frontier regime more in keeping with general developments in Europe. Outer borders gradually assumed new functions. The permanent <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon</b> that the Hasburgs established in 1728 along its entire length remained an unparalleled public health institution, effectively blocking the spread of plague from the Ottoman Balkans. In addition, it served as a migration control institution, signaling the ongoing transition to a modern international frontier, which would have been unimaginable without its mobility control function. This spacial transformation encouraged the kingdom’s recovery and re-population, as well as its transition from a “borderland” into the “heart of Europe”. The simultaneous colonization of Hungary from the west and southeast stimulated its economic and demographic recovery, while compounding its linguistic and ethnic diversity, particularly in border areas, thereby contributing to its dissolution in the age of nationalism...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} explores how modern architecture {{responded to}} the political and ideological demands in former Yugoslavia, and how it has shaped the urban territory of newly formed city of New Belgrade. New Belgrade was conceived as a new capital city of Yugoslavia, {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century – on an empty field between two important regional cities - Belgrade and Zemun. Historically speaking, this empty flood plain functioned as a border and <b>sanitary</b> <b>cordon,</b> which was supervised and controlled as a “no-contact” zone between Belgrade, as the ultimate point of the Orient and the town of Zemun, a small but yet important Austro-Hungarian port on the Danube. From the very beginning planned as a modern city, it’s one of the early realizations of a modern city in the world in general and the unique example of a modern city on a large area - not in the periphery but in the city center, between two historic cores. With its significant size and vastness (over 40 sq km and a population of about 250, 000), grand boulevards and massive buildings grouped into numerically marked blocks, it’s a mixture of a modernist vision and a socialist planning, far larger than any comparable urban district in Central and Eastern European cities. Once emerged from the »conflict between the two dominant ideologies of the postwar period: the modernist, or CIAM’s dogma of functional city and political, Marxist – socialist dogma, in the context of the ruling system« (Blagojevic, 2004) – today, after complete change of paradigm, is heading again towards a very dynamic and rapid construction. However, although recognized as a place of potential new development, the lack of critical review, evaluation and long-term strategies threatens its structure to be, to a certain extent, perceived only as a physical residue of the previous system, or as its ideological monument. Despite the occasional interest of the critics and the press, international mapping and interpretation of modern architecture in Yugoslavia and New Belgrade was almost completely overlooked. On the other hand, after the traumatic collapse of the Federation and repeated search for its lost identity local critics left New Belgrade without proper review, evaluation or even exact findings about its history. The general tendency of moving towards liberal capitalism creates, we might say, an a priori hostile environment towards a socialist period and its legacy, once again trying to ignore history. Therefore, this thesis is an attempt to reconstruct not only the history of construction of New Belgrade but also its meaning and its place in the international map of modernism...|$|E
