500|$|Later, Potty {{appears to}} Patchy {{and tells him}} {{that he is now}} {{assistant}} manager. Potty says that his fancy book smarts got him the promotion and Patchy thinks it's unfair. When Patchy realizes his food is terrible, Potty tells him that he needs to practice his cooking skills. After a montage of training, Patchy makes his first burger. He tries it and realizes it's just as bad and has it walk the plank (in other words, throw it into the garbage). [...] Patchy <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> says that SpongeBob's first patty probably didn't go so well. However, Potty shows SpongeBob (as a baby) making his first patty and it's perfect on the first try.|$|E
500|$|Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He described the episode as [...] "painful to watch" [...] {{and one that}} where [...] "all the worst sci-fi TV show clichés are in evidence". He criticised the out of date sexist values of the plot in which Troi would {{have been forced to}} leave the ship to be with Wyatt. He did praise the appearance of Majel Barett, describing her as [...] "ever-radiant" [...] and the [...] "saving grace of the episode". He gave it a score of three out of ten. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2010. He described Majel Barrett as [...] "agonizing" [...] and the episode was [...] "full of lazy shoulder <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> half-finished ideas". He gave the episode a grade of D.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} brief scene of an {{astronaut}} on Mars uncovering a stone slate featuring {{the cover of the}} album Oops!... I Did It Again. A scientist back on Earth sees it through a video transmitter and says, [...] "Cute. What is it?" [...] As the astronaut replies, [...] "Oh, it's cute alright. It couldn't be...", the ground begins to shake as a large stage rises from the ground. Spears then descends from a platform onto a stage in a red catsuit as the track begins to play. As she continues to sing and dance, she suspends the astronaut mid-air above her. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes of Spears wearing a short white top and skirt, lying barefoot on a white web pad with dancers on the ground around her. During its bridge, Spears does a flip in the air to where the astronaut is and appears in a white jacket, short black leather skirt, and leather boots. As a symbol of his love for her, the astronaut gifts Spears with the Heart of the Ocean, the blue diamond from the blockbuster film Titanic (1997). She questions that she [...] "thought the old lady [...] dropped it into the ocean in the end", to which he responds, [...] "Well, baby, I went down and got it for you". Spears comments [...] "Oh, you shouldn't have" [...] and walks away, the astronaut <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> leaves. The video concludes as Spears and her performers continue to dance.|$|E

500|$|His tragic efforts, however, were {{consistently}} ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber {{in the role}} of Richard III made love to Lady Anne, the Grub Street Journal wrote, [...] "he looks like a pickpocket, with his <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart". Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's The Relapse, Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne's Sir Courtly Nice, and Sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege's Man of Mode were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing, described Cibber as [...] "the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb". These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber's affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738–39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, he whispered to fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he wanted to go home, perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Dryden and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber's adaptation of Richard III in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
2500|$|A {{regiment}} is sent against [...] "Chonkin's gang", but Chonkin successfully fends {{them off}} until they use artillery. When general Drynov incredulously learns that Chonkin single-handedly (with his baba) was holding off the whole regiment, he declares Chonkin {{a hero and}} awards him an order taken off his own chest. When the NKVD lieutenant shows the order for Chonkin's arrest, Drynov <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> tells them {{to carry out their}} duty at which point Chonkin is arrested and carried off {{in the back of the}} truck to the [...] "Right Place", leaving Nyura on her knees on the road weeping after Chonkin as the scene closes and the book ends. The book ends with the joke on Gladyshev, whose misunderstanding of evolution (that monkeys became man through labor and intelligence) has been thoroughly dissettled by Chonkin's question why horses do not become men if they work harder than men do, finds a note attached to the bottom of a hoof of his dead horse which had earlier disappeared. Supposing the horse had evolved and written the note, he is spooked and crosses himself.|$|E

"We {{are friends}} now," [...] they said, {{when they were}} seen {{together}} again; and friends they remained, in spite of <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> smiles, ill-natured speeches, {{and more than one}} attempt to sow discord between them, for people did not understand the new order of things.|$|E
6000|$|Chef Ragozzi. With pomp {{of words}} beyond a soldier's cunning, [...] And <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> {{wrinkled}} brow, {{he smiles and}} whispers!

60|$|As if {{purposely}} {{to justify}} this character, Luis looked about him anxiously a moment, {{and then made}} his way directly {{to the side of}} Colon.

60|$|Of {{the mysteries}} of Isis and Osiris, in which dancing played an {{important}} part, {{the character of the}} ceremonies is matter of dim conjecture; but from the hints that have come down to us like significant <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> whispers from a discreet past, which could say a good deal more if it had a mind to, I hasten to infer that they were no better than they should have been.|$|E
60|$|As Tarzan {{walked slowly}} toward the smoking-room he came {{unexpectedly}} upon two men whispering excitedly just without. He would have vouchsafed them not even a passing thought but for the strangely guilty glance {{that one of them}} shot in his direction. They reminded Tarzan of melodramatic villains he had seen at the theaters in Paris. Both were very dark, and this, in connection with the <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> stealthy glances that accompanied their palpable intriguing, lent still greater force to the similarity.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite right," [...] Philip answered, with a deprecating look (as {{who should}} say, aside, [...] "I really couldn't help it"). [...] "He--he's rather in a difficulty." [...] And {{then he went}} on to explain in a few hurried words to Frida, with sundry <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> nods of profoundest import, that the {{supposed}} lunatic or murderer or foreigner or fool had gone to Miss Blake's without luggage of any sort; and that, [...] "Perhaps"--very dubitatively--"a portmanteau or bag might help him out of his temporary difficulties." ...|$|E

6000|$|The rider {{from the}} chateau, {{and the horse}} in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag.

The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! Help, help!" [...] The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> biting of lips, [...] "It must burn." ...|$|E
60|$|Strengthened in a mind {{naturally}} calm, sedate, and firm, by {{the influence}} of religious confidence, this poor captive was enabled to attend to, and comprehend, {{a great part of}} an interesting conversation which passed betwixt those into whose hands she had fallen, notwithstanding that their meaning was partly disguised by the occasional use of cant terms, of which Jeanie knew not the import, by the low tone in which they spoke, and by their mode of supplying their broken phrases by <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> signs, as is usual amongst those of their disorderly profession.|$|E
60|$|All {{this could}} not escape the notice of the company. Their gayety was chilled by the unaccountable gloom of the bridegroom; their spirits were infected; whispers and glances were interchanged, {{accompanied}} by <b>shrugs</b> <b>and</b> dubious shakes of the head. The song and the laugh grew less and less frequent: there were dreary pauses in the conversation, which were at length succeeded by wild tales and supernatural legends. One dismal story produced another still more dismal, and the baron nearly frightened some of the ladies into hysterics {{with the history of}} the goblin horseman that carried away the fair Leonora--a dreadful story which has since been put into excellent verse, and is read and believed by all the world.|$|E
