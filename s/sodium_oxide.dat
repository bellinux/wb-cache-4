5|$|The {{market for}} sodium is {{volatile}} {{due to the}} difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent {{the formation of a}} surface layer of <b>sodium</b> <b>oxide</b> or sodium superoxide.|$|E
5|$|Sodium at {{standard}} temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white <b>sodium</b> <b>oxide</b> unless immersed in oil or inert gas, {{which are the}} conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98°C) and boiling (883°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.|$|E

40|$|Ignition and {{extinguishment}} {{of sodium}} fires {{was investigated in}} air diluted by nitrogen using a coaxial burner. Oxygen concentration and temperature were changed from 0. 5 % to 21 % and from 110 ºC to 700 ºC, respectively. In undiluted air, ignition occurred near the crust of <b>sodium</b> <b>oxides</b> at temperatures below 600 ºC. At temperatures higher than 625 ºC, ignition was observed in a vapour layer and a conical diffusion flame appeared on a sodium pool at 700 ºC. The flame was observed for only one second after the ignition before a dense cloud from burning sodium obscured vision. In this study, the lowest ignition temperature of sodium was 115 ºC under an air flow rate of 5 L/min. There were extinguishing limits of oxygen concentrations for burning sodium. The limits decreased linearly with increasing sodium temperature up to a temperature of 700 ºC. Anomalous ignition {{was found in a}} region of oxygen concentrations lower than the limits. One example was an observed ignition occurring in the region of oxygen concentrations below 3 % and temperatures above 400 ºC.

25|$|As seen above, {{combustion}} converts {{less than}} half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving off a soldier position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a corrosive substance. The soot contains potassium oxide or <b>sodium</b> <b>oxide</b> that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Black powder arms must therefore be well cleaned after use, both inside and out, to remove the residue.|$|E

500|$|Osmium is {{obtained}} commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing.

In order to separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid. Osmium, ruthenium, rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum, gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia, leaving a solid residue. Rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate.
