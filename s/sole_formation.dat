Opposing Agricola's forces were 2,000 to 2,500 armed partisans.Agricola, finally given a chance to prove himself as commander, addressed the problems energetically. He quickly {{came to the conclusion that}} major anti-partisan actions were impossible to conduct due to the extreme conditions and the lack of forces, so he opted to concentrate and fortify his available forces in key positions. It was due to his persistence that the 2nd Army yielded to his requests and reinforced him with over 10,000 Hungarian troops until May 1942. During these months, Agricola's units battled fiercely with partisans, succeeding in killing over 7,200, according to official reports. German historian Christian Hartmann argued that the relatively heavy casualties of the Korück's troops — 1161 dead, wounded and missing — and the number of captured enemy weapons indicated that Agricola, in contrast with the typical occupation policy of the time, was not focused (at least exclusively) in reprisals against the civilian population, in the hope of terrorizing and weakening the partisan movement. Korück 580 was ultimately successful in eliminating the local partisan threat until the summer of 1942. Agricola also supported the utilization of Soviet volunteers in anti-partisan warfare. In his area of responsibility, in May-June 1942, a battalion formed of Turkestani volunteers, the Turkestanisches Infanteriebataillon 450 (Turkestani Infantry Battalion 450) took part in operations. On 30 June 1942, Agricola praised the commander of the unit, Andreas Mayer-Mader, for his effective leadership style. [...] Noting the increasing influence Soviet propaganda had on the population, Agricola called for more humane treatment, so that the population would not be an impediment in the exploitation of the occupied territory for the war effort. For this, he restrained the indiscriminate executions of civilians, though the figures of those executed remained high: he reported that until June 1942, his units had executed 1,600 out of 6,000 civilians suspected of a wide range of punishable actions (the Kommissarbefehl was also implemented) and released unharmed most of the remaining 4,400. Mass starvation, primarily due to the reckless exploitation of resources by the Wehrmacht was common in other occupied Soviet territories, and the situation in the Korück's territories was not very different. In February 1942, Agricola wrote that the food rations for the civilians were lower than those issued by the pre-war Soviet regime and felt that given the situation, it would be impossible to cultivate positive feelings towards the German troops, thus calling for a change.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{subduction}} rheology in both {{space and}} time has been a challenge {{since the advent of}} plate tectonics. We herein focus on "subduction infancy", that is the first ~ 1 - 5 My immediately following subduction nucleation, when a newly born slab penetrates into the upper plate mantle and heats up. The only remnants of this critical yet elusive geodynamic step are thin metamorphic soles, commonly found beneath pristine, 100 - 1000 km long portions of oceanic lithosphere emplaced on continents (i. e., ophiolites). Through the (i) worldwide compilation of pressure-temperature conditions of metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> augmented by pseudosection thermodynamic modeling, (ii) calculations of the viscosity of materials along the plate interface and (iii) generic numerical thermal models, we provide a conceptual model of dynamic plate interface processes during subduction infancy (and initiation s. l.). We show in particular how major rheological switches across the subduction interface control slab penetration, and the formation of metamorphic soles. Due to the downward progression of hydration and weakening of the mantle wedge with cooling, the lower plate (basalt, sediment) and the upper plate (mantle wedge) rheologies equalize and switch over a restricted temperature-time-depth interval (e. g., at ~ 800 °C and ~ 1 GPa, during 0. 1 - 2 My, for high-temperature metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>formation).</b> These switches result in episodes of maximum interplate mechanical coupling, thereby slicing the top of the slab and welding pieces (basalt, sediment) {{to the base of the}} mantle wedge. Similar mechanical processes likely apply for the later, deeper accretion and exhumation of high-temperature oceanic eclogites in serpentinite mélanges, or for the accretion of larger tectonic slices. This model provides constraints on the effective rheologies of the crust and mantle and general understanding, at both rock and plate scale, for accretion processes and early slab dynamics...|$|E

40|$|At {{the leading}} edge of {{migrating}} cells, protrusive forces are developed by the assembly of actin filaments organised in a lamellipodial dendritic array at the front and a more distal lamellar linear array. Whether these two arrays are distinct or functionally linked and how they contribute to cell migration is an open issue. Tropomyosin severely inhibits lamellipodium formation and facilitates the lamellar array while enhancing migration, by a mechanism that is not understood. Here we show that the complex in vivo effects of tropomyosin are recapitulated in the reconstituted propulsion of neural Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) -functionalised beads, which is based on the <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of a dendritic array of actin-related protein (Arp) 2 / 3 -branched filaments. Actin-depolymerising factor (ADF) and tropomyosin control the length of the actin tail. By competing with Arp 2 / 3 during filament branching, tropomyosin displays opposite effects on propulsion depending on the surface density of N-WASP. Tropomyosin binding to the dendritic array is facilitated following filament debranching, causing its enrichment {{at the rear of the}} actin tail, like in vivo.

Yield levels on the Saïs Plateau between Meknès and Fez in the semi-arid zone, however, remain low possibly because of sub-optimum water use due to inefficient tillage systems. A study was carried out to investigate the effect of soil tillage operations on water infiltration. Two systems of seedbed preparation on a silty clay soil were compared: traditional disc harrow (‘cover crop’) versus reduced tillage using a spring tined cultivator (‘vibrocultor’). Infiltration processes were studied using a rainfall simulator applying rainfall typical for aggressive events in the region. The effect of tillage and rainfall on the structure of the soil was assessed by both quantitative and descriptive methods. It was found that the disc harrow caused excessive pulverisation and seal formation under rainfall. Water infiltration, on the other hand, was not hindered by plough <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> or subsoil compaction.

40|$|The lipid {{fraction}} of roasted coffee {{is an interesting}} ingredient {{that could be used}} in a large number of food formulations. Coffee oil has peculiar flavouring as well as nutraceutical characteristics. The feasibility of the use of coffee oil as ingredient greatly depends not only on its chemical characteristics but also on its physical properties. The crystallisation and melting properties of the coffee oil extracted from Arabica roasted coffee powder were determined by using synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled with differential scanning calorimetry. The fatty acid composition and the flavour profile were also assessed by using GC and GC-MS analyses, respectively. The main fatty acids found in coffee oil are linoleic and palmitic acid. Significant amounts of stearic and oleic acid are also present. These chemical characteristics are linked to the phase transition behaviour. The crystallisation of coffee oil occurs at 6. 5 +/- 0. 3 degrees C, independently of the cooling rate applied (from 0. 5 to 10 degrees C/min). A unique crystalline structure was identified: a double chain length (2 L) beta' structure (55. 29 angstrom).

40|$|International audienceThe {{carcinogenic}} action of UVA radiation is commonly attributed to DNA oxidation mediated by endogenous photosensitisers. Yet, it was recently shown that cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), {{well known for}} their involvement in UVB genotoxicity, are produced in larger yield than oxidative lesions in UVA-irradiated cells and skin. In the present work, we gathered mechanistic information on this photoreaction by comparing formation of all possible bipyrimidine photoproducts upon UVA irradiation of cells, purified genomic DNA and dA 20 :dT 20 oligonucleotide duplex. We observed that the distribution of photoproducts, characterized by the <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of CPD {{and the absence of}} (6 - 4) photoproducts was similar in the three types of samples. The CPD involving two thymines represented 90 % of the amount of photoproducts. Moreover, the yields of formation of the DNA lesions were similar in cells and isolated DNA. In addition, the effect of the wavelength of the incident photons was found to be the same in isolated DNA and cells. This set of data shows that UVA-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are formed via a direct photochemical mechanism, without mediation of a cellular photosensitiser. This is possible because the double-stranded structure increases the capacity of DNA bases to absorb UVA photons, as evidenced {{in the case of the}} oligomer dA 20 :dT 20. These results emphasize the need to consider UVA in the carcinogenic effects of sunlight. An efficient photoprotection is needed that can only be complete by completely blocking incident photons, rather than by systemic approaches such as antioxidant supplementation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{regulation of the}} E 2 F transcription factor during differentiation of muscle cells. E 2 F regulates many genes involved in growth control and is also the target of regulation by diverse cellular signals, including the RB family of growth suppressors (e. g., the retinoblastoma protein [RB], p 107, and p 130). The following aspects of E 2 F function and regulation during muscle differentiation were investigated: (i) protein-protein interactions, (ii) protein levels, (iii) phosphorylation of the E 2 F protein, and (iv) transcriptional activity. A distinct E 2 F complex was present in differentiated cells but not in undifferentiated cells. The p 130 protein was a prominent component of the E 2 F complex associated with differentiation. In contrast, in undifferentiated cells, the p 107 protein was the prominent component {{in one of three}} E 2 F complexes. In addition, use of a differentiation-defective muscle line provided genetic and biochemical evidence that quiescence and differentiation are separable events. Exclusive formation of the E 2 F-p 130 complex did not occur in this differentiation-defective line; however, E 2 F complexes diagnostic of quiescence were readily apparent. Thus, <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of the E 2 F-p 130 complex is a necessary event in terminal differentiation. Other changes in E 2 F function and regulation upon differentiation include decreased phosphorylation and increased repression by E 2 F. These observations suggest that the regulation of E 2 F function during terminal differentiation may proceed through differential interaction within the RB family and/or phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{initial stages}} {{allowing}} {{for the birth of}} obduction and/or subduction zones still remain enigmatic and highlydebated. Although {{there is no doubt that}} initiation occurs on a preexisting lithospheric-scale thermal or mechanicaldiscontinuity (e. g., ridge, supra-subduction zone or transform fault), no consensus has yet been reached onthis subject. However, more and more data allowing to address this issue are available (coming from field analyses,metamorphic petrology and geochronology). In particular, metamorphic soles located at the base of ophioliticnappes, which formed during the very first stages of initiation, yield increasingly precise P-T-t constraints. By confrontingsuch data to thermo-mechanical models, it should be possible to identify which initial configuration allowsfor metamorphic <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> and for the emplacement (or not) of an ophiolitic nappe of realistic dimensions. In this study we designed thermo-mechanical models encompassing three initial model configurations, for whichP-T-t data from the Semail ophiolite of Oman are then used for the validation of model outputs. The first configurationencompasses an oceanic ridge type initial thermal perturbation (error function). The second configurationmimics the thermal perturbation caused by the arrival of a mantle plume at the base of the lithosphere (gaussianfunction). The third initial condition corresponds to a case where the obduction/subduction initiates along a transformfault delimitating lithospheres of contrasting thermal ages (step function). Our results show that obduction never initiates in ridge type models, excepted for particular conditions that are notcompatible with the Oman case. They also indicate that the initial thermal anomaly has to be sharp but not necessaryof large amplitude and that the strength of the lithosphere has to be high enough to ensure the establishment ofthin and long ophiolitic nappe without buckling. Our results also highlight the key role of shear heating in enablingobduction/subduction initiation...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of small Martian gullies has stimulated {{debate about the}} role that water plays on the Martian surface under current or recent conditions. Of critical importance in evaluating various gully hypotheses is reliable morphometric and orientation data. The former centers on such questions as whether the water (or another fluid) emanated from a surface or sub-surface source and the duration of flow. The latter ties into whether solar insolation has an important effect on formation of the initial water source and subsequent mobilization. Initial studies of gullies indicated a poleward orientation dependence, an observation which has recently been challenged. Herein we investigate the orientation of Martian gullies and the dependence of various parameters on the orientation. Whereas previous studies have been global or {{through most of the}} southern hemisphere, we focus on several specific regions. This approach offers some advantages in that regional variations are factored out, such that of lithology, ground water table depth (if any), surface thermal properties, and other parameters are {{more or less the same}} in a given region. Differences in gully attributes as a function of orientation within a region can more easily be attributable to solar insolation effects than is the case for global statistics. We use the orientation to constrain several classes of gully formation hypotheses. 1) A favored orientation toward the pole across all regions could indicate a process dominated by melting of cold trapped ice, snow, or condensed volatiles from incident sunlight during summer under current conditions. 2) Variations among all regions would be more consistent with mechanisms less strongly tied to current solar insolation, such as geothermal heating of ice. 3) Favored orientations within specific regions, but differing among regions, could indicate a preference for poleward ices and melting, with orientation being a function of age and dependent on variations in obliquity and precision. We find that the gullies fall into either categories 2 or 3, but not 1, indicating the recent melting of cold trapped condensates is unlikely the <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{promyelocytic leukemia}} (APL) is typified by the {{reciprocal}} translocation, t(15; 17) (q 22; q 21), {{leading to the}} formation of PML-RARalpha and RARalpha-PML fusion genes. We have characterized 7 cases of morphologic APL found to lack the t(15; 17) on conventional cytogenetic assessment. In 6 of 7 cases, cryptic PML-RARalpha rearrangements were identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH); whereas, in the remaining patient, APL was associated with the variant translocation, t(11; 17) (q 23; q 12 - 21), leading {{to the formation of}} PLZF-RARalpha and RARalpha-PLZF fusion genes. In each of the cases with cryptic PML-RARalpha rearrangements, PML-RARalpha transcripts were detected in the absence of RARalpha-PML, consistent with the concept that PML-RARalpha is the critical oncogenic fusion protein. In 4 of these cases with evaluable metaphase spreads, the occurrence of a nonreciprocal translocation was confirmed by FISH with <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of the PML-RARalpha fusion gene; in 3 cases with morphologically normal chromosomes 15 and 17, RARalpha was inserted into PML on 15 q, whereas in the remaining patient the PML-RARalpha fusion arose due to insertion of 15 q-derived material including PML into RARalpha on 17 q. Immunofluorescence studies were performed using antibodies raised against PML and PIC 1, a ubiquitin-homology domain protein previously identified as an interaction partner of PML. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of subtypes other than M 3, PIC 1 was localized to the nuclear membrane and colocalized with PML within discrete nuclear bodies. In APL cases with cryptic PML-RARalpha rearrangements, the characteristic microparticulate pattern of PML staining was detected with partial colocalization with PIC 1, indicative of disruption of the nuclear bodies; whereas in t(11; 17) -associated APL, PML and PIC 1 remained colocalized within discrete nuclear bodies, as observed in non-APL cases. Although deregulation of the putative growth suppressor PML and delocalization of other nuclear body constituents have been advocated to {{play a key role in}} the development of t(15; 17) -associated APL, the present study shows that disruption of PML nuclear bodies per se is not a prerequisite for the pathogenesis of APL...|$|E
40|$|The {{transamination}} reaction {{between a}} Schiff base polypyrrolic macrocycle, H 4 Ltet/oct, where tet = tetramethyl (C 38 H 36 N 8), oct = octamethyl (C 42 H 44 N 8), and [UO 2 (THF) 2 N(SiMe 3) 2] {{results in the}} <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of mono uranyl complexes [UO 2 (THF) (H 2 Ltet) ], 7, and [UO 2 (THF) (H 2 Loct) ], 8. The molecular structure of 8 was confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study which shows that the macrocycle folds to form a Pac-man shape. The reaction between 7 and [MN(SiMe 3) 22], where M = Mn, Fe, Co or Zn, results in the formation heterobimetallic complexes, [UO 2 (THF) M(THF) (Ltet) ], 9, 10, 11, and 13, respectively. The structures of 9 and 11 have been confirmed by X-ray crystallography and {{show that there is}} a direct donor bond from one oxo ligand of the uranyl dication to the transition metal, and characterisation by vibrational spectroscopy suggests that the bonding of the uranyl dication has weakened. The double deprotonation of 8 with KN(SiMe 2 R) 2, where R = Me, Ph, and subsequent salt elimination reaction with MX 2, where M = Fe, X = I and M = Zn, X = I, Cl, results {{in the formation of the}} first discrete reductively functionalised pentavalent uranyl complexes [UO(OSiMe 3) (THF) (FeI) 2 (Loct) ], 17, [UO(OSiMe 2 Ph) (THF) (FeI) 2 (Loct) ], 18, [UO(OSiMe 3) (THF) (ZnI) 2 (Loct) ], 19, and [UO(OSiMe 3) (THF) (ZnCl) 2 (Loct) ], 20, which contain a covalent Si–O bond to one oxo-group. Complexes 17 to 20 have been fully characterised and the solid state molecular structures of 17 and 19 were determined. Investigation into the mechanism of the functionalisation suggests that the intermediate complex [UO 2 (THF) (K 2 L) ] is highly oxidising and reactive and promotes the single electron transfer reaction with trimethylsilyl reagents and results in the homolytic cleavage of bonds and concurrent reduction of the uranyl ion. The solution redox properties of 8 have been measured by cyclic voltammetry, and exhibits a single electron reduction at - 1. 17 V (vs. Fc/Fc+). The reaction of 8 with one equivalent of cobaltocene results in the formation of the pentavalent uranyl complex [CoCp 2][UO 2 (THF) (H 2 Loct) ], 26. The reaction of 8 with two or three equivalents of B(C 6 F 5) 3 results in the formation of [UO 2 (H 2 Loct) B(C 6 F 5) 3], 31, and [UO 2 (H 2 Loct) (BC 6 F 53) 2], 34, respectively, which are examples of uranyl macrocyclic borane adducts. Reaction of complex 31 with an excess of PMe 3 results in the formation of the THF-free uranyl macrocyclic complex [UO 2 (H 2 Loct) ], 35...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of phospholipids with defined fatty acid and polar head composition catalysed by lipases and phospholipases was investigated. Lipases from Rhizopus arrhizus and Candida antarctica {{were used for}} the direct acylation of DL-a-glycerophosphate and L-a-glycerophosphatidylcholine, with different fatty acids. Esterification reactions can be carried out in systems with low water activity, in which the equilibrium is favoured towards synthesis, and hydrolysis is minimised. For optimisation of the processes, {{it is important to consider}} various reaction parameters, principally the water content of the media. In the acylation of glycerophosphate and glycerophosphorylcholine, fatty acid vinyl esters gave better yields (> 95 %) than free fatty acid, in the formation of lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid or lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine. Solvent free systems were chosen for both reactions, but in some cases conversions could be easily improved by the addition of a small amount of solvent, such as t -butanol. The choline polar head group of lysophosphatidylcholine was exchanged with glycerol in a reaction catalysed by a phospholipase D from Savoy cabbage, in an aqueous micellar system. Characterisation of this reaction and of the hydrolysis showed that both reactions are similar in their Ca 2 + ion dependence, kinetic parameters and pH optima. Contrary to the action of the enzyme towards phosphatidylcholine, phospholipase D does not need detergents or solvents to display optimum activity, with lysophosphatidylcholine as substrate. A combination of two phospholipases was used for the formation of lysophosphatidic acid and the analogue, 1 -acyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate, in diethyl ether-aqueous two-phase systems. Microbial phospholipase D from Streptomyces sp. was used in the transesterification of egg phosphatidylcholine with 1 -lauroyl-glycerol or 1 -lauroyl-dihydroxyacetone, to form two complex phospholipids, 1 -lauroyl-phosphatidylglycerol and 1 -lauroyl-phosphatidyldihydroxyacetone, respectively. The Km values for the alcohol acceptors were very low, 23 ± 7 and 104 ± 5 mM for 1 -lauroyl-glycerol and 1 -lauroyl-dihydroxyacetone, respectively. Phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus selectively hydrolysed the obtained products, giving the desired 1 -acyl-glycerophosphate and 1 -acyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate in stoichiometric amounts. The facile recovery of the products from the ether phases in both PL D and PL C catalysed reactions, makes this a very attractive system. Finally, the direct esterification of dihydroxyacetone and lauric acid in solvent systems at controlled water activity is described. High yields (> 90 %) were easily achieved at low water activities of 0. 06 - 0. 11. The main product of this reaction was 1 -lauroyl-dihydroxyacetone under most of the conditions tested, but the formation of the 1, 3 -dilauroyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate could easily be increased by selection of a more hydrophobic solvent, or with the use of vinyl laurate as acyl donor. Using the latter approach, <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of 1, 3 -dilauroyl-dihydroxyacetone was achieved if the reactions were carried out in hermetically closed reactors...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the worldwide mercury contamination contributed by both natural and anthropogenic sources, two different domains of aqueous mercury (II), Hg(II) complexation {{have been carried out}} using homogeneous complexing agent, Rhodamine B and heterogeneous complexing agent, Covellite (CuS). The studies of Rhodamine B was conducted using UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-Vis) where it revealed the instability of Rhodamine B-Hg(II) -Iodide complex in acidic media and it has been resolved either by extraction with benzene or stabilization in water using polyvinyalcohol (PVAl). The studies on Rhodamine B-Hg(II) -Iodide complex were further developed as a non-destructive spectrophotometric method for trace Hg(II) detection. The investigations of CuS in heterogeneous aqueous Hg(II) complexation were conducted using two analytical approach: (i) solution phase analysis i. e. atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS); (ii) solid characterization analysis i. e. powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From solution phase analysis, the trends of Hg(II) uptake observed were found to dependent on the sorption rate of Hg(II) onto CuS at acidic and alkaline pH. The relatively fast sorption rate of Hg(II) onto CuS at acidic pH can be viewed as the formation of both cubic phase mercury sulfide (Metacinnabar, β-HgS) and monoclinic phase mercuric sulfide chloride (m-Hg 3 S 2 Cl 2) from PXRD analysis. The relatively slow sorption rate of Hg(II) onto CuS at alkaline pH can be viewed by the <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of β-HgS from PXRD analysis. The formation of m-Hg 3 S 2 Cl 2 was associated with the growth of nanosize ranged needle like architecture namely nano-needle crystallite on the edges of the initial CuS hexagonal plates from FESEM-EDX analysis. The formation of β-HgS was also observed {{at the edges of the}} CuS hexagonal plates but its formation was only preferred along the { 101 } and { 100 } plane of CuS hexagonal plates from HRTEM-EDX analysis. Furthermore, the uptake of Hg(II) onto CuS at different Hg(II) concentration has been modeled using sorption isotherm models. The equilibrium data suggested that the sorption behavior of Hg(II) onto CuS obeys well to the Langmuir isotherm with the maximum sorption capacity of CuS for Hg(II), Qmax reaching 434. 78 mg Hg(II) / g of sorbent at 25 °C. Apart from the Hg(II) uptake studies, a consecutive decrease of CuS dissolution and decrease on final solution pH were also detected when initial solution pH is raised. These results showed that an in-situ re-adsorption of Cu(II) and OH- onto CuS has taken place at increasing pH in addition to the ion-exchange of Hg(II) onto CuS. The re-adsorption of Cu(II) and OH- can be viewed as the formation of Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 and its hydrate Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 (H 2 O) from PXRD analysis. Whilst, the re-adsorption of Cu(II) and OH- can be also discussed in term of the formation of Cu(OH) 2 and CuO from XPS studies. Moreover, the precipitation of Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 and Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 (H 2 O) has actually led to the growth of additional platelet crystallite in which it has been identified from FESEM-EDX analysis...|$|E
40|$|Described herein, is the {{synthesis}} and coordination chemistry of seven novel ligands L 1 - L 7. These ligands form metallosupramolecular assemblies upon coordination of {{transition metal ions}} resulting in heterodi- and hetreotrimetallic double helicates and penta- and tetranuclear cyclic helicates. Described in Chapter 2 is {{a new class of}} ditopic segmental pyridyl-thiazole(py-tz) N-donor ligands L 1 - L 3. Reaction of L 1 with ZnII ions results in the formation of a dinuclear double helicate [Zn 2 (L 1) 2] 4 +. Reaction of L 2 with either ZnII or HgII results {{in the formation of the}} L 2 -containing dinuclear double helicates [Zn 2 (L 2) 2] 4 + and [Hg 2 (L 2) 2] 4 +. However, reaction with both ZnII or HgII results in the <b>sole</b> <b>formation</b> of the heterodimetallic helicate [HgZn(L 2) 2]+. Both metal ions are 6 -coordinate but the HgII ion is coordinated by the two py-tz-py units whereas the ZnII ion is coordinated by the py-py-tz domain. The reason that these isomeric sites have different preferences for each of the metal ions is due to the position of the thiazole unit within the terdentate domains, as in the central position the thiazole unit increases the “bite angle” of the donor unit making it more suitable for the larger HgII. Conversely the py-py-tz domain has a smaller bite angle and it more suited to the smaller ZnII ion. Reaction of L 3 with ZnII, HgII and CuII results in the formation of a heterometallic trinuclear double helicate [HH-[HgCuZn(L 3) 2] 5 +. In a similar fashion to L 2, the ZnII ion coordinated by the terdentate py-py-tz domain and the HgII coordinated by the py-tz-py domain. The central bipyridine unit coordinates the tetrahedral CuII ion resulting in the first reported example of a heterotrimetallic double helicate. Described in Chapter 4 is a potentially hexadentate N-donor ligand L 4, which upon reaction with CdII results in the formation of a dinuclear double helicate [Cd 2 (L 4) 2] 4 +. In this structure the ligand partitions into two tridentate tz-py-py domains each of which coordinate a different metal ion. However, reaction of L 4 with ZnII results in the formation of a pentanuclear circular helicate [Zn 5 (L 4) 5] 10 +, with all the five zinc ions adopting a octahedral coordination geometry arising from the coordination of the two tridentate tz-py-py domains from two different ligand strands. This difference in structure is attributed to unfavourable steric interactions which prevent the formation of [Zn 2 (L 4) 2] 4 + but these unfavourable interactions are not present with the larger Cd 2 + ion. Described in Chapter 5 are the potentially pentadentate and tetradentate ligands L 5 and L 6, respectively. The ligand L 5 contains both a bidentate and tridentate binding site separated by a phenylene spacer unit. Reaction of L 5 with CuII results in the formation of a pentanuclear circular helicate [Cu 5 (L 5) 5] 10 +. Each of the CuII ions adopts a 5 -coordinate geometry formed by coordination of the bidentate domain of one ligand strand and the tridentate domain of a different ligand. As a result this gives a head-to-tail pentanuclear double helicate. Reaction of L 6 and L 4 (Chapter 4) with CuII results in the formation of a heteroleptic pentanuclear circular helicate [Cu 5 (L 4) 3 (L 6) 2] 10 +. The cyclic array consists of five copper(II) ions, coordinated by three strands of L 4 and two strands of L 6. In this species four of the CuII adopt a 5 - coordinate geometry arising from coordination of a tridentate domain from L 4 and a bidentate domain from L 6. The remaining copper ion is coordinated by two tridentate domains from L 4 resulting in an octahedral coordination geometry. Described in Chapter 6 is the potentially hexadentate N-donor ligand L 7 which comprises of two identical tridentate py-py-tz N 3 binding domains separated by a pyrene unit. Reaction of L 7 with ZnII results in the formation of a tetranuclear circular helicate [Zn 4 (L 7) 4] 8 + with all four zinc metal ions adopting a six-coordinate geometry arising from the coordination of two tridentate pypy- tz units from two different ligand strands. The formation of this lower nuclearity species (e. g. tetranuclear rather than pentanuclear) is attributed to the p-stacking between the pyrene unit and the py-py-tz domain...|$|E
