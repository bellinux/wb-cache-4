Five steps process of manufacturing {{is based on}} the literary studies and technical calculations. The multistage cold forming machine HATEBUR AKP 5 - 5 was chosen for selected option of forming technology. As raw material was used cylinder shape with diameter of 26 mm and length of 29 mm. The economic results fix the price of one component of 16 CZK for annual dose 250 000 pieces...|$|E

60|$|Although {{the river}} was free, many a sign of winter yet {{remained}} around our forest home. The islands {{in the middle of}} the stream were covered with masses of ice, many of which were piled up to a height of twenty or thirty feet. All along the banks, too, it was strewn thickly; while in the woods snow still lay in many places several feet deep. In time, however, these last evidences of the mighty power of winter gave way before the warm embraces of <b>spring.</b> <b>Bushes</b> and trees began to bud, gushing rills to flow, frogs to whistle in the swamp, and ducks to sport upon the river, while the hoarse cry of the wild-goose, the whistling wings of teal, and all the other sounds and cries of the long-absent inhabitants of the marshes, gave life and animation to the scene.|$|R

40|$|Analytical loads in leaf <b>spring</b> <b>bushing</b> {{can be used}} {{to perform}} finite element {{analysis}} on brackets that connect the leaf spring to a truck frame. Two models of leaf spring in MSC/NASTRAN and MDI/ADAMS were created to compare the bushing loads predicted by each model. Geometric non-linear capability of MSC/NASTRAN (SOL 106) was used to predict the bushing loads in MSC/NASTRAN model. The quasi-static simulation capability of MDI/ADAMS was used to predict the bushing loads in MDI/ADAMS model. The analyses simulated the standard jounce and roll tests at The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). An accurate prediction of loads in MSC/NASTRAN model provides the benefit of integration that allows us to include the leaf spring model in a full vehicle˝model to simulate full vehicle lab tests as well as proving ground durability events. Good correlation was obtained between the two models in jounce condition. More effort is underway to establish satisfactory correlation for roll condition...|$|R

60|$|In regions {{richer than}} the Upper Gambia the {{disappearance}} of man is ever followed by a <b>springing</b> of <b>bush</b> and forest so portentous that a few hands are helpless and hopeless.

The Whydah and Gaboon countries are notable specimens of once populous regions now all but deserted.|$|R

5000|$|PD1A: This {{version was}} {{introduced}} in Autumn 1946. The only difference between this and the standard PD1, was that rubber bushes sourced from Metalastic Ltd were used in place of copper <b>bushes</b> in the <b>spring</b> shackles. It seems this produced a more stable bus, notably Barton Transport had an initial tilt-test failure when they, in 1957, first re-fitted a 7 ft 6 in wide Tiger PS1/1 Chassis with an 8 ft wide double deck body, but fitting PD1A style <b>spring</b> <b>bushes</b> cured the problem from early 1947 the PD1A had supplanted the PD1 in production. This variant, like the PD1, sold generally across the UK. Barton, for instance, took PD1s in 1946 and PD1As in 1947, all with bespoke forward-entrance lowbridge bodies, by Duple. A number of PD1As had standard Leyland outline bodies, licence-built by Walter Alexander Coachbuilders. Two of these were supplied in completely knocked down (CKD) form for the Londonderry & Lough Swilly Railway Company who had them assembled in Derry. These were {{the first of many}} CKD Alexander bodies, construction of such, later, becoming a speciality. The SMT group also took Leyland-style Alexander bodies and the British Transport Commission had examples with Eastern Coach Works bodies of similar appearance to those on their standard Bristol K series double-deckers; in addition Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company had similar bodies built by its own Brislington Body Works and local private-sector coachbuilder Longwell Green Coachworks.|$|R

5|$|Limited {{by their}} need for water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines are found only near the monument's streams or <b>springs.</b> Serviceberry <b>bushes</b> and shrubs like {{mountain}} mahogany are found in places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges.

He knew that the morasses were so deep that even an active and unarmed man could scarce make his way through them and that only by <b>springing</b> from <b>bush</b> to bush.
