25|$|Initially, it was {{proposed}} to use Insitu concrete flat slabs {{in the basement}} with a composite steel frame above podium level all on a 9m x 9m grid. However, as the top five floors had been prelet to KPMG, construction needed to be accelerated and water tightness on the upper levels needed to be achieved quicker. As a result, the plan was changed and the steel frame was started at basement level. However, the basement floors and column finishes were required to be concrete. A hybrid concrete flat slab and concrete encased <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> solution was used to achieve this as it allows the steelwork to continue for the upper floors with temporary bracing in the lower levels. As the concrete floors for the basement construction catch up, the temporary bracing is removed or built in.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{researches}} {{on the behavior}} of <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> at elevated temperature have been carried out experimentally and theoretically. Most of the works were focus on the critical temperature of <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> under specified service load or the fire resistance duration of protected <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> in fire conditions. The knowledge related to the ultimate strength of unprotected <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> is limited. With the advancement of metal production and environmental concern, a new type of structural steel, Fire-resistant steel (FRS), has been developed to conquer inherent weakness of conventional steel at elevated temperature. The requirement of fire-protection used in the fire-resistant <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> can be reduced or even lifted as compared to conventional <b>steel</b> <b>columns.</b> In order to adopt the fire resistance design of steel structures into the performance-based design, the ultimate strength of <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> at different temperature levels is needed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} compression {{tests of}} cold-formed plain and dimpled <b>steel</b> <b>columns.</b> A series of compression and tensile {{tests were conducted}} on plain and dimpled steel of different geometries. For each group of geometries the source of material for both the plain and dimpled <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> was taken from a single coil. Within each group the sections were fabricated either by press-braking or cold-rolled forming. The buckling and ultimate strength of the columns was investigated. The change in strength of the dimpled columns resulting from the cold working associated with the dimpling process was also considered. This paper contains the results obtained when comparing the test strengths of short plain and dimpled <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> using a compression test. In outlining the work the test setup and testing procedure will be described. Enhancements in buckling and ultimate strengths were observed in the dimpled steel columns-caused by the cold-work of the material during the dimpling process. The {{results showed that the}} buckling and ultimate strengths of dimpled <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> were up to 33 % and 26 % greater than plain <b>steel</b> <b>columns,</b> respectively...|$|R
25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab lined with bituminous felt and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured face brick, screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected. Each {{was made up of}} four sets of steel columns and cantilevered steel tapering I-beams bolted together. The seating, made with timber slats and a steel and timber frame, was placed back-to- back facing each track. Dividing each row of seating were metal ribbed screens. Fitted to each <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and sheet steel below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there. They were essentially the same construction as the larger ones with only three bays, two of which were given over to seating. The subway system with its street ramps and stairs to both platforms was constructed with reinforced concrete.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{high-performance}} {{structural steel}} {{has been widely}} used for columns in construction practices due to its significant advantages over conventional steel. However, the same design approach with conventional <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> is still adopted {{in the design of}} high-performance <b>steel</b> <b>columns.</b> As a result, its superior properties cannot be fully considered in design. This paper conducts a test and finite element analysis on the overall stability behaviour of welded Q 460 GJ <b>steel</b> box <b>columns.</b> In the test, four <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> with different slenderness and width-to-thickness ratio were compressed under an axial compression testing machine. And finite element models were established in which material nonlinearity and residual stress distributions of test columns were included. Then, comparisons were made between test results and finite element result, it showed that finite element analysis results are agree well with the test result. It means that the test and finite element model are reliable. Then, we compared the test result with the design value calculated by current code, the result showed that Q 460 GJ <b>steel</b> box <b>columns</b> have the higher overall buckling capacity than the design value. It is necessary to update the design curves for Q 460 GJ <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> so that the overall stability capacity of Q 460 GJ box columns can be designed appropriately...|$|R
