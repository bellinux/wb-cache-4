Optimum niosomal gel formulation was evaluated in-vivo using carrageenen-induced rat paw edema test and compared to gel containing th...|$|E
30|$|The {{lignocellulose}} degrading fungi {{were isolated}} by appearance of zone on <b>carboxy</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (CMC) agar media and tannic acid (TA) media. <b>Carboxy</b> <b>methyl</b> cellulase, filter paperase, cellobiase, xylanase and laccase activity were estimated in submerged, {{as well as}} solid state fermentation using a mixture of rice and wheat straw in the ratio of 4 : 1. rice–wheat straw as substrate. The residue left after solid state fermentation was evaluated for carbon/nitrogen ratio, dry mass loss, and loss of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Selected potential isolates were further tested in pot experiment for their effect on wheat plants. The interaction among isolates was also studied.|$|R
30|$|Starch (S) was {{provided}} by Merck company, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with Mn = 72, 000 and glycerol (Mn = 92 / 10, 78 % purity) purchased from Merck company. <b>Carboxy</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>sodium</b> salt, with an average molecular weight of Mn= 295225 was purchased from Fluka company. Sodium montmorillonite (Cloisite Na+) with a cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 92.6 mequiv. / 100 g clay was supplied by Nanocor Inc. (Arlington Heights, IL). <alpha>−amylase (source from Bacillus subtilis) provided by sigma company. Reagent DNS was used for determination sugars released during degradation.|$|R
30|$|All fungal {{isolates}} were {{checked for}} their ability to produce cellulase enzyme on PDA media supplemented with 5 % <b>carboxy</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (CMC) (Lingappa and Lockwood 1962). Cellulolytic fungi was observed to exhibit a clear zone around the colony when medium was supplemented with 0.2 % congo red and counterstained with 1  M NaCl solution after incubation for 3 – 5  days. Assay of positive isolates were performed to select the isolate with highest cellulolytic activity using potato dextrose broth under similar growth conditions using standard method described in the following section.|$|R
