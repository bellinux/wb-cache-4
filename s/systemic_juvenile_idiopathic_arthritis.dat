50|$|Many {{theories}} exist {{about the}} cause of KFD. Microbial/viral or autoimmune causes have been suggested. Mycobacterium szulgai and Yersinia and Toxoplasma species have been implicated.

However, many independent studies have failed to identify the presence of these infectious agents in cases of Kikuchi lymphadenopathy. In addition, serologic tests including antibodies to a host of viruses have consistently proven noncontributory and no viral particles have been identified ultrastructurally.KFD is now proposed to be a nonspecific hyperimmune reaction to a variety of infectious, chemical, physical, and neoplastic agents. Other autoimmune conditions and manifestations such as antiphospholipid syndrome, polymyositis, <b>systemic</b> <b>juvenile</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>arthritis,</b> bilateral uveitis, arthritis and cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis have been linked to KFD.

DESCRIÇÃO DOS CASOS: Foram analisados retrospectivamente os prontuários de 462 pacientes com artrite idiopática juvenil. Destes, sete (1, 5 %) pacientes desenvolveram síndrome de ativação macrofágica; todos tinham a forma sistêmica da doença. A mediana de idade de início da artrite idiopática juvenil foi de 3 anos e 10 meses, e a mediana do tempo de duração da artrite idiopática juvenil antes da síndrome de ativação macrofágica foi de 8 anos e 4 meses. Todos os pacientes apresentaram febre, icterícia, hepatoesplenomegalia, sangramentos, pancitopenia e elevação das enzimas hepáticas e dos tempos de coagulação e bilirrubina direta. Três casos apresentaram infecções associadas e um caso desenvolveu a síndrome de ativação macrofágica 2 semanas após a introdução de sulfasalazina. Três pacientes morreram. Proliferação macrofágica e hemofagocitose foram evidenciadas em cinco. A terapêutica da síndrome de ativação macrofágica incluiu pulsoterapia com metilprednisolona em todos, ciclosporina em três, plasmaférese em dois e gamaglobulina endovenosa em dois. COMENTÁRIOS: A síndrome de ativação macrofágica é uma complicação da artrite idiopática juvenil sistêmica com alta morbidade e mortalidade.

The median age of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>arthritis</b> onset was 3 years and 10 months and the median duration of <b>juvenile</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>arthritis</b> before macrophage activation syndrome was 8 years and 4 months.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis demonstrate essential roles for histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in regulating inflammatory responses of myeloid and stromal cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and suggest that therapeutic targeting of HDACs with small molecule inhibitors might be useful in suppressing inflammation and joint destruction in RA patients. Our findings also identify two novel non-epigenetic mechanisms, namely reduction of target mRNA stability and modulation of FoxO 1 expression and activity, which are at least partly responsible for anti-inflammatory effects of HDAC inhibitors. In light of a recent clinical trial demonstrating initial clinical efficacy of ITF 2357 in patients with <b>systemic</b> onset <b>juvenile</b> <b>idiopathic</b> <b>arthritis,</b> future studies should be aimed at characterizing the specific roles of HDAC family members in cellular inflammatory activation, and verifying the suitability of either inhibiting total HDAC activity or targeting specific HDACs in therapeutic strategies in RA and other inflammatory disorders...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases, both entities involving a therapeutic challenge even though more sophisticated therapeutic options have been developed.

Despite its cost, the IVIG is well tolerated and should be considered useful in combination with other drugs as part of the JIA treatment, especially in those patients with associated threatening-life systemic complications or with high risk of infection.

Methods: HDAC mRNA expression in RA FLS was measured by quantitative PCR, and the activity of class I, IIa and IIb HDACs was assessed by enzymatic assays. The effects of pan-specific HDACi and selective HDAC 1 / 2, HDAC 3 / 6 and HDAC 8 inhibitors on RA FLS gene expression was analyzed by ELISA and customized qPCR arrays.

To develop a specific diagnostic test, we analyzed leukocyte gene expression profiles of 44 pediatric SoJIA patients, 94 pediatric patients with acute viral and bacterial infections, 38 pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 6 patients with PAPA syndrome, and 39 healthy children. Statistical group comparison and class prediction identified genes differentially expressed in SoJIA patients compared with healthy children.
