5|$|In general, for adults, doses {{are taken}} {{four times a}} day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used {{historically}} for the treatment of rheumatic fever.

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms and signs which {{vary depending on the}} individual and the duration of lead exposure.

Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.|$|E

5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, and a family history of pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{income of}} an {{individual}} with some college education was also similar to the overall mean personal income. The mean personal income for <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> some college education was $31,054, compared to $32,140 for the overall population, age 25 or older with earnings. The mean income for a high school graduate, on the other hand, was considerably below the national mean personal income estimated at $26,505.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E

5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> a bright political future. Many {{expected her to}} run in the 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , she said she would not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E
5|$|From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter used {{discretion}} {{as to who}} {{qualified as}} a rookie. In 1957, the term was first defined as <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any previous Major League season. This guideline was later amended to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the previous year. The current standard of 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (excluding time in military service or on the disabled list) before September 1 was adopted in 1971.|$|E

He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E

5|$|In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle {{group who}} {{were looking for}} <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> a proper drum kit so that the group could {{transition}} from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
5|$|On graduation, Kilburn was {{recruited}} by C.P. Snow. He {{was given a}} quick course in electronics, and was posted to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern, where he worked on radar in Group 19 under Frederic Calland Williams. The group was responsible for designing and debugging electronic circuitry. Although Williams was initially disappointed at being given <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> so little practical experience, Kilburn became a valued member of the team. On 14 August 1943, he married Irene Marsden, a shop assistant. They went on to raise a son, John, and a daughter, Anne.|$|E

The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> both a solid academic background {{and a high}} standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who {{liked the fact that}} as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist <b>someone</b> <b>with</b> poor hand function.|$|E
