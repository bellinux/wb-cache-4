25|$|From spring 1885 {{to summer}} 1886, Wood and Lovell {{traveled}} {{from town to}} town in Michigan, designing theatrical scenery. In 1886, Wood designed the Hennepin Avenue Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Wood and Lovell's other activities are not known from 1886 to 1888, but in 1888 the pair arrived in Los Angeles, California, where Wood had won a commission to remodel the Grand Opera House (now known as the Golden State Theater). The project was finished in 1890. The two men formed a partnership, Wood & Lovell, in 1891 in San Francisco. The firm added a third partner, Fuller Claflin, in 1893. Wood and Lovell focused on commissions in Chicago and New York City, while Claflin handled West Coast business. The same year, Wood & Lovell opened a branch office in Chicago, to which the two original partners removed. They kept their <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> open until 1895.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1985 the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) {{feared that}} the savings industry's risky {{investment}} practices were exposing the government's insurance funds to huge losses. It instituted a rule whereby savings associations could hold no more than 10 percent of their assets in [...] "direct investments", and were thus prohibited from taking ownership positions in certain financial entities and instruments. Lincoln had become burdened with bad debt resulting from its past aggressiveness, and by early 1986 its investment practices were being investigated and audited by the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> of the FHLBB: in particular whether it had violated these direct investment rules; Lincoln had directed accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation into commercial real estate ventures. By the end of 1986, that office of the FHLBB had found that Lincoln had $135 million in unreported losses and had surpassed the regulated direct investments limit by $600 million.|$|E

500|$|On August 24, 2009, Garrido {{visited the}} <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{and left a}} four-page essay {{containing}} his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information {{could be used to}} assist in curing other sexual predators by: [...] "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts." [...] On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his [...] "God's Desire" [...] program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as [...] "erratic" [...] and that the girls were [...] "sullen and submissive." [...] She asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.|$|E

[...] The NLRB offered to transfer him to more highly sought-after posts in other field offices over the next three years, but he declined each time. But believing that another refusal might hurt his career, he accepted a transfer to New Orleans in 1951. There he met Karin Nelson, a field examiner and labor economist from the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> who was on temporary assignment. Truesdale moved to Washington, D.C., in 1952, where he was appointed an administrative analyst for the Board. He wed Karin Nelson in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout its fifty-year {{history the}} Special Service Unit has been quietly {{involved}} in numerous high profile cases. [...] One such {{example is the}} Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description {{of one of the}} abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origination behind prison walls.|$|E

2500|$|Although Brower's {{background}} {{was in the}} wilderness preservation wing of the conservation movement, he quickly led FOE to take {{on many of the}} issues raised by the new environmentalists. [...] FOE campaigned against the Alaska pipeline, the supersonic transport airplane (SST), nuclear power, {{and the use of the}} defoliant Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. [...] After Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, FOE led the opposition to Interior secretary James G. Watt's efforts to sell and lease public lands in the West and develop land adjacent to the National Parks. [...] Brower retired as executive director of FOE on its tenth anniversary in 1979, but continued as chairman of its board of directors. [...] FOE's growing debt and tension between Washington lobbying and grassroots action led to a crisis between Brower and a majority of the board that recalled his conflict with the Sierra Club board. [...] Facing staff cuts in 1984, Brower appealed over the board directly to the membership for emergency contributions. [...] He was removed from the board for insubordination, but was reinstated when he threatened a lawsuit. [...] In 1985 the board voted to close the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> and move to Washington, D.C.. [...] A referendum of the membership supported the board majority, and Brower resigned in 1986 to work through his Earth Island Institute.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before the}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government’s Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI, in Washington) {{had already begun}} {{providing}} war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use {{on a voluntary basis}} through its Foreign Information Service (FIS, in New York) headed by playwright Robert E. Sherwood, the playwright who served as president Roosevelt’s speech writer and information advisor. Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> of the FIS via a leased General Electric’s transmitter to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). Next step was the live broadcast to Germany, which was called Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" [...] and included the pledge: [...] "Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth." [...] Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel William J. Donovan (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term [...] "The Voice of America" [...] to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Labor unions began {{organizing}} in the broadcasting {{industry in}} the early 1930s. Among the most active of the unions was the American Radio Telegraphists Association (ARTA), later part of the CWA. ARTA organized radio operators at Mackay Radio & Telegraph in early 1934. There were two units, one for [...] "point-to-point" [...] operators on land and one for operators at sea. The point-to-point operators were organized into three divisions, covering the three major employers (Mackay Radio, Globe Wireless, and RCA). In June 1935, ARTA members in the land and marine divisions at Mackay Radio decided to coordinate their bargaining so that both groups of workers might win a contract. The talks stalled after Mackay Radio threatened to declare bankruptcy, but the union pressed ahead with its demands in September. ARTA asked for recognition of the union, a written contract, the 48-hour week, and a 14.5 percent wage increase. The ARTA members at Mackay Radio held a vote and authorized a strike if no contract was forthcoming by September 23, 1935. No agreement was reached, and the strike began at 12:01a.m. on October 5, 1935. In San Francisco, Mackay's primary transmission office on the West Coast, 60 of the 62 operators walked off the job. But the strike was far less successful elsewhere. Workers in Seattle and New York City walked out {{for only a few}} hours. In Washington, New Orleans, Chicago, and West Palm Beach, workers either did not strike or walked out in such few numbers as to make the strike ineffective. The company flew in 11 replacement workers from other offices to keep the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>office</b> functioning.|$|E

He preserved the usual professional apathy,--had doubtless sent many more enigmatical and mysterious messages,--but nevertheless, when he finished, he raised his eyes inquiringly to his customer. That gentleman, who enjoyed a reputation for equal spontaneity of temper and revolver, met his gaze a little impatiently. The operator had recourse to a trick. Under the pretence of misunderstanding the message, he obliged the sender to repeat it aloud for the sake of accuracy, and even suggested a few verbal alterations, ostensibly to insure correctness, but really to extract further information. Nevertheless, the man doggedly persisted in a literal transcript of his message. The operator went to his instrument hesitatingly.|$|E
