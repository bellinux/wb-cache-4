5|$|Near Tczew, {{with about}} 7,800 men—including 2,500 cavalry and hussars, the Commonwealth's elite heavy cavalry—Koniecpolski {{tried to stop}} the Swedish army from {{reaching}} Danzig. On 7–8 August, he encountered a Swedish force consisting of 10,000 men, which included 5,000 infantry, near the swamps of Motława. The <b>Swedes</b> wanted to provoke the Poles into attacking, then destroy them with infantry fire and artillery, but Koniecpolski decided against attacking. The <b>Swedes</b> then went on the attack with cavalry, but were unable to draw the Poles within range of their fire. The Swedish attacks dealt severe damage to the Polish cavalry but did not cripple the Polish army whose morale was kept high by Koniecpolski. The battle ended when Gustavus Adolphus was again wounded and the <b>Swedes</b> retreated.|$|E

He suggests the <b>Swede</b> is taking revenge on the McGinneses for tarring-and-feathering him. He believes the <b>Swede</b> hates everybody, especially himself. The <b>Swede</b> retorts {{that he and}} Cullen are alike, but he hates Cullen more than Cullen hates himself. Lowering the gun, Cullen tells {{him that if he}} ever tries anything he will kill him. The <b>Swede</b> resigns himself and tells Cullen that he would miss him.|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, {{the allies}} {{managed to take}} {{possession}} over Jutland and the Swedish commander Philip of Sulzbach was forced into {{a long series of}} retreats. On May 19, 1659, the <b>Swedes</b> abandoned their last positions at Fredriksodde and took up positions at Funen. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, 1659 the first allied assault on Funen began with 9,000 soldiers. Against them stood 4,000 <b>Swedes,</b> considerably fewer, but consisting of battle-hardened veterans. The first attack was duly repelled. On June 26, a second attempt was made: the allies landed after heavy fire had pounded what was thought to be the Swedish positions. However, the <b>Swedes</b> had pulled back and returned unscathed with heavy fire of their own. The invaders were again thrown back. Before a third attempt could be made, a Swedish naval squadron under Owen Coxe managed to sink a large number of the invading fleet at the naval battle of Ebeltoft, and took 1,000 prisoners. In the end the allies had not succeeded to invade Funen, and a decision was taken to instead go back and attack Swedish Pomerania.|$|E

Cullen enters, armed with a pistol, demanding to know Harper's whereabouts. The <b>Swede</b> claims he doesn't know and dares Cullen to shoot him, which he doesn't.|$|R
5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III {{to negotiate with}} the <b>Swedes,</b> and the resulting peace treaty can largely be credited to him. Without any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and <b>Swedes</b> managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much to the surprise of both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish and Swedish militaries {{engaged in}} wide-ranging co-operation, {{but it was}} more focused on the {{exchange}} of information and defence planning for the Åland islands than on military exercises or materiel. The Finnish objective was to commit the <b>Swedes</b> by establishing a military-political joint venture in the Åland: if the <b>Swedes</b> would undertake to assist Finland in fortifying the islands, then an important and useful precedent might be set. The Government of Sweden was aware of the military co-operation, but carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy.|$|E

40|$|In Quebec, the <b>swede</b> midge (Contarinia nasturtii), a newly {{invasive}} pest, {{was found}} {{for the first time}} in 2003. During a two year study (2004 - 2005) I studied the seasonal development of the <b>swede</b> midge, the presence of natural enemies and tested entomopathogenic nematodes for its control. Results showed that the overwintering generation of the <b>swede</b> midge emerged during the second half of June. Based on adult captures and abundance of larvae in the field, there were three to four overlapping generations. Late transplants were more heavily attacked by the <b>swede</b> midge and broccoli and cauliflower were the most susceptible crops. No parasitoids were found in the experimental sites during either year of the study and two polyphagous coccinellid predators (Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata) were field-collected for further evaluation under laboratory conditions. Although these two coccinellid species fed on <b>swede</b> midge larvae in plastic containers, further experiments demonstrated that H. axyridis was not able to prey on <b>swede</b> midge larvae on infested broccoli plants. The susceptibility of <b>swede</b> midge larvae to three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) was also evaluated in laboratory assays. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was the only species that caused significant mortality to <b>swede</b> midge larvae and, at a concentration of 1000 IJs/larva, caused 90 - 100 % mortality in loam, sandy loam, clay and muck soil. This is the first study describing the seasonal development of the <b>swede</b> midge in Quebec. In addition, the potential use of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents against the <b>swede</b> midge is demonstrated...|$|R
5|$|Czarniecki made {{significant}} contributions fighting the Khmelnytsky Uprising, during the Russo-Polish War, and the Polish–Swedish war (The Deluge). His use of guerrilla warfare against <b>Swedes</b> is credited {{as one of the}} main reason for the eventual Polish victory in this war.|$|E

At the railway office, Cullen warns Lily against employing the <b>Swede,</b> but she reasons {{that he was}} Durant's bookkeeper for years and is essential in deciphering Durant's accounting ledgers. When the <b>Swede</b> comments on Cullen's new rifle, Cullen insinuates that the Sioux got it from the <b>Swede.</b> He turns to leave, but then hits the <b>Swede</b> {{on the head with}} the butt of the rifle.|$|R

Prior to the marriage of <b>Swede</b> and Sheryl, <b>Swede</b> had also fathered a son, John William (“Jay”) Savage, who was born on April 29, 1964. Jay was adopted by John Allen and now goes by the name, John Allen (“Jay”) Savage.|$|R
5|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{chose to}} attack Riga, the Grand Duchy's {{foremost}} trade center, in late August 1621, {{just as the}} Ottoman army was approaching Khotyn, tying-up the Polish forces there. The city, stormed several times, had to surrender a month later. Moving inland to the south the <b>Swedes</b> next entered Courland. With Riga the Commonwealth lost the most important Baltic seaport {{in the region and}} an entry to northern Livonia, the Daugava River crossing. The 1622 Truce of Mitawa gave Poland the possession of Courland and eastern Livonia, but the <b>Swedes</b> were to take over most of Livonia north of the Daugava. The Lithuanian forces were able to keep Dyneburg, but suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Wallhof.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavia, Haakon {{regularly}} {{met with}} neighbouring rulers in the border-area around Elven {{from the late}} 1240s through the 1250s. Using grand fleets as envoys, Haakon's fleet at most reportedly counted over 300 ships. Haakon sought to expand his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish province of Halland. He thus looked for alliance with the <b>Swedes,</b> as well as ties with opponents of the ruling line of monarchs of Denmark. Haakon {{made a deal with}} Swedish leader Earl Birger in 1249 about a joint Swedish-Norwegian invasion into Halland and Scania, but the agreement was eventually abandoned by the <b>Swedes</b> (see Treaty of Lödöse). Haakon claimed Halland in 1253, and finally invaded the province on his own in 1256, demanding it as compensation for the looting of Norwegian ships in Danish seas. He was however forced to renounce his claims in 1257 after a peace agreement was made with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon thereafter negotiated a marriage between his only remaining son Magnus and Ingeborg, daughter of former Danish king Eric Ploughpenny. Haakon had also reconciled with the <b>Swedes</b> when he had his son Haakon the Young marry a daughter of Earl Birger. Haakon's Nordic policies initiated the build-up to the later personal unions (called the Kalmar Union), that in the end had dire consequences for Norway as it did not have the economic and military resources to persevere and maintain Haakon's aggressive policies.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{the castle}} {{was no longer}} used as a {{defensive}} building by the <b>Swedes</b> who now ruled the Swedish Estonian Province.
