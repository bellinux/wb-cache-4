5|$|Arachnophobia is a {{specific}} phobia—it is the abnormal fear of spiders or anything reminiscent of spiders, such as webs or spider-like shapes. It {{is one of the}} most common specific phobias, and some <b>statistics</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> 50% of women and 10% of men show symptoms. It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.|$|E

5|$|Navenby was {{originally}} an agricultural village, with most people {{living off the}} land or trading goods in the local market. <b>Statistics</b> <b>show</b> <b>that,</b> in 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture, but today the majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the service industry and most commute to work away from Navenby. The village does, however, offer limited work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, building society and residential care home are based in the village, although the post office closed in January 2011.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} a family’s monthly benefit payment depends on that family's {{specific}} characteristics and financial circumstances, {{as well as}} the overall amount of program funds available for distribution. The latest <b>statistics</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> benefits average $103 each month (2003, see table below right). It is the Puerto Rico government's responsibility to establish the eligibility requirements and benefit levels for participation in the program. The benefits are revised annually every October 1 to consider the nutritional needs of Puerto Rico's impoverished population, analyze the impact of inflation in Puerto Rico, and plan the distribution of available funds accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Across London, Black and Asian {{children}} outnumber White British {{children by}} about six to four in state schools. Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4 per cent were White, 19.8 per cent were Asian, 19 per cent were Black, 10.8 per cent were Mixed and 4 per cent represented another ethnic group. In January 2005, {{a survey of}} London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed {{that there were more}} than 300 languages spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000.

5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety {{advocacy}} group, estimates U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies. The National Safety Council counts traffic and non-traffic deaths within one year of an accident while the government counts only traffic deaths occurring within 30 days of a crash. The National Safety Council's <b>statistics</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the increase in 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low gasoline prices, and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E
5|$|Today {{close to}} 150 pre-university {{educational}} institutions operate in Cluj-Napoca, including 62 kindergartens, 30 primary schools and 45 high schools. Their activity is supervised by the County Board for Education. Most schools {{are taught in}} Romanian; nonetheless, there are some Hungarian-language schools (Báthory István, Apáczai Csere János and Brassai Sámuel high schools), as well as mixed schools — e. g. George Coșbuc and Onisifor Ghibu high schools with Romanian/German classes and Romanian/Hungarian classes, respectively. <b>Statistics</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> 18,208 students {{were enrolled in the}} city's secondary school system during the 1993–94 school year, while a further 7,660 attended one of the 18 professional schools.

5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{make up a}} {{very small}} portion of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of <b>Statistics</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, <b>statistics</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> all PAP minority candidates have won regularly {{and that the only}} two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} coroner's {{necropsy}} <b>statistics</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> subarachnoid and cerebral haemorrhage were important causes of sudden {{death in the}} community. There were more sudden deaths due to cerebral haemorrhage in women than in men but {{this was due to}} the increasing frequency of this condition with age and the sexes were equally affected if standardized mortality rates were calculated. Comparison with a study of hospital necropsy <b>statistics</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the latter was a selected group, elderly patients (predominantly women) being found less frequently. Deaths due to subarachnoid haemorrhage occurred as commonly in men as in women, but were rare over the age of 60 years. This fact probably accounted for the similar epidemiology of these fatal cases in the hospital and the community...|$|R
