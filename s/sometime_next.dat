2500|$|In March 1937, Papen advised Hitler {{to proceed}} {{cautiously}} in Austria, {{and work to}} improve relations with Italy, Austria's principal ally, before taking any steps towards an Anschluss. [...] In May 1937, Papen told the Hungarian minister in Vienna to prepare for dramatic changes in Central Europe, saying that both Austria and Czechoslovakia were going to [...] "disappear" [...] in the near-future. Papen was in contact with Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador to Germany {{in the spring of}} 1937 to discuss how best Britain might co-operate in facilitating changes to Central Europe in a peaceful manner. Weinberg observed that [...] ""The National Socialist Party of Austria had always been a caricature of the German one in its internal dissensions, never [...] papered over effectively by a charismatic personality like Hitler". The Austrian Nazis were forever locked into feuds with one another, and one faction led by Leopold was feuding with Papen. In July 1937, Papen complained to Hitler that the Austrian Nazis with their feuds and half-baked plans for a putsch that were always discovered by the Austrian police were complicating his work in Vienna, which led Hitler to impose Wilhelm Keppler on the Austrian Nazi party as his special representative in an attempt to impose some order on the Austrian Nazis. Papen's differences with the Austrian Nazis were of a degree rather of kind, and in the summer and fall of 1937, Papen bullied the Austrians in his talks, pressuring them to include more Nazis in the government. In September 1937, Papen returned to Berlin when Benito Mussolini visited Germany, serving as Hitler's adviser on Italo-German talks about Austria. In November 1937, Papen told Hitler that based on his talks with Henderson and Georges Bonnet that he believed it was possible for Germany to take Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the former German colonies in Africa by working with Britain and France. However, Hitler wanted a faster timetable for border changes in Central Europe and in early 1938 was seriously considering replacing Papen with either Hermann Kriebel, the German consul in Shanghai or Albert Forster, the Gauleiter of the Free City of Danzig. On 14 December 1937, Papen met with Hitler where the latter stated that the Anschluss was going to take place <b>sometime</b> <b>next</b> year. On 8 January 1938, Papen suggested that Hitler and Schuschnigg meet soon to bring additional pressure on the Austrians to submit. In early 1938 Hitler was planning on appointing Papen the German ambassador to Spain, when the crisis in Austro-German relations broke in January 1938 when the Austrian police discovered yet another plan for a putsch by the Austrian Nazis.|$|E
