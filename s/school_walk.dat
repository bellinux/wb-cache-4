The amount was a serious one, as they found that the book could not be purchased under two guineas; but every boy subscribed to his last farthing. Some promised their pocket money for weeks in advance; others wrote home to their parents to ask for money, and in ten days the boys had the satisfaction of seeing Ripon at the commencement of <b>school</b> <b>walk</b> up to Mr. Porson's desk and present him with the handsome volume in the name of all the boys. Ripon had taken some pains in getting up an appropriate speech, and it was voted a great success.|$|E

5000|$|Bugang {{is practiced}} in two basic forms: the Shangqing <b>School</b> <b>walk</b> along the seven {{stars of the}} Big Dipper and the Zhengyi <b>School</b> <b>walk</b> through the eight trigrams {{arranged}} in the Luoshu 洛書 magic square (Andersen 1989:17-18). In both variants of the practice, each step is accompanied by three actions coordinated with {{the movements of the}} feet: the inwardly pronounced line of incantation when the priest reaches the star or trigram in question, the visualization of a journey through heaven, and shoujue 手訣 [...] "hand practices" [...] in which the thumb of the left hand represents movement in parallel to the body of the priest. Indeed, the basic patterns followed in the practice of bugang are associated with the concept of the movement through heaven of the high god Taiyi, the Great One, or the Supreme Unity, and the accompanying incantations often make it clear that as the priest performs the walk, he impersonates Taiyi. A powerful theme underlying the practice is that of world-creation and the establishment of order, frequently associated with the construction of the sacred area in the initial part of a ritual. Within the liturgy, however, the characteristic specific functions of bugang are, first, to serve as elements of the purification of the ritual area, and second, to structure the movement of the high priest (gaogong 高功), as he approaches the point of the transmission of a document to heaven, and the point of his ascent in order to deliver the document to the Most High. (Andersen 2008:239-240) The Daoist Lingbao School also performed the Yubu ritual (Robinet 1997:173-174).|$|E

5000|$|An {{advocate}} for social reform {{in his native}} country of Egypt, during {{the latter part of}} the 19th century when it was a colony under the British Empire, Amin called for the establishment of nuclear families similar to those in France, where he saw women not placed under the same patriarchy culture that subjugated Egyptian women. Amin believed that Egyptian women were denied their Quranic rights to handle their own business affairs and marry and divorce freely. He refuted polygamy saying it [...] "implied an intense contempt of women," [...] and that marriage should be a mutual agreement. He opposed the Egyptian custom of [...] "veiling" [...] the woman, saying it was the major pronunciation of woman's oppression. The niqab, Amin said, made it impossible to identify women. To him, when they walked with their niqab and long dresses, it made them more noticeable to men and more distrusted. Furthermore, he exclaimed that men in the West treated women with more dignity allowing them to go to <b>school,</b> <b>walk</b> without a veil, and speak their mind. This freedom, he insisted [...] "contributed significantly" [...] to the foundation of knowledge in the nation. He supported the idea that educated women brought forward educated children. When women were enslaved in the home, without a voice and without an education, they tended to spend their time wastefully and bring forth children that would grow to be lazy, ignorant, and mistrustful. Once educated, these women could become better mothers and wives by learning to manage their homes better. Amin gave an example of the situation. He said [...] "Our present situation resembles that of a very wealthy man who locks up his gold in a chest. This man," [...] he said [...] "unlocks his chest daily for the mere pleasure of see his chest. If he knew better, he could invest his gold and double his wealth in a short time." [...] Therefore, it was important to the Egyptian nation that women's roles should be changed. Although, he maintained his view that Egypt remain a patriarchal society, its women should remove the veil and be given a primary education. This he believed was a stepping stone to a stronger Egyptian nation that which was free of English colonialism.|$|E
