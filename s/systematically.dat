5|$|The {{commander}} was not <b>systematically</b> acquainted by Crossair {{with the}} specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century the botanical booty {{resulting}} from the era of exploration was accumulating in gardens and herbaria – and it needed to be <b>systematically</b> catalogued. This was the task of the taxonomists, the plant classifiers.|$|E
5|$|Content analysis: The {{content of}} {{interviews}} and other texts is <b>systematically</b> analysed. Often data is 'coded' {{as a part}} of the 'grounded theory' approach using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software, such as Atlas.ti, MAXQDA, NVivo, or QDA Miner.|$|E
5|$|During its lifetime, {{a nucleus}} may {{be broken down}} or destroyed, either {{in the process of}} cell {{division}} or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be <b>systematically</b> degraded.|$|E
5|$|In his 2005 book Active Liberty, Breyer {{made his}} first attempt to <b>systematically</b> lay out his views on legal theory, arguing that the {{judiciary}} should seek to resolve issues {{in a manner that}} encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the written}} {{language}} {{and more recently}} also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past. That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet <b>systematically.</b>|$|E
5|$|Medieval and Renaissance {{surgeons}} {{continued the}} practice of trepanation for head injury. In the Middle Ages, physicians further described head injury symptoms and the term concussion became more widespread. Concussion symptoms were first described <b>systematically</b> in the 16thcentury by Berengario da Carpi.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{into account}} {{all of the}} victims of persecution, the Nazis <b>systematically</b> killed an {{estimated}} six million Jews and an additional 11 million people during the war. Donald Niewyk suggests that the broadest definition, including Soviet civilian deaths, would produce a death toll of 17 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was deliberately mined after the Arabs had captured the area. Together with that major synagogue, another 57 Jewish sanctuaries were purposely and <b>systematically</b> {{destroyed by the}} Jordanians soon after their occupation of the Old City in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were <b>systematically</b> stripped, with anything movable being removed {{and sold to}} Israeli contractors, before they were pulled apart with tractors and bulldozers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of worm depending on which direction they turn when encountering a new type of intersection. The different varieties of worm can be classified <b>systematically</b> by assigning every direction a number and listing the choice made every time a new type of intersection is encountered.|$|E
5|$|There follows 'A List of British Birds, <b>systematically</b> {{arranged}} into Ordines, Genera and Species', divided as in Thomas Bewick's A History of British Birds into Land Birds and Water Birds.|$|E
5|$|They found mines {{with the}} whitish metal nuggets {{and took them}} home to Spain. Antonio de Ulloa {{returned}} to Spain and established the first mineralogy lab in Spain {{and was the first}} to <b>systematically</b> study platinum, which was in 1748.|$|E
5|$|This period {{witnessed}} many {{texts of}} Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism discussing and <b>systematically</b> compiling yoga methods and practices. Of these, Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are {{considered as a}} key work.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied {{rational}} expectations to models with Phillips curve trade-offs between inflation and output {{and found that}} monetary policy {{could not be used}} to <b>systematically</b> stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and no central bank could <b>systematically</b> use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E
5|$|Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel, {{a former}} U.S. Defense Department analyst who leads {{a group of}} cyber-terrorists <b>systematically</b> {{shutting}} down the entire U.S. infrastructure. Olyphant filmed his role within three weeks.|$|E
5|$|To find {{a maximum}} clique, one can <b>systematically</b> inspect all subsets, but {{this sort of}} brute-force search is too {{time-consuming}} to be practical for networks comprising {{more than a few}} dozen vertices.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle was {{the first}} person to study biology <b>systematically.</b> He spent two years observing and {{describing}} the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos. His data are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.|$|E
5|$|As for Edward II himself, his {{dependence}} on the Despensers grew only deeper, and their transgressions more severe. Lancaster's supporters (including Roger Mortimer, William Trussell and Robert de Holland) found themselves <b>systematically</b> accused of false charges, being imprisoned and having their lands {{taken over by the}} Despensers. Mortimer and Trussell eventually fled to Paris where they were to be joined by Edward's estranged wife Isabella who was to become Mortimer's lover.|$|E
5|$|As {{the units}} {{moved to the}} Saudi border, many were {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 Iraqi armored fighting vehicles were attacked by Harrier aircraft with Rockeye cluster bombs. Another Iraqi convoy of armored vehicles was hit by A-10s, which destroyed {{the first and last}} vehicles, before <b>systematically</b> attacking the stranded remainders. Such air raids prevented the majority of the Iraqi troops deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.|$|E
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to <b>systematically</b> destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng <b>systematically</b> developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|Betances, who had {{collected}} {{more money in}} France for the Party than the plan's potential cost, grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause. By then, some of the Party's followers stationed in France wanted Betances to be stripped of his posts and assignments. At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband <b>systematically.</b>|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's {{ideas on}} the {{concurrent}} majority are illustrated in A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It <b>systematically</b> presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Daurises, {{who seems}} to have had the largest army, {{initially}} took his army to the Hellespont. There, he <b>systematically</b> besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus and Paesus, each in a single day according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion. This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{data are}} limited, but {{reactive}} attachment disorder {{appears to be}} very uncommon. The prevalence of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little <b>systematically</b> gathered epidemiologic information on RAD. A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children {{to the age of}} 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.|$|E
5|$|Following his assassination, many {{associates}} of Elagabalus {{were killed or}} deposed, including his lover Hierocles. His religious edicts were reversed and the stone of Elagabal {{was sent back to}} Emesa. Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate. The practice of damnatio memoriae—erasing from the public record a disgraced personage formerly of note—was <b>systematically</b> applied in his case.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{transfer}} to local authority control, {{much of the}} property on the estate {{was found to be}} in poor condition. In 1971 a report by the London Borough of Haringey found that half the properties on the estate were still lacking basic facilities such as baths, internal toilets and hot water. Houses were <b>systematically</b> extended to the rear to accommodate modern bathrooms.|$|E
5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used <b>systematically,</b> {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Hennessy {{concludes that}} if the un{{dissolved}} and dissolved gas content of a tissue cannot be independently measured {{either directly or indirectly}} then the safe maximum limits relative to the ambient pressure cannot be accurately determined through decompression trials and it will not be possible to <b>systematically</b> develop a comprehensive biophysical model for gas exchange. He proposes a best fit double compartment model for dissolved gas and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data.|$|E
5|$|Homology was {{noticed by}} Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was {{explicitly}} analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 Book of Birds, where he <b>systematically</b> compared the skeletons {{of birds and}} humans. The pattern of similarity was interpreted {{as part of the}} static great chain of being through the mediaeval and early modern periods: it was not then seen as implying evolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Los Angeles, a cyborg assassin {{known as}} a Terminator arrives from 2029 and steals guns and clothes. Shortly afterward, Kyle Reese, a human soldier from 2029, arrives. He steals clothes and evades the police. The Terminator begins <b>systematically</b> killing women named Sarah Connor, whose {{addresses}} he finds in the telephone directory. He tracks the last Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The pair steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car.|$|E
5|$|Instead, he practised a {{different}} style of science: <b>systematically</b> gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.|$|E
5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function. Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews was not actually returned to them. When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being <b>systematically</b> exterminated and that this had included the transport of prisoners who had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is a {{valuable}} research tool, both in cell culture and in living organisms, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi {{may be used for}} large-scale screens that <b>systematically</b> shut down each gene in the cell, which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology, medicine and insecticides.|$|E
5|$|Relaxation techniques, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may {{be useful}} in {{relieving}} the stress that may aggravate tics, but the majority of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and biofeedback, with the exception of habit reversal) have not been <b>systematically</b> evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette's. Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that does not respond to conventional treatment, but it is regarded as an invasive, experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread.|$|E
