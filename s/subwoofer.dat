5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} <b>subwoofer</b> amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the <b>subwoofer</b> sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the <b>subwoofer).</b> A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The <b>subwoofer</b> phase control found on many <b>subwoofer</b> amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the <b>subwoofer</b> relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the <b>subwoofer</b> to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E
5|$|The <b>subwoofer</b> phase {{can still}} be changed by moving the <b>subwoofer</b> closer to or further from the {{listening}} position, however {{this may not be}} always practical.|$|E
5|$|Changing the {{relative}} {{phase of the}} <b>subwoofer</b> {{with respect to the}} woofers in other speakers may or may not help to minimize unwanted destructive acoustic interference in the frequency region covered by both <b>subwoofer</b> and main speakers. It may not help at all frequencies, and may create further problems with frequency response, but is even so generally provided as an adjustment for <b>subwoofer</b> amplifiers. Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch or a more complex continuously variable circuits.|$|E

50|$|Centering the <b>subwoofers</b> {{between the}} high end {{cabinets}} tends to minimize the timing error throughout the listening area. The effects of separated <b>subwoofers</b> are more predictable outdoors, but <b>subwoofers</b> are often placed together {{as a starting point}} for indoor venues, too.|$|R

5|$|<b>Subwoofer</b> {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most <b>subwoofer</b> drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; <b>subwoofer</b> designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in a {{loudspeaker}} enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. <b>Subwoofer</b> enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a <b>subwoofer</b> and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a <b>subwoofer</b> driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, <b>subwoofer</b> drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small <b>subwoofer</b> drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre <b>subwoofer</b> cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common <b>subwoofer</b> driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E

5|$|Tom Horral, a Boston-based acoustician, blames {{complaints}} about modern movies being too loud on <b>subwoofers.</b> He says that before <b>subwoofers</b> {{made it possible}} to have loud, relatively undistorted bass, movie sound levels were limited by the distortion in less capable systems at low frequency and high levels.|$|R
5|$|The {{use of a}} <b>subwoofer</b> augments {{the bass}} {{capability}} of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low frequency capability. A <b>subwoofer</b> does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very low frequency content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low frequency content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle {{without the help of}} a <b>subwoofer,</b> especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the <b>subwoofer</b> row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal <b>subwoofer</b> array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the <b>subwoofer.</b> However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single <b>subwoofer</b> channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>subwoofer</b> {{enclosure}} designs rely on drivers facing to {{the sides}} or to the rear {{in order to achieve}} a degree of directionality. End-fire drivers can be positioned within a single enclosure that houses more than one driver.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the <b>subwoofer</b> within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single <b>subwoofer,</b> allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer <b>subwoofer</b> enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional <b>subwoofer</b> enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the <b>subwoofer</b> enclosures greater durability.|$|E

5|$|Another early <b>subwoofer</b> {{enclosure}} {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45cm) driver to provide servo control {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The <b>subwoofer</b> was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from High Fidelity magazine.|$|E
5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for <b>subwoofer</b> drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono <b>subwoofer</b> channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E

5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo <b>subwoofer</b> design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|Professional audio subwoofers used in rock {{concerts in}} stadiums, DJ {{performances}} at dance music (e.g., EDM) and similar events must {{be capable of}} very high bass output levels, at very low frequencies, with low distortion. This {{is reflected in the}} design attention given in the 2010s to the <b>subwoofer</b> applications for sound reinforcement, public address systems, dance club systems and concert systems. Consumer applications (as in home use) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower playback levels. Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound, churches, nightclubs, and theme parks. Movie theatres certified to the THX standard for playback always include high capability subwoofers. Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high sound levels, using multiple 12-, 15-, 18- or 21-inch drivers (30cm, 40cm, 45cm, 53cm respectively). Drivers as small as 10-inch (25cm) are occasionally used, generally in horn-loaded enclosures.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise was {{the second}} Star Trek series to be {{released}} in high definition on Blu-ray following the earlier releases of Star Trek: The Next Generation, with season one delivered on March 26, 2013. The fans of the franchise were asked for feedback on potential covers for the first season release, but as there was no clear winner, a new design was created based on the feedback received. The second season was released on August 20, 2013, the third season was on January 7, 2014, and the final season on April 29, 2014. The Blu-ray releases featured both the same additional features as the DVD release, in addition to new features exclusive to these releases. In January 2017 a new 24 disc Blu-ray set of the whole series was released. This set includes the whole series in 1080p with a screen size ratio of 1.78:1 (widescreen) and with the sound in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (5 channels plus <b>subwoofer).</b> The set includes 97 episodes from its original broadcast run {{at the dawn of the}} 21st century and features like a cast reunion.
