5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} characteristic test of broiler ration pelleted that added of onggok as binder with <b>water</b> <b>spraying</b> process ABSTRACT. Pellet {{is a kind}} of solidified and mechanically compressed feed. Problem frequently rise is that pellet shape is easily damaged, brittle, and broken during production, transportation and storage processing. The purpose this study was to know the influence of onggok addition as binding agent with 5 % <b>water</b> <b>spraying</b> on the {{physical characteristic}} of pellet form ration. The data were analyzed by analyzed of variance and the significant experiment results would be examined by orthogonal contrast test. The treatments consist from the first experiment were: A 1 = basal ration + 0 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water,</b> A 2 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water,</b> A 3 = basal ration + 10 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> and A 4 = basal ration + 15 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water.</b> The best result from the first experiment would be used for the second experiment, the treatments second experiment were: R 1 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 0 % onggok, R 2 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 2 % onggok, R 3 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 4 % onggok and R 4 = basal ration + 5 % <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> + 6 % onggok. The parameters were water content, water activity, specific gravity, loose bulk density, compressed bulk density, angle of repose, modulus of fineness, average particle sizes and the durability of pellet form. The conclusion of the experiment that added of onggok as binder significant influenced of the characteristic physical pellet, i. e. : increased loose bulk density, compressed bulk density, modulus of fineness, average particle sizes, and durability of pellet, but decreased specific gravity, water content, angle of repose and water activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work was to evaluate phytotoxicity of mesotrione in poppy (Papaver somniferum). The amount of <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> (150, 300 and 450 [*]l per hectare) was compared as well. In the end, the different growth stimulators (Atonik – 0. 6 [*]l .  ha− 1, Route – 0. 8 [*]l .  ha− 1) and the adjuvants (Atplus 463 – 0. 5 % solution, Silwet 77 – 0. 1 [*]l .  ha− 1) wre tested. Degree of phytotoxicity of individual va­riants was assessed by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (parameter: maximum quantum yield of electron transport in photosystem II - QY) in 1 st to 21 st day after treatment. The results showed that the application of mesotrione caused phytotoxicity on poppy plants. The most significant phy­to­to­xi­ci­ty is evident at doses of 450 [*]l <b>spraying</b> <b>water</b> per hectare. Addition of growth stimulators and adjuvants increases the phytotoxicity (decreases the value of QY) compared to the herbicide application itself. The mesotrione reduced the weight of dry plants by 15 [*]% (150 [*]l of <b>spraying</b> <b>water),</b> 1 [*]% (300 [*]l of <b>spraying</b> <b>water)</b> and 64 [*]% (450 [*]l of <b>spraying</b> <b>water)</b> compared to control variant...|$|R

25|$|During {{the morning}} Self-Defense Force {{helicopters}} drop water four {{times on the}} spent-fuel pools of units 3 and 4. They measure radiation field of 3.75 Sv/h above Unit 3. In the afternoon it is reported that the unit 4 spent-fuel pool was filled with water {{and none of the}} fuel rods were exposed. Construction work is started to supply a working external electrical power source to all six units of Fukushima I. Starting at 7pm, police and fire water trucks attempt to <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> into the unit 3 reactor with high pressure hoses. Japanese authorities inform the IAEA that engineers are laying an external grid power line cable to unit 2. After watching the helicopter effort on TV Kazunori Hasegawa, president of Chuo Construction, calls the government and offers the use of his two truck-mounted concrete boom pumps to <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> directly into the reactors. TEPCO did not respond for three days, and then stated it would wait for the arrival of similar pumps obtained elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|After the Southeastern U.S. drought of 2007, {{the airport}} (the eighth-largest water user in the state) made changes to reduce water usage.

(The two terminals alone use 917,000 gallons or about 3.5 million liters each day on average.)

25|$|With the CP0 and CP1 designs, two {{reactors}} {{share the}} same machine and command room. With the CP2 design, each reactor has its own machine and command room. Apart from this difference, CP1 and CP2 use the same technologies, and the two types are frequently referred to as CPY. Compared to CP0 they have an additional cooling circuit between the emergency system that {{in case of an}} accident allows to <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> into the containment and the circuit which contains river water, a more flexible control system and some minor difference in the layout of the building.|$|E
25|$|Smoke {{is still}} rising from units 2 and 3, but is less visible, and is theorized to be steam {{following}} operations to <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> onto the buildings. Repair work resumes, {{after having been}} halted because of concerns over the smoke; it is felt safe because no significant changes in radiation levels have occurred. Work continues to restore electricity, and a supply cable is connected to unit 4. Injection of seawater into units 1–3 continues.

25|$|For {{reasons that}} are still unknown, the Stockholm caught fire during the night of 19 December 1938 in her {{fitting-out}} berth. Strong winds and toxic gasses generated by the fire hampered the firefighting efforts, and the firefighters were left with {{no choice but to}} <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> on the ship from the outside, hoping that it would extinguish the fire. Eventually the large amounts of water pumped on the ship caused her to lose stability and sink in her berth. Inspection of the wreck after the fire revealed that—apart from certain engine components— the ship was beyond salvage, and she had to be scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Early on 17 March, TEPCO {{requested}} {{another attempt}} by the military to put water on the reactor using a helicopter and four helicopter drops of seawater took place around 10:00 JST. The riot police used a water cannon to <b>spray</b> <b>water</b> onto {{the top of the}} reactor building and then were replaced by members of the SDF with spray vehicles. On 18 March, a crew of firemen took over the task with six fire engines each spraying 6 tons of water in 40 minutes. 30 further hyper rescue vehicles were involved in spraying operations. Spraying continued each day to 23 March because of concerns the explosion in Unit 3 may have damaged the pool (total 3,742 tonnes of water sprayed up to 22 March) with changing crews to minimise radiation exposure. Lighting in the control room was restored on 22 March after a connection was made to a new grid power supply and by 24 March it was possible to add 35 tonnes of seawater to the spent fuel pool using the cooling and purification system. On 21 March grey smoke was reported to be rising from the southeast corner of Unit 3 – where the spent fuel pool is located. Workers were evacuated from the area. TEPCO claimed no significant change in radiation levels and the smoke subsided later the same day.|$|E

One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
