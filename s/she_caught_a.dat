5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> whiff of her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At {{the end of the}} day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

He's very disciplined, he's good-looking, and all the sisters want him." [...] Sanders enjoyed the food so much, she agreed to come back and meet the woman's minister. At the second dinner, the nurse's aide told her the minister was present and Sanders thought to herself, [...] "Big deal."

60|$|The manager seemed {{looking for}} her, and <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} of relief {{in his eyes}} {{when he first saw}} her.

2500|$|Nearing her term, the Duchess of Berry still {{played a}} {{lead role in}} the [...] "little suppers" [...] of the Regent, freely indulging in strong drink. On 2 April 1719, after four days of gruesome labor, she was {{delivered}} of a baby girl. According to Saint-Simon the father was her lieutenant of the guards, Sicaire Antonin Armand Auguste Nicolas d'Aydie, the Chevalier de Rion. The princess nearly died during childbirth, shut {{up in a small}} room of her Luxembourg palace. The curé of Saint-Sulpice (Paris) church, Jean-Baptiste Languet de Gergy refused to give her the absolution or to let anyone else administer her the sacraments unless she would expel her paramour from the palace. The Regent tried in vain convincing the irate curé to attend his suffering daughter. But the [...] "illustrious sinner" [...] put an end to Languet's vigil by finally giving birth. According to Saint-Simon, the Duchess of Berry secretly married Rion a few days later hoping thereby to lessen the public scandal caused by her confinement and the refusal of the Church to administer her the sacraments. The means adopted by the princess to conceal her delivery ended in her death. Her health fatally undermined by her harrowing lying-in, she left Paris for her Château de Meudon where she gave a reception in honour of her father who did not approve of her marriage to Rion and had sent him away from Paris. She had not recovered from her horrendous childbirth and this evening reception at which <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> chill severely affected her health.|$|E
2500|$|Oswald's co-worker, Charles Givens, {{testified to}} the Commission that he last saw Oswald on the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository (TSBD) at {{approximately}} 11:55a.m.—35 minutes before the motorcade entered Dealey Plaza. The Commission report stated that Oswald was not seen again [...] "until after the shooting." [...] However, in an FBI report taken {{the day after the}} assassination, Givens said that the encounter took place at 11:30a.m. and that he later saw Oswald reading a newspaper in the first floor domino room at 11:50a.m. William Shelley, a foreman at the depository, also testified that he saw Oswald making a phone call on the first floor between 11:45 and 11:50a.m. Janitor Eddie Piper also testified that he spoke to Oswald on the first floor at 12:00p.m. Another co-worker, Bonnie Ray Williams, was eating his lunch on the sixth floor of the depository and was there until at least 12:10p.m. He said that during that time, he did not see Oswald, or anyone else, on the sixth floor and thought that he was the only person up there. However, he also said that some boxes in the southeast corner may have prevented him from seeing deep into the [...] "sniper's nest." [...] Carolyn Arnold, the secretary to the Vice President of the TSBD, informed the FBI that as she left the building to watch the motorcade, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of a man whom she believed to be Oswald standing in the first floor hallway of the building just prior to the assassination.|$|E
