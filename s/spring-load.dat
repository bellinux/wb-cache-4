50|$|The shock {{indicator}} was invented to ensure safe shipment of expensive goods {{and to hold}} the right people liable for damage. As with other inventions, it has undergone various stages of development. The earliest {{shock indicator}}s were simple mechanical devices with a <b>spring-load</b> assembly. Newer ones come integrated with {{a complex set of}} electronic circuits that detect, measure and record shocks. Many companies make these indicators and conduct active research.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spring-load</b> type shock {{indicators}} {{involve a}} simple extensible spring with a load attached to one end. Small shocks cause only temporary excursions {{of the load}} from its resting position following Hooke's law.A shock strong enough to stretch the spring beyond its elastic limit will lead to an irreversible deformation of the spring, thus providing a permanent indication that such a shock was experienced by the system.The critical acceleration at which the elastic limit is reached can be tuned by carefully choosing the material {{and shape of the}} spring, as well as the mass of the load.|$|E

50|$|Break open designs {{work best}} with rimmed {{cartridges}}, which {{can use a}} solid extractor. Rimless cartridges require a <b>spring-loaded</b> extractor, which can slide {{out of the way}} for cartridge insertion, and spring back to engage the recessed rim. While these <b>spring-loaded</b> extractors are found on even inexpensive models, the <b>spring-loaded</b> extractor is not as strong as a solid extractor, and increases the likelihood that failures to extract will occur.|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Interactive {{locomotion}} {{control over}} varied terrain. Gait, footsteps, and transitions are automatically generated, based on userspecified goals, such as direction, step length, and step duration. In the above example, a user steers the biped across uneven terrain with gaps, steps, and inclines. This paper presents a physics-based locomotion controller based on online planning. At each time-step, a planner optimizes locomotion over multiple phases of gait. Stance dynamics are modeled using a simplified <b>Spring-Load</b> Inverted (SLIP) model, while flight dynamics are modeled using projectile motion equations. Full-body control at each instant is optimized {{to match the}} instantaneous plan values, while also maintaining balance. Different types of gaits, including walking, running, and jumping, emerge automatically, as do transitions between different gaits. The controllers can traverse challenging terrain and withstand large external disturbances, while following high-level user commands at interactive rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between traditional (force scaling models) {{and the more}} recently conceived dynamic explanations of load compensation (λ model) was the departure point for the present study. By using the complex “open” motor skill of catching a ball rather than the traditional “closed” skills under “normal” (baseline) conditions and under conditions where a spring load {{was applied to the}} catching hand (thereby changing the dynamics of the skeleto-muscular system) it was hoped to provide further clarification of this issue. Traditional force scaling models, in this respect, would predict that maximal closing velocity of the grasp action, and movement time would not be significantly different between a control and a <b>spring-load</b> condition. In contrast, a dynamic system perspective would maintain that spring loading would be compensated for by a change in the rate of shift of the reciprocal command (R-command). The obtained results showed a significant difference for conditions with regard to the maximal closing velocity of the grasp action, the baseline condition being higher than the two <b>spring-load</b> conditions. Furthermore, a significant difference was found for the aperture at moment of catch, the aperture at moment of catch being smaller in the baseline condition than that under the two springload conditions. With regard to the temporal variables, no significant differences were obtained. A comprehensive overall explanation of the obtained data in terms of the force scaling models was not realisable. It may be that findings supporting such theories are task specific and that for constrained tasks such as catching a ball-different underlying organisational principles apply. The λ model, however, could explain adequately the obtained results. It was concluded that, except for the preparatory phase associated with load compensation before the onset of the movement of the ball, the spatiotemporal structure of the control pattern underlying catching remains the same (invariant) in both baseline and load conditions. Thereby, the spatiotemporal structure of the resulting movement changes {{under the influence of the}} load and thus is not the same for load and baseline condition...|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} based upon the fact that if an object is part of a highly stable {{oscillating}} system, it is possible to obtain an extremely precise measure for its mass in terms of the energy trapped in the system, rather than through a ratio between force and acceleration, provided such trapped energy can be properly measured. The subject is timely since there is great interest in Metrology on the establishment of a new electronic standard for the kilogram. Our contribution to such effort includes both the proposal of an alternative definition for mass, as well as the description of a realistic experimental system in which this new definition might actually be applied. The setup consists of an oscillating type-II superconducting loop subjected to the gravity and magnetic fields. The system is shown to be able to reach a dynamic equilibrium by trapping energy up to the point it levitates against the surrounding magnetic and gravitational fields, behaving as an extremely high- Q <b>spring-load</b> system. The proposed energy-mass equation applied to the electromechanical oscillating system eventually produces a new experimental relation between mass and the Planck constant. </p...|$|E
30|$|Impedance (dielectric) {{spectroscopy}} (IS) {{measurements were}} performed on samples using a specially designed airtight sample holder [3, 9]. Temperature controllers connected to band heaters placed externally around the cylindrical chambers are monitored by thermocouples (type K) inserted inside its metallic walls. The constructed sample holder allows controlling both the temperature (from room temperature up to T ~  200  °C) and relative humidity. Nafion samples were sandwiched with carbon cloths, to facilitate water equilibration, between stainless steel <b>spring-load</b> contact terminals, insulated from the chamber walls. Before studying the electric properties of the ionomer, several experiments were performed to ensure the correct assessment of the bulk properties of the sample under investigation. Some of the parameters checked were different electrode materials (platinum, gold, carbon cloth), different membrane thicknesses, and the short-circuited sample holder. Such series of experiments are important to separate contributions arising from the sample holder (and connection cables) and electrodes from the sample itself. In a recent report, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed {{as a function of}} time under an applied dc potential in order to verify whether electrode polarization is observed in IS data of Nafion. Such experiments revealed morphology changes under the applied potential in the same timeframe of the impedance spectroscopy measurements, further indicating that electrical data correspond to the bulk properties of Nafion samples [12].|$|E
40|$|A intolerância ao exercício físico em pacientes com Doença Pulmonar Obstrutiva Crônica (DPOC) é complexa e multifatorial. Nesse âmbito, surge a utilização do suporte ventilatório não invasivo (SVNI) como um auxílio para melhorar a {{endurance}} em portadores de DPOC. Esse benefício para um dado nível de trabalho externo pode atrasar o desenvolvimento da hiperinsuflação pulmonar dinâmica (HD), que assume um papel primordial desfavorável notadamente nos estágios mais avançados da doença. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi avaliar os efeitos do uso de um sistema BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) com níveis de pressão “invertidos” (BiPAP “invertido” - BIPAPi), em comparação ao EPAP (Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure) sobre a tolerância ao exercício (Tlim) em esteira rolante, na DPOC com HD. Um total de 16 pacientes de ambos os sexos (12 homens) com DPOC (GOLD II a IV) e estáveis, aptos a demonstrar HD no exercício com ΔCI(pico-repouso) > 150 mL, sem coronariopatia aguda ou arritmia conhecida, sem uso de oxigênio suplementar contínuo ou SpO 2 150 mL, without acute coronary {{disease or}} arrhythmia known and without using continuous supplemental oxygen or SpO 2 < 90 % at rest. They underwent pulmonary function tests, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) incremental and three tests {{at a constant}} speed and high intensity treadmill, with random sequence, one without intervention (control), another with facial mask EPAP (<b>spring-load)</b> and a one-way valve with an expiratory resistance between 5 - 10 (~ 7. 5) cmH 2 O and a device called BiPAPi (IPAP: 4 cmH 2 O and EPAP 5 - 10 (~ 7. 5) cmH 2 O). There was a minimum of 24 hours between tests. We used the program Sigma Plot 12. 0. The results were expressed as {{mean and standard deviation}} (SD). The Shapiro-Wilks test to check normality and distribution was used. Non-normal variables were log-transformed. The one-way analysis of variance (1 -way ANOVA) was used in the comparison between the two devices under control in CPET at a constant speed and significance set at α = 5 %. Twelve men (75 %) and 4 women (25 %) {{with a mean age of}} 64. 5 ± 7. 3 years. There was a reduction in walking distance and Tlim with the use of EPAP in relation to BiPAPi and control (p= 0. 001). In isotime analysis (200 s) of the two devices compared with the control, there was a reduction in tidal volume (VT) for the EPAP mode compared to BiPAPi and control (p = 0. 018). A reduction in oxygen pulse of EPAP compared to control (p= 0. 046). The results indicated that the proposed NIV less IPAP to EPAP to reduce inspiratory resistance and to avoid alveolar collapse brought no advantage in increasing Tlim on a treadmill compared to control, and the EPAP alone showed up, with pressures between 5 - 10 (~ 7. 5) cmH 2 O, proved to be deleterious...|$|E
