5|$|At the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, Daenerys Targaryen befriends one of {{the younger}} Dosh Khaleen, and when they go outside, they {{encounter}} Jorah and Daario. The two men {{want to try to}} sneak Daenerys out of Vaes Dothrak, but Daenerys knows that is impossible due to the estimated 100,000 Dothraki present in the city. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> she has a different plan.|$|E
5|$|Sasha {{has gone}} back to the forest to raise her three kits, Hawk, Moth, and Tadpole. While hunting for her kits, she is caught by a ShadowClan patrol. Afraid that they will take her kits, she lies and says they died from the cold. Afterwards, she lets her kits play outside, but when they go back in, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> about Ken.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{celebrate}} Scully's birthday. They are {{approached by}} a woman named Sharon Graffia, who claims to be Max's sister; <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> that Max planned to deliver something to Mulder, but that his flight to Washington has crashed. The agents head to the crash site in Northville, New York, and attend an NTSB meeting where Flight 549's final transmissions are shown. Mulder theorizes that the plane was forced down by aliens attempting to abduct Max; the NTSB team, led by chief investigator Mike Millar (Joe Spano), dismisses his claims.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll excuse an old sailor, sir; but I think that's {{more than}} mortal man can do. There's no {{hour of the}} day but what she's {{teaching}} <b>them</b> something. <b>She's</b> <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> Bible stories now, I'll warrant, if you could hear her." ...|$|R
60|$|Joan {{spent most}} of that day in sitting beside Kells. The whole day seemed only an hour. Sometimes she would look down the canon trail, half expecting to see {{horsemen}} riding up. If any of Kells's comrades happened to come, what could <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them?</b> They would {{be as bad as}} he, without that one trait which had kept him human for a day. Joan pondered upon this. It would never do to let them suspect she had shot Kells. So, carefully cleaning the gun, she reloaded it. If any men came, <b>she</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> that Bill had done the shooting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That she will, with nice {{histories}} {{of you and}} me and Annette. And <b>she</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> at Worthbourne till old Sir Antony disinherits Percy. No more than he deserves!' ...|$|R
5|$|In the present, Detective Munch {{does not}} believe Byers' story, but it is soon corroborated by Mulder. After the Lone Gunmen are released, they {{encounter}} Susanne after she has failed to get the press to believe her story; <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> to reveal the truth to {{as many people as}} possible. Susanne is then captured by X, who leers at the Lone Gunmen as he departs with her. Later, the three of them meet Mulder in the convention center and explain what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd Irving and his friend, Genis Sage {{accompany}} the chosen, Colette Brunel and her guardians, Raine Sage and Kratos Aurion on her journey of world regeneration. The {{purpose of the}} journey is to replenish Sylvarant with mana, a necessary energy to their survival. The path of the journey consists of five temples which must be unsealed by Colette. On their journey, they meet Sheena Fujibayashi who comes from Tethe'alla, a world parallel to Sylvarant. <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> about how the two worlds vie for each other's mana through the journey of regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{guilty about}} her {{deception}} and concerned for the Flanders' safety, Marge goes {{to check on}} them at their new house. There, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> {{the truth about the}} murders, but they are not annoyed. Ned and Maude are pleased {{to be a part of}} Springfield's history, and refuse Marge's offer of returning the deposit. Unfortunately, the house is destroyed seconds later when Li'l Bandit and Wiggum's police car crash through the house. Marge returns Flanders' down payment. Hutz, annoyed at the damage costs and especially by the return of the money, fires Marge. At the end of the episode, Homer takes Marge to the government unemployment office to collect a welfare check.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Neither--except to {{wish them}} farther off. She was afraid {{all the while}} they'd spill dishes on her gown. <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>'em</b> this, poor chicks--and it completes their abasement. When they had grilled long enough, she says: [...] "And so you would have fleshed your maiden swords for me--for me?" [...] Faith, {{they would have been}} at it again if she'd egged 'em on! but their swords--oh, prettily they said it!---had been drawn for her once or twice already.|$|R
60|$|Gently <b>she</b> answered, <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> her errand, beseeching {{them to let}} her pass ere {{the cold}} wind blighted her frail blossoms. Then they flung wide the doors, and she passed in.|$|R
50|$|As {{they arrive}} Cassie <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> {{that they are}} there {{so that she can}} learn which one of them should inherit the bulk of her fortune. <b>She</b> also <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> that <b>she</b> keeps of all her money at the house.|$|R
5|$|Later that night, Daenerys {{stands before}} the {{gathered}} khals {{in the temple}} to hear her fate. There, she recalls her pregnancy ritual in this temple and her husband's vow to conquer Westeros. She accuses the khals of being unsuited to leading the Dothraki due to their lack of ambition, and says she will lead them. When Khal Moro and the other khals threaten to gang-rape her instead of serving her, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> they will die instead. She tips two braziers onto the straw floor, quickly setting the entire temple on fire and killing the khals, who have been barred inside by the younger Dosh Khaleen. A Dothraki crowd of thousands witnesses Daenerys emerge from the burning temple, naked but unburned. Amazed, they, Jorah and Daario bow down to her.|$|E
5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} {{the only person in the}} room when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris â€” who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E
5|$|Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> {{both she}} will not kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides {{she wants to be}} remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.|$|E
60|$|And with {{a little}} flush of {{pleasure}} and a smile, Mary answered that <b>she</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> all he was very grateful for their sympathy, but didn't feel strong enough to see them.|$|R
6000|$|At last, {{their mother}} {{proposed}} {{that they should}} come and sit down by her, and <b>she</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> something more about the air. [...] "How should you like that, Rollo?" [...] said she.|$|R
60|$|Again she commanded, she insisted, <b>she</b> raved, <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> that if {{they let}} the Prince's army be {{destroyed}} those of M. de Turenne would assuredly come in and sack the city for its rebellion.|$|R

They return to New Orleans to find Charlotte, who is the princess of the Mardi Gras Parade, but only until midnight. Naveen tells Ray he loves Tiana {{and is willing to}} give up his dreams for her, but before he can tell her, he is {{captured}} by the demons and brought to Facilier.|$|E
25|$|Briony's apologies are not accepted. Robbie, enraged at her presence, nearly hurts her, but Cecilia calms him down, and {{the couple}} instead demands that Briony confess her lie in writing and have the legal records rectified. Briony {{promises}} to do so. When <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> the real assailant was Paul {{and that he was}} just married to Lola, Cecilia is disappointed: Paul is now unlikely to be punished, being immune to Lola's testimony as his wife, and with Briony's having become an unreliable witness.|$|E
50|$|Carol {{becomes a}} victim of rape {{at the hands of}} three intruders who are let into the club under mysterious circumstances. Due to her history of {{psychological}} problems, the police have difficulty believing that what <b>she's</b> <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> is the truth. She makes a friend in Lieutenant Sharpe (Peter Coyote), a detective who claims to have been sent in to investigate the break-in and who seems to believe her story. Sharpe is later revealed to be an impostor who was previously imprisoned because of Carol's uncle Fletcher.|$|R
60|$|And {{when he woke}} <b>she</b> was <b>telling</b> the {{children}} a story. And what story did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them?</b> One story <b>she</b> told them, which begins every Christmas Eve, and yet never ends at all for ever and ever; and, as she went on, {{the children}} took their thumbs out of their mouths and listened quite seriously; but not sadly at all; for she never told them anything sad; and Tom listened too, and never grew tired of listening. And he listened so long that he fell fast asleep again, and, when he woke, the lady was nursing him still.|$|R
60|$|Also she {{saw many}} wonders and learned many secrets of that vast, spiritual {{universe}} into which {{this world of}} ours pours itself day by day. But if she remembers anything of these <b>she</b> cannot <b>tell</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the command}} center of the Galeos, Dauragon {{explains}} {{that he plans to}} provide unlimited energy to those who will follow him and destroy those who will not. The trio attack and kill him, releasing Dominique from the computer.

She leads them to the back half of the ship, and sacrifices herself to save Sion and Dominique. The front half of the ship rams and destroys the satellite, with the back half returning safely to Earth.|$|E

Yasmini reveals further details of the Sisterhood of True Dreamers, telling them of a terrible dream kept from the Czar himself. <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> that if Athelstane and Cassandra King die, then somehow, the King-Emperor and his heir will die. There will be no union with France, and in time, the Empire will be torn asunder by a massive world war and separatist movements. Then, around a hundred years from the present, another {{asteroid}} impact will occur, leaving only the rats surviving.|$|E
6000|$|How--when could <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them?</b> Who could {{approach}} {{them with the}} disclosure of their own illegitimacy before their father and mother had been dead a week? Who could speak the dreadful words, while the first tears were wet on their cheeks, while the first pang of separation was at its keenest in their hearts, while {{the memory of the}} funeral was not a day old yet? Not their last friend left; not the faithful woman whose heart bled for them. No! silence for the present time, at all risks--merciful silence, for many days to come! ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, at {{the gate}} she shared her wrath with Jenny's mother. What call had they to {{want to make the}} poor {{children}} to be like parsons at church? Jem shouldn't be there no more, <b>she</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Mount coughed a {{peculiar}} cough that her mistresses well knew to signify that <b>she</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> something {{they would not}} like to hear, if they chose to ask her, and it was the younger who put the question--- ...|$|R
25|$|Odrade next calls {{a meeting}} of all the Bene Gesserit, announcing her plan to attack the Honored Matres. <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> that this attack will be led by Teg. She also announces {{candidates}} to succeed her as Mother Superior; she will share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana before she leaves. Odrade then goes to meet the Great Honored Matre. Under cover of Odrade's diplomacy, the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg attack Gammu with tremendous force. Teg uses his secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system. Survivors of the attack flee to Junction, and Teg follows them there and carries all with him. Victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In {{the midst of this}} battle, the Jews (including Rebecca with her precious memories) take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} funeral, Octavianus meets Pansa (Jack Angel), {{formerly}} Caesar's most trusted spy. With Pansa's help, Octavianus sneaks into the Senate where Maecenas (Larry Cedar), Antonius' secretary, proposes {{that rather than}} immediately executing Vipsanius, they hold a gladiatorial tournament across the Empire, the winner of which will perform the execution. Antonius approves of the idea, but dictates that Vipsania (Moira Quirk), Vipsanius' wife, be publicly executed immediately. Agrippa arrives back in Rome, and Octavianus explains the situation.

Meanwhile, Octavianus will remain in Rome and investigate the murder.|$|E
