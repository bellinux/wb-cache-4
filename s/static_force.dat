5|$|The Serbian State Guard (or SDS) was {{established}} by Nedić {{on the basis of}} an understanding he reached with the German Military Commander in Serbia, General der Artillerie (Lieutenant General) Paul Bader, and the Higher SS and Police Leader in Serbia, SS-Obergruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei (SS-General of Police) August Meyszner, regarding the maintenance of law and order in the occupied territory. It was formed on 10 February 1942 from two former Yugoslav gendarmerie regiments, Drinski and Dunavski, but the law formally creating the force was not issued by Nedić until 2 March 1942. The SDS took over the role and functions of the gendarmerie, and was initially commanded by Stevan Radovanović. Sources vary on the strength of the SDS. The Germans initially set a maximum strength of 17,000, but the SDS quickly reached a strength of 18,500. Initially the SDS included four groups, the Rural Police (poljska straža), the Municipal Police (gradska straža), the Frontier (or Border) Guard (granična straža), and the Village Guard (seljačka straža). The SDS was equipped using arms and ammunition captured by the Germans from throughout Europe, and was organised as a largely <b>static</b> <b>force</b> split across five regions (oblasts): Belgrade, Kraljevo, Niš, Valjevo and Zaječar, with one battalion per region. Each region was further divided into three districts (okrugs), each of which included one or more SDS companies. A branch of the SDS was created specifically for service in the Banat, and was known as the Banat State Guard. It was formed from the region's German minority (or Volksdeutsche), and in March 1942 numbered less than one thousand.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the difference in}} behavior between hollow-core fiber reinforced polymer-concrete-steel (HC-FCS) columns and conventional reinforced concrete (RC) columns under vehicle collision in terms of dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>forces.</b> The HC-FCS column consisted of an outer FRP tube, an inner steel tube, and a concrete shell sandwiched between the two tubes. The steel tube was hollow inside and embedded into the concrete footing with a length of 1. 5 times the tube diameter while the FRP tube stopped {{at the top of}} footing. The RC column had a solid cross-section. The study was conducted through extensive finite element impact analyses using LS-DYNA software. Nine parameters were studied including the concrete material model, unconfined concrete compressive strength, material strain rate, column height-to-diameter ratio, column diameter, column top boundary condition, axial load level, vehicle velocity, and vehicle mass. Generally, the HC-FCS columns had lower dynamic <b>forces</b> and higher <b>static</b> <b>forces</b> than the RC columns when changing the values of the different parameters. During vehicle collision with either the RC or the HC-FCS columns, the imposed dynamic forces and their equivalent <b>static</b> <b>forces</b> were affected mainly by the vehicle velocity and vehicle mass...|$|R

Here, we focus on the microfluidic forces generated by cilia-driven fluid flow and heart-driven hemodynamics, as well as on the signaling pathways involved in flow sensing.

Since the ice will bend slightly when any vehicle capable of travelling on ice-covered water, it follows that travelling at some critical speed may impose sufficient flexing of the ice sheet to cause resonance, and this may result in positive feedback effectively amplifying the oscillation within the body of water supporting the ice beneath the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Static</b> <b>force</b> {{fields are}} fields, {{such as a}} simple electric, {{magnetic}} or gravitational fields, that exist without excitations. The most common approximation method that physicists use for scattering calculations {{can be interpreted as}} static forces arising from the interactions between two bodies mediated by virtual particles, particles that exist for only a short time determined by the uncertainty principle. The virtual particles, also known as force carriers, are bosons, with different bosons associated with each force.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{position}} of a target stimulus is misperceived owing to ongoing motion. Although <b>static</b> <b>forces</b> (fixation, landmarks) affect perceived position, motion remains the overwhelming force driving estimates of position. Motion endpoint estimates biased in the direction of motion are perceptual signatures of motion's dominant role in localization. We sought conditions in which <b>static</b> <b>forces</b> exert the predominant influence over perceived position: stimulus displays for which target position is perceived backward relative to motion. We used a target that moved diagonally with constant speed, abruptly turned 90 ° and continued at constant speed; observers localized the discontinuity. This yielded a previously undescribed effect, “turn-point shift,” the tendency of observers to estimate the position of orthogonal direction change backward relative to subsequent motion direction. Display and mislocalization direction differ from past studies. <b>Static</b> <b>forces</b> (foveal attraction, repulsion by subsequently occupied spatial positions) were found to be responsible. Delayed turn-point estimates, reconstructed from probing the entire trajectory, shifted the horizontal coordinate forward in the direction of motion. This implies more than one percept of turn-point position. As various estimates of turn-point position arise at different times, under different task demands, the perceptual system does not necessarily resolve conflicts between them...|$|R

50|$|In {{classical}} physics, {{momentum is}} the product of mass and velocity and is a vector quantity, but in fluid mechanics it is treated as a longitudinal quantity (i.e. one dimension) evaluated in the direction of flow. Additionally, it is evaluated as momentum per unit time, corresponding to the product of mass flow rate and velocity, and therefore it has units of force. The momentum forces considered in open channel flow are dynamic force - dependent of depth and flow rate - and <b>static</b> <b>force</b> - dependent of depth - both affected by gravity.|$|E
5000|$|Impedance control doesn't simply {{regulate}} {{force or}} {{position of a}} mechanism. Instead it regulates the relationship between force {{on the one hand}} and position, velocity and acceleration on the other hand, i.e. the impedance of the mechanism. It requires a position (velocity or acceleration) as input and has a resulting force as output. The inverse of impedance is admittance. It imposes position.So actually the controller imposes a spring-mass-damper behavior on the mechanism by maintaining a dynamic relationship between force and position, velocity and acceleration: F = Ma + Cv + Kx + friction + <b>static</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of piezoelectric sensors {{is that they}} cannot be used for truly static measurements. A <b>static</b> <b>force</b> results in a fixed amount of charge on the piezoelectric material. In conventional readout electronics, imperfect insulating materials and reduction in internal sensor resistance causes a constant loss of electrons and yields a decreasing signal. Elevated temperatures cause an additional drop in internal resistance and sensitivity. The main effect on the piezoelectric effect is that with increasing pressure loads and temperature, the sensitivity reduces due to twin formation. While quartz sensors must be cooled during measurements at temperatures above 300 °C, special types of crystals like GaPO4 gallium phosphate show no twin formation up to the melting point of the material itself.|$|E

As a <b>static</b> <b>force,</b> it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force creating torsional vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitation [...] Structure-borne noise can also be generated by torque ripple when rotor shaft line vibrations propagate to the frame [...]|$|E
50|$|As of 2008, {{wind power}} {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} power sources in the world. The bulk of this growth has been in the form of conventional, three-bladed, horizontal-axis wind turbines, with vertical axis wind turbines accounting for a small remainder. Converting the kinetic energy of the wind into useful electricity requires converting the linear horizontal motion of wind into the rotational motion of a shaft in an electrical generator. In every case this requires some method of maintaining a <b>static</b> <b>force</b> against the motion of the wind, to keep the wind-collection apparatus from simply blowing away. Conventional wind turbines accomplish this by mounting rotors rigidly on towers, relatively close to the ground. This arrangement works reliably, but is relatively expensive, requires large amounts of structural material, and cannot tap the much stronger winds often present at higher altitudes.|$|E
50|$|A taut wire {{perimeter}} security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually {{mounted on a}} fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick {{that there is no}} need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, <b>static</b> <b>force</b> transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.|$|E
