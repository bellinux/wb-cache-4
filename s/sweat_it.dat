Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E

The high-fat (averaging about 52grams of fat, 5grams trans fats) and high-salt content are less than ideal for sedentary situations. The HDR and TOTM account for this nutritional need.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s, Hepburn had {{developed}} a noticeable tremor, giving her a permanently shaking head. She did not work for two years, saying in a television interview, [...] "I've had my day—let the kids scramble and <b>sweat</b> <b>it</b> out." [...] During this period she saw the Broadway production of On Golden Pond, and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping with the difficulties of old age. Jane Fonda had purchased the screen rights for her father, actor Henry Fonda, and Hepburn sought to play opposite him {{in the role of}} quirky Ethel Thayer. On Golden Pond was a success, the second-highest grossing film of 1981. It demonstrated how energetic the 74-year-old Hepburn was, as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a lively singing performance. The movie won her a second BAFTA and a record fourth Academy Award. Homer Dickens, in his book on Hepburn, notes that it was widely considered a sentimental win, [...] "a tribute to her enduring career." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening {{episode of the}} serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is [...] "probably {{as good as it}} [...] The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy [...] and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." [...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of <b>sweat),</b> <b>it</b> looks like people are doing something you would never have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun." ...|$|E

Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said the [...] "double feature continued the recent hot streak" [...] of episodes, and Michael Slezak of TVLine highlighted this episode's [...] "script that winkingly acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee original players in favor of new and more-hyped flavors". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it showcased writer and director Ian Brennan's [...] "strengths of acid comedy and sad stories of small-town teenagers who'll never get anything but to <b>sweat</b> <b>it</b> out on the streets of a runaway American dream"; he gave [...] "Props" [...] a [...] "B" [...] grade. Rae Votta of Billboard said, [...] "It felt organically Glee, zany but with heart." ...|$|E

A 12-inch record of the song was released on November 18, 2004. [...] "Tilt Ya Head Back" [...] was well received by most music critics, Jason Birchmeier from AllMusic picked this song as a standout from the album and wrote that the song could be a hit [...] "whether on radio" [...] or [...] "on MTV." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly praised the duo's vocal on the song, while Rolling Stone editor Rob Sheffield named it [...] "a completely pop duet." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard praised the [...] "Superfly" [...] sample used in the track and its musical style.

2500|$|Within {{their first}} year at Columbia, the Stooges became very popular. Realizing this, Columbia Pictures {{president}} Harry Cohn used the Stooges as leverage, as the demand for their films {{was so great that}} he eventually refused to supply exhibitors with the trio's shorts unless they also agreed to book some of the studio's mediocre B movies. Cohn also saw to it that the Stooges remained ignorant of their popularity. During their 23 years at Columbia, the Stooges were never completely aware of their amazing drawing power at the box office. Their contracts with the studio included an open option that had to be renewed yearly, and Cohn would tell the boys that the short subjects were in decline, which was not a complete fabrication (Cohn's yearly mantra was [...] "the market for comedy shorts is dying out, fellas"). The Stooges thought that their days were numbered and would cruelly <b>sweat</b> <b>it</b> out each year, with Cohn renewing their contract at the eleventh hour. This deception kept the insecure Stooges unaware of their true value, resulting in them having second thoughts about asking for a better contract without a yearly option. Cohn's scare tactics worked for all 23 years that the Stooges were at Columbia; the team never once asked for a salary increasenor were they ever given one. It was not until after they stopped making the shorts in December 1957 that Moe learned of Cohn's underhanded tactics, what a valuable commodity the Stooges had been for the studio and how many millions more the act could have earned. Columbia offered theater owners an entire program of two-reel comedies (15-25 titles annually) featuring such stars as Buster Keaton, Andy Clyde, Charley Chase and Hugh Herbert, but the Stooge shorts were the most popular of all.|$|E
