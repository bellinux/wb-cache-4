Building Regulations in Northern Ireland require a Grade D, LD2 system to be installed, with smoke alarms fitted in the escape routes and the main living room and a heat alarm in the kitchen; this standard also requires all detectors to have a mains supply and a battery back up.|$|E

25|$|The written work of Somananda {{contains}} more than philosophical <b>system</b> <b>building.</b> It also contains {{an account of the}} rival schools of philosophy and a series of refutations based on logic. For example, Somananda disagrees with the gross realism of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, the subtle realism of Samkhya, and the idealism of Vedanta, or that of Vijnanavada of Buddhism. In his view, the universe is an appearance, but not of Maya (illusion) but of the free will of Shiva. In reality the universe is Shiva himself. Instead of postulating an principle of beginning-less ignorance avidya like Advaita Vedanta, he points out that it is though the free-will of Shiva, Svatantriya, that ignorance appears. Ignorance is not an ontological reality but an epistemological phenomenon.|$|E

[...] "Anti-partyism became an article of political faith." [...] Without a two-party <b>system</b> <b>building</b> alternative sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, [...] "negative, carping and petty." [...] The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M.

This is a report of the theory of the way of existence of <b>building</b> <b>systems.</b> We can recognise the species of <b>building</b> <b>system</b> as same as the biological world, when we survey the styles of <b>building</b> <b>systems.</b> The species of <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> exist as a community as a botanical community.

2500|$|When Leibniz died, his {{reputation}} was in decline. He was remembered {{for only one}} book, the Théodicée, whose supposed central argument Voltaire lampooned in his popular book Candide, which concludes with the character Candide saying, [...] "Non liquet" [...] (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of [...] "not proven". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed {{it to be an}} accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his Candide bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, Christian Wolff, whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced David Hume who read his Théodicée and used some of his ideas. In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and <b>system</b> <b>building</b> of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized.|$|E

40|$|Supply Chain Management (SCM) is an {{important}} part of the production process in <b>systems</b> <b>building.</b> The loosely-coupled construction supply chains created by the involvement of many interdependent sub-contractors and suppliers destabilize the production process. Purchasing strategies, used by many construction companies, for controlling the supply chain may not be applicable to small and medium-sized (SME) <b>systems</b> <b>building</b> companies, because the relationship between the buyer and the suppliers is characterized by long-term supply chain relationships rather than short-term project incentives. In order to ensure the reliability of deliveries and product quality, supply strategy in the form of SCM is suggested. The position taken is that <b>systems</b> <b>building</b> SMEs could integrate their supply chain with their customers and suppliers, in order to reduce variation in deliveries. A re-analysis of multiple case study and previously published qualitative data has been performed with SCM characteristics as the unit of analysis. Implications are that <b>systems</b> <b>building</b> SMEs need to have a long-term integration perspective when using SCM. Furthermore, SMEs have limited capacity and capabilities so differences in the maturity of their ‘systems building thinking’ might hinder effective SCM. However, the results do not conclusively prove or disprove the idea that SCM can replace project-based purchasing as the supply strategy for <b>systems</b> <b>building</b> SMEs.
