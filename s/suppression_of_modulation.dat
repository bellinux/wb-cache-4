Although current therapeutic strategies aiming at reduction of {{blood pressure and}} proteinuria often slow down deterioration of renal function, still many patients progress to end-stage renal disease. The development of novel pharmacological approaches for treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is therefore instrumental. Here we review the renoprotective potential of vitamin D and its analogues. In CKD patients, vitamin D deficiency is common and progression of CKD is associated with low (active) vitamin D levels. Moreover, in animal models of CKD, treatment with vitamin D (analogues) alone or in combination with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade reduces proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

Although the role of Akt in the <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> apoptosis is well elucidated, a potential function of Akt in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance is less intensively documented. In this study, we describe the construction of a novel form of constitutively active Akt 1, which relies on the deletion of its pleckstrin homology domain and the insertion of a C-terminal farnesylation sequence. Stable cell lines were generated with MCF 10 A mammary epithelial cells and A 549 human NSCLC cells expressing constitutively active Akt 1. Enigneered MCF 10 A cells were rendered resistant towards apoptosis resulting from loss of cellular substrate attachment (anoikis). We investigated the chemosensitivity of A 549 cells expressing farnesylated Akt vs control cells. A profoundly decreased sensitivity towards Mitoxantrone and cisplatin was observed in cells expressing farnesylated Akt. No significant difference in sensitivity however was observed upon treatment with cell cycle specific chemotherapeutic agents like paclitaxel.

Cytokines capable of inducing MVEC apoptosis in vitro are up-regulated in both TTP and HIV infection. However, the concentrations of these cytokines required to elicit EC apoptosis in vitro are 2 - to 3 -log–fold greater than present in patient plasmas. We report that clinically relevant levels of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and interferon (IFN) –γ act in synergy to induce apoptosis in dermal MVECs, but {{have no effect on}} large-vessel ECs or pulmonary MVECs. This reflects the tissue distribution of TTP lesions in vivo. Sensitivity to TTP plasma or TRAIL plus IFN-γ is paralleled by enhanced ubiquitination of the caspase- 8 regulator cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), targeting it for proteasome degradation. c-FLIP silencing with anti-FLIP short interfering RNA (siRNA) in pulmonary MVECs rendered them susceptible to TTP plasma– and cytokine-mediated apoptosis, while up-regulation of c-FLIP by gene transfer partially protected dermal MVECs from such injury. TTP plasma–mediated apoptosis appears to involve cytokine-induced acceleration of c-FLIP degradation, sensitizing cells to TRAIL-mediated caspase- 8 activation and cell death. <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> TRAIL or <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> immunoproteasome activity may have therapeutic relevance in TTP...|$|R

In this work, {{the detection of}} cholesterol is reported {{for the first time}} noninvasively in human calf adipose tissue by 13 C MRS at 7 T, with the J-refocused 1 H PRESS localized DEPT sequence combined with broadband decoupling. Subjects and Methods: A J-refocused 1 H PRESS localized DEPT sequence was shown in Fig. 1. A 90 o RF pulse was inserted {{in the middle of the}} double echo PRESS localization part, which reverses the direction of J-coupling evolution at this point. While J-refocused 1 H PRESS substitutes the first 90 o pulse of a conventional DEPT experiment, the residual part of the DEPT sequence remains unchanged and was implemented subsequently. The effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> J-modulation was investigated by comparing glutamate spectra obtained with and without J-refocusing pulse at different TE times. To detect lipids in the calf adipose tissue, the sequence was applied on a 7 T Philips Achiena MRI system using a quadrature dual-tuned 13 C/ 1 H partial volume extremity coil. Results: As demonstrated from the glutamate phantom, an effective <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> J <b>modulation</b> by the J-refocusing pulse is achieved when TE is less than 80 ms as shown in Fig. 2.

L. (2008). “Effects of low-frequency biasing on spontaneous otoacoustic emissions: Amplitude modulation,” J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123, 887 – 898]. In addition to amplitude modulation, the bias tone produced an upward {{shift of the}} SOAE frequency and a frequency modulation. These frequency effects usually occurred prior to significant modifications of SOAE amplitudes and were dependent on the relative strength of the bias tone and a particular SOAE. The overall SOAE frequency shifts were usually less than 2 %. A quasistatic modulation pattern showed that biasing in either positive or negative pressure direction increased SOAE frequency. The instantaneous SOAE frequency revealed a “W-shaped” modulation pattern within one biasing cycle. The SOAE frequency was maximal at the biasing extremes and minimized at the zero crossings of the bias tone. The temporal <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> SOAE frequency occurred with a short delay.

We studied 1) if activation of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex via subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) caused a <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> EMG and 2) how the responses to stimulation of the motor cortex via TMS and cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS) were modulated across the locomotor cycle. TMS at intensities subthreshold for activation of the corticospinal tract elicited <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> EMG for approximately one-half of the subjects and muscles during cycling, and in matched static contractions in vastus lateralis. There was also significant modulation in the size of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS across the locomotor cycle (P 0. 86; P < 0. 05). When MEP and CMEP amplitudes were normalized to background EMG, they were relatively larger prior to the main EMG burst and smaller when background EMG was maximum. Since the pattern <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> normalized MEP and CMEP responses was similar, the data suggest that phase-dependent <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> corticospinal responses during cycling in humans is driven mainly by spinal mechanisms. However, there were subtle differences in the degree to which normalized MEP and CMEP responses were facilitated prior to EMG burst, which might reflect small increases in cortical excitability prior to maximum muscle activation.
