In this study, 200 monotonic tests of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with single- or double-layer gypsum sheathing at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with double-layer gypsum sheathing in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum sheathing connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the loaded sheathing edge combined with significant screw tilting and the loaded sheathing edge flexing fracture.

In addition, the influence of the loaded edge distance, double-layer sheathing and elevated temperatures is discussed in detail with clear conclusions.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis.

It is suggested that self-tapping screws with 10  mm diameter showed better joint performance in maximum load capacity and dissipated energy than did 8  mm <b>screw</b> <b>connections.</b> Self-tapping screws with fully threaded shanks showed better initial stiffness on the joint than did half-threaded <b>screw</b> <b>connections,</b> but also showed less ductility. Further, both fully threaded and double-threaded sections also provided the joint with higher maximum load and better dissipated energy than did connections using screws with half-threaded shank. The nailing approach of using self-tapping screws is a key to influencing the structural performance of a joint. The results indicated that toe-nailing approach is superior to the face-nailing approach in the maximum load capacity, initial stiffness, and dissipated energy of a beam–girder connection. A self-tapping screw connection with derived allowable loading capacity for Japanese cedar glulam structure could compete as a viable bolt connection for use in wood-framed construction.|$|E
