5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift,</b> which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I think, {{is that we should}} relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{modelling}} {{and experimental}} measurements {{led to the}} assessment of stress of structural nodes of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> platform, which is used for relocation of cars from a production line. It also led to the optimization of producing process. Immediate load of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> platform by a car on stand causes additional bending moment that must be captured in a scissor mechanism. At the beginning the experimental measurements on the real lifting platform were made for obtaining of dependence of displacement, velocity and acceleration on time, which was almost 1. 5 ± 0. 1 g. Then a dynamical analysis of lifting platform was performed using the numerical method Runge Kutta 4 th order. Model analysis showed that the initial immediate acceleration of lifting platform at start and immediate deceleration at stop lead to dynamic shocks. These dynamic shocks are dangerous due to a long term operation because they permanently load not only pivots but also other parts – bearings and joining parts. A resonance may occur as well. In particular, dynamic shocks caused damage of structural nodes. Immediate load of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> platform by a car on stand causes additional bending moment. It is not appropriate {{in terms of a}} long-term operation. The recommended load lifting platform should be symmetrical...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the shape}} of the {{original}} device, a pantograph also refers to a kind of structure that can compress or extend like an accordion, forming a characteristic rhomboidal pattern. This can be found in extension arms for wall-mounted mirrors, temporary fences, <b>scissor</b> <b>lifts,</b> and other <b>scissor</b> mechanisms such as the pantograph used on electric locomotives and trams.|$|R
50|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is used in}} devices such as <b>lift</b> tables and <b>scissor</b> <b>lifts.</b> Modern low-profile computer keyboards make an extensive use of it as well, installing each key on a scissor support to ensure their smooth vertical movement, allowing {{the use of a}} cheap and reliable rubber dome contact set, instead of expensive and colmplex array of mechanical switches.|$|R
50|$|Aerial work {{platforms}} are variously configured and powered machines, {{designed to}} deliver workers to otherwise inaccessible areas. An {{example of one}} of these machines is the <b>scissor</b> <b>lift,</b> as it is known in Australia, along with cherry pickers and spiders.|$|E

50|$|One highly {{effective}} {{method of scoring}} involved scissor lifts. As there was no upper-end cap on the crate stacking bonus (see below) several teams built 10-18-foot scissor lifts that would lift a crate, scoring 200-400 points. This score was virtually impossible to beat {{without the use of}} another <b>scissor</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lift tables {{can come}} in {{a vast array of}} {{configurations}} and can be built to suit various highly specialized industrial processes. The most common lift table design incorporates hydraulic cylinders and an electrically powered pump to actuate the <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> mechanism. Lift tables can also be driven by pneumatic sources, trapezoidal-threaded screw drives, push chains or by hydraulic foot pump when the load is not heavy. Lift tables can be mounted in a pit for floor-level loading, especially useful for access by manual pallet-pump trucks and the mobility impaired or wheelchair users.|$|R

The company also manufactures ladder lifts up to 56 meters, <b>scissor</b> <b>lifts</b> up to 22 meters and self-propelled engine-run articulated cherry picker boom lifts, {{with up to}} 26m lifting range.|$|R
5000|$|Electric forklifts - {{powered by}} {{lead-acid}} batteries or sometimes lithium-ion batteries, {{several types of}} forklifts are electric: cushion tire forklifts, <b>scissor</b> <b>lifts,</b> order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks. Electric forklifts are primarily used indoors on flat, even surfaces. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in food-processing and healthcare sectors.|$|R
50|$|To {{incorporate}} the device into a lift system, multiple helical band actuators are arranged below the lift platform {{where they are}} powered by an electric motor(s) and synchronized transmission. Helical band actuators require a separate lateral support mechanism, usually provided {{in the form of}} guide rails or self-guiding frame, such as a pantograph (e.g. a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift).</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> is {{yet another}} type of lift. These are usually mobile work {{platforms}} {{that can be easily}} moved to where they are needed, but can also be installed where space for counter-weights, machine room and so forth is limited. The mechanism that makes them go up and down is like that of a scissor jack.|$|E
5000|$|Riders {{first step}} onto a <b>scissor</b> <b>lift,</b> {{where they are}} raised into the loading position. Operators then hook the riders onto a cable that brings the riders {{to the top of}} the tower and a cable that holds the riders during the free-fall. Once the riders are {{securely}} attached to the cable and the operators say it is safe to operate, the <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> is brought down and the riders are pulled {{to the top of the}} tower. Once the riders reach the top, they must wait until the operator at the bottom says to [...] "pull the cord". The operator will usually say [...] "tower one / two: 3, 2, 1, fly." [...] At this point, the rider at the far right (unless there is a single rider) must pull the cord releasing them from the lift cable. During the first drop, riders experience about 3 to 4 seconds of free-falling. After about 10 swings, an operator will lift a hydraulic cable with a loop at the top which then a rider will have to grab and hold on to. After grabbing the cable, the riders will come to a stop just above the <b>scissor</b> <b>lift.</b> The next riders will step onto the lift where the previous riders will be unloaded and they will be attached to the lift cable where the cycle begins again. One cycle can last anywhere between 3 and 5 minutes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scissor</b> <b>lifts,</b> {{a staple}} of {{mechanical}} design, especially in competitive robotics, are a type of linkage {{that can be used}} to raise a load to some height, when acted upon by some force, usually exerted by an actuator. The position of this actuator, however, can affect the mechanical advantage and velocity ratio of the system. Hence, there needs to be a concrete way to analytically compare different actuator positions. However, all current research into the analysis of <b>scissor</b> <b>lifts</b> either focusses only on the screw jack configuration, or derives separate force expressions for different actuator positions. This, once again, leaves the decision between different actuator positions to trial and error, since the expression to test the potency of the position can only be derived once the position is chosen. This paper proposes a derivation for a general force expression, in terms of a few carefully chosen position variables, which can be used to generate the force expression for any actuator position. Hence, this expression illustrates exactly how each of the position variables (called a, b and i in this paper, as defined later) affect the force output, and hence can be used to pick an appropriate actuator position, by choosing values for the position variables that give the desired result.

40|$|Abstract- Wear plate welding {{machines}} requires some special raw {{material handling system}} as they are heavy to handle. Wear plate welding requires 4 - 5 workers for handling and clamping of raw material. This paper reviews different material handling equipment used by various industries. As the raw material is heavy, {{it is very difficult}} to handle manually. Hence there is requirement of integrated material handling and clamping system to do this heavy task. An integrated approach for material handling and clamping is suggested. In this paper, various handling mechanisms like <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> mechanism, hydraulic lift platform in scissors type mechanism, hydraulic lifting system based on multistage telescopic cylinder are discussed. Their analysis is done by using various software. Some failure diagnosis points are also discussed by mathematical calculations. Clamping mechanisms like electric power clamping device driven by step motor and screw-toggle-lever force amplifier in series, unilateral fixtures for sheet-metal parts with holes are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>scissor</b> <b>lift</b> {{is a type}} of {{platform}} that can usually only move vertically. The mechanism to achieve this is the use of linked, folding supports in a criss-cross [...] "X" [...] pattern, known as a pantograph (or scissor mechanism). The upward motion is achieved by the application of pressure to the outside of the lowest set of supports, elongating the crossing pattern, and propelling the work platform vertically. The platform may also have an extending [...] "bridge" [...] to allow closer access to the work area, because of the inherent limits of vertical-only movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{focus of}} this project will be on {{selecting}} a suitable lifting mechanism for the harvester vehicle. Concepts generation are done internally by individual and externally among group {{in order to provide}} more intelligence ideas on the system. Advantages and disadvantages of the concepts are discussed then only select the best among them. While performing material selection, few different factors need to be considered such as material properties, cost and availability. During the selection, different types of materials will be analyzed so that the most suitable material can be chosen. Finite element stress and strength analysis will be performed as well to study the stresses, forces and deflection displacement of the complex <b>scissor</b> <b>lifting</b> structure to determine the suitable structure dimension. After that, 3 D part drawings are drawn to check whether the parts fit each other without a real modeling construction that costs time and money. The final stage will focus on cost calculation which consists of raw of material cost, manufacturing cost, profit and also payback period. From the calculation, the payback period calculated is 2. 09 years and proved that this project is worthy to be invested...|$|R
