40|$|In recent years, the Korean {{government}} {{has sought to}} encourage rural young people to enter farming and older farmers to leave it. The government‟s tool for promoting this intergenerational change has been agricultural <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy,</b> which includes farm entry policy, farm exit policy, competitiveness policy, and rural development policy. However, {{the number of young}} farmers has decreased and number of old farmers has increased. This research investigates why agricultural <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> has failed, analyzing survey data on farm entry and exit using regression analysis, and with procedures enhanced by bootstrapping. The conclusions of the research are as follows. Agricultural <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> does not induce young people to enter farming mainly because: 1) Rural young people have as little enthusiasm for farming as their urban counterparts; and 2) Competitiveness policy cancels the effects of farm entry policy. Meanwhile, agricultural <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> has not induced old farmers to retire mainly because: 1) Older farmers are as reluctant to leave farming as younger ones; 2) Farm exit policy does not promote farm exit; and 3) Competitiveness policy and rural development policy, as well as farming conditions and farm exit barriers, cancel the effects of farm exit policy.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> on women's access to employment opportunities. <b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> affect women differently in their various roles :n development. Women face various constraints on the choice cf participating in the labour force. These constraints include level of education, marital status, family and household responsibilities, availability of support services, policies, historical factors, laws and cultura: attitudes. This paper argue. :, that <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> are likely to negatively affect the employment position cf women. First, retrenchment has affected mainly sectors where women are concentrated like: social, personal and community services, finance, real estate and business services. Second, the public sector which has been an employer of the last resort will have very few new jobs during <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> period.

40|$|Structural {{adjustment}} {{policies are}} recommended and financially {{supported by the}} World Bank and the International Monetary Fund {{as part of an}} effort to solve the external account crisis prevailing in many developing countries, including some African countries. Structural adjustment programs include policy reforms implemented in various sectors and pursue, almost without exception, outward-oriented trade strategies. One aspect of structural adjustment programs is the potential for expanded product ion of agricultural tradables in SubSaharan Africa. Much of this expansion is expected to increase the volume of agricultural exports. Although the expanded production of importables, particularly food, could be significant, the situation in African countries deserves particular attention because their production is highly concentrated on a few export commodities. If most African countries promoted and expanded their exports at the same time, world prices would. decrease.

In particular, the paper sheds light on how these two key <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> variables affect the short-run and long-run dynamics of inflation, output and exports. The general conclusion is that exchange rate changes have a moderate dynamic effect on inflation, output and exports. In contrast, government expenditures are less effective in influencing any of the above macroeconomic variables, either in the short-run or in the long-run. The impulse response functions derived from the VAR suggest that the impact of devaluation is strongly felt in either the third or the fourth year. The variance decompositions indicate that exchange rate changes account for about 30 percent, 7 percent and 27 percent in the variation of ouput, inflation and exports, respectively, in the ninth year. However, the percentage of the variation in the above variables owing to changes in government expenditures is very small. The implication of these results is that the structural adjustment policies in relation to changes in exchange rate and government expenditures may not be very effective as previously envisaged.

Quantitative estimates, based on Augmented-Dickey Fuller unit root test, cointegration and error correction specification, indicate that the real exchange rate, cocoa producer price, cassava price and trend significantly affected cocoa yield response in the long-run while the real exchange rate, cocoa producer price, cassava price and rice price significantly affected cocoa yield response in the short- run. In addition, from the results, the error correction mechanism (ECM) indicated a feedback of about 67. 4 % of the previous year’s disequilibrium from long-run domestic cocoa yield. The Perron structural break test show that SAP has a positive and significant effect on cocoa yield, but a negative effect on the cocoa producer price.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of sustainable development}} is a relatively recent advent in policy and the evaluation of industry structural adjustments. Although the elements of economic and environmental assessment have been relatively well developed and accepted, the effective inclusion of 'social' aspects in assessments of sustainable development are still being grappled with. This paper, which discusses a project that investigated the sustainable development of the Marine Scalefish Fishery in South Australia, was focused on providing a combined {{assessment of}} the interrelationships between the environmental, economic and social aspects of the industry {{and the effect of}} its restructure in 2005. The findings highlight the complexities of developing effective policies to address all three aspects of sustainable development, rather than trading off one outcome against another. In the case of the fishery at hand, while the environmental and economic objectives of the adjustment appear to have achieved, the social objectives may well have not. In this circumstance, the findings raise the possibility that the social impacts of the restructure may in fact, alone, compromise the long term future of the industry, despite the economic success of the restructure.

25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> on poor {{countries}} {{has been one}} of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank. The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans, which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources. <b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we provide}} {{empirical}} assessment of government involvement in economic activities. This assessment is done {{within the framework}} of a two-part strategy. In the first part, we evaluate the effects of the government size on the overall rate of economic growth of a group of 30 developing countries. This approach can be regarded as macroeconomic {{in the sense that the}} economywide growth is the subject of investigation. In the second part, we conducted a comparative study of technical efficiency between privately owned and publicly owned companies in the international oil industry. We refer to this approach as microeconomic since a particular industry is under investigation. this dissertation consists of two essays. In the first essay, we examine the effect of government size, measured by the ratio of government consumption expenditures to gross domestic product (GDP) on the rate growth of GDP. Our sample includes 30 low-income and middle-income developing countries over the period 1970 - 90. We use a panel data approach to avoid the shortcomings of the cross-country models often used in such an analysis. The results indicate government size has a highly significant negative influence on the rate of economic growth. Therefore, privatization is viewed as a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> to overcome the negative effects of government size. However, we emphasize this policy can be effective only in the proper environment in a market-oriented economy with well-established political, social, and economic institutions, and a well-defined property right system. The essay provides some empirical evidence from a group of countries about the impact of privatization on the rate of economic growth. In the second essay, we measure the firm-specific technical efficiency for a sample of 44 publicly owned and privately owned petroleum companies in the international oil industry. The empirical investigation is carried out by using the stochastic frontier production function approach. The results indicate the private decision-making units in the oil industry overperformed their publicly owned counterparts in terms of technical efficiency. The implication is privatization can improve the performance of the transformed public enterprises...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} {{of other countries}} that have implemented structural adjustment policies in recent history points {{to the possibility that}} such actions may yield negative employment and/or income distribution effects. For instance, Yagci, Kamin and Rosenbaum (1985) cited the case of Turkey where, during four years of structural adjustment "inflation fell from 103 percent in 1980 to 32 percent in 1983 and exports increased frcm $ 2. 3 B to $ 5. 7 B in the same period but unemployment increased from 19. 6 percent to 23. 2 percent and real wages fell more than 10 percent in 1980 - 1983. " Similarly, Foxley (1981) noted that uneraplojnent sharply rose in Uruguay and Chile, Brazil and Argentina as a result of adjustment policies undertaken by these countries in the 1970 s. Furthermore, existing studies of the impact effects of selected components of the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> package implemented by the Philippines indicate that they do have an adverse influence on employment (Medalla 1986 b). It cannot be denied though that these works were largely based on partial equilibrium analysis and may, therefore, be limited by the said approach. Orthodox economic theory, for instance, tells us that structural adjustment policies should, by "getting prices right" lead to a greater degree of efficiency and higher economic growth. Given this perspective, a re-examination in a general equilibrium framework of the employment impact of the various structural adjustment measures adopted in the Philippines in the 1980 s is not only worthwhile but timely as well. This study represents a small step in this direction. Specifically, this paper will (1) review existing Philippine literature on this area, (2) provide estimates of the employment/wage effects of (i) tariff reform, (ii) BOI incentive changes, (iii) removal of export taxes, (iv) financial liberalization and (v) exchange rate adjustment based on simulation experiments using {{one or both of the}} PIDS-NEDA (1987) macroeconometric model and Habito's (1986) computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Philippine economy and (3) recommend new directions for policy and future research in this area. The decision to employ these two models as the basis of our analysis is determined by purely pragmatic reasons. They represent the best alternative specifications of an economy-wide model of the Philippines that are available to this writer for purposes of policy analysis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the conflicting and differing political-economic crisis facing Kenya {{over time in}} an effort to explain people’s health and, especially women’s health in the areas of maternal mortality and morbidity. In that respect, this study has particularly assessed <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> instituted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in order to determine how they might have exacerbated the health conditions of women in Kenya. Since maternal mortality and morbidity in Kenya have escalated under <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies,</b> this study used two methodological approaches to assess the health situation: (1) the historical-comparative approach and (2) interviews with appropriate medical personnel. Basically, the historical approach allowed for a historical investigation of the imposition of colonial rule and the state policies on the general welfare of the Kenyan people, including the health care system. Interviews were used to assess specific behavioral patterns, conditions and circumstances related to the provision of health care services. Numerous factors such as the discrepancy between the growth in population and medical care, unsafe and clandestine abortions due to laws that prohibit abortion in Kenya, the problems of unmet need and poverty influence maternal mortality and morbidity. While the above explanations are relevant, {{it is important to note}} that the following factors are also relevant: 1. The colonial legacy is a factor. 2. The level of postcolonial appropriations to the health system which has declined over time; and 3.

40|$|The present government's {{concern is}} aimed towards poverty alleviation, {{productive}} employment generation, income redistribution and sustained economic growth. Given these development goals, issues concerning employment, wages and productivity which have gained prominence {{through the years}} should be dealt with. Rising levels of unemployment and underemployment along with declining productivity and real wages continue to plague the economy. Likewise, the balance of payments problems and the increasing indebtedness further aggravate the worsening economic condition. These major problems began to attract much attention for there arose dissatisfaction among the populace with the upsurge {{in the incidence of}} poverty and the occurrence of other related problems. With the task of finding solutions to these problems, the government implemented policies and initiated a structural reform program. The purpose of the. present study is twofold. First, the nature of the abovementioned problems is studied by looking at the labor market conditions. Specifically, an analysis of the trends in employment, wages and productivity, and a comprehensive historical account of how policies and policy changes affected them directly and indirectly, are presented. Moreover, the impacts of policies adopted by the government in the 1980 s on employment, wages and productivity are assessed qualitatively. Policy recommendations are drawn based on the findings of the study. Secondly, the employment impact of the various structural adjustment measures adopted in the 1980 s is re-examined within a general equilibrium framework. Specifically, the study provides estimates of the employment and wage effects of the structural adjustment program based on simulation experiments using the PIDS-NEDA (1987 version) macroeconometric models and Habito's (1986) computable general equilibrium model of the Philippine economy. Based on these, policy recommendations and new directions for future research in the area are provided. Part I of this study discusses the recent trends in employment, unemployment, underemployment, wages and productivity. It was observed that employment has generally increased over the period 1970 - 87 with a few years exhibiting slight declines. It was also observed that more than 50 percent of total employment was engaged in agriculture while the share of agriculture to total employment showed an apparent tendency to decline. The structural shift has been from agriculture to services, instead of agriculture to industrial sector. Unemployment rates in the country were high especially during the 1980 s. Likewise, underemployment rates were also rapidly rising. Labor productivity roughly measured by output per worker has increased from 1961 to 1980 but declined thereafter until 1986 afterwhich a slight increase was observed in 1987. Nominal agricultural and nonagricultural wages has been increasing through the years. However, real wages in both sectors declined. A review of the past and present policies showed that the industrialization policies implemented during the post-war period generally increased output and investments but their inherent capital bias resulted in the low rate of labor absorption. The manufacturing sector failed to generate enough jobs necessary to absorb the increasing labor force. This was due to factors like the limitations in the domestic market for output of import substituting firms, and the misallocation of investible funds to high cost industries as a result of incentives and short-sighted labor legislation which raised labor costs and discouraged employment. In addition, the adoption of an outward-looking strategy like export promotion is hindered by the lack of reciprocal response in the international setting due to increasing protectionism and stagnation among developed economies. In search for policies which can increase labor absorption, the following points were made based on the analysis. First, what is called for is a system of taxation and protection which is nonfactor price distortive. Secondly, economic growth and employment generation can be accelerated with a firmer commitment {{on the part of the}} authorities in implementing the structural reforms. And lastly, the outward-looking strategy is worth pursuing giving emphasis to light manufacturing industries which showed resiliency to the impact of the economic crisis as evidenced by its ability to maintain relatively high levels of sales and small levels of labor displacement during the crisis years. Part II provides a quantitative assessment of the impact of structural adjustment measures on employment and wages. Using the PIDS-NEDA macroeconometric models, three counterfactual experiment related to <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> reform were conducted to appraise their employment effect for 1980 to 1990. Firstly, simulation results showed that the tariff reform program (TRP) has a positive effect on output, employment, exports and prices. Secondly, removal of export taxes on all products except logs in 1986 has a small positive effect on output and total employment except in 1989 and 1990. The policy has favorable influence on current account balance by effecting an increase in exports. Thirdly, an evaluation of the financial liberalization program using the PIDS-NEDA model was found not to be feasible given the shortcomings of the present version of the model. Using Habito's computable general equilibrium model, two simulations were. done. First, the estimates showed that TRP increased total output and average wage implying positive effect on the labor market. The policy increased the relative price of nontradables while it decreased relatively price of importables. It also decreased average wage in agriculture and manufacturing while it increased that of nontradables. TRP was found to favor middle income groups. Second, BOI incentives decreased total output, average wage and total employment. It has a regressive impact on real income across household group. The shift to a flexible exchange' rate regime has a positive effect on output and prices. Labor is reallocated into export and import substituting sector away from nontradables...|$|E
