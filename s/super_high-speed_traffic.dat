40|$|It {{is known}} that planing craft suffer {{significant}} wave load and impact force when it runs in wave at high-speed. In severe seas, peculiar violent motions, like jumping from wave crest and falling down to wave surface occur. Recently, this type of craft {{is used as a}} leisure boat and its Froude number is over 6. 0. For such <b>super</b> <b>high-speed</b> craft, even small waves are dangerous. However, it has not been clarified what sea state are the limiting criteria for full speed running. In the present study, the ship motions of such a craft at <b>super</b> <b>high-speed,</b> that means at Fn= 2. 0 to 5. 0, in regular head waves are measured in a towing tank, and are divided into some different types; linear motion, non-linear motion with and without jumping. The criteria of these types are determined according to running conditions; Froude number, wave period and wave height and so on. A computer program to simulate ship motion of planing craft at <b>super</b> <b>high-speed</b> is developed using a motion equation with experimental hydrodynamic coefficients and theoretical ones based on a potential theory. The results of the simulation are in good agreement with experimental ones...|$|R

40|$|Complex Network Theory can {{analyze the}} {{reliability}} of <b>high-speed</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> networks and also evaluate node importance. This paper conducts a systematic and in-depth research of importance of various nodes in the <b>high-speed</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> network so as to improve the <b>high-speed</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> network level. To study importance of network nodes can contribute to an in-depth understanding of the network structure. Therefore, the complex network is introduced and the node importance is evaluated.

40|$|Abstract—Many long-running network {{analytics}} applications {{impose a}} high-throughput and high reliability requirements on stream processing systems. However, previous stream process-ing systems cannot sustain <b>high-speed</b> <b>traffic</b> {{at the core}} router level. Furthermore, their fault-tolerant schemes cannot provide strong consistency which is essential for network analytics. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of SAND, a fault-tolerant distributed stream processing system for network analytics. SAND is designed to operate under <b>high-speed</b> network <b>traffic,</b> and it uses a novel checkpointing protocol which can perform failure recovery based on upstream backup and checkpointing. We prove our fault-tolerant scheme provides strong consistency even under multiple node failure. We implement several real-world network analytics applica-tions on SAND, evaluate their performance using network traffic captured from commercial cellular core networks, and demonstrate that SAND can sustain <b>high-speed</b> network <b>traffic</b> and that our fault-tolerant scheme is efficient.

Second, the conventional traffic conflict indicators, such as TTC, approximate-TTC, PET, etc. are demonstrated. The characteristics of these conflict indicators are discussed.
