500|$|Just a {{day after}} {{returning}} for pre-season training with Leeds, on 28 June 2013, Morison joined former club Millwall, also of the Championship, on a season-long loan deal. On rejoining Millwall, Morison stated – [...] "I'm pleased to be back here. If anybody has any doubts about me all I'd <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> aim to score plenty of goals for Millwall and help this club to greater success". Morison finished the season with eight goals in 41 appearances, helping the London club stave off relegation from the Championship with a 19th-place finish.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I want to <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{standard}} that I share with everyone that, I frequently <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{provide the same}} care that I would provide my own daughter I feel." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought the}} best thing to <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{suspected}} as much from the first. Therefore I said so.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're {{stronger}} than you think," [...] he declared. [...] "I never {{felt this way}} in my life before. What <b>I</b> meant to <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never understood running away with a woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{really and}} truly, George, what I said and meant to <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> trusted Lignum {{to you and}} was sure you'd bring him through it. And you HAVE brought him through it, noble!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay stated [...] "This is so tragic. How do {{we talk to}} {{the parents}} who are going through this? All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel for them, and I care for them." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "That's not my logo, and I {{was totally}} unaware that it existed... The logo I created was very similar, but I {{designed}} {{it in the}} early 1980s. All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was so sports-unaware that I didn't know about the earlier logo. I feel like a total idiot now that I didn't know about it. I'm flabbergasted." ...|$|E
2500|$|During her {{marriage}} with Lindström, Bergman {{had a brief}} affair with Spellbound costar Gregory Peck. Unlike the affair with Rossellini, that with Peck was kept private until he confessed it to Brad Darrach of People in an interview five years after Bergman's death. Peck said, “All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a real love for her (Bergman), and I think that’s where I ought to stop…. I was young. She was young. We were involved for weeks in close and intense work.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{not about}} to dispute the point, Tim,' said young Cheeryble, laughing. 'I am not such a heretic as <b>that.</b> All <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hold myself under an {{obligation}} to the coincidence, that's all.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the term}} [...] "paraliterature", Ursula K. Le Guin commented that [...] "it exists. What I'm <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't want to {{perpetuate}} this division. So I would always {{put it in}} quotes, or do something to show that I'm rejecting a word <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to use".|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] Jeanne answered, with a sigh, [...] "that you {{are very}} unintelligent. What <b>I</b> meant to <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{do not like to}} sit here and talk with you. It wearies me, because you do not say {{anything}} that interests me, and I should very much rather read my book." ...|$|R
2500|$|Type O Negative's debut album, Slow, Deep and Hard, was {{released}} in 1991. The album incorporated the thrash elements of Carnivore merged with doom metal. Steele had written the music {{in the space of}} one night {{in the aftermath of a}} relationship break-up, and this was reflected in the lyrical topics of heartbreak, fantasies of revenge, and the contemplation of suicide; something Steele had himself attempted: [...] "On October 15th, 1989, I slashed my wrists. All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> fell in love with the wrong person." ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish I {{could drink}} {{the health of}} {{everyone}} of you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, aunt. The {{last word}} I have to <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> implore {{you not to}} leave Scroope {{as long as you}} are {{comfortable}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If your ladyship will pardon my saying so, <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> neither you nor any {{one else}} could tell me <b>that.</b> What <b>I</b> wished to <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} <b>that</b> we at Scotland Yard were placed in charge of your jewels until after the wedding. Mr. Peter Ruff is, as you may be aware, a private detective himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lavinia,' {{returned}} Mr Sampson, in {{a dismal}} vein, I {{did not mean}} to say so. What I did mean to <b>say,</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never expected to retain my favoured place in this family, after Fortune shed her beams upon it. Why do you take me,' said Mr Sampson, 'to the glittering halls with which I can never compete, and then taunt me with my moderate salary? Is it generous? Is it kind?' ...|$|R
60|$|To {{tell him}} the whole truth would {{probably}} have been to bring him to Frankfort as fast as sailing-vessels and horses could carry him. All I could venture to <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had found the lost trace of Minna and her mother, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had every reason to believe there was no cause to feel any present anxiety about them. <b>I</b> added <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> in a position to forward a letter secretly, if it would comfort him to write to his sweetheart.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Begging your pardon, sir, I'm {{perfectly}} under control. And all I <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't stay {{any longer}} alone downstairs there. There's {{somebody in the}} house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is another}} matter," [...] he confessed. [...] "You {{come from a}} world of which I know nothing. All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would rather think of you--as {{something}} different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Captain O'Grady, all I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall {{at dinner}} this evening move {{a vote of}} censure upon you as mess {{president}} for not having discovered the fact before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I wish to <b>say</b> now <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot {{consent to}} act for you, in this matter, merely as an {{intermediary}} whose failure {{would leave the}} affair in state quo." ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> a digression, and, of course, {{you know}} all about it just as well as <b>I</b> do. All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't suppose <b>that</b> the judge had ever spoken a cross word to Zena in his life.--Oh, he threw her novel over the grape-vine, <b>I</b> don't deny <b>that,</b> but then why on earth should a girl read trash like the Errant Quest of the Palladin Pilgrim, and the Life of Sir Galahad, when the house was full of good reading like The Life of Sir John A. Macdonald, and Pioneer Days in Tecumseh Township? ...|$|R
5000|$|On December 5, 2012, Damian Lillard {{was named}} Western Conference Rookie of the Month for November, {{making him the}} third rookie in Blazers history to earn the honor, {{following}} Arvydas Sabonis (1994) and Brandon Roy (2007). When asked about the honor, Lillard stated [...] "I’m happy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can get it, but <b>I</b> think all <b>that</b> it <b>says</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> played good for one month. My mind {{has been focused on}} being consistent for the whole season, so ... it's a big deal to win the award, but it's not a big deal for the season. I’ll be happy about it and then it’ll be gone. It's a new month already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite safely, thank you. I {{was going}} to write you a note this afternoon. I went away on an impulse. All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am sorry. Do forgive me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{rather have}} yours, John. But, in truth, what I {{want you to}} <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am right in doing this,--right in keeping my promise to my brother, and {{providing}} for his children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You express {{yourself}} so disagreeably," [...] said she, [...] "one hardly {{knows how}} to answer; what I mean to <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> occasionally allow Isidore the pleasure and honour of expressing his homage by the offer of a trifle." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just twenty, and Jim said <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> twenty-seven.|$|R
60|$|Wild. The {{worst that}} you can <b>say</b> of me <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have loved you thrice over.|$|R
60|$|CRICHTON. Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can <b>say</b> {{at present}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have cast a {{favourable}} eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah your English--possibly! All I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{listened to}} her conscientiously, and I didn't {{perceive}} in what she did a single nuance, a single inflexion or intention. But not one, mon cher. I don't think she's intelligent." ...|$|E
6000|$|CRAVEN. Well, Mrs. Tranfield, all I can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{hope you}} will succeed in {{establishing}} your complaint, and that Julia may soon see the last of this most outrageous institution. (Sylvia, still caressing his arm, laughs at him; Charteris returns.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Very well, then,” said my friend’s wife, rising, “all I have to <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall {{take the}} {{children}} and go to an hotel until those cheeses are eaten. I decline to live any longer {{in the same house}} with them.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "All <b>I</b> can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> healthy {{all my life}} I {{would not}} have prayed well or put myself in God's hands; and had I been better looking I would not have escaped {{situations}} which the more handsome of my friends got themselves involved in." ...|$|R
60|$|I went by Liverpool Street, {{and drove}} across to Paddington. I had never, to my knowledge, been in London before: {{and it was}} all so new to me. But Liverpool Street was even newer to me than Paddington, I noticed. A faint sense of {{familiarity}} seemed to hang about the Great Western line. And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not surprising, <b>I</b> thought, as I turned it over; for, of course, in the old days, when we lived at Woodbury, I must often have come down from town that way with my father. Yet I remembered nothing of it all definitely; the most <b>I</b> could <b>say</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> seemed dimly to recollect having been there before--though when or where or how, I hadn't the faintest notion.|$|R
60|$|Theo. All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can <b>say</b> {{at present}} <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will never <b>be</b> Don Melchor's: The rest, time and your service must make out.|$|R
