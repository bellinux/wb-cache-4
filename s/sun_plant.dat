40|$|Influence of {{different}} light regimes (plants grown in shade {{and in the}} sun) on respiration, activity of alternative respiratory pathway and carbohydrates content in mature leaves of Ajuga reptans L. was investigated. All experiments were carried out under natural conditions. <b>Sun</b> <b>plants</b> had higher respiration, activity of the alternative pathway and carbohydrates content compared to the shade plants. Additional experiments were performed in order to study effects of darkening as well as evolution of respiration and carbohydrates concentrations in leaves of A. reptans during the day. Darkening led {{to a decline in}} total respiration in all types of plants investigated. Activity of the alternative pathway remained unchanged by 20 % in the leaves of the shade plants. On the other hand, darkness led to a twofold decrease in the activity of the alternative pathway in the leaves of the <b>sun</b> <b>plants.</b> Content of soluble carbohydrates in the darkness did not change in the leaves of the shade plants while significantly decreased in the leaves of the <b>sun</b> <b>plants.</b> Total respiration in the mature leaves of the shade plants studied did not change significantly during the day.

40|$|In {{the shade}} plant Alocasia macrorrhiza grown in low light, {{photosynthetic}} CO 2 assimilation during a 5 second lightfleck plus postillumination CO 2 assimilation can allow up to 60 % more photosynthesis {{than that which}} occurs during 5 seconds of steady state light of the same intensity (RL Chazdon, RW Pearcy 1986 Oecologia. 69 : 524 - 531).

It was found that the pool of triose-P was much larger than that of RuBP and could account for five times more postillumination CO 2 assimilation than could RuBP. The same trend was seen in the <b>sun</b> <b>plant</b> Phaseolus vulgaris when it was grown in the shade. In contrast, sun-grown Alocasia and Phasiolus did not have a large pool of triose-P relative to RuBP following a lightfleck. In sun plants, carbon may rapidly be converted to RuBP in the light whereas in shade plants there may be a restriction in the path between the triose-P and RuBP pools. It is hypothesized that in shade plants the buildup of triose-P rather than RuBP during the lightfleck prevents inhibition of electron transport which may otherwise occur because of competition for ATP between the two kinases of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle. Utilization of the triose-P for postillumination CO 2 fixation would require the capacity for significant postillumination ATP synthesis. The extensive grana stacking and large intrathylakoid space which accompanies the high level of chlorophyll in low-light-grown Alocasia could be an important contributing factor to postillumination ATP formation...|$|E

Our objective was to investigate the effects of shading on A. sparsifolia. Methods We selected two light regimes, natural and shade (60 % of natural light), to understand the effects of shading on leaf morphology and response characteristics of photosynthesis in A. sparsifolia growing naturally on the southern edge of Taklimakan Desert, northwest China. Important findings Plants grown in the shade treatment had greater SLA (p < 0. 01), lower leaf fresh mass per unit leaf area, leaf dry mass per unit leaf area and leaf thickness than plants grown in full natural light treatments (p < 0. 01), and greater content of total chlorophyll a + b and total carotenoids, especially chlorophyll a content (p < 0. 01). With shade, plants had lower light-compensation point, light-saturation point and dark respiration rate, higher apparent quantum yield and light use efficiency and significantly higher photosynthetic rate of light-saturation point. Under high irradiation shade plants had net photosynthetic rate lower than that of plants grown in full natural light, leading to photoinhibition. We concluded that A. sparsifolia had the ability to adjust to shade in leaf morphology and characteristics of photosynthesis. In addition, the content of free proline (Pro) increased significantly in shade plants (p < 0. 01), which showed that free Pro {{plays an important role in}} shade acclimation of A. sparsifolia.

40|$|Abstract: Fluorescence imaging {{represents}} a non-invasive tool for revealing and understanding spatial heterogeneity in leaf performance caused by external factors, such as abiotic stress. Sun (Rosa meillandina and Chrysanthemum morifo-lium) and shade (Spathiphyllum wallisii) plants {{were used to}} study their tolerance to heat and high illumination. Fluores-cence yield, effective PSII quantum yield and non-photochemical quenching were analysed in leaves attached to plants by fluorescence imaging. The control plants of all species showed homogeneous images of the fluorescence parameters throughout the leaf. The fluorescence yield (F) was 0. 1 or less, the effective PSII quantum yield (Y(II)) around 0. 75 and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) less than 0. 3. The two sun plants showed higher tolerance to stress conditions. Few variations were observed in F and Y(II) images after stress photoperiods and some leaf regions showed an increase in NPQ, indicating more thermal energy dissipation in these zones than in other leaf regions. The images of the fluorescence parameters {{were similar to those}} of control plants after one recovery photoperiod without stress conditions. Shade plant showed lower tolerance and irreversible damage was observed after the first photoperiod, particularly {{at the base of the}} leaf and in the areas adjacent to the ribs. The centre and top of the leaf were less damaged, and effective PSII quantum yield remained high because the leaf curved to reduce the incident radiation. Incubation with the herbicides DCMU and paraquat led to differences in the fluorescence parameter images. The effect of DCMU (0. 1 mM) was visible after 30 min incubation, beginning at the ribs and adjacent areas of the leaf. The three species studied showed different degree of sensi-tivity to paraquat (0. 2 mM), and the effective quantum yield in each species was affected at different incubation times.

40|$|Biotic soil crusts are a {{worldwide}} phenomenon in arid and semi-arid landscapes. Metabolic {{activity of the}} poikilohydric organisms found in these crusts is dominated by quick and drastic changes in moisture availability and long periods of drought. Under controlled conditions, we studied the role of water content on photosynthetic and respiratory CO 2 exchange of three green algal soil crust lichens from a desert site in southern Utah (USA) : Diploschistes diacapsis (AGH.) LUMBSCH, Psora cerebriformis W. WEBER, and Squamarina lentigera (WEBER) POELT. Photosynthetic metabolism is activated by extremely small amounts of moisture; lower compensation values for net photosynthesis (NP) are reached between 0. 05 and 0. 27 mm of precipitation equivalent. Thus, the lichens can use very low degrees of hydration for carbon gain. Maximal NP occurs between 0. 39 and 0. 94 mm precipitation equivalent, and area-related rates equal 2. 6 - 5. 2 mu mol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1). All three tested species show 2 ̆ 7 <b>sun</b> <b>plant</b> 2 ̆ 7 features, including high light requirements for CO 2 exchange compensation and for NP saturation. Diploschistes diacapsis maintains high rates of NP at full water saturation. In contrast, suprasaturated thalli {{of the other two}} species show a strong depression in NP which can be removed or reduced by increased external CO, concentration. Consequently, this depression is most probably caused by increased thallus diffusive resistances due to pathway blockage by water. This depression will greatly limit carbon gain of these species in the field after heavy rain. It occurs at all temperatures of ecological relevance and also under conditions of low light. However, maximum water holding capacity of P. cerebriformis and S. lentigera is higher than that of D. diacapsis. This could mean that periods of hydration favorable for metabolic activity for those two species last longer than those of D. diacapsis. This might compensate for their lower rates of NP during suprasaturation. Thus, two different strategies might have developed for lichen existence in the specific and extreme arid soil crust habitat. Data about habitat conditions for the different lichen species are needed in older to test this hypothesis and to allow interpretation and prediction of performance of these soil crust lichens in nature...|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of varying}} light {{intensity}} and nitrogen nutrition on photosynthetic physiology and biochemistry {{were examined in}} the <b>sun</b> <b>plant</b> Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) and in the shade plant Alocasia macrorrhiza (Australian rainforest floor species). In both Phaseolus and Alocasia, the differing growth regimes produced large changes in photosynthetic capacity and composition of the photosynthetic apparatus. CO 2 -saturated rates of photosynthesis were linearly related to leaf nitrogen (N) content in both species but photosynthesis per unit leaf N was markedly higher for Phaseolus than for Alocasia. Photosynthetic capacity was also higher in Phaseolus per unit ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase (RuBPCase) protein. The leaf content of RuBPCase was linearly dependent on leaf N content in the two species. However, the proportion of leaf N which was RuBPCase was greater in Phaseolus than in Alocasia and was more sensitive to growth conditions, ranging from 6 % of leaf N at low light to 20 % at high light. In Alocasia, this range was much less, 6 to 11 %. However, chlorophyll content was much more sensitive to light intensity in Alocasia. Thus, the RuBPCase/chlorophyll ratio was quite responsive to N availability and light intensity in both species (but for different reasons), ranging from 6 grams per gram for Phaseolus and 2 grams per gram for Alocasia at high leaf N and 1. 5 gram per gram for Phaseolus and 0. 5 gram per gram for Alocasia at low leaf N. These large changes in the proportions of components of the photosynthetic apparatus had marked effects on the sensitivity of these species to photoinhibition. These environmental effects also caused changes in the absolute levels of metabolites of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle. Concentrations of RuBP and P-glycerate were approximately 2 -fold higher in high light-grown than low light-grown Phaseolus and Alocasia when expressed on a leaf area basis. However, if metabolite pool sizes are expressed {{on the basis of}} the RuBPCase catalytic site concentration, then they were little affected by the marked changes in leaf makeup. There appears to be fundamental differences between these species in the mechanism of sun-shade adaptation and N partitioning in the photosynthetic apparatus that result in significant differences in the N-use efficiency of photosynthesis between Phaseolus and Alocasia but similar RuBPCase:substrate:product ratios despite these differences...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} on the harmful effect of {{salinity}} on N utilization in the flower crops gloxinia (a salt-sensitive mesophytic semi-shade plant) and chrysanthemum (a salt- tolerant <b>sun</b> <b>plant).</b> For solid substrates (trials 2 and 3) the specific conductivity of the saturation extract (EC. in mmho per cm at 25 °C) was used as measure of salinity (Richards et al., 1954). In water culture (Trial 1), the specific conductivity of the nutrient solution (EC in mmho per cm at 25 °C) was used. The specific conductivity of the substrate also indicated osmotic suction S s. In solid substrates, the availability of water is dependent not only on S s {{but also on the}} matric suction S m. To eliminate the influence of S m, attempts were made to keep it constant. In Trial 1, the yield of dry matter was studied at 4 nitrate concentrations and with 4 EC e values, the latter obtained by adding NaCl. Increases in EC e depressed yield increment per unit nitrogen. This reduction in N effect, being much larger for gloxinia than for chrysanthemum, represented a decrease in N utilization, attributable to a disturbance in nitrogen metabolism at rising suction tension (S l or DPD) in the leaf (Barnette & Naylor, 1966). This rise in S l with EC of the medium could be deduced from a decrease in percentage transpiration. Brouwer (1963) has shown that S l increases with NaCl concentration. There was a practically linear negative relationship between yield and EC. After extrapolating EC to zero, the nitrogen curves coincided into one typical yield curve. Therefore the osmotic factor seemed dominant. The large influence of NaCI on ionic balance in the plant showed that specific ion effects could not be neglected. Notable specific effects were for the cations, the antagonism of Na + to uptake of K +, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, and for the anions the antagonism of Cl - to NO 3 -. The organic salts (C-A) decreased appreciably with rising Cl - concentrations in the medium. The two plants deviated in pattern of ion uptake. Chrysanthemum selectively absorbed K +, and could to some degree control the entry of ions. Gloxinia showed no selectivity and could not prevent the entry of ions. This difference must partly account for the difference in salt tolerance between the species. Certainly some investigators (Bernstein & Ayers, 1953; Sutcliffe, 1962) looked upon selective uptake of K +, as an indication of a species' salt tolerance. Since salinity depresses water balance of plant through S s, salt tolerance must also depend on the genetically determined osmotic characteristics of the plant. According to Slatyer (1963) the osmotic pressure of mesophytic shade plants (e. g. gloxinia), is about 5 bar, for most crop plants (e. g. tomato and chrysanthemum) between 10 and 20 bar, and for halophytes (e. g. Atriplex nummularia) even 72 bar. In Trial 2, on a solid substrate, the nitrogen effect was depressed by four different types of salt, as by NaCl in Trial 1. The depression seemed to be almost proportional to the increase in EC e caused by addition of salt. Only K 2 SO 4 depressed yield of gloxinia more than could be explained by the increase in EC e caused by addition of the salt. As in Trial 1, the depression of the N effect by any salt could be attributed to a decreased N utilization. The almost linear negative relationship between yield and EC e was clearly influenced by the N rate. At optimum N rate, the reduction in yield by EC e was much larger than at the lowest N rate. In assessing damage by salinity, the nitrogen status of the crop must be considered. Specific ion effects could be detected by correction for EC e. K 2 SO 4 exerted the largest specific harmful effect on growth of gloxinia. Chrysanthemum, which was usually much less affected by specific salt injury, suffered mostly from the specific effect of Na 2 SO 4. Extremely important for the ionic balance in the plant was the increase in proportion of N as NH 4 + with N rate (here given as ammonium nitrate). NH 4 + competes strongly with other cations but according to van Tuil (1965) contributes much less than NO 3 - to the content of organic salts. Increases in NH 4 + in the substrate with N rate therefore accounted for the decreases in organic salts in almost all series. For gloxinia, K +, competed markedly with uptake of Ca 2 +, for K 2 SO 4 even more so than for KCl. The specific harmfulness of K 2 SO 4 for growth was therefore essentially a Ca 2 + deficiency induced by K +, and SO 4 2 - together. The specific harmfulness of Na 2 SO 4 for chrysanthemum can be ascribed to a decrease in K +, in the plant by competition from NH 4 + and Na + together. The difference between species in pattern of ion uptake in Trial 1 was confirmed. Gloxinia seemed to have a high Ca 2 + requirement but unlike chrysanthemum's selectivity for K +, could not absorb Ca 2 + selectively. According to van den Berg (1952) the salt tolerance of a crop is often associated with a specific Ca 2 + requirement. The results of Trial 2 support this opinion. In Trial 3, the influence of different substrates proved to be based entirely on the inverse proportionality between moisture capacity and EC e. The shape of the pF curve and the daily water loss by transpiration indicate that, despite of attempts to standardize the moisture level, the influence of matric suction S m was considerable in the clay-peat substrates of chrysanthemum, although it had been eliminated in the sand-peat substrates of gloxinia. The increase in N effect with increasing peat content of the substrates proved to be an EC e effect, as did also the lower negative effect of NaCl or of excess N with increasing peat content. These results also explained the significant interaction between nitrogen and substrate, reported elsewhere for gloxinia and cyclamen (Arnold Bik, 1962). The relationship between yield and EC e were almost independent of substrate. The usefulness of EC e as a criterion of salinity in trials with different substrates was thus confirmed. For gloxinia, the curves of N rate against yield for each of substrate-NaCl series coincided into one typical yield curve when EC e was adjusted to zero. Therefore at uniform pF and with adequate aeration the substrate effect is actually an EC e effect so long as the substrate components do not exert any particular effect such as fixation of K +. Plant composition again showed that the form of N (NH 4 + or NO 3 -) and, by its influence on nitrification, the CaCO 3 content of the substrate governed the ionic balance of the plant. In gloxinia total cations and total inorganic anions in the plant both decreased with increasing peat content, in accordance with the lower concentrations in the substrate. In chrysanthemum, this relationship was confused by the influence of the clay component of the substrate. Trial 3 suggests that the effect of salinity was more an osmotic effect than a specific ion effect. Practical measures for growers are suggested (Chap. 6) to minimize the harmfulness of salinity on the N effect and on the vegetative growth of pot plants and other ornamentals...|$|E

They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered <b>sun.</b> <b>Plants</b> are typically watered {{once every two}} or three weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} analysis of fluorescence induction curves of leaves treated with 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 dimethylurea {{was done for}} several species. These measurements gave the ratios of the total chlorophyll to photosystem II reaction centers. This communication is a preliminary survey of <b>sun</b> and shade <b>plants</b> and demonstrates a significant variation in this ratio. In the <b>sun</b> <b>plants,</b> the photosynthetic unit sizes (chlorophyll reaction centers) varied between 220 to 480. The shade plants gave numbers mostly in the range between 630 to 940. The {{computer analysis}} of the fluorescence data also gave the connectivity parameter of energy transfer between photosynthetic units of photosystem II which varied between 0. 2 and 0. 5 but did not show any obvious correlation to the photosynthetic unit size...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims A major {{challenge}} in plant ecophysiology is understanding {{the effects of}} multiple suboptimal environmental conditions on plant performance. In most Mediterranean areas soil salinity builds up during the summer because of low availability of soil water coupled with hot temperatures. Although sunlight and soil salinity may strongly interact in determining a plant's performance, this has received relatively little attention. Methods Two-year-old seedlings of Fraxinus ornus were grown outdoors in pots during a Mediterranean summer in either 45 % (shaded plants) or 100 %(sun plants) sunlight irradiance andwere supplied with either deionized water or deionized water plus 75 mM NaCl. Morpho-anatomical traits, water and ionic relations, gas exchange and photosystem II performance, concentrations of individual carotenoids, activity of antioxidant enzymes, concentrations of ascorbic acid and individual polyphenols were measured in leaves. Leaf oxidative stress and damagewere estimated by in vivo analysis of stable free radicals and ultrastructural analyses. Key Results Leaf concentrations of potentially toxic ions did not markedly differ in shadedor sunplants in response to salinity. Leaves of sunplants displayed superior water use efficiency compared with leaves of shaded plants, irrespective of salinity treatment, andhad both better stomatal control and higher CO 2 carboxylation efficiency than leaves of shaded plants. In the salt-treated groups, the adverse effects of excess midday irradiancewere greater in shade than in <b>sun</b> <b>plants.</b> The activity of enzymes responsible for detoxifying hydrogen peroxide decreased in shaded plants and increased in <b>sun</b> <b>plants</b> {{as a result of}} salinity stress. In contrast, the activity of guaiacol peroxidase and the concentration of phenylpropanoids increased steeply in response to salinity in shaded plants but were unaffected in <b>sun</b> <b>plants.</b> Conclusions It is concluded that salinity may constrain the performance of plants growing under partial shading more severely than that of plants growing under full sun during summer. The results suggest co-ordination within the antioxidant defence network aimed at detoxifying salt-induced generation of reactive oxygen species...|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 2,000 years ago, the Romans, having {{recognized}} {{the advantages of}} the slaty soil on the steep slopes facing the <b>sun,</b> <b>planted</b> here in the Bremmer Calmont the first grapevines. They called the hill calidus mons - the hot hill - for it is a south-facing slope with extremely favourable climatic conditions. The Romans’ name also yields the modern name, “Calmont”. The slopes, set at between 50 and 55°, are Europe’s steepest vineyard terraces. Grown here are most outstanding Riesling wines, which at both state and federal levels achieve high awards.|$|R
50|$|It prefers deep loamy soils in partial shade, {{but will}} grow in poorer soils and in full <b>sun.</b> The <b>plant</b> is {{sometimes}} cultivated, {{often in a}} variegated form, for its exotic appearance.|$|R
30|$|At {{the other}} end of the scale, the {{youngest}} children demonstrate a noteworthy lack of comprehension regarding the notion of living beings. They seem to answer randomly when considering whether the <b>sun,</b> <b>plants</b> and clouds are or not living beings. This point suggests that these individuals still do not grasp the criteria to decide which of the aforementioned entities are or not living beings. More interestingly, the 4 – 5 [*]year old children mostly attributed a “living being” status to vehicles which, according to the data presented, cannot be explained as a consequence of a pattern of random choice.|$|R
50|$|Food webs {{describe}} {{the transfer of}} energy between species in an ecosystem. While a food chain examines one, linear, energy pathway through an ecosystem, a food web is more complex and illustrates all of the potential pathways. Much of this transferred energy comes from the <b>sun.</b> <b>Plants</b> use the sun’s energy to convert inorganic compounds into energy-rich, organic compounds, turning carbon dioxide and minerals into plant material by photosynthesis. Plant flowers exude energy-rich nectar above ground and plant roots exude acids, sugars, and ectoenzymes into the rhizosphere, adjusting the pH and feeding the food web underground.|$|R
