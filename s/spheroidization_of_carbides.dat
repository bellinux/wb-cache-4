40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a Z-parameter {{method is}} {{proposed}} to relate creep rupture data and microstructure deterioration of three low carbon steels: Cr 5 Mo, 12 Cr 1 MoV and 20 steels. A new analytic {{expression of the}} Larson-Miller parameter verse stress is supposed as: P =Z + C 1 lgσ + C 2 σ, where C 1 and C 2 are constants which determine {{the shape of the}} curves and related to materials, and the value of parameter Z represents the magnitude deviated from the master curve which corresponds with the deterioration in rupture properties. As the deterioration in rupture properties closely connects with the degradation of microstructure, namely the <b>spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbides</b> in pearlite style steel, a linear relationships have been found between the value of Z-parameter and the level of spheroidi-zation E which can be expressed as: Z = a 1 + a 2 E...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tempering}} temperature, {{within the range}} of 400 to 700 °C, on the microstructure and hardness of two super-bainitic steels, one as the control parent sample and the other with added Co & Al was investigated. Post-tempering examinations of the super-bainitic samples showed that low temperature tempering cycles (400 – 500 °C) resulted in carbides formation, and some increases in the hardness possibly due to precipitation strengthening in the Co & Al contained steel. Once the tempering temperature increased to 600 °C, the hardness plummeted in both steels due to the concurrent coarsening of the bainitic ferrite plates and more precipitation of carbides. At the higher tempering temperature of 700 °C, further reduction in the hardness occurred because of the accelerated recovery of ferrite and <b>spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbides.</b> This work clearly showed that the super-bainitic steel containing Co & Al had a superior tempering resistance particularly at low tempering temperatures (< 500 °C) due to reduced carbide precipitation in the presence of Co & Al...|$|E

Meanwhile, the morphology of M 2 C evolves from the plate-like shape into the fibrous one. Compared with the plate-like M 2 C, the fibrous M 2 C is less stable at high temperatures, which promotes the <b>spheroidization</b> and refinement <b>of</b> <b>carbides.</b> Therefore, M 2 steels modified by calcium obtain higher hardness and red-hardness after heat treatment than those without the addition of calcium...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of Cr and Al (strong ferrite formers) on the strain-induced γ-to-pearlite transformation in eutectoid steels. The microstructure evolution during the hot deformation of three eutectoid steel grades was investigated using hot torsion testing. More specifically, the steels were deformed to strain levels varying from ε = 0, 5 to ε = 1, 5 at their specific Ar 1 temperature. Hot deformation of the undercooled austenite leads to strain-induced γ-topearlite transformation and to the almost instantaneous <b>spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> the formed <b>carbides.</b> The corresponding microstructures consist of submicronic cementite particles and ferritic grains that are 1 - 5 μm in size.

40|$|AbstractA non-circular drawing {{sequence}} {{was investigated}} for manufacturing {{medium carbon steel}} wires with improved <b>spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> cementite for better cold workability compared to those produced by the conventional wire drawing. The wire drawing and non-circular drawing processes with 20 % area reduction per each pass were numerically and experimentally applied up to the fourth pass (total area reduction of 59 %). The drawn wire by the non-circular drawing sequence shows higher average effective strain value than {{the one of the}} wire drawing in the numerical result. To investigate the effect of prior cold working on <b>spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> the drawn wire, spheroidization annealing was conducted at subcritical temperature of 705 oC for 2 h for both processes. According to the present investigation, the wires subject to subcritical annealing following the non-circular drawing sequence showed the reduced ultimate tensile strength and micro-hardness, and the enhanced reduction of area compared to those for the wire drawing. From upsetting test results, cold workability was also improved for the annealed specimen processed by the non-circular drawing sequence compared to the one produced by the wire drawing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate microstructure changes during spheroidization annealing. Owing to the SEM results, the <b>spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> the annealed specimens processed by the non-circular drawing sequence was improved than the one produced by the wire drawing.

40|$|Abstract：Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) in a fully {{pearlitic}} structured steel 65 Mn {{was successfully}} {{carried out at}} 923 K via route C in this study. The severe shear deformation of ECAP was accommodated by periodical bending, periodical shearing and shearing fracture etc in the pearlitic lamellae. The cementite in the pearlite has higher plastic deformation capability. Excessive imperfections may be introduced into the cementite, which supplies additional energy driving for the following <b>spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> cementite in subsequent processing.

Fine and coarse pearlite microstructures were obtained by appropriate heat treatments according to the TTT diagram of SK 85 {{high carbon steel}}. Hot rolled plates of SK 85 steel were austenitized at 800 oC for 2 hrs and then put directly into a salt bath at either 570 oC or 670 oC to obtain a fine pearlite (FP) structure and a coarse pearlite (CP) structure, respectively. Cold rolling was subsequently conducted on those specimens with reduction ratios from 0. 2 to 0. 4.

30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the visible surface of iron particles is close to spherical under the form. Special studies [30] showed that even at room temperature, crystals of various metals under the action of surface tension forces change their form {{in the direction of}} reducing their external surface. However, at low temperatures, this process proceeds very slowly and becomes noticeable only after a long time (several months). <b>Spheroidization</b> <b>of</b> iron particles proceeds much faster at temperatures of CNTs formation and microscopic size of iron particles. Apparently, many times, repeating cycles of iron oxidation-reduction also plays a big role in the process <b>of</b> <b>spheroidization</b> which leads to a weakening of the bonds between the atoms in the crystal lattice and thereby contributes for intensification of their self-diffusion.|$|R
