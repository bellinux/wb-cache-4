I ain't reached that mood." [...] In his reply, Pound pointed out that Hemingway had only lost [...] "the time it will... take you to rewrite the parts you can remember... If the middle, i.e., FORM, of the story is right then one {{ought to be able to}} reassemble it from memory... If the thing wobbles and won't reform... then it never wd. have been right." [...] Critics are uncertain whether he took Pound's advice and re-created existing stories or whether everything he wrote after the loss of the suitcase was new.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear {{what she has to say}} and the women feel like they can <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> men as well".|$|E
500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E

500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
2500|$|In late March 2011, it {{was noted}} that Chris Jericho was very {{critical}} of Zbyszko and his announcing capabilities during his tenure in WCW in his latest book. When this was brought to his attention, Larry proceeded to challenge Jericho to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his face, and questioned his manhood in a popular internet video. Zbyszko stated in another video that the reason for Jericho's disrespect was because he could not use the phrase [...] "The Living Legend" [...] in the WWE because it has been used and trademarked by Zbyszko. On March 17, 2012, In Caribou, Maine Zbyszko defeated Ryan Michaels in a lumberjack match to retain the All Out Mayhem Heavyweight Championship. He would lose the title a month later to Gino Martino in Gray, Maine.|$|E
2500|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right. I said {{a lot of things in}} the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly [...] "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: [...] "I'm still waiting [...] to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] To this Ali responded: [...] "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{the modern}} style in which {{multiple}} sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game {{except for the}} 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died {{in his hotel room}} following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, [...] "Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one. And I <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you as best I can with a broken heart." ...|$|E

[...] "In I Honestly Love You (No Not You)", Miley {{believes}} that Oliver {{is in love}} with her when she overhears him (while asleep in the hospital because of a broken ankle) say [...] "I love you". However, after a talk with her dad she thinks that Oliver will move on and so will Lilly but when Lilly announces that she {{is in love with}} Oliver, Miley ends up telling her the truth. Lilly and Miley hatch a plan to get Oliver back but only to find out that he was practicing saying [...] "I love you" [...] so he could <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Lilly. They both say that they love each other in the end of the episode. (It is mentioned in this episode that neither Oliver nor Miley have romantic feelings for each other). However, Oliver did used to have romantic feelings towards Hannah Montana before he knew she was Miley. Miley,at first, didn't want to tell him who she was, just in case he had romantic feelings for her as Miley, but when she eventually told him, he saw her as just a friend.|$|E
