2500|$|Another {{study was}} done where {{the onset of}} athetoid {{movement}} followed a thalamic stroke. The thalamus {{is part of a}} pathway that is involved with the cortical feedback loop in which signals from the cortex are relayed through the striatum, pallidus and thalamus before making it back to the cortex. The striatum receives excitatory inputs from the cortex and inhibits the pallidum. By doing so it frees the thalamus from pallidal inhibition allowing the thalamus to send excitatory outputs to the cortex. Therefore, the lesions to the thalamus or any other part of this feedback loop can result in movement disorders as they can alter the reactivity of one towards the other. [...] Also, in a case of people with thalamic stroke, a majority suffered severe sensory deficits and ataxia. It is proposed that this loss of proprioception and the ensuing loss of <b>synergic</b> stabilization may also lead to abnormal movements, such as those dealt with in athetosis.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "human scale development" [...] work of Right Livelihood Award-winning Chilean {{economist}} Manfred Max Neef {{promotes the}} idea of development based upon fundamental human needs, which {{are considered to be}} limited, universal and invariant to all human beings (being a part of our human condition). He considers that poverty results from the failure to satisfy a particular human need, it is not just an absence of money. Whilst human needs are limited, Max Neef shows that the ways of satisfying human needs is potentially unlimited. Satisfiers also have different characteristics: they can be violators or destroyers, pseudosatisfiers, inhibiting satisfiers, singular satisfiers, or <b>synergic</b> satisfiers. Max-Neef shows that certain satisfiers, promoted as satisfying a particular need, in fact inhibit or destroy the possibility of satisfying other needs: e.g., the arms race, while ostensibly satisfying the need for protection, in fact then destroys subsistence, participation, affection and freedom; formal democracy, which is supposed to meet the need for participation often disempowers and alienates; commercial television, while used to satisfy the need for recreation, interferes with understanding, creativity and identity. <b>Synergic</b> satisfiers, on the other hand, not only satisfy one particular need, but also lead to satisfaction in other areas: some examples are breastfeeding; self-managed production; popular education; democratic community organizations; preventative medicine; meditation; educational games.|$|E

5000|$|A {{detailed}} comparison among PEI {{and other}} amino-containing molecules showed an excellence performance of PEI-containing samples with cycles. Also, {{only a slight}} decrease was registered in their CO2 uptake when increasing the temperature from 25 to 100°C, demonstrating a high contribution of chemisorption to the adsorption capacity of these solids. For the same reason, the adsorption capacity under diluted CO2 was up to 90% of the value under pure CO2 and also, a high unwanted selectivity towards SO2 was observed. Lately, many efforts {{have been made in}} order to improve PEI diffusion within the porous structure of the support used. A better dispersion of PEI and a higher CO2 efficiency (CO2/NH molar ratio) were achieved by impregnating a template-occluded PE-MCM-41 material rather than perfect cylindrical pores of a calcined material, following a previously described route. The combined use of organosilanes such as aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, AP, and PEI has also been studied. The first approach used a combination of them to impregnate porous supports, achieving faster CO2-adsorption kinetics and higher stability during reutilization cycles, but no higher efficiencies. A novel method is the so-called [...] "double-functionalization". It is based on the impregnation of materials previously functionalized by grafting (covalent bonding of organosilanes). Amino groups incorporated by both paths have shown <b>synergic</b> effects, achieving high CO2 uptakes up to 235 mg CO2/g (5.34 mmol CO2/g). CO2 adsorption kinetics were also studied for these materials, showing similar adsorption rates than impregnated solids. This is an interesting finding, taking into account the smaller pore volume available in double-functionalized materials. Thus, it can be also concluded that their higher CO2 uptake and efficiency compared to impregnated solids can be ascribed to a <b>synergic</b> effect of the amino groups incorporated by two methods (grafting and impregnation) rather than to a faster adsorption kinetics.|$|E
50|$|Uranyl nitrate, UO2(NO3)2, can be {{extracted}} from aqueous solution into diethyl ether.

For this reason only uranyl and other actinyl ions, including the plutonyl ion, , can {{be extracted}} from mixtures containing other ions. Replacing the water molecules that are bound to the uranyl ion in aqueous solution by a second, hydrophobic, ligand increases the solubility of the neutral complex in the organic solvent.

50|$|Conversely, plutonyl is {{more easily}} reduced than uranyl. This {{difference}} is utilized in {{the separation of}} plutonium from uranium in the PUREX process, as described below. The plutonyl ion is always associated with other ligands. The most common arrangement is for the so-called equatorial ligands to lie in a plane perpendicular to the O-Pu-O line and passing through the plutonium atom. With four ligands, as in PuO2Cl42− the plutonium has a distorted octahedral environment, with a square of ligand atoms in the equatorial plane. In plutonyl nitrate, PuO2(NO3)22H2O, as in uranyl nitrate there is a hexagon of six ligand atoms in the equatorial plane, four oxygen atoms from bidentate nitrate ions and two oxygens from the water molecules. Plutonyl nitrate, like uranyl nitrate, is soluble in diethyl ether. The complex that is extracted has no electrical charge. This {{is the most important}} factor in making the complex soluble in organic solvents. Also the water molecules are replaced by ether molecules.

5000|$|In Sanskrit Anahata means [...] "sound {{produced}} {{without touching}} two parts" [...] {{and at the}} same time it means [...] "pure" [...] or [...] "clean, stainless".

At the level of Anahata chakra appears the possibility to integrate the two opposite forces and in this way to obtain the effect (sound, in this case), without the two forces to be confronted(without touching of the two parts). This energy is specific to cooperation and integration, which brings peace and a new perspective in a world which, up to this level (considering only the energies specific to the first three centres of force: Muladhara, Swasdhistana and Manipura) was made only of a more or less conscious confrontation between opposite forces.

5000|$|Both linear and {{branched}} polyethylenimine {{have been}} used for CO2 capture, frequently impregnated over porous materials. First use of PEI polymer in CO2 capture was devoted to improve the CO2 removal in space craft applications, impregnated over a polymeric matrix. After that, the support was changed to MCM-41, an hexagonal mesostructured silica, and large amounts of PEI were retained in the so-called [...] "molecular basket". MCM-41-PEI adsorbent materials led to higher CO2 adsorption capacities than bulk PEI or MCM-41 material individually considered. The authors claim that, in this case, a <b>synergic</b> effect takes place due to the high PEI dispersion inside the pore structure of the material. As a result of this improvement, further works were developed to study more in depth the behaviour of these materials. Exhaustive works have been focused on the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as the CO2/O2 and CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity of several MCM-41-PEI materials with PEI polymers. Also, PEI impregnation has been tested over different supports such as a glass fiber matrix [...] and monoliths. However, for an appropriate performance under real conditions in post-combustion capture (mild temperatures between 45-75°C and the presence of moisture) it is necessary to use thermally and hydrothermally stable silica materials, such as SBA-15, which also presents an hexagonal mesostructure. Moisture and real world conditions have also been tested when using PEI-impregnated materials to adsorb CO2 from the air.|$|E

Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times referred to the film as [...] "knowledgeable about {{the city and the}} people who make accommodations with it. It shows us how boring that obligatory evil kingpin is in so many other crime movies". He explained, it comprises [...] "characters who do wrong and are therefore bad, but it doesn't really have 'villains' in the usual movie sense of the word. It's too smart and grown up for such lazy categories". In the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Stack wrote that [...] "The film's setup is intense, full of fearsome action, a pulse-pumper. But soon it becomes a thinking man's police drama about the political aftermath of the botched drug-lord case." [...] Left unmoved, he declared that although [...] "Lumet and his fine cast play it out in a moody, hard-boiled style, Night Falls on Manhattan falls flat. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, said the film unfolds [...] "less in the gritty world of New York law enforcement than in the implausible tabloid imagination of Robert Daley, on whose pulp novel the film is based." [...] He did though positively comment that [...] "Night Falls on Manhattan makes you nostalgic for Lumet's truly first-rate corruption movies, like the great, underrated Q&A (1990)." [...] In a slightly negative tone, Barbara Shulgasser of the San Francisco Examiner, thought Lumet's [...] "seriousness and simplicity with which he approaches his subject in Night Falls on Manhattan are refreshing even if the vivacity of the thing never really has a chance to develop." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews viewed the film as being [...] "savvy about a number of things." [...] He claimed that [...] "Not only does it have a good feel for both sides of the police corruption issue, but it's aware of the political rivalries and behind-the-scenes dealmaking that keeps a city running." [...] In his overall summation, he wrote [...] "Sidney Lumet has done something that I wasn't sure was possible in this age of instant, formulaic gratification: make a riveting cop movie without a car chase and a courtroom thriller without cheap theatrics." [...] Adding to the positive sentiment, Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times, said the story was [...] "a string of unlikely events and coincidences" [...] which [...] "set off Night Falls, and Lumet makes them believable the old-fashioned way: through interaction with a screen full of strongly drawn, fully dimensioned, psychologically valid characters." [...] Writing for Time Out, author SGr exclaimed, [...] "Lumet has made 40-odd films, some classic, some lousy. This isn't by any means". He commended how actor [...] "Dreyfuss shines as a radical defence attorney." [...] Not entirely enthusiastic about certain elements of the plot was Andy Klein writing for the Dallas Observer. He flatly wrote, [...] "As satisfying as much of the film is, there are a few missteps, large and small, that may require indulgence on the part of viewers." [...] Describing a lighthearted position on its positive attributes, Mike Clark of USA Today felt [...] "Lumet (who also wrote the script) seems to feed on lousy cop-precinct furniture, political showboating and confrontations between street-savvy adversaries played by <b>synergic</b> actors." [...] On an entirely negative front, Russell Smith of The Austin Chronicle remarked that [...] "Lumet and Daley simply appear to have forgotten everything they once knew about lean, reality-based storytelling—a fact that no amount of bluster, superstar charisma, and stylistic virtuosity can conceal." [...] Smith added, [...] "Expected story developments fail to materialize, and others drop from the blue sky with no apparent rationale. Equally annoying is the film's inability to decide whether it wants to be a conventional melodrama—a view the manically overacting Holm and Ferrer obviously subscribe to—or a dark, nihilistic satire in the vein of other Lumet films such as Network." ...|$|E
