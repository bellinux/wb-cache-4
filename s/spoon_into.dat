5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew {{as soon as he saw}} Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped his}} <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> the {{bowl with a}} clatter. He looked up, the very picture of amazement and consternation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your breakfast, sir," [...] I answered. I {{set down}} the plate and the pot before him and pressed the pewter <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> his hand.|$|E

60|$|So Gambouge shovelled {{dish and}} <b>spoons</b> <b>into</b> the flap of his surtout, {{and ran down}} stairs as if the Devil were behind him--as, indeed, he was.|$|R
6000|$|And hastily {{gathering}} up {{the package of}} samples, the restaurant keeper walked to the open doorway and flung knives, forks and <b>spoons</b> <b>into</b> the muddy gutter! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Mr. Plunkett," [...] cried Morgan, conquering his mirth, [...] "the {{dinner is}} getting, cold. Let us {{sit down and}} eat. I am anxious to get my <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> that shark-fin soup. Business afterward." ...|$|E
60|$|A small dose {{of whiskey}} {{strengthened}} him, {{so that he}} could dip a <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> the sugar caddy which Malemute Kid placed before him. After his appetite had been somewhat cloyed, Prince, shuddering as he did so, passed him a mug of weak beef tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what if he}} didn't, Biddy?" [...] {{said his}} Honour the Mayor; [...] "a good thing's a good thing, and here goes!" [...] {{wherewith}} he plunged his <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> the savoury mess. The Mayoress, as we have said, dared not; but she hated Lady Gorgon, and remembered it at the next election.|$|E

25|$|The choux pastry paste is piped {{through a}} pastry bag or dropped {{with a pair}} of <b>spoons</b> <b>into</b> small balls and baked to form largely hollow puffs. After cooling, the baked profiteroles are {{injected}} with filling using a pastry bag and narrow piping tip, or by slicing off the top, filling them, and reassembling. For sweet profiteroles, additional glazes or decorations may then be added.|$|R
60|$|Joe's {{station and}} {{influence}} were something feebler (if possible) {{when there was}} company than when there was none. But he always aided and comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty of gravy to-day, Joe <b>spooned</b> <b>into</b> my plate, at this point, about half a pint.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain was}} helped to pudding in a soup plate, that being {{relatively}} a rather small dessert plate for him. He {{was about to}} plunge the dessert <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> it, but stopped suddenly and gazed at it. Then he turned his awful gaze on the small servant who almost shrank before it.|$|E
60|$|But two moments stand vividly {{out of its}} unreality--and each of them to my shame. A small, wreathed, silver-gilt dish {{was placed}} before me. Automatically I thrust my <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> its jelly, and pecked at the flavourless morsels. Sheer {{nervousness}} had deprived me of my sense of taste. But {{there was something in}} Mrs Monnerie's sly silence, and Lord Chiltern's solemn monocle, and Percy's snigger, that set me speculating.|$|E
60|$|Even the {{children}} were instructed, each to dip a wooden <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> Mr. Micawber's pot, and pledge us in its contents. When this was done, my aunt and Agnes rose, and parted from the emigrants. It was a sorrowful farewell. They were all crying; {{the children}} hung about Agnes to the last; and we left poor Mrs. Micawber in a very distressed condition, sobbing and weeping by a dim candle, that must have made the room look, from the river, like a miserable light-house.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they all}} formed a circle round the kid; and {{one after the}} other, with great regularity, dipped their <b>spoons</b> <b>into</b> the mush, and after {{stirring}} them round {{a little in the}} molasses-pool, they swallowed down their mouthfuls, and smacked their lips over it, as if it tasted very good; which I have no doubt it did; but not having any spoon, I wasn't sure.|$|R

5000|$|On 16 November 1837, he and 25 {{others were}} charged with high treason. The {{following}} month, on 4 December 1837, Louis-Joseph Papineau and Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan joined Nelson at Saint-Denis where they decided to resist arrest, procure arms and ammunition {{for the people and}} declare the independence of Lower Canada. It was around this time that Nelson exclaimed, [...] "The time has come, to melt our <b>spoons</b> <b>into</b> bullets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Didn't I {{say that}} fish would be delicious?' she cried; and {{plunging}} her <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> the dish the girl helped {{herself to a}} large piece. But the instant it touched her mouth a cold shiver ran through her. Her head seemed to flatten, and her eyes to look oddly round the corners; her legs and her arms were stuck to her sides, and she gasped wildly for breath. With a mighty bound she sprang {{through the window and}} fell into the river, where she soon felt better, and was able to swim to the sea, which was close by.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{the water}} in the pot began to boil. Peegwish put in a large {{proportion}} of barley, lighted his pipe, and sat down to await the result with the patience of a Stoic. Wildcat sat beside him with equal patience. An hour passed, Peegwish dipped a wooden <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> the pot and tasted. The result was not satisfactory--it burnt his lips. He let the spoonful cool, and tried again. The liquid was marvellously like barley-broth, with which delicacy he was well acquainted. Another hour passed; again he dipped the spoon, and again met with disappointment, for his brew was not yet beer. The sun went down, the moon arose, the stars came out, and still Peegwish and Wildcat sat watching and dozing over the big pot.|$|E
60|$|It was {{an apple}} {{marshmallow}} sundae, I recollect. I dug my <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> {{it with an}} assumption of gaiety which I was far from feeling. The first mouthful almost nauseated me. It was like cold hair-oil. But I stuck to it. I could not break down now. I {{could not bear to}} forfeit the newly-won esteem of my comrades. They were gulping their sundaes down with the speed and enjoyment of old hands. I set my teeth, and persevered, and by degrees a strange exhilaration began to steal over me. I felt that I had burnt my boats and bridges; that I had crossed the Rubicon. I was reckless. I ordered another round. I was the life and soul of that party.|$|E
60|$|I {{ran into}} the kitchen and huddled our four silver <b>spoons</b> <b>into</b> my pocket; then took the unlucky book with the bank-notes {{and put it in the}} bosom of my dress. I was {{determined}} to defend the property confided to my care with my life. Just as I had secured the pocketbook I heard the door splintering, and rushed into the passage again with my heavy kitchen poker lifted in both hands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{noted in a}} {{question}} on NPR's popular news quiz show Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me. Host of the show Peter Sagal explained that The Malibu Beach Vampires is widely acclaimed by those few who have seen {{it as one of}} the worst movies ever made. One internet reviewer said, [...] "Were I a weaker man, I most likely would have jammed grapefruit <b>spoons</b> <b>into</b> my eyes and then blindly flung myself to my death in oncoming traffic after watching this." ...|$|R
50|$|The word chorreador {{is related}} to the Spanish verb , meaning to drip or trickle, and refers to the action of hot water seeping through the coffee grounds and {{dripping}} out. A coffee cup or pot is placed {{on the bottom of the}} stand, and fine to medium-fine ground coffee is <b>spooned</b> <b>into</b> a dry bolsita. This is then suspended from the top of the stand so it hangs over the container. Boiling water is poured slowly over the coffee grounds, and the liquid seeps through, making coffee, which drips into the waiting container.|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{was allowed}} to pour out Oscar's {{medicine}} but herself. She knew when the <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> which {{it was to be}} measured was full, by the sound which the liquid made in falling into it. When he was able to sit up in his bed, and when she was standing at the pillow-side, she could tell him how near his head was to hers, by the change which he produced, when he bent forward or when he drew back, in the action of the air on her face. In the same way, she knew as well as he knew, when the sun was out and when it was behind a cloud--judging by the differing effect of the air, at such times, on her forehead and on her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not mean}} that?" [...] said St. Barbe; [...] "of course, I was only jesting. It is not likely that I should say or do {{anything}} disagreeable to those whom I look upon as my patrons--I may say friends--through life. It makes me almost weep when I remember my early connection with Mr. Ferrars, now an under-secretary of state, and who will mount higher. I {{never had a chance}} of being a minister, though I suppose I am not more incapable than others who get the silver <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> their mouths. And then his divine sister! Quite an heroic character! I never had a sister, and so I never had even a chance of being nearly related to royalty. But so it has been throughout my life. No luck, my lord; no luck. And then they say one is misanthropical. Hang it! who can help being misanthropical when he finds everybody getting on in life except himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Morning, Jimmy," [...] {{said the}} mate, {{as the man}} brought him and Lemuel their portions. [...] "I hate to have the dining-room chairs off a paintin' when there's so much style about {{everything}} else, and I've got a visitor with me. But I tell him he'll have to take us as he finds us, and stand it this mornin'." [...] He wasted no more words on his joke, but plunging his large tin <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> his bowl, kept his breath to cool his broth, blowing upon it with easy grace, and swallowing it at a tremendous rate, though Lemuel, after following his example, still found it so hot that it brought the tears into his eyes. It was delicious, and he was ravenous from his twenty-four hours' fast, but his companion was scraping {{the bottom of his}} bowl before Lemuel had got half-way down, and he finished his second as Lemuel finished his first.|$|E
50|$|Malpua in {{northern}} India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, don't contain fruit. There are several variations, using {{some or all}} of the following ingredients: maida (refined flour), semolina, milk, and yogurt. The batter is left to stand for a few hours before being <b>spooned</b> <b>into</b> a kadhai of hot oil to form a bubbling pancake which should be crisp around the edges. The pancakes are then immersed in a thick sugar syrup. Malpua is a popular sweet to make on the Hindu religious occasion of Holi. Malpua along with mutton curry is served in many non-vegetarian Maithil homes during Holi.|$|R

50|$|In 2013, {{the remains}} of two teenaged Austrian First World War {{soldiers}} {{were found on the}} Presena glacier. One of them carried a <b>spoon</b> tucked <b>into</b> his puttees, apparently a common practice amongst soldiers eating out of communal pots.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Cot," [...] {{said the}} Captain, [...] "my {{exceedingly}} goot and excellent friend, and I {{am happy to}} do such a favour for you! And it's well you have thought of it yourself; because, {{if it had not}} been for some of our very goot and excellent friends, that would be putting their <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> other folk's dish, I should have been asking you a civil question myself, how you came to dine with us, with all that mud and mire which Mr. Tyrrel's grasp has left upon the collar of your coat--you understand me.--But it is much better as it is, and I will go to the man with all the speed of light; and though, to be sure, it should have been sooner thought of, yet let me alone to make an excuse for that, just in my own civil way--better late thrive than never do well, you know, Sir Bingo; and if you have made him wait a little while for his morning, you must give him the better measure, my darling." ...|$|E
6000|$|The swineherd {{dropped his}} wooden <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> the {{bowl with a}} clatter. [...] "Potstausand!"

If it should come to our Lord Baron's ears he would cut the tongue from out thy head and my head from off my {{shoulders}} for it. Dost thou think I am going to meddle in such a matter as this? Listen! these proud Baron folk, with their masterful ways, drive our sort hither and thither; they beat us, they drive us, they kill us as they choose. Our lives are not as much to them {{as one of my}} black swine. Why should I trouble my head if they choose to lop and trim one another? The fewer there are of them the better for us, say I. We poor folk have a hard enough life of it without thrusting our heads into the noose to help them out of their troubles. What thinkest thou would happen to us if Baron Henry should hear of our betraying his affairs to the Red-beard?" ...|$|E
60|$|Over this chamber, which {{contained}} what his soul longed after, {{and over the}} president's rooms, there ran a set of unoccupied garrets, into which the dexterous Cartouche penetrated. These were divided from the rooms below, according to the fashion of those days, {{by a set of}} large beams, which reached across the whole building, and across which rude planks were laid, which formed the ceiling of the lower story and the floor of the upper. Some of these planks did young Cartouche remove; and having descended by means of a rope, tied a couple of others to the neck of the honey-pots, climbed back again, and drew up his prey in safety. He then cunningly fixed the planks again in their old places, and retired to gorge himself upon his booty. And, now, see the punishment of avarice! Everybody knows that the brethren of the order of Jesus are bound by a vow to have no more than a certain small sum of money in their possession. The principal of the college of Clermont had amassed a larger sum, in defiance of this rule: and where do you think the old gentleman had hidden it? In the honey-pots! As Cartouche dug his <b>spoon</b> <b>into</b> one of them, he brought out, besides a quantity of golden honey, a couple of golden louis, which, with ninety-eight more of their fellows, were comfortably hidden in the pots. Little Dominic, who, before, had cut rather a poor figure among his fellow-students, now appeared in as fine clothes as any of them could boast of; and when asked by his parents, on going home, how he came by them, said that a young nobleman of his schoolfellows had taken a violent fancy to him, and made him a present of a couple of his suits. Cartouche the elder, good man, went to thank the young nobleman; but none such could be found, and young Cartouche disdained to give any explanation of his manner of gaining the money.|$|E
50|$|Using incense seal clocks {{requires}} {{a period of}} preparation. A fine layer of damp white wood ash is first laid down in a small container, flattened, and lightly compacted. Seals {{that were in the}} form of patterned metal stencils were simply laid down on the ash while the incense powder was poured over it. After a light compaction of the incense powder by a tamper, lifting up the metal seal forms a long trail of incense powder that has been masked onto the ash. Other seals have a protruded pattern that creates a negative indentation in the wood ash. The incense powder is carefully <b>spooned</b> <b>into</b> the indentation in the ash and then recompacted again with the seal.|$|R

There {{are many other}} popular variations depending on regional and cultural affiliations. Popular tea brews in Assam are Sah, Ronga Sah (red tea without milk) and Gakhir Sah (milk tea). In West Bengal and Bangladesh it is called Cha. In Hindi speaking north India, popular tea brews are Masala Chai, Kadak Chai (typically {{a feature of the}} mountain community of North India, this is a very strongly brewed tea, {{almost to the point of}} bitterness), Malai Mar Ke Chai (where a generous dollop of full fat cream is <b>spooned</b> <b>into</b> the cup of tea) are some of the more popular variations.|$|R
