Semantic Web {{supports}} a fire-new infrastructure for {{solving the problem}} of <b>semantic</b> information <b>interoperability,</b> and it promises to support an intelligent and automatic information-processing platform for multi-agent system whose ultimate objective is to provide better services for end-users, for example, interoperable information query. Therefore, except agent-to-agent interaction in multi-agent system, there is human-to-agent interaction. To unify the two kinds of interaction, this paper introduces Q language- a scenario description language for designing interaction among agents and users. A Q-based architecture, which inte-grates ontology servers, ontology-mapping servers, semantic information sources, and multi-agent query system, {{is presented as a}} system solu-tion to <b>semantic</b> information <b>interoperability</b> on <b>Semantic</b> Web. Further-more, we investigate key technologies of interoperability: domain ontol-ogy, ontology-mapping service, and related multi-agent system, and give an implementation to demonstrate how our architecture works. ...|$|R

Enterprise {{interoperability}} in distributed environments {{has been}} recently improved by adopting the emerging Web Service standards and technology, making an ever-growing number of services {{available on the}} web. One of the major problems in this framework is how to make effective and efficient the process of matching service descriptions {{in order to find}} suitable available services for a given service request. <b>Semantic</b> service <b>interoperability</b> is thus a main research issue. In the paper, we propose the Semantic Driven Service Discovery approach for open P 2 P systems, where peers are organized in a <b>semantic</b> community for <b>interoperability</b> purposes. In the approach, ontologies are introduced to express domain knowledge related to service descriptions and to guide service discovery by mapping/matching service requests against service entertainments according to defined inter-peer semantic links. ...|$|R

There are numerous companies and public offices involved in the exploitation of a new oil field, {{and there is a}} high degree of specialization among them. Even though standardization has been considered important in this industry for many years, there is still very little integration across phases and across disciplines. An industrially driven consortium launched the Integrated Information Platform project in 2004, in which semantic standards based on OWL and Semantic Web technologies were to be developed for the subsea {{petroleum industry}}.
