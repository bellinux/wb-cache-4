40|$|The paper {{discusses}} thermodynamic phenomena {{accompanying the}} flow of gas in a <b>slotted</b> <b>seal.</b> The analysis of the gas flow has been described based on an irreversible adiabatic transformation. A model based on the equation of total enthalpy balance has been proposed. The iterative process of the model aims at obtaining such a gas temperature distribution that will fulfill the continuity equation.

Since the process stability {{in terms of a}} constant feed rate is not guaranteed for high plunging depths, this paper focuses on an experimental approach to investigate interdependencies between common process control strategies and process output parameters (e. g. feed rate, surface integrity) during the machining of cavities with high aspect ratios in the intermetallic alloy TNM-B 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} thermomechanical {{strength of}} modern materials for aerospace industry {{is accompanied by}} a challenging conventional machinability via cutting. This applies particularly to γ-TiAl alloys. In principle Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) processes are ideal for machining these materials, since they are independent of the material's mechanical properties and capable of machining complex structures. <b>Seal</b> <b>slots</b> in blades of compressors and turbines are one example. Manufacturers of EDM machine tools do not provide adapted technologies for processing γ-TiAl alloys, so end users are forced to configure and develop specific EDM processes by themselves. Therefore it is indispensable to develop fundamental knowledge about EDM-machining of γ-TiAl alloys. To acquire this knowledge the interdependency of material, process-related parameters and productivity is examined. The analysis is focusing on two different γ-TiAl alloys...|$|R

40|$|Feather <b>seals</b> (also called <b>slot</b> <b>seals)</b> {{typically}} found in turbine stators limit leakage from the platform {{into the core}} cavities and from the shroud to the case. They are of various geometric shapes, yet all are contoured to fit the aerodynamic shape of the stator and placed as close as thermomechanically reasonable the powerstream flow passage. Oscillations engendered in the compressor or combustor alter the steady leakage characteristics of these sealing elements {{and in some instances}} generate flow instabilities downstream of the seal interface. In this study, a generic feather seal geometry was studied numerically by imposing an upstream harmonic pressure disturbance on the simulated stator-blade gap. The flow and thermal characteristics were determined; it was found that for high pressure drops, large fluctuations in flows in the downstream blade-stator gap can occur. These leakages and pulsations in themselves are not all that significant, yet if coupled with cavity parameters, they could set up resonance events. Computationally generated time-dependent flow fields are captured in sequence video streaming...|$|R

Guides on the piston would lift it into position and the water pressure would hold it in place behind the train.

These requirements on the engines result in new requirements on components and manufacturing processes, to know: application of new engineering materials, higher component temperatures, increased demands on tightness, 3 -D complex shapes as well as new manufacturing technologies. EDM-machining is typically chosen for applications including complex geometries like high aspect ratio cavities in high-temperature resistant materials, since the EDM-process is independent from the mechanical properties of the processed material. This paper addresses the design and utilization of a unit composed of piezoelectric actuators for machining <b>seal</b> <b>slots</b> in turbine components. This aims the optimization of the flushing mechanisms through vertical vibration of the tool electrod es while manufacturing high aspect ratios cavities and therewith the optimization and/or reduction of both process time and electrode wear. Firstly, the piezo-unit was designed and components like piezoelectric actuators and charge amplifier were chosen, in accordance to previous defined requirements regarding vibration frequencies and amplitudes. During the experimental investigations graphite electrodes were applied. A total of twelve cavities with an aspect ratio of 12 are simultaneously machined in the material MAR- 247. During the process, a harmonic longitudinal vibration of the electrodes overlapped to the machine's feed movement is realized. Both vibration amplitude and frequency were varied during the experiments, ranging from 2 m to 16 m and from 50 Hz to 1 kHz, respectively. The results are compared to the conventional process without vibration, while the EDM-parameters remain unaltered.

40|$|The {{leakage test}} program {{was one of}} such {{supporting}} technology programs structured to provide guidance to the Energy Efficient Engine High Pressure Turbine Component Design Effort. Leakage reduction techniques were identified and evaluated. Test models were used to simulate component leak paths and to evaluate leakage reduction techniques. These models simulated the blade/disk attachment, the vane inner platform attachment, and the vane outer platform attachment combined with the blade outer airseal. Disk blade attachment testing indicated that leakage in this area could be reduced to very low levels by paying careful attention to the tolerances along the contact surface between the blade vibration damper and the blade platform contact surface. The aim of feather seal testing was to achieve a goal for an effective leakage gap of one mil (. 001 inch) per inch of feather seal length. Results indicated that effective gaps even below the goal level were achievable by (1) maintaining close tolerances between feather <b>seals</b> and their <b>slots</b> to minimize end gaps and limit seal rotation, (2) avoiding feather seal overlap, and (3) minimizing feather seal intersections.

40|$|WLCSP bumps have {{traditionally}} been produced by dropping preformed solder spheres through a metal template onto silicon wafers using modified surface mount stencil printers [1]. The squeegee blades associated with these printers have been retrofitted with a special fixture in which spheres are gravity feed down through a narrow slot. This same stencil printer {{is often used to}} apply the flux to the wafer just prior to sphere dropping. Several issues are associated with this technology that limit its widespread use in high volume and high yield applications. These limitations include: 1) there is a practical lower limit to the size of sphere that can be dropped, 2) the <b>seal</b> between the <b>slotted</b> fixturing and the wafer can fail, causing a release of all the spheres into the tool (often referred to as bursts or escapes), and 3) the yields are statistically low. One new WLCSP technology that is showing high promise toward eliminating these issues, is Wafer Level Solder Sphere Transfer (also called Gang Ball Placement) [2]. This technology uses a patterned vacuum plate to simultaneous pick up all of the preformed solder spheres, optically inspect for yield, and then transfer them over to the wafer. This paper will discuss this technology and the process parameters for producing WLCSP bumps. Throughput levels of 25 to 30 wafers per hour were measured. Yield losses of less than 10 ppm were realized for placing 300 µm spheres onto 200 mm wafers with ~ 80, 000 I/Os.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the evaluation of}} Pressure Actuated Leaf Seals (PALS) technology readiness for shaft and shroud sealing in power generation and aerospace applications. Seal designs tested are prototypical and constructed using processes appropriate for volume production. Results include both static and dynamic seal leakage measurements running against a 5. 1 in (129. 54 mm) diameter smooth surface test rotor and another that simulates sealing against turbine blade shrouds. A further test was undertaken using a 2 D static rig that determined acoustic noise experienced during testing was attributed to leaves vibrating at their natural frequency {{as a result of}} inter-leaf gaps. The dynamic simulated shroud test includes steps, duplicating small discontinuities of adjacent shroud <b>sealing</b> surfaces and <b>slots</b> to inject air radially under the seal leaves as may occur between shrouds on blades {{with a high degree of}} reaction. Consistent seal performance over 15 hours confirms suitability for turbine blade tip applications. Controlled deflection of PALS leaves with operating differential pressure is effective for startup rub avoidance in service as well as conformal wear-in sizing of leaf tips with the rotor. Tested leaf tip wear-in of approximately 0. 010 in (0. 25 mm) against rotor discs without hard-face coating, shows potential to eliminate seal misalignment and run-out contributions to operating seal clearance. PALS design features prevent further rubbing contact with the operating rotor after initial wear-in sizing thereby sustaining a small effective seal clearance and prospects for long seal life. Measurements of rotor surface wear tracks from the wear-in process and endurance runs are included as well as rotor and leaf tip photos. Test results support the technology readiness of the PALS concept as a viable, robust, low leakage dynamic seal for select commercial application...|$|R
