He wrote through Twitter [...] "You loved what I gave you last Valentine's #Climax <b>So</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> 'Special delivery from the cloud'Happy Valentine's Day!". [...] "Go Missin'" [...] was released on the day of its announcement through SoundCloud as a free download. The song was produced by Diplo, who previously collaborated with Usher on the track [...] "Climax", which was released as the lead single from the latter's seventh studio album, Looking 4 Myself (2012). [...] "Go Missin'" [...] was later released to Italian radio on February 22, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|.....anything {{that shows}} {{documentation}} {{of the brain and}} vagina connection is going to alarm some feminists.....also feminism has kind of retreated into the academy and sort of embraced the idea that all gender is socially constructed and <b>so</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> a book that is actually looking at science..... though there has been some criticisms of the book from some feminists ... who say, well you can’t look at the science because that means we have to grapple with the science..... to me the feminist task of creating a just world isn’t changed at all by this fascinating neuroscience that shows some differences between men and women.|$|E

[...] Different {{parts of the world}} may have {{different}} dye processes, <b>so</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> where knowledge of when and where a textile originated, as well as a working knowledge of chemistry, can come in handy. [...] If in doubt as to the wash ability of a dye, apply a drop or two of water to an inconspicuous place and blot with a clean white cloth. [...] If the dye transfers to the cloth, even in small amounts, the textile should not be washed.|$|E

2500|$|Levinas {{pointed to}} the Judeo-Christian belief that it was God who first {{commanded}} Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, {{he would not have}} listened to the angel's command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, [...] "transcending ethics" [...] seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable. One interesting consequence of Levinas' critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent. However, one of Kierkegaard's central points in Fear and Trembling was that the religious sphere entails the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always {{in one way or another}} ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn't tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in Stages on Life's Way. I conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, I believe that he approves of intrigues, and what I have read in the sacred books of the Old Testament is not of a sort to dishearten me. The Old Testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to God, and that at a later period Christ said to His disciples, “These things I said not unto you from the beginning … I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now” – <b>so</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth.
