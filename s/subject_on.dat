40|$|SUMMARY Madopar, a {{combination}} of levodopa with benserazide, induced an inconsistent rise in plasma growth hormone in unmedicated patients with Parkinson's disease and in controls, and a greater growth hormone rise in Parkinsonian <b>subjects</b> <b>on</b> chronic Madopar therapy. In <b>subjects</b> <b>on</b> chronic therapy with levodopa and carbidopa (Sinemet), the growth hormone releasing effect of Madopar was blunted. Madopar increased plasma prolactin (PRL) in controls, unmedicated patients and patients on Madopar therapy while in patients on Sinemet therapy the PRL-releasing effect of Madopar was strikingly reduced. Since these data were interpreted as due to a defective dopamine tone in the hypothalamus of Parkinsonian <b>subjects</b> <b>on</b> Madopar but not Sinemet therapy, a direct dopamine receptor agonist, lisuride was administered. Lisuride, however, elicited a blunted growth hormone response both in patients on Madopar and Sinemet therapy, without revealing a state of supersensitivity of dopamine receptors for growth hormone control in Parkinsonian <b>subjects</b> <b>on</b> Madopar therapy. No difference was present in the PRL-lowering effect of lisuride in the different experimental groups. These findings suggest that: (1) hypothalamic dopamine function is impaired in Parkinsonian <b>subjects</b> <b>on</b> Madopar therapy, preserved in unmedicated patients and enhanced in patients on Sinemet therapy; (2) the endocrine effects observed in Parkinsonian <b>subjects</b> <b>on</b> chroni...|$|R

5|$|Maltese courts became British <b>subject</b> <b>on</b> 5 October 1813, {{months before}} the Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. At this point the British, under Governor Thomas Maitland, adopted a {{codification}} of a mixed system of Civil Law, which included Roman Law, Code Napoléon and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltes law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with physical force.|$|E
5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the <b>subject</b> <b>on</b> a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E
5|$|In Edinburgh, Born {{promoted}} {{the teaching of}} mathematical physics. He had two German assistants, E.

Born became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937, and of the Royal Society of London in March 1939. During 1939, he got as many of his remaining friends and relatives still in Germany as he could out of the country, including his sister Käthe, in-laws Kurt and Marga, and the daughters of his friend Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg. Hedi ran a domestic bureau, placing young Jewish women in jobs. Born received his certificate of naturalisation as a British <b>subject</b> <b>on</b> 31 August 1939, one day before the Second World War broke out in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In January 1933, the Nazi Party came {{to power}} in Germany, and Born, who was Jewish, was suspended. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he took a job at St John's College, Cambridge, and wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, as well as Atomic Physics, which soon became a {{standard}} textbook. In October 1936, he became the Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where, working with German-born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, he continued his research into physics. Max Born became a naturalised British <b>subject</b> <b>on</b> 31 August 1939, one day before World War II broke out in Europe. He remained at Edinburgh until 1952.

5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history, with 114million viewers– {{more than the}} game itself, which had 111.3million viewers. According to the Nielsen ratings, the show had a 47.4 household rating; among adults 18–49 it had a 41.5 rating, compared with the game average of 40.5. Reuters noted that the half-hour from 9:30 to 9:58 ET peaked at a 50.7 household rating and a 72 share, with 117.7 million viewers. The record was broken by Bruno Mars in 2014 (115 million) and Katy Perry in 2015 (118 million).
