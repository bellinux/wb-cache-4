5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the <b>sword</b> from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the <b>sword</b> shall never carry a better <b>sword</b> than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the <b>sword</b> from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the <b>sword</b> first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the <b>sword</b> had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} of <b>swords</b> in Japan {{is divided into}} specific time periods: jokoto (ancient <b>swords,</b> until around 900 A.D.), koto (old <b>swords</b> from around 900-1596), shinto (new <b>swords</b> 1596-1780), shinshinto (new new <b>swords</b> 1781-1876), gendaito (modern <b>swords</b> 1876-1945), and shinsakuto (newly made <b>swords</b> 1953-present).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Swords</b> have a {{long history}} in China. Bronze <b>swords</b> have been traced back to the bronze daggers of the Shang dynasty. Bronze long <b>swords</b> {{suddenly}} appeared during the mid-third century BC. Later <b>swords</b> were made of iron or steel. These metals were wrought, never cast. <b>Swords</b> commonly reached a length of 70-100 cm, although longer <b>swords</b> have been found. [...] Chinese iron <b>swords</b> were used in Japan from the third to sixth century AD, but were replaced with Korean and native Japanese <b>swords</b> {{by the middle of the}} Heian era.|$|R

5|$|A later popular Polish legend {{related to}} the history of the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec <b>sword,</b> is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the <b>sword</b> itself was not forged until 200years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Bolesław notched another gate with another <b>sword,</b> thus giving rise to the legend.|$|E
5|$|A legend links Szczerbiec with King Bolesław I the Brave who {{was said}} to have chipped the <b>sword</b> by hitting it against the Golden Gate, Kiev (now in Ukraine) during his {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the <b>sword</b> is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation <b>sword</b> by Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928. During World War II, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Kraków until 1959. In the 20th century, an image of the <b>sword</b> was adopted as a symbol by Polish nationalist and far-right movements.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his <b>sword,</b> the Dark <b>Sword</b> of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark <b>Sword</b> reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark <b>Sword.</b> Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark <b>Sword</b> and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark <b>Sword</b> of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur, Ivy {{was raised by}} the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed <b>sword</b> Soul Edge, and worked himself to death. Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to Ivy {{that she was not}} their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, Ivy learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented <b>sword,</b> bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the <b>sword</b> in later games, Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV. Using an artificial soul to keep herself alive, she acts as a teacher to younger warriors when the <b>sword</b> re-appears years later.|$|E
5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese <b>sword</b> needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a <b>sword</b> guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a <b>sword</b> from damage, from early times on Japanese <b>sword</b> mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
5|$|Infiltrating the Warlock Lord's {{fortress}} in the Skull Mountain, Shea {{reaches the}} <b>sword</b> and unsheathes it. He learns about its true power, {{the ability to}} confront those with the truth about their lives. The Warlock Lord materializes and tries to destroy Shea, but the youth stands his ground and confronts his enemy with the <b>sword.</b> Although immune to physical weapons, the Warlock Lord vanishes after being forced to confront the truth about himself: he had deluded himself into believing that he is immortal, but this is impossible. The <b>Sword</b> forces him to confront this paradox, and it kills him.|$|E

5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark <b>Sword</b> of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark <b>Sword,</b> which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon <b>Sword,</b> defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark <b>Sword</b> then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon <b>Sword</b> revives her. Irene tells Ryu that she felt like she had been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E
5|$|Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's Bar {{telling stories}} of past battles {{to his friend}} Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary <b>Sword</b> of Kahless. The <b>sword</b> is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the <b>Sword.</b> He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the <b>Sword</b> and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the shroud. Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the <b>sword</b> on a planet where the Vulcan team found the shroud.|$|E

5|$|Lobanov-Rostovsky {{ultimately}} sold Szczerbiec to Prince Anatole Demidov {{who kept}} it {{together with the}} rest of the Demidov collection in his Villa San Donato near Florence. In 1870, the <b>sword</b> was bought for 20,000 French francs by Alexander Basilevsky, Russian ambassador to France and great art collector. In 1878, he displayed Szczerbiec at the World's Fair in Paris. By that time, the scabbard had been lost and the <b>sword</b> itself was presented as of Teutonic origin. It was seen by several Polish visitors who speculated whether it could be the Polish coronation <b>sword.</b> In 1884, the entire Basilevsky collection was purchased by Emperor Alexander III of Russia for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Both Polish and other experts at the time expressed doubts as to the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in Russia's largest museum (see Historical replicas below). An international museum congress held in Saint Petersburg in 1913 pronounced the <b>sword</b> a 17th-century replica.|$|E

50|$|The word claymore {{was first}} used in {{reference}} to <b>swords</b> in the 18th century in Scotland and parts of England to refer to basket-hilted <b>swords.</b> This description was maybe not used during the 17th century, when basket hilted <b>swords</b> were the primary military <b>swords</b> across Europe, but these broad-bladed <b>swords</b> remained in service with Scottish regiments for some time longer. After the Acts of Union in 1707 when Scottish and English regiments were integrated together, the <b>swords</b> were seen as a mark of distinction by Scottish officers over the more slender sabres used by their English contemporaries: a symbol of physical strength and prowess, and {{a link to the}} historic Highland way of life. Such <b>swords</b> remained in service with Scottish regiments into the 19th century.|$|R
