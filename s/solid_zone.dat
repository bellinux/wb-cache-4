The determining factors for local cancer control in pulmonary cryoablation were assessed using computed tomography (CT), isothermal curves, and histologic findings in pigs. Experimental findings {{were compared with}} clinical CT findings and were extrapolated to local cancer control outcomes. MethodsCryoablation was performed with thermal monitoring, and the ablated areas were divided into 3 zones: less than − 20 °C, − 20 °C to 0 °C, and greater than 0 °C and were compared with histologic findings. CT findings with multiplanar reconstruction in 36 nodules were compared with the porcine histologic findings. The relationship between CT findings and 3 -year local cancer control was evaluated in 98 nodules. ResultsThe 3 concentric thermal zones correlated with histologic findings as follows: less than − 20 °C zone, complete tissue destruction (zone D); − 20 °C to 0 °C zone (which surrounded zone D), hemorrhage with air trapping and maintenance of alveolar structures (zone H); and greater than 0 °C zone (outermost), edema with sustained alveolar structures (zone E). The CT findings in 36 nodules showed a central <b>solid</b> <b>zone,</b> a surrounding air-containing zone, and an outside <b>solid</b> <b>zone,</b> corresponding to zones D, H, and E, respectively.

40|$|Since {{the float}} zone process {{involves}} two solid-melt interfaces, possible gas interfaces, heat and mass transfers, various driving forces and complex heating sources, {{an analysis of}} the entire process would be very complex.

40|$|International audienceThe {{thermodynamics}} of iron {{clusters of}} various sizes, from 76 to 2452 atoms, {{typical of the}} catalyst particles used for carbon nanotubes growth, has been explored by a flat histogram Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm (called the σ-mapping), developed by Soudan et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 144109 (2011), Paper I]. This method provides the classical density of states, g p (E p) in the configurational space, {{in terms of the}} potential energy of the system, with good and well controlled convergence properties, particularly in the melting phase transition zone which is of interest in this work. To describe the system, an iron potential has been implemented, called “corrected EAM” (cEAM), which approximates the MEAM potential of Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. B 64, 184102 (2001) ] with an accuracy better than 3 meV/at, and a five times larger computational speed. The main simplification concerns the angular dependence of the potential, with a small impact on accuracy, while the screening coefficients S ij are exactly computed with a fast algorithm. With this potential, ergodic explorations of the clusters can be performed efficiently in a reasonable computing time, at least in the upper half of the <b>solid</b> <b>zone</b> and above. Problems of ergodicity exist in {{the lower half of the}} <b>solid</b> <b>zone</b> but routes to overcome them are discussed.

The standard N− 1 / 3 at linear dependence (Pawlow law) is observed for N at > 300, allowing an extrapolation up to the bulk metal at 1940 ± 50 K. For N at < 150, a strong divergence is observed compared to the Pawlow law. The melting transition, which begins at the surface, is stated by a Lindemann-Berry index and an atomic density analysis.

The mine had averaged 2 - 3 falls in the beltway per year and, since the roof injection, no roof falls have occurred.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} the {{thermodynamics}} and structures of iron clusters has been carried on, focusing on small clusters and initial icosahedral and fcc-cuboctahedral structures. Two combined tools are used. First, energy intervals are explored by the Monte Carlo algorithm, called σ-mapping, detailed {{in the work of}} Soudan et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 144109 (2011), Paper I]. In its flat histogram version, it provides the classical density of states, gp(Ep), in terms of the potential energy of the system. Second, the iron system is described by a potential which is called “corrected EAM” (cEAM), explained in the work of Basire et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 141, 104304 (2014), Paper II]. Small clusters from 3 to 12 atoms in their ground state have been compared first with published Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, giving a complete agreement of geometries. The series of 13, 55, 147, and 309 atom icosahedrons is shown to be the most stable form for the cEAM potential. However, the 147 atom cluster has a special behaviour, since decreasing the energy from the liquid zone leads to the irreversible trapping of the cluster in a reproducible amorphous state, 7. 38 eV higher in energy than the icosahedron. This behaviour is not observed at the higher size of 309 atoms. The heat capacity of the 55, 147, and 309 atom clusters revealed a pronounced peak in the <b>solid</b> <b>zone,</b> related to a solid-solid transition, prior to the melting peak. The corresponding series of 13, 55, and 147 atom cuboctahedrons has been compared, underscoring the unstability towards the icosahedral structure. This unstability occurs clearly in several steps for the 147 atom cluster, with a sudden transformation at a transition state. This illustrates the concerted icosahedron-cuboctahedron transformation of Buckminster Fuller-Mackay, which is calculated for the cEAM potential. Two other clusters of initial fcc structures with 24 and 38 atoms have been studied, as well as a 302 atom cluster. Each one relaxes towards a more stable structure without regularity. The 38 atom cluster exhibits a nearly glassy relaxation, through a cascade of six metastable states of long life. This behaviour, as that of the 147 atom cluster towards the amorphous state, shows that difficulties to reach ergodicity in {{the lower half of the}} <b>solid</b> <b>zone</b> are related to particular features of the potential energy landscape, and not necessarily to a too large size of the system. Comparisons of the cEAM iron system with published results about Lennard-Jones systems and DFT calculations are made. The results of the previous clusters have been combined with that of Paper II to plot the cohesive energy Ec and the melting temperature Tm in terms of the cluster atom number Nat. The N− 1 / 3 atNat− 1 / 3 linear dependence of the melting temperature (Pawlow law) is observed again for Nat > 150. In contrast, for Nat < 150, the curve diverges strongly from the Pawlow law, giving it an overall V-shape, with a linear increase of Tm when Nat goes from 55 to 13 atoms. Surprisingly, the 38 atom cluster is anomalously below the overall curve...|$|E

Paraffin wax RT 58 is used as phase change material (PCM), in which metal foams are embedded to enhance the heat transfer. During the melting process, the test samples are electrically heated on the bottom surface with a constant heat flux. The PCM with metal foams has been heated from the solid state to the pure liquid phase. The temperature differences between the heated wall and PCM have been analysed {{to examine the effects}} of heat flux and metal foam structure (pore size and relative density). Compared to the results of the pure PCM sample, the effect of metal foam on solid/liquid phase change heat transfer is very significant, particularly at the <b>solid</b> <b>zone</b> of PCMs. When the PCM starts melting, natural convection can improve the heat transfer performance, thereby reducing the temperature difference between the wall and PCM. The addition of metal foam can increase the overall heat transfer rate by 3 - 10 times (depending on the metal foam structures and materials) during the melting process (two-phase zone) and the pure liquid zone. The tests for investigating the solidification process under different cooling conditions (e. g. natural convection and forced convection) have been carried out. The results show that the use of metal foams can make the sample solidified much faster than pure PCM samples, evidenced by the solidification time being reduced by more than half. In addition, a two-dimensional numerical analysis has been carried out for heat transfer enhancement in PCMs by using metal foams, and the prediction results agree reasonably well with the experimental data...|$|E

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} enhancement for phase change materials (PCMs) has received increasing attention nowadays, {{since most of}} PCMs have low thermal conductivities which prolong the charging and discharging processes. Metal foams, {{as a sort of}} novel material with high thermal conductivity, are believed to be a promising solution to enhance the {{heat transfer}} performance of PCMs for thermal energy storage systems. The effects of natural convection on heat transfer enhancement for PCMs embedded with metal foams are investigated in this paper. The numerical investigation is based on the two-equation non-equilibrium heat transfer model, where the coupled heat conduction and natural convection in PCMs are considered at phase transition and liquid zones. The numerical results are validated by experimental data. In order to investigate the effect of metal foams on heat transfer, two different cases are compared in this study, which are the Case A (PCMs embedded with metal foams) and the Case B (pure PCMs). At the <b>solid</b> <b>zone,</b> heat conduction plays a dominant part because of natural convection's absence, thus metal foams achieve much higher heat conduction rate than pure PCMs, and this {{can be attributed to the}} high thermal conductivity of metal foams skeleton and the heat can be quickly transferred through the foam solid structure to the whole domain of PCMs. At the two-phase zone and liquid zone, natural convection takes place and becomes the dominant heat transfer mode, but metal foam structures suppress the natural convection inside the PCMs owing to big flow resistance in metal foams. In spite of this suppression caused by metal foams, the overall heat transfer performance of Case A is still superior to the counterpart of Case B (pure PCMs), implying the enhancement of heat conduction offsets or exceeds the natural convection loss. The results show that the heat transfer enhancement due to the natural convection in PCMs embedded with metal foams is not as strong as expected, since metal foams have big flow resistance and the natural convection is suppressed. It also shows that better heat transfer performance can be achieved by using the metal foams of smaller porosity and bigger pore density. Last but not least, a series of detailed velocity and temperature profiles are given through numerical solutions, in order to present a vivid evolution of flow field and temperature profiles in the whole melting process...|$|E

40|$|Modeling of {{plasticization}} during {{injection molding}} {{has been a}} complex issue. particularly for the <b>solid</b> conveying <b>zone.</b> This can be further complicated by break-up of the solid-bed due to the reciprocation motion experienced in injection molding. The break-up of the solid-bed can introduce molding quality problems such as inhomogeneities in parts. A transparent barrel system {{has been set up}} for injection molding to observe the solid-bed break-up mechanism and the conditions that influence this process. This paper summarizes some solid-bed break-up results relevant to injection molding. These results may be useful to the modeling community for experimental verification of their simulations, and to the molding community for setting up molding conditions to prevent the occurrence of solid-bed break-up.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 199 – 214 The {{effects of}} {{interstitial}} carbon on the diffusion and mechanical properties of copper and silver are studied theoretically. Semiempirical methodology, atomistic simulations, and first-principles density functional schemes are combined to extract {{some understanding of}} the diffusion process and lattice reconstruction in extremely dilute interstitial Cu–C and Ag–C alloys. It is demonstrated that carbon inclusion in the host matrix leads to sufficient non-uniform dilatation of the lattice. We also show that an account of static displacements {{is important in the}} calculations of the activation energy for the diffusion of the interstitial atoms. The “embedded” cluster scheme is suggested to simulate the relaxation in extremely dilute alloys. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy results are presented, which demonstrate the existence of a <b>solid</b> solution <b>zone</b> at the Cu–C interface...|$|R

INTRODUCTION Small concentrations of impurities in metals are of recognized importance in controlling their mechanical and electrical properties. In metallic conductors like copper, small particle precipitates are found to improve hardness and wear resistance of contacts. Recently dispersion-strengthened copper alloys based upon fine insoluble particles of composition like Cr 2 Nb [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary cardiac tumours are rare. Nearly 70 % {{of primary}} cardiac tumours are benign, the {{majority}} of which are represented by myxomas. The most frequent primary cardiac neoplasm is the angiosarcoma that represents 31 % of primary cardiac malignant. We report a particular clinical case of cardiac angiosarcoma, its light and transmission electron microscopic aspects and {{a review of the}} recent literature. Methods: A 52 years old man died for a severe right ventricle filling deficit caused by an intracavitary tumour originated from the right atrial anterolateral wall. The fragments obtained from autoptic tumoral cardiac tissue were processed for light and electron microscopy. The section were stained with haematoxilineosin, Masson trichromic and Gomori method. An immunohistochemical study for vimentin, Factor VIII related antigen and peroxidase-conjugated lectin from Ulex Europaeus was also performed using the unlabed peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Results: The hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the tumoral mass was composed by a well-differentiated histotype characterized by numerous vascular areas in which neoplastic cells were loosely and irregularly arranged to form incomplete vessels or anastomized blood-filled vascular channels. On the other hand, some less-differentiated solid areas were present and irregularly surrounded the differentiated vascular areas. Results of Ulex Europeaeus Agglutinin I labelling were positive in both solid and vascular areas of the tumour although the positive reaction was less evident in the <b>solid</b> <b>zones</b> Factor VIII related antigen positive cells were less numerous and mainly found in vascular areas. The observation by electron microscopy showed the lack of evident pinocytotic vesicles, the presence of thin and delicate cytoplasmatic processes, Weibel-Palade bodies, and also the disarrangement of the extracellular fibrous matrix. Conclusion: The light microscopy observation and immunohistochemical study underscore that is not easy to obtain information about the level of differentiation of this tumour. The presence of blood-filled lumina and the identification of typical markers of endothelial cells seems to indicate a well-differentiated nature. However, the ultrastructural findings seem to indicate a less differentiated nature...|$|R
