So according to the forming process of asphalt mixture, this paper puts forward the method and principle to evaluate asphalt and stone's adhesion based on the surface energy theory. It evaluates the adhesion properties of asphalt and stone under hydrous and anhydrous conditions respectively. In the anhydrous condition, we choose contact angle and the Gibbs free energy of failure stage as the indexes of evaluating asphalt- stone interface's adhesion properties, while the materials under the hydrous condition, we select cohesional work, contact angle, Gibbs free energy as the indexes of evaluating asphalt-stone system's resistance of moisture...|$|E
30|$|The fibers were {{separately}} {{put into}} a 105  °C oven for 24  h to ensure moisture-free surfaces, and <b>solid</b> <b>asphalt</b> (600  g) stored in a sealed can was preheated at 160  °C for 1  h to liquefy it for mixing. In order to investigate the effects of fibers on asphalt mortar, different fiber contents (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3  wt%) in the asphalt mortar were studied. The fiber content of 0  wt% represented pure asphalt mortar. The fiber was weighed and slowly added to the asphalt under stirring at 500  rpm to prevent the fiber from possibly agglomerating. Then, they were mixed at 160  °C for approximately 30  min under stirring to produce homogeneous fiber-modified asphalt mortar. To avoid the adverse effect of excessive heat, the temperature was carefully monitored through thermocouple probe.|$|E
50|$|The new viaduct {{features}} better {{noise protection}} for the surrounding communities, thanks to noise-absorbing <b>asphalt,</b> <b>solid</b> concrete crash barriers, and partial noise walls. Some further urban design improvements were {{also part of the}} project, such as a volcanic-themed walkway from Gillies Avenue down towards Newmarket (connecting to Clovernook Road).|$|R
40|$|A {{contract}} for Project HR- 20 "Treating Loess, Fine Sands and Soft Limestones with Liquid Binders" of the Iowa Highway Research Board was awarded in December, 1951, to the Iowa Engineering Experiment Station of Iowa State University as its Project 295 -S. By 1954 {{the studies of}} the fine materials and asphalts had progressed quite well, and a method of treating the fine materials, called the atomization process, had been applied. A study was begun in 1954 to see {{if some of the}} problems of the atomization process could be solved with the use of foamed asphalt. Foamed asphalt has several advantages. The foaming of asphalt increases its volume, reduces its viscosity, and alters its surface tension so that it will adhere tenaciously to <b>solids.</b> Foamed <b>asphalt</b> displaces moisture from the surface of a solid and coats it with a thin film. Foamed asphalt can permeate deeply into damp soils. In the past these unusual characteristics were considered nuisances to be avoided if possible...|$|R
40|$|Seeps are the {{expression}} of the migration of hydrocarbons from subsurface accumulations to the surface in sedimentary basins. They may represent an important indication of the presence of petroleum (gas and oil) reservoirs and faults, and are a natural source of greenhouse gas (methane) and atmospheric pollutants (ethane, propane) to the atmosphere. Romania is one of the countries with the largest number of seeps in the world, due to the high petroleum potential and active tectonics. Based on a review of the available literature, and on the field surveys performed by the authors during the last 17 years, we report the first comprehensive GIS-based inventory of 470 seeps in Romania (HYSED-RO), including gas seeps (10. 4 % of the total), oil seeps (11. 7 %), mud volcanoes (50. 4 %), gas-rich springs (12. 6 %), <b>asphalt</b> (<b>solid)</b> seeps (4. 3 %), unclassified manifestations (4. 0 %), and uncertain seeps (6. 6 %). Seeps are typically located in correspondence with major faults and vertical and fractured stratigraphic contacts associated to petroleum reservoirs (anticlines) in low heat flow areas, and their gas-geochemistry reflects that of the subsurface reservoirs. The largest and most active seeps occur in the Carpathian Foredeep, where they release thermogenic gas, and subordinately in the Transylvanian Basin, where gas is mainly microbial. HYSED-RO may represent a key reference for baseline characterization prior to subsurface petroleum extraction, for environmental studies, and atmospheric greenhouse gas emission estimates in Romania...|$|R
