500|$|For <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> production, {{there are}} a number of ways to {{manufacture}} the fiber. [...] The glass can be blown or blasted with heat or steam after exiting the formation machine. [...] Usually these fibers are made into some sort of mat. [...] The most common process used is the rotary process. [...] Here, the glass enters a rotating spinner, and due to centrifugal force is thrown out horizontally. [...] The air jets push it down vertically, and binder is applied. [...] Then the mat is vacuumed to a screen and the binder is cured in the oven.|$|E

50|$|Long draw is the {{spinning}} technique {{used to create}} woolen yarns. It is spun from carded rolags. It is generally spun from shorter <b>stapled</b> <b>fibers.</b> Long draw spun yarns are light, lofty, stretchy, soft, and full of air, thus they are good insulators, and make good knitting yarns.|$|R
25|$|<b>Staple</b> <b>fibers</b> are spun in an {{intrinsic}} viscosity range that lies rather somewhat lower {{and that should}} be between 0.58 and 0.62 dℓ/g.

50|$|The {{resulting}} <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> is of shorter length {{compared to}} the original fiber length, meaning {{it is more difficult}} to spin. Recycled cotton is therefore often blended with virgin cotton fibers to improve yarn strengths. Commonly, not more than 30% recycled cotton content is used in the finished yarn or fabric.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{preparation}} for short draw spinning is combing, as combing requires the long <b>stapled</b> <b>fibers</b> preferred {{for the short}} draw technique, and it also leaves the fibers parallel, which is a characteristic of short draw spun yarns. The combed fiber can then be drafted to form a sliver or roving (if the fibers are twisted slightly after drafting, it is called a roving—if not, it is a sliver), or spun directly.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} properties of polypropylene hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete. There are {{two forms of}} polypropylene fibers including coarse monofilament, and <b>staple</b> <b>fibers.</b> The content of the former is at 3 kg/m(3), 6 kg/m(3), and 9 kg/m(3), {{and the content of}} the latter is at 0. 6 kg/m(3). The experimental results show that the compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexural properties of the polypropylene hybrid fibeF-reinforced concrete are better than the properties of single fiber-reinforced concrete. These two forms of fibers work complementarily. The <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> have good fineness and dispersion so they can restrain the Cracks in primary stage. The monofilament fibers have high elastic modulus and stiffness. When the monofilament fiber content is high enough, it is similar to the function of steel fiber. Therefore, they can take More Stress during destruction. In addition, hybrid fibers disperse throughout concrete, and they are bond with mixture well, so the Polypropylene hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete can effectively decrease drying shrinkage strain.

50|$|A lack of raw {{material}} forced the rayon industry to take new steps. <b>Staple</b> <b>fiber</b> as replacement for cotton {{was the new}} product, waste threads of man-made continuously spinnable filaments cut to staple length. In 1916, the first staple filament spinning machine was put into operation. It was developed by Emil Bronnert, a chemist and Eduard Boos, an engineer.|$|E
50|$|Eri silk is a <b>staple</b> <b>fiber,</b> {{unlike other}} silks, which are {{continuous}} filament. The {{texture of the}} fabric is coarse, fine, and dense. It is very strong, durable, and elastic. Eri silk is darker and heavier than other silks and blends well with wools and cotton. Due to its thermal properties it is warm in winter and cool in summer.|$|E
5000|$|Staple {{nonwovens}} {{are made}} in 4 steps. Fibers are first spun, cut to a few centimeters length, and put into bales. The <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> are then blended, [...] "opened" [...] in a multistep process, dispersed on a conveyor belt, and spread in a uniform web by a wetlaid, airlaid, or carding/crosslapping process. Wetlaid operations typically use 0.25 to 0.75 in long fibers, but sometimes longer if the fiber is stiff or thick. Airlaid processing generally uses 0.5 to 4.0 in fibers. Carding operations typically use ~1.5" [...] long fibers. Rayon {{used to be a}} common fiber in nonwovens, now greatly replaced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene. Fiberglass is wetlaid into mats for use in roofing and shingles. Synthetic fiber blends are wetlaid along with cellulose for single-use fabrics. Staple nonwovens are bonded either thermally or by using resin. Bonding can be throughout the web by resin saturation or overall thermal bonding or in a distinct pattern via resin printing or thermal spot bonding. Conforming with <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> usually refers to a combination with melt blowing, often used in high-end textile insulations.|$|R
500|$|The highly boronated glasses used in {{fiberglass}} are E-glass (named for [...] "Electrical" [...] use, but now {{the most}} common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other common high-boron glasses include C-glass, an alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass <b>staple</b> <b>fibers</b> and insulation, and D-glass, a borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant).|$|R
5000|$|Short draw is the {{spinning}} technique {{used to create}} worsted yarns. It is spun from combed roving, sliver or wool top - anything with the fibers all lined up parallel to the yarn. It is generally spun from long <b>stapled</b> <b>fibers.</b> Short draw spun yarns are smooth, strong, sturdy yarns, and dense. [...] Short draw spun yarns also tend to not be very elastic. These characteristics make them good for use in weaving.|$|R
50|$|A cushion is a soft bag of some {{ornamental}} material, {{stuffed with}} wool, hair, feathers, polyester <b>staple</b> <b>fiber,</b> non-woven material, or even paper torn into fragments. It {{may be used}} for sitting or kneeling upon, or to soften the hardness or angularity of a chair or couch. Decorative cushions often have a patterned cover material, and are used as decoration for furniture.|$|E
50|$|Ring {{spinning}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common spinning methods in the world. Other systems include air-jet and open-end spinning, a technique where the <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> is blown by air into a rotor and attaches to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces.|$|E
50|$|Nonwoven {{fabric is}} a fabric-like {{material}} made from <b>staple</b> <b>fiber</b> (short) and long fibers (continuous long), bonded together by chemical, mechanical, heat or solvent treatment. The term {{is used in}} the textile manufacturing industry to denote fabrics, such as felt, which are neither woven nor knitted. Some nonwoven materials lack sufficient strength unless densified or reinforced by a backing. In recent years, nonwovens have become an alternative to polyurethane foam.|$|E
50|$|Regular rayon has {{lengthwise}} lines called striations and its cross-section is an indented circular shape. The cross-sections of HWM and cupra rayon are rounder. Filament rayon yarns {{vary from}} 80 to 980 filaments per yarn and vary {{in size from}} 40 to 5000 denier. <b>Staple</b> <b>fibers</b> range from 1.5 to 15 denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped. Rayon fibers are naturally very bright, but the addition of delustering pigments cuts down on this natural brightness.|$|R
50|$|Carpet is a {{soft floor}} {{covering}} made of bound carpet <b>fibers</b> or <b>stapled</b> <b>fibers.</b> Carpeting refers to wall-to-wall coverage, whereas a rug is simply {{used to cover}} a space. This type of flooring is typically used indoors {{and can be used}} in both high and low traffic areas. It typically lasts for 15-18 years before it needs to be replaced. The quality of a carpet is usually measured in face weight, or how many fibers there are per square inch. The higher the face weight the more plush a carpet will feel.|$|R
