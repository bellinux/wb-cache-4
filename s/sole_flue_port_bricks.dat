50|$|The convicts adapted simple country {{techniques}} {{commonly used}} for animal shelters and the locally available materials to create huts with wattle-and-daub walls. So useful were the local acacia trees for weaving shelters {{that they were}} given the name Wattle. Some pipe clay {{was obtained from the}} coves around <b>Port</b> Jackson. <b>Bricks</b> were fired in wood fires and were therefore soft. Lime for cement was obtained by burning oyster shells.|$|R
5000|$|Madisonville was an {{important}} <b>port,</b> providing <b>bricks</b> and other products of the towns along the Tchefuncte River to New Orleans, in the decades before the Civil War. After the Union capture of New Orleans, this area remained under nominal Confederate control; and the cutoff of trade with New Orleans across [...] "enemy lines" [...] was devastating to the local economy, which did not recover for decades after the peace.|$|R
50|$|Bairnsdale {{established}} {{a reputation as}} a marketing and trading centre for the large rural area of East Gippsland and this has been helped by the development of excellent road systems, a good railway service and to some extent steamer and air services. The 1880s were seen as the ‘Golden Age’ for steamer traffic on the rivers and Bairnsdale was seen as one of the major colonial <b>ports.</b> The <b>brick</b> Bairnsdale railway station opened in 1890 with other platforms and railway infrastructure being completed at the same time. The contractor R. Kreokel won the contract for the work to be carried out for the amount of ₤2,322.|$|R
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive <b>port</b> side <b>brick</b> oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|R
50|$|The port was supplanted as {{a trading}} centre for {{shipping}} by {{the coming of}} the railway. Later in the 19th century, it became known for its stonehooking trade. Other industries such as the St. Lawrence Starch Works (1889-1989) and the <b>Port</b> Credit <b>Brick</b> Yard (1891-1927) provided employment for many local residents. In 1932 L.B. Lloyd built an oil refinery on the old brick yard site and operated by a succession of operators culminating in its purchase by a division of Texaco who operated it until its closing in 1985, when Texaco opened a new much larger facility at Nanticoke on Lake Erie. The tallest structure in Port Credit used to be the 320 ft smokestack at the St Lawrence Starch plant which has since been demolished. The stack falling marked the change of Port Credit into a residential area from the former industrial hub.|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of large quantity of dredged sediments on land {{has long been}} an issue, particularly when significant contaminants are present. Heating fine-grained dredged sediments to high temperatures can convert these problematic sediments into materials that can be used beneficially. It can both improve considerably the geotechnical engineering properties of the sediment, and neutralise contaminants. Furthermore, this process can reduce the amount of sediment disposed of on land. The sand, silt, and clay fractions of dredged sediments are essentially different in their mineralogical composition, becoming more complex with decreasing particle size. The clay fraction has the greatest influence on the effects of thermal stabilisation. Consequently, a broad knowledge of the quantities and types of sediments produced and the range of their geotechnical engineering properties and their contaminants is a prerequisite for successful, cost-efficient modification of dredged sediments by heating. Numerous alternative methods of soil stabilisation have been used with dredged sediments, but none offers the range of benefits afforded by thermal stabilisation. It is the most reliable method of soil improvement, and the only method that gives immediate results. The laboratory and industrial-scale research presented here shows that there is definite potential for dredged sediment to be incorporated cost-effectively in a variety of industrial manufacturing processes, and in engineering applications following high-temperature heat treatment. Potential products include sand and gravel for road base, solid fill and bricks, among others. Firing fine-grained marine or riverine sediments to high temperatures can convert them to good quality sand and gravel with high frictional shear strength and high permeability. Artificial gravel has been produced that satisfies the Queensland Main Roads Department requirements for use as Subtype 2. 5 unbound pavement material. Heat treatment destroys or stabilises organic contaminants such as tributyltin, common salt, which is converted into other minerals when heated to high temperatures, and other inorganic contaminants. Although the cost of heat treatment can be higher than that of other common treatment methods, this can be offset by the sale of the end products. No other single treatment method is capable of both improving the engineering properties of dredged sediment and eliminating or immobilising its contaminants. The industrial-scale testing verified that the use of sediment as raw material for brick manufacturing is possible and is not only the cheapest way to recycle the dredged sediment, but also replaces source raw material for brick manufacturing. Dried sediment in reclamation ponds can now be recycled easily and maintenance costs are thereby reduced. The use of recycled sediment as raw material for brick manufacturing also reduces the cost of raw materials by about 20 %. It is thus a long-term partial solution to problems faced by both <b>port</b> authorities and <b>brick</b> manufacturers. Analytical and numerical solutions of the desiccation of the dredged sediment disposed of on land have been presented that enable the moisture content profile of the sediment at particular time to be estimated. However, further validation is necessary. The solutions, when fully validated, will provide a useful tool for the management of dredged sediment in disposal ponds and for the desiccation of sediments prior to thermal stabilisation processes. The estimated direct cost of thermal stabilisation is competitive with that of alternative methods, and {{it should be possible to}} reduce the overall cost of sediment disposal by the sale of stabilised material for beneficial uses, and the reuse of existing sediment holding ponds. Overall, it has been shown that thermal stabilisation has the potential to reduce considerably the problem of the {{disposal of}} ever-increasing volumes of dredged sediments that have problematic engineering properties and/or are significantly contaminated...|$|R
