25|$|During the Third Doctor's tenure, {{producer}} Barry Letts {{was adamant}} that the device {{not become a}} cure-all for the series, and limited its use to avoid writers becoming over-reliant on it. During this time, the device underwent significant design changes. In The Sea Devils, the Doctor used it to detonate landmines; Michael E. Briant explains that this was feasible, stating that the sonic waves shook the mines. In The Three Doctors the sonic screwdriver is almost unrecognisable, being a unique, one-use prop with a plastic red <b>spherical</b> <b>head.</b> In the DVD commentary, Letts himself remarks on {{the thickness of the}} prop {{and the fact that it}} belies the idea that it was the regular one, prompting Katy Manning to question whether it was indeed a sonic screwdriver. This was due to the serial being produced out of transmission order: the original sonic screwdriver prop went missing during the recording of Carnival of Monsters, requiring a new prop to be built for the rest of the season; The Three Doctors was recorded after Carnival, but set before it, so the screwdriver could be seen to revert to its previous appearance for one story after The Three Doctors before receiving a more permanent redesign thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum is {{a species}} of gasteroid fungus in the family Sclerodermataceae, and is the type species of the genus Calostoma. It is known by several common names, {{including}} stalked puffball-in-aspic and gelatinous stalked-puffball. The fruit body has a distinctive color and overall appearance, featuring a layer of yellowish jelly surrounding a bright red, <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> approximately [...] in diameter atop a red or yellowish brown spongy stipe [...] tall. The innermost layer of the head is the gleba, containing clear or slightly yellowish elliptical spores, measuring 14–20micrometers (µm) long by 6–9µm across. The spore surface features a pattern of small pits, producing a net-like appearance. A widely distributed species, it grows naturally in eastern North America, Central America, northeastern South America, and East Asia. C.cinnabarinum grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests, where it forms mycorrhizal associations with oaks.|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of joint implantation of straight silicon tube and <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube in treatment of post-operative patients with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis. METHODS:Forty-nine patients(50 eyes) with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis who had treated with straight silicon tube or <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube were implanted with straight silicon tube combined with <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube. Patients were followed up for 1 a {{to observe the}} curative effect. RESULTS:The operation was invalid in 5 cases(5 eyes) as their rigation of lacrimal passage was failure. The remaining 45 eyes in 44 cases were cured with no epiphora. The cure rate was 90 % at 1 a after the tubes were extracted. CONCLUSION:The joint implantation of straight silicon tube and <b>spherical</b> <b>headed</b> silicon tube is an effective and safe technique in treatment of post-operative patients with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis,and worthy of widely use in patients with chronic dacryadeitis {{who have never been}} treated with surgeries...|$|R

500|$|Certain Cerambycidae use {{antennae}} to balance, and blister beetles may {{use them}} for grasping. Some aquatic beetle species may use antennae for gathering air and passing it under the body whilst submerged. Equally, some families use antennae during mating, and a few species {{use them for}} defence. In the cerambycid Onychocerus albitarsis, the antennae have venom injecting structures used in defence. Antennae vary greatly in form, sometimes between the sexes, but are often similar within any given family. Antennae may be , , , , [...] (either on one side or both, bipectinate), or [...] The physical variation of antennae {{is important for the}} identification of many beetle groups. The Curculionidae have elbowed or geniculate antennae. Feather like flabellate antennae are a restricted form found in the Rhipiceridae and a few other families. The Silphidae have a capitate antennae with a <b>spherical</b> <b>head</b> at the tip. The Scarabaeidae typically have lamellate antennae with the terminal segments extended into long flat structures stacked together. The Carabidae typically have thread-like antennae. The antennae arises between the eye and the mandibles and in the Tenebrionidae, the antennae rise in front of a notch that breaks the usually circular outline of the compound eye. They are segmented and usually consist of 11 parts, the first part is called the scape and the second part is the pedicel. The other segments are jointly called the flagellum.|$|E
