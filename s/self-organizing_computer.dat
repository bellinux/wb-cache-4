These environments create challenges {{to the design of}} systems that can adapt to changes in the workload while maintaining desired QoS levels. This paper focuses on the use of online analytic performance models in the design of self-managing and <b>self-organizing</b> <b>computer</b> systems. A general approach for building such systems is presented along with the algorithms used by a Quality of Service (QoS) controller. The robustness of the approach with respect to the variability of the workload and service time distributions is evaluated. The use of an adaptive controller that uses workload forecasting is discussed. Finally, the paper shows how online performance modelscanbeusedtodesignQoS-awareserviceorientedarchitectures...|$|E
40|$|Description of an {{approach}} to computer programming which tries to minimize the time required for retranslation from the computer language into {{the language of the}} original process. A notion of a programmable network is introduced which allows the abstract machines that are a model of the processes in the user's mind to be put into a rigorous and simple form. Each process is then modeled as a particular finite-state machine, a circulating page loose system being employed as an architecture for implementing these finite-state machines. An experiment is discussed in which the use of abstract machines as a language for modeling processes, in conjunction {{with the use of a}} <b>self-organizing</b> <b>computer,</b> decreases user effort, eliminates the need for compilation, facilitates debugging, and decreases computer time...|$|E

Historically, two broad approaches {{have attempted to}} characterize the essential nature of living systems: 1) functional emergence, and 2) vitalism. Functionalism characterizes life by its organizational arrangements leading to purposeful behaviors, 1 implying that non-biological systems which exhibit {{at least some of}} these behaviors may be considered living. For example certain types of <b>self-organizing</b> <b>computer</b> programs have life-like functions, and “artificial life ” proponents view such systems as alive [Langton (38) ]. But living systems seem to have an essential uniqueness, often ascribed to an emergent property of biochemical and physiological processes. Emergence implies a hierarchical organization in which a novel property (e. g. life) arises from complex interactions of relatively simple components at lower, reductionist levels. As weather patterns and candle flames emerge from complex interactions among simple gas and dust particles, life is said to emerge from complex interactions among biomolecules, ions and atoms [Scott (52) ]. However biomolecules are not simple, and emergent phenomena like candle flames and weather patterns manifest self-organization, homeostasis and adaptive behaviors.

40|$|Abstract. Data {{locality}} optimization {{in parallel}} systems is a non-trivial task. This task is typically {{done by the}} programmer: based upon an exhaustive analysis of an application's run-time behavior, data access and distribution is re-modeled manually. Once the system, application, or just the input data set changes this effort has to be repeated. Ideally, this task can be automated which requires introduction of Self-X qualities into the system. We developed an architecture concept for <b>self-organizing</b> parallel <b>computer</b> systems. This architecture is based on two main principles which are exible monitoring to instantiate self-awareness, and adaptive components for all aspects of self-conguration. It is completed by a self-awareness mechanism, the autonomic planning. These Self-X properties pervade all system layers. Based on this architecture concept, we implemented an autonomic data locality optimization system. With the achieved results {{presented in this paper}} we suc-cessfully demonstrated suitability and applicability of the architecture concept and were able to highlight the benets of autonomic data locality optimization. ...|$|R
40|$|Application {{optimization}} {{usually means}} optimization for a given, static computer architecture. In such systems, the programmer optimizes towards given objective functions {{with respect to}} the existing system. This scenario changes dramatically when dealing with recongurable systems. Here, the underlying system architecture may change and be changed during runtime. Such changes might be both, measures of self-healing or a direct result of self-optimization. In any case, {{it is not possible to}} optimize in a classic sense anymore since the objective functions might change with each reconguration. Optimization therefore be-comes an effort of nding a best compromise between sometimes contradictory objective functions and the current system conguration. In this paper we outline an architecture- and application-independent framework for <b>self-organizing</b> par-allel <b>computer</b> systems. Main focus of this framework is to provide a novel, uniform approach to modeling Self-X systems. Core of this framework is a layer model with exible, decentralized monitoring and adaptive components on each system layer. Monitoring components feed an adaptive planning stage, which evalu-ates this data against given objective functions and instruments the adaptive components to perform required system updates. The suitability and applicability of this framework is demonstrated by successful adaptation of two exam-ple scenarios: data locality optimization serves as a software-only application example, whereas a dedicated Software-dened Radio architecture is presented as an example for an architecture based on the framework sketched in this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{framework}} of our {{project is to}} provide a computational model of physical complex processes for simulation needs. In Geophysics, the study of this kind of system has led to the concept of "Self-Organized Criticality ", to explain the "repeatability" of emergent phenomena in nature. To model <b>Self-organized</b> criticality within <b>computers,</b> the original part of the work is to propose a multiagent platform where emergent phenomena are dynamically created during simulation at the time they occur. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that multiagent systems, studied as "emergent systems", can help in providing adequate mechanisms needed to model selforganization in complex systems.

40|$|Individual medial {{entorhinal cortex}} (mEC) 'grid' cells provide a {{representation}} of space {{that appears to be}} essentially invariant across environments, modulo simple transformations, in contrast to multiple, rapidly acquired hippocampal maps; it may therefore be established gradually during rodent development. We explore with a simplified mathematical model the possibility that the self-organization of multiple grid fields into a triangular grid pattern may be a single-cell process, driven by firing rate adaptation and slowly varying spatial inputs. A simple analytical derivation indicates that triangular grids are favored asymptotic states of the <b>self-organizing</b> system, and <b>computer</b> simulations confirm that such states are indeed reached during a model learning process, provided it is sufficiently slow to effectively average out fluctuations. The interactions among local ensembles of grid units serve solely to stabilize a common grid orientation. Spatial information, in the real mEC network, may be provided by any combination of feed-forward cortical afferents and feedback hippocampal projections from place cells, since either input alone is likely sufficient to yield grid fields...|$|R
