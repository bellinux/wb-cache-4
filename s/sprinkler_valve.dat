50|$|The {{pressure}} release valve is often one {{of a variety of}} commercially available types such as a plumbing ball valve, an irrigation <b>sprinkler</b> <b>valve</b> or a quick exhaust valve. Experienced builders often make their own valves for this purpose to gain greater flow and faster actuation. The most common custom design used is the piston valve. Multiple valves arranged to be triggered together are occasionally used as an alternative to a single larger valve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sprinkler</b> <b>valve</b> (otherwise {{known as}} a solenoid valve): The use of {{irrigation}} sprinkler valves as pneumatic valves has become increasingly popular for spudgunning. These valves are intended to be electrically triggered causing a solenoid to depressurise a diaphragm and allow airflow through. It is also possible to remove the solenoid and, instead, to actuate the valve manually with a blowgun to depressurise the diaphragm. Such modifications allow the valve to open as much as 3 to 5 times faster.|$|E
50|$|The movie {{begins with}} four teenage, high-school, hockey players from Minnesota being chased {{down by the}} girls' field hockey team. Earlier, 16-year-old Kendall Knight (Kendall Schmidt) had {{suggested}} that they pull a prank on the girls' hockey team: turn on the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>valve</b> to spray them all. Carlos Garcia (Carlos Pena Jr.) attempts to pull the valve but was not strong enough. Eventually James Diamond (James Maslow) agrees to help Kendall and Carlos. Logan Mitchell (Logan Henderson) helps as well, which makes the four boys powerful enough to turn the valve. A group of angry girls chase the boys into a dead-end alley and beat them up.|$|E

5000|$|Hunter {{produces}} pop-up gear-driven rotors, spray <b>sprinklers,</b> <b>valves,</b> controllers, central controllers {{and weather}} sensors. The company reports that it holds more than 250 product patents and 40 trademarks, and conducts business in 125 countries. The company {{was founded in}} 1981 by Edwin J. Hunter and Paul M. Hunter, to produce a compact landscape sprinkler called the [...] "PGP" [...] (an acronym meaning [...] "professional gear-driven pop-up"), the first sprinkler to utilize [...] "matched-precipitation" [...] regardless of the radii or arc. The former president and CEO was Richard E. Hunter, Edwin’s son. Richard's son, Greg Hunter, is the current president.|$|R

5000|$|Power {{consumption}} and supply {{requirements of the}} solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4" [...] 150 psi <b>sprinkler</b> <b>valve,</b> intended for 24 VAC (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA. Comparatively, an industrial 1/2" [...] 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in high pressure fluid and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA. Neither valve lists a minimum pressure required to remain closed in the un-powered state.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Quick-exhaust valves (QEVs for short) are {{ready-made}} piston valves or diaphragm valves, {{designed to}} quickly exhaust pneumatic cylinders. They work somewhat similarly to pneumatically modified <b>sprinkler</b> <b>valves,</b> {{they are more}} expensive and harder to find, but also perform better. QEVs need a separate pilot valve for triggering. They can be very sensitive, triggering at a pressure drop of a few psi, so care should be taken when filling with a Schrader valve or other valves that will let out air when disconnected. Most QEVs {{are designed to be}} filled from the pilot side, and will typically work well using a 3 -way valve as the fill/pilot valve. Some QEVs will also work when filled from the chamber side. Small QEVs are sometimes used as pilots for larger valves, often to allow the use of a blowgun as the trigger...|$|R
50|$|Diaphragm valve: A {{diaphragm}} valve {{is used in}} pneumatic cannons where the barrel is within the air chamber. It is a disk of flexible material mounted directly behind the barrel that seals it when pressure is increased behind the disk. The design is such that air leaks past the diaphragm from behind it to the chamber around the barrel, sealing the soft rubber against {{the butt of the}} barrel. Once the chamber is fully pressurised the compressed air behind the diaphragm is quickly vented, causing the centre of the diaphragm to flex backwards, exposing the butt of the barrel to the compressed air inside the chamber, which rapidly exhausts through the barrel, launching the projectile. <b>Sprinkler</b> <b>valves</b> have also been modified to act in the same manner a {{diaphragm valve}} operates; changing the triggering of the valve to a release of air controlled by a blowgun valve, rather than electronically.|$|R
50|$|This signal {{indicates}} that {{a portion of the}} building's fire protection system has been disabled (such as a fire <b>sprinkler</b> control <b>valve</b> being closed and, consequently, a sprinkler tamper switch being activated), or, less frequently, that a lower priority initiating device has been triggered (such as a duct smoke detector). Depending on the system's design, the supervisory point may be latching, meaning the panel must be reset to clear the supervisory condition, or non-latching, meaning the indicator automatically goes out when the condition has cleared. However, some panels require a reset regardless of whether the supervisory point is latching or non-latching.|$|R
40|$|A multi-microprocessor based {{distributed}} control system manages spatially variable water and chemical application. The microprocessors are networked together using 3120 processors and PLT- 20 transceivers in a master slave configuration. The control units consist of an 8051 I/O processor and a 3120 communications processor that communicate over a half mile 480 VAC three phase power cable. The power line communications used single phase to ground coupling. The control system was tested from May through July 1996 on a mile center pivot irrigation system in Southern Idaho. A power system transient simulation helps to explain field observations. I. BACKGROUND In 1994 (1) work started in earnest on developing methods to improve productivity and efficiency of food production using techniques which can be generally classified as &quot;precision agriculture&quot;. Among others, Agricultural Engineer, Dr. Bradley King of the University of Idaho Aberdeen R&E center investigated methods to control the 150 plus <b>sprinkler</b> <b>valves</b> along a mile long center pivot agricultural irrigation system. Attempts to implements network control using RS 485 proved unreliable. In 1995, Dr. King successfully implemented a center pivot control scheme based on X- 10 power line communications (PLC). He used commercially available receivers to operate the valves. Dr. King’s experiences with the X- 10 system and technical reports from other researches in the precision farming arena convinced him that the PLC would be superior to other means of communications. The X- 10 system had significant disadvantages: a separate 117 VAC line had to be run along the pivot to operate the X- 10 equipment and communications was only one-way with no error detection or correction...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open <b>sprinklers),</b> the deluge <b>valve</b> must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system. The type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm pull station, which signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|R
