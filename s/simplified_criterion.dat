40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a simple criterion {{to predict the}} failure of steel structures due to the interaction effect of fracture and fatigue which is termed as extremely-low cycle fatigue (ELCF) failure. The criterion has been obtained from further simplification of available cyclic void growth model (CVGM). Initially the simplified ELCF fracture criterion is clearly presented and associated ELCF fracture prediction methodology is also indicated. The <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> is then employed to determine ELCF fracture of some structural models. Hence verification of the <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> is confirmed {{by comparing the results}} with previous criterion-based estimations. Then the <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> is applied to predict the ELCF fracture of a reduced beam section specimen. Finally, study tends to conclude that the <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> produces reasonable accurate prediction to ELCF fracture of steel structures where magnitude of triaxiality remains relatively constant...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, precoded BICM spatial {{multiplexing}} MIMO {{system with}} spatial component interleaver is discussed. For the SVD-precoded spatial multiplexing MIMO system with spatial component interleaver, the PEP of coded bits is analyzed. Based on the bound of PEP, the optimum spatial Q-component interleaver design criterion and a optimum spatial Q-component interleaving rule are proposed. The performance of conventional spatial multiplexing MIMO system {{is dominated by}} the smallest singular value of the channel matrix (the weakest layer), while the proposed scheme can improve the performance of the weakest layer through the spatial component interleaving. In addition, the LF precoded BICM spatial multiplexing MIMO system with spatial component interleaver and ZF receiver is studied. Based on the minimum average probability of symbol vector error criteria, the optimal effective SNR-based precoding matrix selection criterion and a <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> are proposed. The <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> has the same performance for two-layer transmission and small performance loss for M> 2. Moreover, the method of determining the optimal rotation angles for the proposed schemes via maximizing the BICM AMI is also presented. The AMI analysis also illustrates that the optimal rotation angle is more crucial for SVD-precoded MIMO scheme with spatial component interleaver. For the proposed scheme with LF precoding, performance gain brought by constellation rotation is very limited. The simulation results validate all the theoretical analyses. Through the above optimization, the performance of the proposed precoded BICM spatial multiplexing MIMO system with spatial component interleaver outperforms that of conventional precoded spatial multiplexing MIMO system.|$|E

In this connection, flight tests of a twin-engine airplane in which the vertical fin area was increased are cited. The reasons for inadequate directional stability in certain modern designs are accounted for and the properties and applications of dorsal fins are discussed.

Convergence is difficult to ascertain in practice due to the unfavorable scaling of required resources for many-particle problems and therefore a <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> based on a threshold value for the least occupied mode function is often used.

Based on an experimentally relevant example of attractively interacting bosons in one dimension, we demonstrate that the simplified convergence criterion fails to assure qualitatively correct results. Furthermore, the numerical evidence for the creation of two-hump fragmented bright soliton-like states presented by A. I. Streltsov et al. [Phys. Rev.

An homogenisation procedure {{is used for}} the in-plane and the out-of-plane behaviour of three-dimensional woven composite shells, taking the in-plane periodicity of the material into account while relaxing any periodicity tying in the thickness direction. Several types of damage (matrix or reinforcement cracking, delamination, [...] .) can appear in a composite material. In this paper, material non-linear computations are used to assess the importance of bending on the risk for delamination at the reinforcement/matrix interface. The normal and tangential stresses at the interface are computed and a <b>simplified</b> <b>criterion</b> for delamination is used for this purpose. The effect of flexural loading on the stress components responsible for a potential delamination failure mode at the interface is analysed.
