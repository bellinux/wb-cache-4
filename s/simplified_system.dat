5|$|The {{start of}} the process came with {{proposals}} released in 1995 by the Honours Advisory Committee that reviewed the honours system. Until May 1996, New Zealand made recommendations for various British awards for acts of gallantry performed during military operations and acts of bravery by civilians including the Victoria Cross and George Cross. However, the British Government's review and simplification of their awards system provided an ideal opportunity for New Zealand to also develop a unique and <b>simplified</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|Culme-Seymour was {{concerned}} {{to restore the}} efficiency of his squadron, in particular through exercises to build the confidence of his ships' captains that they could work together effectively and without further mishaps. Evan-Thomas gained considerable experience in working with a fleet, and in particular a comprehensive knowledge of the signal book. Control of a fleet at this time was by a system of flag signals from the command ship, {{which had to be}} read and obeyed by other ships. The signal book had grown to contain thousands of flag combinations to give detailed instructions, and controversy had arisen within the navy whether this system would be practical in battle. Tryon had been an advocate of a much simpler system, where captains had greater latitude simply to 'follow the leader' and use their own initiative rather than waiting for explicit orders. Ironically, the ship collision had happened during manoeuvres using the traditional system, not when captains were supposed to be acting independently, and had they used initiative rather than following incorrect flag commands, the accident could have been avoided. Nonetheless, a perception arose that the <b>simplified</b> <b>system</b> giving more independence to captains was somehow to blame, and the navy as a whole moved back to detailed flag instructions. Evan-Thomas at the centre of this reversal of policy in the Mediterranean squadron, gained an expectation for accurate and detailed flag commands which contributed to later difficulties at the Battle of Jutland, where signal failures contributed to the loss of British ships. Other experiments continued to try to improve the effectiveness of communication between ships, including semaphore, searchlight and carrier pigeon.|$|E

500|$|Commenting on the combat, Paprocki {{said that}} despite the {{simplified}} combo system, the developers have [...] "managed to infuse the sheer brutality and force God of War is known for {{within the confines of}} the [...] platform." [...] Because of the <b>simplified</b> <b>system,</b> situations which call for Kratos' magical abilities are rare. [...] However, if players do choose to use these abilities, selecting them is a [...] "burden in the haste of a battle", requiring players to cycle through their entire inventory. Paprocki also criticized the lack of an autosave feature, as the game does not save the player's position when receiving a phone call, which [...] "can lead to unbearable frustration." [...] Freeman said that the combination of the weapons and quick time events make the combat [...] "a convincing interpretation of the action in the original console games". Davis said that although there are puzzle and platforming elements, the focus is [...] "clearly on the combat" [...] and felt that the combat system was [...] "a little shallow". He said it seems as if the abundance of enemies [...] "exist solely to act as punching (or slicing, as it were) bags for Kratos".|$|E

[...] Such a <b>simplified</b> <b>system</b> usually omits {{diacritics}} and tie-bars, simplifies -yj and -ij word endings to [...] "-y", ignores the Ukrainian soft sign (ь) and apostrophe (’), and may substitute ya, ye, yu, yo for ia, ie, iu, io at the beginnings of words. It may also simplify doubled letters. Unlike in the English language where an apostrophe is punctuation, in the Ukrainian language it is a letter. Therefore sometimes Rus’ is translated with an apostrophe, even when the apostrophe is dropped for all other names and words.|$|E
