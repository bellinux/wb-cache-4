5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is <b>stuck</b> <b>out.</b> This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E

25|$|Early torpedoes used contact {{exploder}}s. A typical exploder had {{a firing}} pin that <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> from the warhead and was restrained by a transverse shear pin. The torpedo would hit the target with {{enough energy to}} break the shear pin and allow the firing pin to strike a percussion cap that ultimately detonated the warhead. An arming impeller was an additional safety device: the firing pin could not move until the torpedo had travelled a preset distance.|$|E
25|$|A single {{from the}} first ball put Devine on strike, and she hit four {{consecutive}} twos. Devine required five runs from the last ball to win and she struck a powereful straight drive. Perry, who has played football for Australia, <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> her right foot and the ball deflected to mid-on where Sthalekar stopped the ball and only one run was scored. This sealed an Australian win by three runs. Perry was named the player of the match for her 3/18.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{managed to}} reach the final, where they met Sri Lanka. Taylor scored 74, a record score by an Australian captain in the World Cup, but Sri Lanka comfortably triumphed on this {{occasion}} by seven wickets to claim the trophy. In another spiteful encounter, some players refused to shake hands after the match. Ranatunga, having declared before the match that Australian leg spinner Shane Warne was overrated, struck a six from a misexecuted flipper which turned into a full toss and promptly <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> his tongue at the spinner.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand fell to be 4/29 in {{the eighth}} over, and during the {{subsequent}} period, Nitschke and Sthalekar tied them down with spin {{as they tried to}} consolidate. Sthalekar did not take a wicket but conceded only 19 runs from her four overs. Devine required five runs from the last ball to win and she struck a powerful straight drive from the bowling of Ellyse Perry, who <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> her right foot. The ball deflected to mid-on where Sthalekar stopped it and restricted the scoring to a single, sealing an Australian win by three runs.|$|E
25|$|Judy Lewis was Gable's {{only child}} born {{while he was}} alive. Nineteen months after the birth, Young claimed to have adopted Judy. The girl grew up {{resembling}} Gable very much, including having large ears that <b>stuck</b> <b>out.</b> She went by the name Judy Lewis after her mother married Tom Lewis when Judy was four years old. According to Lewis, Gable visited her home once, when she was 15, asked about her life, and kissed her on her forehead upon leaving. He did not tell {{her that he was}} her biological father. Neither Gable nor Young would ever publicly acknowledge the truth about their daughter, but most in Hollywood and some in the general public believed Gable was her father, due, in part, to their strong resemblance and the timing of her birth.|$|E

25|$|Perry {{was then}} {{taken out of}} the attack and the New Zealanders {{consolidated}} and rebuilt the innings. Nicola Browne and Sophie Devine put on 41 from as many balls. In the 18th over, Browne was caught behind for 20 from Perry, and New Zealand were 6/103 {{at the start of the}} last over, needing 14 runs to win. Perry was given the ball. A single from the first ball put Devine on strike, and she hit four consecutive twos. Devine required five runs from the last ball to win and she struck a powerful straight drive. If the ball had gone past Perry, it could have reached the boundary for a four to tie the match and force a Super Over. Perry <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> her right foot and the ball deflected to mid-on where Sthalekar stopped the ball and only one run was scored. This sealed an Australian win by three runs. Perry was named the player of the match for her 3/18.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on July 25 {{and dropped the}} opener of a four-game series against the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2. Mat Latos held the Dodgers to one run in 7 2/3 innings, and Jay Bruce and Xavier Paul each homered to end the six-game winning streak. Hanley Ramírez hit a two-run homer to back Clayton Kershaw's eight strikeouts in eight innings as the club won 2-1 {{in the second game}} of the series. Hyun-jin Ryu dominated on July 27, striking out nine and allowing only one run on two hits in seven innings in the Dodgers' 4-1 victory over the Reds. Puig hit a walk-off homer {{in the bottom of the}} 11th as the Dodgers took the series finale 1-0. A pitching duel between Chris Capuano and Tony Cingrani kept the game tied heading into extra innings. The 20 strikeouts by Dodgers batters in the game set a franchise record, breaking the mark set during a 15-inning game on May 2, 1995 against the Giants. Greinke <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> 7 in 7 innings and Mark Ellis hit a walk-off RBI single in the ninth as the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees 3-2 on July 30. Kershaw pitched eight shutout innings as the month came to a close, but Hiroki Kuroda also did not allow a run and the Yankees won 3-0 after scoring all their runs off the Dodgers bullpen in the top of the ninth.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth {{straight}} game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13–3 at Coors Field. In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup {{at the same time}} (Tony Gwynn, Jr., Jerry Hairston, Jr., Iván DeJesús, Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6–2 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3–2. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Elián Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4–3 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee {{in the top of the}} eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2–1 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6-5. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8–3 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a cross-country flight to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It was all they needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers got back into the winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> a season high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston, Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8–3 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8–2 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.|$|E

Amargasaurus was first described in 1991 and contains a single known species, Amargasaurus cazaui. It was a large animal, but small for a sauropod, reaching [...] in length. Most distinctively, it sported two parallel rows of tall spines down its neck and back, taller than in any other known sauropod. In life, these spines most likely could have <b>stuck</b> <b>out</b> of the body as solitary structures that supported a keratinous sheath. An alternate hypothesis, now less favored, postulates that they could have formed a scaffold supporting a skin sail. They might have been used for display, combat, or defense.|$|E
