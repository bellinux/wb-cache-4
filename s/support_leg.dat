50|$|The classic speedskating {{technique}} is an alternating cycle of inside-edge pushes and outer-edge glides. The cycle starts as the skater is gliding on one (let us suppose the right) leg with a bent knee. He then straightens (extends) the right knee and hip while leaning to the left. The {{direction of the}} push is therefore outwards (rightwards) {{from the center of}} mass. When the pushing leg reaches full extension he sets down the left (now <b>support)</b> <b>leg</b> and glides on it while picking up the right leg and bringing it back behind and underneath him (recovery) ready to be placed on the ground (set down) and become the new <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> Once the pushing leg has been recovered, the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> pushes out in the other direction and the cycle repeats. Note that the pushes are always in a lateral direction: the left leg pushes exclusively leftwards, and the right leg exclusively rightwards.|$|E

50|$|Just {{prior to}} the swing phase, the athlete should land on the {{supporting}} leg with the knee slightly flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg. The best position of the supporting leg {{has been found to}} be 5 to 10 cm to the side of the ball (left of the ball for a right-footed kicker, right of the ball for a left-footed kicker). Skilled athletes have a tendency toward a closer ball-to-support leg side position. For forward to back positioning, there is variability based on the desired action of the ball. Placing the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> further behind the ball will produce a greater upward direction whereas placing the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> closer to the ball will produce greater forward propulsion. Ball flight trajectory is dictated by the supporting foot’s position. The support foot should be positioned so as to be parallel to the intended direction of the ball. Other important body positioning to be aware of is to bend the upper body slightly forward over the ball.|$|E
50|$|Freestyle Footbag is a footbag sport where players {{demonstrate}} their abilities by performing sequences of acrobatic tricks. The ending {{position of the}} bag on one trick becomes the starting position of the bag on the next trick. Tricks are created by combining different components between contacts (stalls or kicks, usually stalls). Components can be spins, dexterities (wrapping a leg around the bag in mid-air), or ducks (letting the bag pass a few inches above the neck). Contacts are usually {{on the inside of}} the foot behind the opposite <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> (clipper stall) or on the toe, however many inventive possibilities remain and are used to create a near-endless list of tricks.|$|E

5000|$|... "Inside turn" [...] is most {{intuitively}} {{clear if}} initially {{the couple is}} in an open single-handhold position facing each other, and the name corresponds to {{the direction of the}} lead. To lead the inside turn, the leader moves the follower's arm inside, and conversely for the outside turn. In other positions the term is not so clear, therefore in some dances, some prefer to use this term according to its usage in ballet, based on footwork rather than arm style. In ballet, when describing pirouettes, an outward (en dehors) turn is the turn in the direction towards the working leg. Accordingly, an inward (en dedans) turn is the turn in the direction towards the <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> See also rond de jambe.|$|E

50|$|The seating on a powerchair {{can vary}} in design. Starting {{with a basic}} sling seat and {{backrest}} made of vinyl or nylon, some chairs have an optional padding, some have more comfortable cushion and backrest options which may include a head rest. There are companies which can fit their own backrests and seat cushions for people with increased need for stability in the trunk, or at increased risk of pressure sores from sitting out. Finally, specialist seating solutions are available for users who need individually tailored <b>support.</b> <b>Leg</b> rests may {{be integrated into the}} seating design and may have powered adjustment for those users who need to vary their leg position. Powerchairs may also have a tilt-in-space, or reclining facility for users who are unable to maintain an upright seating position indefinitely. This function can also help with comfort by shifting pressure to different areas for a while, or with positioning in a wheelchair when a user needs to be hoisted in.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Recent {{studies on}} the insect water strider showed that the insect heavily relies on surface tension force to stay afloat. Inspired by this insect, water strider robots have been {{developed}} using the same locomotive principles as the insect. This paper focuses on numerically modeling the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> of the insect and the robots. The rigid-leg model {{as well as the}} compliantleg model is developed using numerical approaches, under an assumption made on the water surface breaking condition. The effect of different leg material and geometry are discussed. It is shown through simulations that four 7 cm-long Teflon R ○ coated compliant <b>supporting</b> <b>legs</b> with optimized shapes can lift up to 4. 3 grams (0. 15 g/cm), while an actual prototype carried 3. 7 grams. Another prototype using twelve of these legs successfully lifted 9. 3 grams. Experiments show that the analyses capture the important features of the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs.</b> The design rules proposed in this paper will be useful in understanding the insect statics and also the robotic water strider <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> design. This study will allow a heavier robot to be used for education, entertainment or environment monitoring purposes. I...|$|R

However in both rotating directions, the swinging legs exist, {{and one of the}} swinging legs hits the ground and forms a <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> polygon with the <b>supporting</b> <b>legs.</b> Because of the newly formed supporting polygon, the robot will maintain standing posture if the tumbling velocity is low.|$|R

5000|$|The double-push {{eliminates}} the [...] "glide" [...] phase {{from the above}} cycle, {{replacing it with a}} medially-directed [...] "underpush" [...] on the outside-edge. The recovery skate is placed on an outside edge and pushed underneath the body (right leg pushes leftward, and vice versa) while maintaining that outside edge, before being steered or pulled back across the centerline for the regular inside-edge push that follows.By its nature the double-push is less stable than classic technique, making it difficult to learn. If the skater should lose traction during an underpush there is no <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> to fall back on.The double-push also allows for the very brief application of force through both legs simultaneously. The skater does this by transferring his weight from the inside-edge foot to the outside-edge foot gradually, rather than transferring all of his weight to the outside-edge foot instantly. Some hold that this is essential to the DP, but this opinion is not universal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{legs of a}} horse require routine {{observation}} for lacerations or swelling. Everyday care involves {{brushing the}} legs with a brush to remove dirt and mud. A currycomb is generally not used below the knees. It is common to have excess hair trimmed from the fetlock to prevent excess accumulation of mud and moisture {{that may lead to}} skin problems, such as rain rot or scratches. Many riders wrap the horse's legs with protective boots or bandages to prevent injury while working or exercising. After a ride, it is common for a rider or groom to hose off the legs of a horse to remove dirt and to ease any minor inflammation to the tendons and ligaments. Liniment may also be applied as a preventative measure to minimize stiffness and ease any minor strain or swelling. If the horse has been overworked, injured, or is to be transported, a standing bandage or shipping boot may be placed on the horse's legs for protection, to hold a wound dressing, or to provide <b>support.</b> <b>Leg</b> wraps are useful in preventing injury or for treating horses with leg injuries. Veterinarians may recommend using wraps during rehabilitation to prevent further injury. Another common use for leg wraps is to protect the legs of horses while being shipped in a horse trailer.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Captain Parmenter, One Man Army," [...] it is {{revealed}} {{that all of}} the soldiers (troopers) of [...] "F Troop" [...] have been at Fort Courage for at least 20 months. Therefore, they spent {{at least part of the}} Civil War at Fort Courage. They are so incompetent that when they are formed into a firing squad in the episode titled [...] "The Day They Shot Agarn" [...] all of their shots miss Agarn despite the fact they are standing only a few yards from him. The most common running gag through both seasons of the series (shown in every first season opening except for the pilot episode) involves the fort's lookout tower. Every time the cannon is fired in salute the lit fuse burns out. Corporal Agarn or Private Dobbs then steps up and kicks the cannon's right wheel, collapsing the cannon and causing it to fire off target. The cannonball strikes a <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> of the lookout tower, bringing it crashing to the ground along with the trooper in it. In the opening credits, this coincides with the line in the lyrics, [...] "Before they resume with a bang and a boom." [...] In one episode, an arrow brings the tower crashing down and in another Parmenter brings down the tower with a lasso. In another episode, musical instruments being played loudly cause the tower to collapse. The fort water tower is also a frequent victim of this sort of gag.|$|E
40|$|For {{applications}} requiring {{high performance}} angular rate measurements {{it is important}} to be able to design MEMS rate sensors with high quality factors (Q). This paper considers ring resonator based rate sensors and investigates the influence of design changes to the ring and <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> on thermoelastic damping, which is the dominant dissipation mechanism. A computational method is used to quantify the thermoelastic damping and a detailed parameter study is conducted to understand the influence of ring geometry, <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> and micro-machined slots around the ring circumference. The results show that damping in the <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> can have significant influence on the total energy dissipated from the resonator, and the optimum leg geometry can be identified to achieve high Q. It is also observed that the addition of slots improves Q for resonators having higher energy loss. However, for high-Q, rings slots have a detrimental effect. The results presented are useful for designing ring resonators with reduced levels of damping...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Walking {{is one of}} {{the basic}} human activities. Several well-defined, motion {{tracking}} systems have been used for gait analysis. However, these systems such as the optical motion tracking system are very expensive and limited to laboratory usage. Recently, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) -based inertial sensors have made it possible to overcome these disadvantages. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify gait events and the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> by measuring the mediolateral swing angle. An inertial sensor unit with a 3 -axis accelerometer and 2 -axis gyroscope was attached to the subject’s lower trunk using an elastic band. Five, healthy and young (20 – 29 yrs.) subjects participated in this experiment. Each walked twice along a straight, 25 -m path at three different speeds. During each trial, the sensor transmitted signals to a PC via Bluetooth technology. In this study, gait events and the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> were identified using the peak and sign of the mediolateral swing angle. The mediolateral swing angle was calculated using the integrated gyroscope signal. For comparison, a well-defined spatiotemporal gait analysis technique was also applied. In this reference method, the gait event was identified with the last peak of the vertical acceleration before the sign change from positive to negative. The <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> was identified using the sign of the mediolateral acceleration double integration. Identification of the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> was difficult in the referenc...|$|R
