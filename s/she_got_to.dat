Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E

The actress commented that she had loved her character's transition from [...] "bratty" [...] to [...] "almost nice" [...] and believed that Natasha was still herself no matter what she had gone through. Novakovic was pleased that <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> explore every aspect of Natasha and go through every emotion with her. She added that she wanted Natasha to be remembered by the viewers. Novakovic filmed her final scenes in December, but Natasha continued to appear on-screen until 29 March 2013.|$|E
500|$|At {{comprehensive}} school, Turunen {{performed as}} a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, [...] "Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was." [...] Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, [...] "If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times". At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert {{in front of a}} thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna.|$|E

All of the living members of the original Star Trek cast agreed to appear in the episode with the exception of James Doohan, whose agent replied with [...] "No way." [...] Because of this, the episode's working title was jokingly named [...] "We got everybody but Scotty" [...] and so Scotty was replaced with [...] "Welshie". William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy recorded their lines together, which was unusual as actors usually record solo. Following his work on Futurama, Goodman went on to join the writing staff on Star Trek: Enterprise.|$|E
500|$|Another {{relationship}} Nicole pursued {{was with}} Aden Jefferies, her longtime closest friend. Aden {{had a strong}} fanbase from his previous relationship with Belle Taylor. This resulted in the audience being divided over their relationship. Nicole has also been featured in various other romantic storylines, such as a brief fling with Liam Murphy, James {{said that he was}} compatible with Nicole because he had [...] "the edge she was after". She also dated Trey Palmer and they became involved in sex tape storyline, many newspapers reported on the plot because it [...] "echoed" [...] co-star Lewis' real life sex tape scandal. Producer Welsh once stated he believed Nicole was destined to become [...] "full circle" [...] and Nicole began behaving erratic and wild once more, due to her failed romances and the death of her friend Belle. She also had an affair with an older male character, Sid Walker. James liked the fact Nicole had so many romances because <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> kiss many of her co-stars.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what am I to do with my Gratitude”.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} the recurring villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny later called [...] "the valentine from Hell". Takei later previously {{played the role}} in the season one episode [...] "Ricardio the Heart Guy". Sugar felt that Bubblegum, in the episode, {{was the victim of}} sexual harassment by Ricardio, and that the only way for her to solve the problem was for her to turn the situation around and somehow over come Ricardio. In the episode, this was metaphorically depicted by having Bubblegum best him in combat. Sugar reveled in the fact that <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> draw Bubblegum ripping off Ricardio's leg and beating him with; she noted that she had been wanting to featuring such a scene in her art since she was in high school. The climactic scene with Ricardio was also supposed to have featured more body imagery. Ricardio was originally slated to have been seated on a giant hand-throne, and the hole in the Ice King's chest was to have been more graphic.|$|E
500|$|The move to {{the sixth}} series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory, who had ceased {{to exist in the}} {{original}} slot in the fifth series. With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's like to be the companion from the companion's point of view, and <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> talk about essentially in that version how sad it is, in some ways. One day something will happen to her, she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll get sick of this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help. Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called [...] "several of [...] best lines" [...] and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations.|$|E
500|$|Northanger Abbey {{was shot}} on {{location}} in Ireland from late August 2006. The Independent's Sarah Shannon stated that ITV had filmed in the country [...] "largely thanks to the generous tax incentives offered by the republic's government." [...] Filming lasted for five weeks and the drama was shot on Super 16 mm film. Twenty-first century Dublin streets doubled for nineteenth century Bath, the setting for the novel. Shannon thought some viewers might be annoyed with this and Thompson commented, [...] "But isn't that shot of the Royal Crescent in Bath {{a bit of a}} cliché? What we've done is create our own Bath." [...] Lismore Castle in County Waterford was chosen as Northanger Abbey, home of the Tilney family. Higginsbrook House, near County Meath, served as the exterior to the Morland family's home. The house was later used in Becoming Jane, a film about Austen's early life. Other shooting locations included Dublin Castle, Ardbraccan House and Charleville Castle. Jones told Paul Byrne of the Evening Herald that she enjoyed shooting in Ireland as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> see a lot of the country.|$|E
