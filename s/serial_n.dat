40|$|International audienceNowadays, many robotic {{applications}} {{require an}} accurate model to perform tasks where dynamics is significant. The friction model {{discussed in this}} paper aims at improving the existing rigid robot model. The losses in joint transmission originate in friction between moving parts in contact or between moving parts and the ambient fluid. Commonly, robotic identification models represent joint transmission friction force as a viscous friction force, depending on the velocity, added to a constant dry friction force. However, the tribology science field teaches that friction in general depends on load (reaction force normal to the contact surface). It {{is important to consider}} this dependence when variable loads are applied on the joint transmission (external payloads, inertial load and gravity forces). Since these mechanisms are lubricated, it is appropriate to refer to the Stribeck curve (rather than Coulomb). This curve describes the friction coefficient as being dependent on a parameter (Hershey) combining the velocity and the load. This paper proposes a new expression of the load-velocity friction model, in order to identify a <b>serial</b> <b>n</b> degrees of freedom (DOF) robot. The friction force of this new inverse dynamic identification model is a linear function of both inertial and external forces. An experimental validation on an industrial manipulator used as a force feedback telerobot in nuclear plant concludes this paper...|$|E
40|$|Context: The case {{fatality}} from {{acute poisoning}} with glyphosate-containing herbicides is approximately 7. 7 % from the available studies but these have major limitations. Large prospective studies {{of patients with}} self-poisoning from known formulations who present to primary or secondary hospitals are needed to better describe the outcome from acute poisoning with glyphosate containing herbicides. Furthermore, the clinical utility of the glyphosate plasma concentration for predicting clinical outcomes and guiding treatment has not been determined. Objective: To describe the clinical outcomes, dose–response, and glyphosate kinetics following self-poisoning with glyphosate-containing herbicides. Methods: This prospective observational case series was conducted in two hospitals in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2007. We included patients {{with a history of}} acute poisoning. Clinical observations were recorded until discharge or death. During a specified time period, we collected admission (n = 216, including five deaths) and <b>serial</b> (<b>n</b> = 26) blood samples in patients. Severity of poisoning was graded using simple clinical criteria. Results: Six hundred one patients were identified; the majority ingested a concentrated formulation (36 %, w/v glyphosate). Twenty-seven percent were asymptomatic, 63. 7 % had minor poisoning, and 5. 5 % of patients had moderate to severe poisoning. There were 19 deaths (case fatality 3. 2 %) with a median time to death of 20 h. Gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory distress, hypotension, altered level of consciousness, and oliguria were observed in fatal cases. Death was strongly associated with greater age, larger ingestions, and high plasma glyphosate concentrations on admission (> 734 μg/mL). The apparent elimination half-life of glyphosate was 3. 1 h (95 % CI = 2. 7 – 3. 6 h). Conclusions: Despite treatment in rural hospitals with limited resources, the mortality was 3. 2 %, which is lower than that reported in previous case series. More research is required to define the mechanism of toxicity, better predict the small group at risk of death, and find effective treatments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{immobilization}} of non-rigid objects {{is currently}} an active research area in robotics. This paper explores {{the problem by}} studying the immobilization of serial chains of rigid polygons connected by rotational joints. The chain is to be immobilized at a given placement by frictionless point fingers that may contact the polygons only along edge inte-riors or at concave vertices. In earlier work we established that any <b>serial</b> chain of <b>n</b> 6 = 3 polygons without parallel edges can be immobilized with n+ 2 frictionless point fingers. This paper establishes {{that this is the}} minimal number of frictionless point fingers required for the immobilization of such chains. The paper also establishes that <b>serial</b> chains of <b>n</b> = 3 polygons are indeed exceptional and require six rather than five point fingers for their immobilization. The paper next introduces a robust version of immobility, which requires that immobilization be maintained with respect to small finger placement errors. The paper describes how to robustly immobilize any <b>serial</b> chain of <b>n</b> polygons without parallel edges at the cost of only one additional frictionless point finger. The immobilization procedures described in the paper are constructive and readily implementable as part of grasp and manipulation planners. ...|$|R

METHODS: A systematic {{review of the literature}} from January 1982 to January 2006 of perinatal outcome in pregnancies with isolated fetal hydrothorax with hydrops with any form of prenatal treatment was conducted. RESULTS: Forty-four articles met our selection criteria, reporting a total of 172 fetuses treated prenatally. Reported treatment options were single (n = 13) or <b>serial</b> thoracocentesis (<b>n</b> = 18), thoraco-amniotic shunt placement (n = 100) or a combination of thoracocentesis and shunting (n = 36). Four case-reports described pleurodesis with OK- 432, (n = 3) and intrapleural injection of autologous blood (n = 2). Overall survival rate was 63 %, ranging from 54 % for single thoracocentesis to 80 % in the 5 cases treated with pleurodesis, without statistically significant differences between the treatment modalities. Shunt-placement with or without prior thoracocentesis was most often described, with survival rates of 67 and 61 % respectively. DISCUSSION: The available literature consists exclusively of case reports and case series. This systematic review suggests that with prenatal intervention, perinatal survival rates around 63 % are possible.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{kinematics}} and the optimization of a generic robotic structure composed by <b>N</b> <b>serial</b> rotary joints and actuated with a mono-directional tendon system. In {{the first part}} of the paper, the specific case that brought us to develop this study is introduced; the main motivations and the scenario with its specific constraints and design choices have been described. Since a complete and detailed analysis of an n-R serial structure with this kind of characteristics could not be found in the literature, the study of the kinematics and the parameter optimization of such a structure is treated as generally as possible, in order to make the procedure and the results applicable for any similar structure. Finally, in the last part, through the introduction of specific constraints and the definition of the parameters, the general analysis has been applied to the specific case of study: the preliminary study of a finger exoskeleton for an astronaut suit...|$|R
