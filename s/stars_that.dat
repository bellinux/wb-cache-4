5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of <b>stars,</b> <b>that</b> depend upon their mass and composition. When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship E=mc2.|$|E
5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion {{with respect to}} the background <b>stars.</b> <b>That</b> is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky, performing a looping motion.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{variables}} are <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events. This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and flare stars, {{as well as}} giant and supergiant stars.|$|E

5|$|In Chinese astronomy, the <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> make up Andromeda {{were members}} of four {{different}} constellations that had astrological and mythological significance; a constellation related to Andromeda also exists in Hindu mythology.

5|$|Kepler-40 was, at {{the time}} of its discovery, the largest and most evolved star known to host a transiting planet. It is the sixth known host star with a radius over 1.8 times that of the Sun and a transiting planet, after <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> include Kepler-5 and Kepler-7.|$|E
5|$|M110 {{also appears}} to be {{interacting}} with the Andromeda Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies.

5|$|Stars {{can also}} vary in {{luminosity}} because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, {{as well as}} rotating <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> produce extreme starspots.

5|$|The true {{nature of}} the {{supernova}} remained obscure for some time. Observers slowly came to recognize a class of <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> undergo long-term periodic fluctuations in luminosity. Both John Russell Hind in 1848 and Norman Pogson in 1863 had charted <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> underwent sudden changes in brightness. However, these received little attention from the astronomical community. Finally, in 1866, English astronomer William Huggins made the first spectroscopic observations of a nova, discovering lines of hydrogen in the unusual spectrum of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis. Huggins proposed a cataclysmic explosion as the underlying mechanism, and his efforts drew interest from other astronomers.|$|E
5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Although {{above the}} horizon and hence visible to the Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. <b>Stars</b> <b>that</b> are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, Robert McClure {{discovered}} that essentially all barium stars {{began with a}} companion <b>star</b> <b>that</b> made the s-process elements, and when the companion star aged into a white dwarf, a stellar wind moved what was made by one star to the other star, a shifting of mass from an Asymptotic giant branch(AGB) <b>star</b> <b>that</b> turned into a white dwarf, to its companion star.|$|R
5|$|As of 2006, {{the star}} {{with the highest}} known {{absolute}} magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> are currently known {{are located in the}} NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{hoped to}} {{implement}} a survey called the N2K Consortium, a collaboration which uses Doppler spectroscopy to find radial velocity measurements of <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> hadn't been previously surveyed. The project searched particularly for gas giants with short orbits around metal-rich stars to find how the metallicity of the star and {{the mass of the}} planet are related.|$|E
5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of <b>stars</b> <b>that</b> had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Mystified by its origins, Danziger {{postulated}} {{possible explanations}} as forming from a helium cloud, an aged <b>star</b> <b>that</b> had exhausted its hydrogen, or a <b>star</b> <b>that</b> had somehow thrown off its hydrogen envelope, though noted {{there was no}} evidence of such an envelope.
