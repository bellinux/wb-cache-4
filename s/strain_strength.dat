The basic {{assumption is that}} <b>strain</b> <b>strength</b> of geomaterial comply with a certain distribution law in space. Failure of tensile fracture plane and shear fracture plane in representative volume element (RVE) with iso-strain are discussed, and generalized failure {{constitutive model}} of fracture plane in RVE is established considering combined effect of tension and shear. Fracture plane consists of elastic microplanes and fractured microplanes. Elastic microplanes are intact parts of the fracture plane, and fractured microplanes are the rest parts of the fracture plane whose strain have ever exceeded their <b>strain</b> <b>strength.</b> Interaction mode on elastic microplanes maintains linear elasticity, while on fractured microplanes it turns into contact and complies with Coulomb’s friction law. Intact factor and fracture factor are defined to describe damage state of the fracture plane which can be easily expressed with cumulative integration of distribution density function of <b>strain</b> <b>strength.</b> Strong nonlinear macroscopic behavior such as yielding and strain softening can be naturally obtained through statistical microstructural damage of fracture plane due to distribution of <b>strain</b> <b>strength.</b> Elastic–brittle fracture model and ideal elastoplastic model are special cases of this model when upper and lower limit of distribution interval are equal...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{research}} work, a comprehensive testing {{program has been}} carried out to study the stress-strain and volume change behavior of unreinforced and reinforced residual soil. A series of drained triaxial tests were conducted using computer controlled GDS triaxial apparatus for unreinforced and reinforced soil. Test results show that reinforced soils exhibit higher failure strains and volume contraction than unreinforced soils. Reinforced soils with non-woven geotextile exhibit higher failure <b>strains,</b> <b>strength</b> and coefficient of interface friction than woven geotextile reinforced residual soil. A simplified approach for numerical calculations were proposed to predict the shear strength of unreinforced and reinforced soils for triaxial compression stress paths and the coefficient of interface friction for reinforced soils. Charts were also presented to predict the strength of reinforced soil and to determine the coefficient of interface friction from triaxial tests. Predictions of failure stress using simplified approach are satisfactory compared to laboratory observations. ...|$|R
