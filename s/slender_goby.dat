50|$|Gobiusculus flavescens are small, <b>slender</b> <b>gobies,</b> {{reaching}} up to 6 cm in length. They are distinct from other gobies in that {{their eyes are}} {{on the side of}} the head (lateral) rather than on top (dorsal). There is a black spot at the base of the tail fin, and in the males, there is a second, smaller black spot beneath the pectoral fins. They are reddish to greenish brown in colour, paler on the undersides with dark reticulations dorsally. There are four light 'saddle' marks dorsally from the head to the end of the second dorsal fin. Along the midline of the sides are a series of bluish markings. During the breeding season these markings become extremely bright in the males.|$|R
