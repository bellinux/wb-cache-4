50|$|A <b>shore</b> <b>lead</b> (or coastal lead) is an oceanographic {{term for}} a {{waterway}} opening between pack ice and shore. While the gap of water may be as narrow as a tide crack if closed by wind or currents, {{it can be as}} wide as 1000 ft. Its formation can be influenced by tidal action, or subsurface conditions, such as current and ocean floor. Commonly, a <b>shore</b> <b>lead</b> is navigable by surface vessels.|$|E

50|$|Foxe Basin is a broad, {{predominantly}} shallow depression, {{generally less}} than 100 m in depth, while to the south, depths {{of up to}} 400 m occur. The tidal range decreases from 5 m in the southeast to less than 1 m in the northwest. During much of the year, landfast ice dominates in the north, while pack ice prevails towards the south. Foxe Basin itself is rarely ice-free until September, open pack ice being common throughout the summer. Vigorous tidal currents and strong winds keep the ice pack in constant motion {{and contribute to the}} numerous polynyas and <b>shore</b> <b>leads</b> which are found throughout the region. This same motion, combined with the high sediment content of the water makes the sea ice of Foxe Basin dark and rough, easily distinguishable from other ice in the Canadian Arctic.|$|R

50|$|The game {{remained}} scoreless {{until the}} Sanford fifth, when Mark Micowski (Vermont) hit a solo home run, cutting the North <b>Shore</b> <b>lead</b> to 3-1. Corey Thompson (East Carolina) then hit an RBI single to score Mike Roth (South Carolina), driving Navigator starter Jason Markovitz from the game. Jim Schult (Eastern Connecticut) replaced Markovitz {{and struck out}} Tucker Nathans (Fairfield) to end the inning with North Shore leading 3-2.|$|E
50|$|When {{the lake}} is being drained, a pair of grated, {{submerged}} drains in Turtle Cove and a single open drain about 15 feet out from the lake’s north <b>shore</b> <b>lead</b> to the Fulton St. hydrants mentioned previously. This gravity-fed system will empty about half the lake’s water over about a five-day period before the level drops enough to expose the drains. If work requires the lake to be lowered further still, SF Rec and Parks will bring in gasoline powered pumps.|$|E
50|$|Public {{access to}} Mohawk Island NWA is {{permitted}} from September 1 through March 31, for day use only, from sunrise to sunset.

The paths along the <b>shore</b> <b>lead</b> to woods and streams with fine views of the waves breaking on the rocks. The village is well preserved and the harbour accommodates both fishing boats and pleasure craft. The old houses, many of them listed buildings, are packed tightly together along the main road and up little lanes. There is a small sandy beach bordered by low rocky cliffs. In addition to the distinctive chimneys {{of a number of}} former smokehouses, there is a little fishing museum which can be visited by arrangement with the keeper.|$|E
50|$|The {{white sand}} beaches {{that line the}} {{northern}} <b>shore</b> <b>lead</b> {{to the development of}} the resort town of Varadero close to the mainland, while the farther end is lined with all-inclusive resorts. The Josone Park sits between the two areas. A small marina and a dolphinarium are located on the south-eastern shore. The Hicacos Point Natural Park is a 3.12 km2 ecological preserve established in 1974 on the north-eastern tip. It contains the 250 m long Cave of Ambrosio, Mangón Lake (home to 31 species of birds and 24 species of reptiles) and the ruins of the La Calavera (The Skull) Salt Works, one of the first salt works to be constructed by the Spanish in the New World.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Polynyas {{are areas}} of open water {{surrounded}} by ice. In the C a n a e h Arctic, {{the largest and}} best known polynya is the North Water. There are also several similar, but smaller, recurring polynyas and <b>shore</b> <b>lead</b> systems. Polynyas appear tobe of critical importance to arctic marine birds and mammals for feeding, reproduction’itnd migration. Despite their obvious biological importance, most polynya areas. are threatened by extensive disturbance and possible pollution {{as a result of}} propesed offshore petrochemical exploration and year-round shipping with ice-brewg capability. However, we cannot evaluate what the effects of such disruptions mi&t be because to date we have conducted insufficient research to enable us to haye: a quantitative understanding of the critical ecological processes and balances that magl,k unique to polynya areas. It is essential that we rectify the situation because the survival of viable populations or subpopulations of several species of arctic marine birds qnd mammals may depend on polynyas. RftSUMfi.

50|$|Staffin (Stafain) is a {{district}} with the Gaelic name An Taobh Sear, which translates as 'the East Side', {{on the northeast}} coast of the Trotternish peninsula of the island of Skye. It {{is located on the}} A855 road about 17 mi north of Portree and is overlooked by the Trotternish Ridge with the famous rock formations of The Storr and the Quirang. The district comprises 23 townships made up of, from south to north, Rigg, Tote, Lealt, Lonfearn, Grealin, Breackry, Cul-nan-cnoc, Bhaltos, Raiseburgh, Ellishader, Garafad, Clachan, Garros, Marrishader, Maligar, Stenscholl, Brogaig, Sartle, Glasphein, Digg, Dunan, Flodigarry and Greap. The Kilmartin River runs northwards through the village. From where it reaches the sea a rocky <b>shore</b> <b>leads</b> east to a slipway at An Corran. Here a local resident found a slab bearing a dinosaur track, probably made by a small ornithopod. Experts subsequently found more dinosaur prints of up to 50 cm, the largest found in Scotland, made by a creature similar to Megalosaurus. At about 160 million years old they are the youngest dinosaur remains to be found in Scotland.|$|R

40|$|Salinity and {{temperature}} measurements {{have been made}} beneath Ronne Ice Shelf, Antarctica. Access to the seawater was gained by hot-water drilling through 562 m of ice at a site 300 km from the ice front. The ice column is composed of 516 m of meteoric-origin ice, underlain by 31 m of consolidated saline ice, with a further 15 m of unconsolidated slush at the base. The 360 -m-deep water column beneath the ice shelf consists broadly of a 210 -m layer of Ice Shelf Water (ISW) at a potential temperature of − 2. 30 °C and salinity 34. 53, overlying a 100 -m-thick layer of modified Western Shelf Water (− 2. 03 °C, 34. 64). The layers are separated by a weak 50 -m-thick pycnocline. Isotopic analyses of water samples support this interpretation of the water types. Comparison of the data with published oceanographic observations from the <b>shore</b> <b>lead</b> indicate {{that the source of}} the water is either the western Berkner shelf or north of the ice front in the Ronne Depression. The measurements from the drill site broadly match predictions from a simple plume model of the sub-ice-shelf water circulation. In that model the basal slope of the ice shelf plays a central role in determining the properties of the ISW plume. With the exception of the upper few tens of meters the temperature and salinity of the entire water column vary by about 0. 04 °C and 0. 03 on tidal timescales, and there is evidence for a longer-term drift, presumably connected with shifts in the larger-scale circulation. There is also much variability from internal wave activity. The salinity and deuterium budgets indicate that the meltwater fraction in the ISW observed at the drill site was between 5. 3 and 6. 5 ‰, in reasonable agreement with values previously found for ISW in the open ocean...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{existence}} of obstacles in harbors or near <b>shore</b> environments <b>leads</b> to Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) links between two underwater acoustic communication (UWAC) nodes. That is, only {{echoes of the}} transmitted signal arrive at the receiving node. Mistaking the first (strong) echo as a Line-Of-sight (LOS) measurement and using it for ranging causes significant degradation of the accuracy level of UWAC-based localization. In this paper, we propose a solution for the NLOS identification problem in underwater acoustic localization. Results from both extensive simulations and sea trial experiments confirm our approach and demonstrate a high detection rate of NLOS measurements. I...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{power as}} a green and {{low-carbon}} renewable energy could effectively mitigate the energy crisis and reduce environmental pollution, including the rapid developing offshore wind power with its rich reserves, wind stability, high wind speed, less interference, noise and other advantages. The trend for development of offshore wind farms is towards a growing size of installed power. This together with higher distances from the <b>shore</b> <b>leads</b> in many cases to HVDC connection as a preferred choice for power export. Thus, the wind turbines are connected through a collection grid to an offshore platform. As the offshore wind farm contains {{a large number of}} power electronic devices and submarine cables, it will inevitably lead to the occurrence of harmonic resonance. Offshore wind farm harmonic and resonance will affect the power quality, while poses a huge challenge to the power grid and wind power. In this thesis work, a comprehensive harmonic analysis in offshore wind farm was studied. Firstly, a detail configuration of the wind energy conversion system and harmonic analysis basics are described and interpreted. Next, a suitable model of one offshore wind farm is built and validated in Matlab/Simulink. The equivalent circuit is calculated for the components in the aggregated wind farm based on their harmonic model. And potential resonance problems are analyzed by frequency scan method to calculate the resonance impedance and frequency. Afterwards, based on the self-built system model, potential harmonic issues that arise in the system are investigated in time domain to interpret the THD at PCC between the collection grid and the onshore grid. As well, a few effective strategy for suppressing harmonics are simulated to evaluate the various influence on the harmonic issue. Both the designed C-type filter and active power filter performed a satisfying results on harmonics suppression. European Wind Energy Maste...|$|R

30|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a set of}} nuanced {{narratives}} and a theoretically-informed report on what {{is the driving force}} and motivation behind the movement of Hindus and Sikhs from one continent to another (apart from their earlier movement out of the subcontinent to distant <b>shores).</b> What <b>leads</b> them to leave one diasporic location for another location? In this sense they are also ‘twice-migrants’. Here I investigate the extent and nature of the transnational movement of diasporic Hindus and Sikhs crossing borders into the U.S. and Australia – the new dharmic sites – and how they have tackled the question of the transmission of their respective dharmas within their own communities, particularly to the younger generation. Two case studies will be presented: one from Hindus and Sikhs in Australia; the other from California (temples and gurdwaras in Silicon Valley and Bay Area).|$|R
