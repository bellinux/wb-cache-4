5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

25|$|Bosses are {{the most}} common bullies. In fact, {{approximately}} 72% of bullies outrank their victims. Statistics from the 2007 WBI-Zogby survey show that 13% of U.S. employees report being bullied currently, 24% <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been bullied in the past and an additional 12% <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> witnessed workplace bullying. Nearly half of all American workers (49%) report that they have been affected by workplace bullying, either being a target themselves or having witnessed abusive behaviour against a co-worker.|$|E

This pattern held across offence categories and was also apparent for serious and frequent offending. Conversely, those of Asian origin were least likely to <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> offended.|$|R

Reactors 1, 2 and 3 have been cooled down to a stable level and nitrogen has been injected into their containment vessels to prevent hydrogen explosions; however, the assessment admits that contaminated water has leaked out of storage tanks, and that water level settings at its water purification facilities were incorrect.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of crystal sets {{is that they}} are vulnerable to interference from stations near in frequency to the desired station; that is to <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> low selectivity. Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple tuned circuit does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a large bandwidth (low Q factor) compared to modern receivers.|$|E
25|$|At {{a debate}} of Democratic presidential {{candidates}} in Philadelphia on October 30, 2007, NBC's Tim Russert cited {{a passage from}} a book by Shirley MacLaine in which the author writes that Kucinich had seen a UFO {{from her home in}} Washington State. Russert asked if MacLaine's assertion was true. Kucinich confirmed and emphasized that he merely meant he had seen an unidentified flying object, just as former U.S. president Jimmy Carter had. Russert then cited a statistic that 14% of Americans <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> witnessed a UFO.|$|E
25|$|Liberia {{scored a}} 3.3 {{on a scale}} from 10 (highly clean) to 0 (highly corrupt) on the 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index. This gave it a ranking 87th of 178 {{countries}} worldwide and 11th of 47 in Sub-Saharan Africa. This score represented a significant improvement since 2007, when the country scored 2.1 and ranked 150th of 180 countries. When dealing with public-facing government functionaries 89% of Liberians <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> had to pay a bribe, the highest national percentage in the world according to the organization's 2010 Global Corruption Barometer.|$|E

25|$|Families who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{run out of}} {{pharmaceutical}} options have moved to Colorado to access Charlotte's Web. The demand has spurred calls for more research to determine whether these products actually do what is claimed. Amy Brooks-Kayal, {{vice president of the}} American Epilepsy Society, stated that epileptic seizures may come and go without any obvious explanation, and that Charlotte's web could cause developmental harm. She recommended that parents relocate so that their affected children could have access to one of the nation's top pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to Colorado.|$|E
25|$|Conversion, as {{a purely}} civil wrong, is {{distinguishable}} from both theft and unjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft {{will also be}} conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from unjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, {{the person who has}} another's property may always raise a change of position defense, to <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there always must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights.|$|E
25|$|On 15 May 2014, {{the captain}} and three crew members were charged with murder, while the other 11 members of the crew were indicted for abandoning the ship. An arrest warrant was also issued for Yoo Byung-eun, the owner of Chonghaejin Marine, which {{operated}} Sewol, {{but he could not}} be found despite a nationwide manhunt. On 22 July 2014, police revealed that they had established that a dead man found in a field 415 kilometres south of Seoul was Yoo. Foul play was ruled out, but police <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> yet to establish the cause of Yoo's death.|$|E

25|$|Although Burzynski and his {{associates}} claim success {{in the use of}} antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases, and some of the clinic's patients <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been helped, {{there is no evidence of}} the clinical efficacy of these methods. The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the American Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK among others, is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. While the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|He also {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a Universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.|$|E
