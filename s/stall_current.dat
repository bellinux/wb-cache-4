These threshold perturbations separate undercritical perturbations which return to the normal phase from overcritical perturbations which lead to the superconducting phase. Careful numerical work in the small-current limit shows that the amplitude of these solutions is exponentially small in the current; we provide an approximate analysis which captures this behavior. As the current is increased toward the <b>stall</b> <b>current</b> J*, the width of these solutions diverges resulting in widely separated normal-superconducting interfaces. We map out numerically the dependence of J* on u (a parameter characterizing the material) and use asymptotic analysis to derive the behaviors for large u (J* ~ u^- 1 / 4) and small u (J -> J_c, the critical deparing current), which agree with the numerical work in these regimes. For currents other than J* the interface moves, and in this case we study the interface velocity as a function of u and J.

40|$|Motors used {{to actuate}} powered {{prostheses}} generally under-utilize their torque capacity due to thermal {{limitations of the}} windings. This thesis investigates the effectiveness of increasing {{the rate of heat}} transfer away from the windings in order to enable running motors at higher currents than their rated maximum levels, thus raising this torque saturation limit. Simulation models and physical prototypes based on the RCTiger 100 KV U 8 brushless outrunner motor were built to observe the temperature of the windings as constant current was applied to the motor. The addition of a fan-based active cooling system allowed the motor to run at 142 % of its maximum continuous current rating for up to 56 seconds before winding temperatures exceeded 550 C, and limited temperature increase in simulation to 26 ' above ambient temperature when the full 35 A <b>stall</b> <b>current</b> was applied for one second. Although the simplified circuit model was not able to fully capture nonlinear thermal behavior of the motor, simulations were able to predict approximate heating time constants and time duration before windings reached threshold temperature for current ranges 5 - 15 A. Experimental and simulation results support the hypothesis that active cooling enables motors to run at their full torque potential for short periods of time, which holds promise for the use of cooling mechanisms in prosthetic applications. by Ava E.

Therefore the need can arise for an additional resistance in series with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can build up the counter-EMF. As the motor rotation builds up, the resistance is gradually cut out. The speed-torque characteristic is an almost perfectly straight line between the stall torque and the no-load speed. This suits large inertial loads as the speed will drop until the motor slowly starts to rotate and these motors have a very high stalling torque.|$|R

40|$|Massive {{black hole}} {{binaries}} (BHBs) {{are expected to}} be one of the most powerful sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range of the pulsar timing array and of forthcoming space-borne detectors. They are believed to form in the final stages of galaxy mergers, and then harden by slingshot ejections of passing stars. However, evolution via the slingshot mechanism may be ineffective if the reservoir of interacting stars is not readily replenished, and the binary shrinking may come to a halt at roughly a parsec separation. Recent simulations suggest that the departure from spherical symmetry, naturally produced in merger remnants, leads to efficient loss cone refilling, preventing the binary from <b>stalling.</b> However, <b>current</b> N-body simulations able to accurately follow the evolution of BHBs are limited to very modest particle numbers. Brownian motion may artificially enhance the loss cone refilling rate in low-N simulations, where the binary encounters a larger population of stars due its random motion. Here we study the significance of Brownian motion of BHBs in merger remnants in the context of the final parsec problem. We simulate mergers with various particle numbers (from 8 k to 1 M) and with several density profiles. Moreover, we compare simulations where the BHB is fixed at the centre of the merger remnant with simulations where the BHB is free to random walk. We find that Brownian motion does not significantly affect the evolution of BHBs in simulations with particle numbers in excess of one million, and that the hardening measured in merger simulations is due to collisionless loss cone refilling.

Angle of attack, reduced frequency and both NACA 0021 and NACA 0012 airfoils are investigated using particle image velocimetry to assess their influence on the developed flow structure resulting from the ramp-up constant angular velocity motion. The pitch motion was shown to delay {{the onset of the}} stall vortex to high angles of attack, which is linked to increased lift. Moreover, increasing the reduced frequency reduced the rate of vortex growth as the angle of attack was increased. Development of a rear separation bubble with low velocity is noted during initial development of the dynamic stall process. Once the critical angle of attack is reached, initiation of the formation of the dynamic stall vortex is observed. Increased angular displacement resulted in the annihilation of the trailing edge vortices, by the initial stall vortex, which also coincided with vortex-induced separation leading to bluff body separation.

This is exactly what this paper seeks to avoid. It suggests priority actions and secondary improvements to sustain the dynamics of construction of the internal market, from today to the few coming years. It tries too to explain the underlying rationale for these recommendations by describing several aspects of the present state of the construction of the internal market and what factors are blocking or unblocking its progress. A main constraint has guided our thinking and writing of this paper. We have excluded the issuance of a new package of European directives and regulations to push for stronger convergence {{in the construction of the}} EU internal energy market. In fact, such an event is low likely. (cont.) By contrast, we have counted on two levers: the conscientious applying of the provisions of the second directive and companion regulations, and the promoting of reinforced regional cooperation agreements that will lead to the voluntary opening of some domestic markets to regional "mini internal markets". We believe and try to demonstrate that thank to these levers a minimal but sufficient dynamics of construction can be fostered. The identified priority actions will allow to progress without precluding further policy changes at a later date. Then the length of the phase is defined by the expected life of the current College of European Union Commissioners, that is until 2009. The paper is divided into 5 sections. Each section corresponds to priorities to improve a critical factor: 1 - national market designs, 2 - EU internal market design, 3 - industry structure, 4 - TSOs, and 5 - regulators.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} {{convective flow}} effects in a transonic compressor rotor with a circumferential-groove casing treatment are investigated in this paper. Experimental {{results show that}} the circumferential-groove casing treatment increases the compressor stall margin by almost 50 % for the current transonic compressor rotor. Steady flow simulation of the current casing treatment, however, yields only a 15 % gain in stall margin. The flow field at near-stall operation is highly unsteady due to several self-induced flow phenomena. These include shock oscillation, vortex shedding at the trailing edge, and interaction between the passage shock and the tip clearance vortex. The primary focus of the current investigation is to assess the effects of flow unsteadiness and unsteady flow convection on the circumferential-groove casing treatment. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques were applied in addition to steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to simulate the flow field at near-stall operation and to determine changes in <b>stall</b> margin. The <b>current</b> investigation reveals that unsteady flow effects are as important as steady flow effects on the performance of the circumferential grooves casing treatment in extending the stall margin of the current transonic compressor rotor. The primary unsteady flow mechanism is unsteady flow injection from the grooves into the main flow near the casing. Flows moving {{into and out of the}} grooves are caused due to local pressure difference near the grooves. As the pressure field becomes transient due to self-induced flow oscillation, flow injection from the grooves also becomes unsteady. The unsteady flow simulation shows that this unsteady flow injection from the grooves is substantial and contributes significantly to extending the compressor stall margin. Unsteady flows into and out of the grooves have as large a role as steady flows in the circumferential grooves. While the circumferential-groove casing treatment seems to be a steady flow device, unsteady flow effects should be included to accurately assess its performance as the flow is transient at near-stall operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to investigate the}} causes and effects of stone decay and soiling upon Scottish market crosses, and to develop a risk assessment model for this monument type. Risk assessment methods are otherwise used in spheres of business and industry. This research is unique in exploring the possibility of applying these techniques to the study and prediction of monument degradation. Additionally, the research is the first synthesised study of market crosses since 1928. A mapping methodology was developed in order to record the condition of a sample of Scottish market crosses. Visible evidence of the erosion, soiling and conservation of these monuments was collected and analysed in relation to various associated weathering factors. A risk assessment model was then developed for predicting the future condition of such monuments. Integrated with this, intervention criteria and conservation guidelines were also produced aimed at those charged with the care of market crosses. The model was applied to a case study to assess the risk of degradation of the tested monument. The method was found to work in practice, and could be used by practitioners in the future. The methodology for the research can be summarised as follows. Based upon the literature review, hypotheses were formulated regarding the effect of various weathering factors upon decay and soiling patterns. Data for all surviving market crosses in Scotland was co 11 ected from archives and publications. A pro-forma and relational database were designed to hold an of the gathered data. A sample of 27 crosses was selected for detailed analysis. An increased level of data was col 1 ected for the sampled crosses, and a programme of intensive fieldwork was undertaken at these. Evidence for a 11 visible decay, soiling and conservation treatment was mapped onto a detailed elevation sketch of each facade of every sampled cross. The decay and soiling were also classified according to intensity level and surface extent, based upon evidence from visual observation. In addition to the drafted mappings, the visited monuments were subject to a photographic survey. The collected data were analysed by interrogating the database and by applying a variety of statistical tests. A number of significant relationships were indicated between the various decay/soiling types and weathering agents. It was found that the patterns of decay, and particularly soiling, were greatly influenced by the monument characteristics, primarily due to {{the degree to which the}} stone was exposed to moisture ingress. Environmental factors were also found to have some influence, particularly the nature of the ground surface and the land-use type. Surprising 1 y, the leve 1 of nearby traffic was found to have little effect. Climatic factors were shown to be significant in relation to a few decay/soiling types. However, the contradictory nature of these trends suggested that the ranges within Scotland may be too limited to have much real effect upon the observed variations in decay/soiling. Previous intervention was found to have some significant effects, particularly in the case of chemical stone cleaning. Risk levels for each significant relationship were calculated from the rate of occurrence and the amount of stone degradation observed in the sample. The sample risk model was developed to produce a pro-forma designed for use by practitioners involved in managing Scottish market crosses. Practitioners could use the designed system to regularly record the condition of other crosses and assess the extent to which they are at risk from decay/soiling due to various weathering agents existing at each site. Intervention criteria were also produced in order to advise the practitioner on when and how to intervene to <b>stall</b> the <b>current</b> decay or to reduce the risks of future degradation of crosses in their care. Methods were also suggested for interpreting and promoting market crosses to the public.

40|$|Resume : In {{work package}} 2. 3. 1 "LNC Application Studies for 130 -seat Regional A/C" of the Clean Sky GRA LNC project, Fraunhofer proposes a {{high-lift}} wing having {{a leading edge}} depressed downwards (a. k. a. droop nose) for reducing noise radiated from the leading edge. As opposed to the precedent wing models, the current model has a droop nose extended almost over the entire wing from 18 % to 98 % span. Good aerodynamic performance (cl max = 2. 6 at 15 degree angle of attack) of this model has been estimated in CFD analysis conducted in a full-scale condition. Due to the Reynolds number effect, CFD analysis in a 1 : 6 -scaled condition has shown smaller cl max = 2. 0, smaller angle of attack and less abrupt <b>stall</b> behavior. The <b>current</b> study aimed {{to confirm that the}} same performance expected in the scaled condition is actually observed in a wind tunnel. For this purpose, a 1 : 6 -scaled half wing model was first designed and manufactured {{so that it can be}} set in three different configurations: (1) clean wing,(2) high-lift baseline having deployed TE flaps but no droop nose leading edge and (3) full high-lift with droop nose. WT tests with this model were performed in an automotive WT facility in Weissach, Germany. Flow speed was set at 40 m/s. Aerodynamic forces and moments were measured by a six-component balance at various angles of attack ranging from - 6 to 20 degrees with 2 degree step. In these tests, the model was placed upright on a platform covering a balancerig raised above the WT floor in order not to disturb the flow. In the tests with a transition tripping strip attached on the suction side near the LE, cl max of 1. 0 at AoA of 10 degree for the clean wing, cl max of 1. 7 at AoA of 8 degree for the high-lift baseline and cl max of 1. 9 at 12 degree angle of attack for the droop-nose configuration. All the configurations have less abruptstall behavior as expected. These results are in good agreement with those of the CFD analysis. In the test without the transition tripping strip, very similar results were observed in the clean wing and high-lift baseline configurations. In the droop nose configuration, however, a large cl max of 2. 5 at a very large stall angle of 20 degree was observed during the WT test. This results hould be more investigated. In addition to aerodynamic examination, aeroacoustic noise sources were also examined with an acoustic beamforming system during the WT tests. No noise sources would be detected for the clean wing. For both high-lift configurations, these were found at few points on the leading edge, at the outer flap and at one of the stay supporting the inner flap. No qualitative difference insource distribution could be found between these two configurations...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} a {{controversial}} topic in modern animal agriculture, {{partly because it}} generates interest from both the scientific community and the general public. The housing of gestating sows, particularly individual housing, {{is one of the}} most critical concerns in farm animal welfare. We hypothesize that the physical size of the standard gestation stall may limit movement and evoke demands and challenges on the sow to affect the physiological and psychological well-being of the individually housed sow. Thus, improvements in the design of the individual gestation stall system that allow more freedom to move, such as increasing stall width or designing a stall that could accommodate the changing size of the pregnant sow, may improve sow welfare. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of a width adjustable stall (FLEX) on productivity and behavior of dry sows. The experiment consisted of 3 replications (block 1, n= 4 sows; block 2, n= 4 sows; block 3, n= 8 sows), and multi-parious sows were allotted to either a FLEX stall or standard gestation stall for 1 gestation period. Sow mid-girth (top of the back to bottom of the udder) was measured 5 - 6 times throughout gestation to determine the best time points for FLEX stall width expansions. FLEX stall width was adjusted according to mid-girth measurements, and expanded to achieve an additional 2 cm of space between the bottom of the sow’s udder and floor of the stall so that sows could lie in full lateral recumbency without touching the sides of the stall. Productivity data recorded included: sow body weight (BW) and BW gain, number of piglets born and born alive, proportions of piglets stillborn, mummified, lost between birth and weaning, and weaned, and litter and mean piglet birth BW, weaning BW, and average BW gain from birth-to-weaning. Lesions were recorded on d 21 and d 111 of gestation. Sub-pilot behavior data were observed and registered for replicate 1 sows using continuous video-records for the l 2 hour lights on period (period 1, 0600 - 1000; period 2, 1000 - 1400; period 3, 1400 - 1800) prior FLEX stall adjustment and 12 hour lights on period post adjustment on d 21, 22, 23, 43, 44, 45, 93, 94, 95. A randomized complete block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement for treatments was used to analyze sow productivity and performance traits. Data were analyzed using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS. A preliminary analysis of data means and numerical trends was used to analyze sow behavior measurements. Sows housed in a FLEX stall had more (P < 0. 05) total born and a tendency for more piglets born alive (P = 0. 06) than sows housed in a standard stall. Sow body weight also tended to be higher (P = 0. 06) for sows housed in a FLEX stall compared to sows housed in a standard stall. There were numerical trends for mean durations of sit, lay, lay (OUT), and eat behaviors to be greater for sows housed in a FLEX stall compared with sows housed in a standard stall. The mean duration of lay (IN) behavior tended to be numerically less for sows housed in a FLEX stall compared with sows housed in a standard stall. There were numerical trends for the mean durations of stand and drink behaviors to be greater for sows housed in a standard stall compared with sows housed in a FLEX stall. The mean frequencies of postural changes and mean durations of oral-nasal-facial and sham-chew behaviors were numerically similar between types of gestation stall. Mean durations and numerical trends indicate that time of day influenced all of the behaviors assessed in this study. The results of this pilot study indicate that the adjustable FLEX stall may affect sow productivity and behavior differently than the standard gestation stall, and thus potentially improve sow well-being. Future research should continue to compare the new FLEX <b>stall</b> design to <b>current</b> housing systems in use and examine physiological traits and immune status in addition to behavioral and productivity traits to assess the effects that this housing system has on the overall welfare of the gestating sow...|$|R
