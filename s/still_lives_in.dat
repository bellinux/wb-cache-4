5|$|Ganga Singh was {{the best-known}} king among the Rajasthan princes. A {{favourite}} of the British Raj, he earned {{the title of}} Knight Commander of the Star of India. He served {{as a member of}} the Imperial War Cabinet, represented the country at the Imperial First World War Conferences and the British Empire at the Versailles Peace Conference and was aware of the shift of fortunes in the World War II but died in 1943, before the war was won by the allies.

The hall where he held his Golden Jubilee as a ruler of Bikaner is now a museum.

5|$|Pele {{was born}} to the female spirit Haumea, or Hina, who, like all Hawaiian gods and goddesses, descended from the supreme beings, Papa, or Earth Mother, and Wakea, or Sky Father. According to the myth, Pele {{originally}} lived on Kauai, when her older sister Nāmaka, the Goddess of the Sea, attacked her for seducing her husband. Pele fled southeast to the island of Oahu. When forced by Nāmaka to flee again, Pele moved southeast to Maui and finally to Hawaii, where she <b>still</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> the Halemaumau Crater at the summit of Kīlauea. There she was safe, because {{the slopes of the}} volcano are so high that even Nāmaka's mighty waves could not reach her. Pele's mythical flight, which alludes to an eternal struggle between volcanic islands and ocean waves, is consistent with geologic evidence about the ages of the islands decreasing to the southeast.|$|E
