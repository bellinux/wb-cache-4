500|$|Australian Rules {{football}} {{was also a}} big part of Ponting's sporting life; during winter he played junior football for North Launceston and until he was 14, it could have become a possible sporting option, before he broke the humerus in his right arm playing for North Launceston Under–17s. Ponting's arm was so badly damaged {{that it had to be}} pinned. Told to endure a 14-week lay-off, he never played competitive football again. He later wrote: [...] "At one stage I was concerned that the arm injury might also <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> playing cricket but they [...] did a pretty good job on pinning the bones—and it hasn't bothered me since." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the 2008 presidential election, Farrakhan explained, {{during a}} BET {{television}} interview, {{that he was}} [...] "careful" [...] never to endorse Obama during his campaign. [...] "I talked about him—but, in very beautiful and glowing terms, stopping short of endorsing him. And unfortunately, or fortunately, however we look at it, the media said I 'endorsed' him, so he renounced my so-called endorsement and support.

[...] When queried by interviewer Don Downie if that was too much to ask, Beierle replied, [...] "You bet! But it didn't <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> trying." ...|$|E

[...] Weldon then wrote a 4½-page letter to President George W. Bush that said that Bush's national security team was [...] "arrogant and disrespectful" [...] {{in the way it}} cancelled the trip.

2500|$|Vang further {{testified that}} Joseph Crotteau {{deserved}} to die [...] "because he {{accused me of}} giving him the finger and tried to cut {{in front of me}} to <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> leaving." [...] And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski [...] "deserved to die," [...] his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} the collaborations, Williams {{said it was}} [...] "no problem" [...] {{to connect with the}} featured artists on the album, saying [...] "a phone call was made and we were already cool with one another.

2500|$|Eça, a cosmopolite {{widely read}} in English literature, was not enamoured of English society, {{but he was}} fascinated by its oddity. In Bristol he wrote: [...] "Everything about this society is disagreeable to me - from its limited way of {{thinking}} to its indecent manner of cooking vegetables." [...] As often happens when a writer is unhappy, the weather is endlessly bad. Nevertheless, he was rarely bored and was content to stay in England for some fifteen years. [...] "I detest England, {{but this does not}} <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> declaring that as a thinking nation, she is probably the foremost." [...] It may be said that England acted as a constant stimulus and a corrective to Eça’s traditionally Portuguese Francophilia.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this {{chain of}} defections, François Fillon {{remained}} defiant, holding a rally at the Trocadéro on that afternoon intended as show of force. He then appeared on 20 heures on France 2 that evening, {{during which he}} {{refused to give up}} his candidacy, saying that [...] "there is no alternative" [...] and adding that [...] "no one today can <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> being a candidate", insisting that [...] "it is not the party that will decide" [...] the fate of his candidacy. He said that the rally at the Trocadéro cemented his legitimacy, and that though he would have stepped down two months ago if indicted then, it was now too close to the presidential election and it would be unfair to voters of the right if he quit now. With a [...] "political committee" [...] planned for the following day, he proposed to assemble a modified campaign team, naming François Baroin, Éric Ciotti, and Luc Chatel, in an attempt to rally support around his candidacy. Immediately after Fillon's appearance, Juppé announced on Twitter that he give a statement to the press in Bordeaux at 10:30 CET the day after.|$|E
2500|$|The album gained media {{attention}} for its explicit themes and exploration of homosexuality, suggested as a [...] "queer-studies thesis." [...] Singapore law officials banned the album {{due to its}} lyrics supporting homosexuality.

Her cover of Rod Stewart's [...] "Tonight's the Night" [...] suggests losing her virginity to another woman, also alluding to bisexuality. Media attention led Stewart to announce [...] "that's an original song by Janet Jackson" [...] when performed in concerts. In response to criticism, Jackson said, [...] "I {{have a lot of}} gay friends, men and women, and that's why I did it. I knew people would say I was gay, and I didn't care." [...] She also stated, [...] "I caught a lot of hell for that... religious groups have been upset with me for certain songs on the album, but it’s not going to <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> writing what I feel inside."

I think I tend to be a bit more aware of what's going on around me on the football pitch because I am deaf in one ear. Maybe that's led to some of my other senses becoming heightened a bit.

[...] "Amityville" [...] is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city's crowning as murder capital of the United States. [...] "Bitch Please II" [...] features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus. [...] "Kim", the prequel to [...] "'97 Bonnie and Clyde" [...] from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem [...] "screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew". The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, [...] "Bleed, bitch, bleed!" [...] "Kim" [...] is followed by [...] "Under the Influence", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 [...] "runs rampant" [...] on the track. [...] "Criminal" [...] features production from Dr. Dre, which consists of [...] "piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that 'you can't <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> topping these charts...'". He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that [...] "half the shit I say, I just {{make it up to}} make you mad".|$|E
2500|$|Since 1868, {{the pope}} was plagued first by facial {{erysipelas}} {{and then by}} open sores on his legs. Nevertheless, he insisted on celebrating daily Mass. The extraordinary heat of the summer of 1877 worsened the sores {{to the effect that}} he had to be carried. He underwent several painful medical procedures, which he undertook with remarkable patience. He spent most of his last few weeks in his library, where he received cardinals and held papal audiences. On 8 December, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, his situation improved markedly to the point that he could walk again. By February, he could say Mass again on his own in standing position, enjoying the popular celebration of the 75th anniversary of his first communion. Bronchitis, a fall to the floor, and rising temperature worsened his situation after 4 February 1878. He continued joking about himself: when the Cardinal Vicar of Rome ordered bell-ringing and non-stop prayers for his recuperation, the pope asked, [...] "Why do you want to <b>stop</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> going to heaven?" [...] He told his doctor that his time had come. Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878, aged 85, concluding the longest pontificate in papal history, after that of St. Peter, whom tradition holds had reigned for 37 years. His last words were, [...] "Guard the church I loved so well and sacredly", as recorded by the cardinals kneeling beside his bedside. His body was originally buried in St. Peter's grotto, but was moved in a night procession on 13 July 1881 to the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls. When the cortege approached the Tiber River, a group of anticlerical Romans screaming [...] "Long live Italy! Death to the Pope! Death to the Priests!" [...] threatened to throw the coffin into the river but a contingent of militia arrived to prevent this. The simple grave of Pius IX was changed by his successor, John Paul II, after his beatification.|$|E
