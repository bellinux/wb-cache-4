Owens first learned that he would be killed off when Carter called him and told him, [...] "You're going to go out a hero, of sorts". Owens was {{slightly}} disappointed, noting that he had just been introduced in the series during the conclusion of the previous season. Davis was upset that Owens was leaving the series, and reportedly told Owens during their last scene together, [...] "I don't want to <b>shoot</b> <b>you!</b> I enjoy working with you!" [...] Owens, however, jokingly noted that Davis had no problems slapping him when the script called for it. In the episode, Laurie Holden, who played Marita Covarrubias, returns.

To accomplish this, she was given [...] "terrible-looking" [...] contact lenses and her hair was unkempt.|$|E

The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill."

I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to <b>shoot</b> <b>you</b> myself, you goddamned whimpering coward."

500|$|HM Prison Maze was {{considered}} one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe. In addition to [...] fences, each H-Block was encompassed by an [...] concrete wall topped with barbed wire, and all gates on the complex were made of solid steel and electronically operated. Prisoners had been planning the escape for several months. Bobby Storey and Gerry Kelly had started working as orderlies in H7, which allowed them to identify weaknesses in the security systems, and six handguns had been smuggled into the prison. Shortly after 2:30 pm on 25 September, prisoners seized control of H7 by simultaneously taking the prison officers hostage at gunpoint in order to prevent them from triggering an alarm. One officer was stabbed with a craft knife, and another was knocked down by a blow to the back of the head. One officer who attempted to prevent the escape was shot in the head by Gerry Kelly, but survived. By 2:50 pm the prisoners were in control of H7 without an alarm being raised. A dozen prisoners also took uniforms from the officers, and the officers were also forced to hand over their car keys and details of where their cars were, for possible later use during the escape. A rearguard was left behind to watch over hostages and keep the alarm from being raised until they believed the escapees were clear of the prison, when they returned to their cells. At 3:25 pm, a lorry delivering food supplies arrived at the entrance to H7, whereupon Brendan McFarlane and other prisoners took the occupants hostage at gunpoint and took them inside H7. The lorry driver was told the lorry was being used in the escape, and he was instructed what route to take and how to react if challenged. Storey told the driver, [...] "This man [...] is doing 30 years and he will <b>shoot</b> <b>you</b> without hesitation if he has to. He has nothing to lose." ...|$|E
