40|$|Background: Homologous {{chromosomes}} <b>separate</b> <b>in</b> meiosis I {{and sister}} chromatids <b>separate</b> <b>in</b> meiosis II, generating haploid gametes. To {{address the question}} why sister chromatids do not <b>separate</b> <b>in</b> meiosis I, we explored the roles of Shogoshin 1 (Sgo 1) in chromosome separation during oocyte meiosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sgo 1 function was evaluated by exogenous overexpression to enhance its roles and RNAi to suppress its roles during two meioses of mouse oocytes. Immunocytochemistry and chromosome spread were used to evaluate phenotypes. The exogenous Sgo 1 overexpression kept homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids not to <b>separate</b> <b>in</b> meiosis I and meiosis II, respectively, while the Sgo 1 RNAi promoted premature separation of sister chromatids. Conclusions: Our results reveal that prevention of premature separation of sister chromatids in meiosis I requires th...|$|R
