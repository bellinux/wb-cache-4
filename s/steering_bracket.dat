This paper mainly {{talks about}} the problem of flat television’s {{placement}} and the creative design of this automatic <b>steering</b> <b>bracket</b> which designed on the basis of analyzing the existing brackets and aims to make televisions turning around instantly, conveniently and automatically (instead of never moved or hand operated) for people who are watching TV from whichever angle. It is the working of two small electrical motors drives the rotation of the rack at horizontal direction and vertical direction. And only with the help of its remote control can this automatic <b>steering</b> <b>bracket</b> divert the television. The bracket was made of bigger strength aluminum alloy, it is lighter weight, stainless, surface beautiful, compared with traditional processing methods, and selecting aluminum alloy can remarkably improve the production efficiency, ensure product quality and improve the qualification rate of finished products...|$|E
40|$|National audienceClassical {{ultrasonic}} tomography generally uses source {{signals of}} constant amplitude. Mostly linear characteristics like ultrasonic amplitude, attenuation or {{time of flight}} in various directions are evaluated and used to structural defects imaging. On the other hand, more complex and nonlinear characteristics of elastic wave propagation, like 3 rd harmonics etc. are starting to be also used for ultrasonic imaging e. g. in medicine, providing more sensitive indicators of small body changes and irregularities. Nonlinear parameters obtained by Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy (NEWS) NDT techniques can give us better information about incipient damage zones than linear ones. The main advantage of NEWS consists not only in higher sensitivity {{but also in the}} ability to detect defects smaller than the ultrasonic wavelength. Some limitations of NEWS methodology are given by difficulties with more precise defects location when global excitation of larger or more complicated structures is applied. To overcome these constraints, further developments of NEWS techniques are desirable for nonlinear pseudo-tomography or tomography defects imaging. Two NEWS methods are considered: Nonlinear Wave Modulation Spectroscopy (NWMS) and Nonlinear Time Reversal Mirrors (NLTRM) with ESAM and DORT signal processing. Testing results, obtained on metallic and concrete parts illustrate performance of both procedures. Both NDT procedures are illustrated on the ASB (Actuator <b>Steering</b> <b>Bracket)</b> aircraft landing gear part subjected to fatigue loading. No arising defects were indicated by traditional NDT methods, although the slightly enhanced acoustic emission (AE) activity was observed to be concentrated in the area depicted by crosslets. The ASB sample was tested by the above NLTRM procedure after 25000 cycles. Sine-pulse train of frequency 389 kHz and 30 &_mu;s duration has been used in primary excitation. Damaged zones detected by AE and NLTRM are overlapping, which confirms high sensitivity of proposed nonlinear methodology. Advantage of nonlinear tomography-like imaging methods is in their potentiality to acquire very complex information about the tested structure...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{principle}} of a double-half-revolution mechanism, a new-style wheel-legged lunar rover was proposed in this paper. Its mobile system includes rover body frame, four identical wheel-legged components and <b>steering</b> <b>brackets,</b> etc. The independently driven and steering wheel-legged components are based on a double-half-revolution mechanism, and their driving moments are transmitted by two tandem planetary gear trains. Its mobile performance was analyzed, including fluctuation of rover body, capability of anti-rolling and vertical obstacle-climbing capability. Analysis shows that the wheel-legged lunar rover with double-half-revolution mechanism is adaptive to the undulate lunar surface. IACSIT; Beijing Technology and Business Universit...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{principle}} of double-half-revolution mechanism, a new-style bionic wheel-legged lunar rover was designed in this paper. Its mobile mechanism is comprised of four identical wheel-legged mechanisms, rover body <b>bracket</b> and <b>steering</b> <b>brackets,</b> etc. On the basis of establishing the coordinate transformation models of the bionic wheel-legged mechanisms, kinematics of its mobile mechanism was analyzed, and the forward kinematics models of the striking rods were established. Based on kinematics simulation in COSMOS Motion software, this paper obtained the trail curves of joints relative to the reference coordinate system. Simulation shows that the fluctuation of the bionic wheel-legged lunar rover is small and it can realize the striding movement smoothly. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} milestone 1941 Clipper {{rode the}} senior wheelbase of 127 in {{and used the}} One Twenty's [...] straight eight, but produced 125 bhp (five more than the One Twenty). Despite the familiar engine, few Clipper parts were interchangeable with other models. The chassis was entirely new: a double-drop frame allowed a lower floor without reducing road clearance. The engine was mounted well forward and the rear shocks were angled to assist the traditional Packard fifth shock in controlling side-sway. The front suspension was entirely new, since the lower frame eliminated the need for Packard's traditional long torque arms. A double-link connection between the Pitman arm and <b>steering</b> <b>brackets,</b> with a cross bar and idler arm and two cross tubes, controlled wheel movement.|$|R
25|$|The engine {{mounting}} was substantially different. Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle {{as on the}} Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy <b>steering</b> head <b>bracket.</b> This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit is bolted to a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The {{engine mounting}} {{was said to have}} been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} ultrasonic intermodulation {{as a method of}} robustly detecting cracks in engineering components. The bispectrum signal processing technique is used to analyse the nonlinear response of a sample to continuous excitation at two frequencies. The increased nonlinearity due to defects such as fatigue cracks is detected. The technique is shown to be insensitive to the support conditions and excitation positions. The importance of the shape of the excited modes is demonstrated and suggests that global inspection can be achieved only by exciting multiple modes. This multimode approach is then applied to the detection of cracking of a steel <b>steering</b> actuator <b>bracket...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{common type}} of {{micro-alloyed}} steel is improved-formability HSLA. It has a yield strength up to [...] but only costs 24% more than A36 steel (...) [...] One of the disadvantages of this steel {{is that it is}} 30 to 40% less ductile. In the U.S., these steels are dictated by the ASTM standards A1008/A1008M and A1011/A1011M for sheet metal and A656/A656M for plates. These steels were developed for the automotive industry to reduce weight without losing strength. Examples of uses include door-intrusion beams, chassis members, reinforcing and mounting <b>brackets,</b> <b>steering</b> and suspension parts, bumpers, and wheels.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} alloy castings for safety critical structural components such as engine mount <b>brackets,</b> <b>steering</b> knuckles, and control arms, offers significant opportunities for achieving weight reduction in automobiles, {{since they are}} typically about half {{the weight of the}} steel, cast iron, or ductile iron component that they replace. Metal Compression Forming (MCF) is a variant of the squeeze casting process, in which molten metal is allowed to solidify under pressure in order to close porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure on the entire mold face, thereby directing pressure on all regions of the casting and producing a uniformly sound part. The process is capable of producing parts with properties close to those of forgings, while retaining the near net shape, complexity in geometry, and relatively low cost of the casting process. The paper describes the casting process development involved in the production of an aluminum A 357 alloy motor mount bracket, including the use of a filling and solidification model to design the gating and determine process parameters. Tensile properties of the component are presented and correlated with those of forged components. Limited fatigue properties obtained by fully reversed strain controlled testing are also presented...|$|R
