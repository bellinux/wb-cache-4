5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E

6000|$|As I was desirous {{to recover}} the long lost bottom of Walden Pond, I {{surveyed}} it carefully, before the ice broke up, early in '46, with compass and chain and <b>sounding</b> <b>line.</b> There have been many stories told about the bottom, or rather no bottom, of this pond, which certainly had no foundation for themselves. It is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it. I have visited two such Bottomless Ponds in one walk in this neighborhood. Many have believed that Walden reached quite through {{to the other side}} of the globe. Some who have lain flat on the ice for a long time, looking down through the illusive medium, perchance with watery eyes into the bargain, and driven to hasty conclusions by the fear of catching cold in their breasts, have seen vast holes [...] "into which a load of hay might be driven," [...] if there were anybody to drive it, the undoubted source of the Styx and entrance to the Infernal Regions from these parts. Others have gone down from the village with a [...] "fifty-six" [...] and a wagon load of inch rope, but yet have failed to find any bottom; for while the [...] "fifty-six" [...] was resting by the way, they were paying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for marvellousness. But I can assure my readers that Walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable, though at an unusual, depth. I fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone weighing about a pound and a half, and could tell accurately when the stone left the bottom, by having to pull so much harder before the water got underneath to help me. The greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet; to which may be added the five feet which it has risen since, making one hundred and seven. This is a remarkable depth for so small an area; yet not an inch of it can be spared by the imagination. What if all ponds were shallow? Would it not react on the minds of men? I am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol. While men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless.|$|E

60|$|Up to {{this moment}} I have had my eye mainly upon prose; for though in verse also the {{implication}} of the logical texture is a crowning beauty, yet in verse it may be dispensed with. You would think that here was a death-blow to all I have been saying; and far from that, it is but a new illustration of the principle involved. For if the versifier is not bound to weave a pattern of his own, it is because another pattern has been formally imposed upon him {{by the laws of}} verse. For that is the essence of a prosody. Verse may be rhythmical; it may be merely alliterative; it may, like the French, depend wholly on the (quasi) regular recurrence of the rhyme; or, like the Hebrew, it may consist in the strangely fanciful device of repeating the same idea. It does not matter on what principle the law is based, so it be a law. It may be pure convention; it may have no inherent beauty; all that {{we have a right to}} ask of any prosody is, that it shall lay down a pattern for the writer, and that what it lays down shall be neither too easy nor too hard. Hence it comes that it is much easier for men of equal facility to write fairly pleasing verse than reasonably interesting prose; for in prose the pattern itself has to be invented, and the difficulties first created before they can be solved. Hence, again, there follows the peculiar greatness of the true versifier: such as Shakespeare, Milton, and Victor Hugo, whom I place beside them as versifier merely, not as poet. These not only knit and knot the logical texture of the style with all the dexterity and strength of prose; they not only fill up the pattern of the verse with infinite variety and sober wit; but they give us, besides, a rare and special pleasure, by the art, comparable to that of counterpoint, with which they follow at the same time, and now contrast, and now combine, the double pattern of the texture and the verse. Here the <b>sounding</b> <b>line</b> concludes; a little further on, the well-knit sentence; and yet a little further, and both will reach their solution on the same ringing syllable. The best that can be offered by the best writer of prose is to show us the development of the idea and the stylistic pattern proceed hand in hand, sometimes by an obvious and triumphant effort, sometimes with a great air of ease and nature. The writer of verse, by virtue of conquering another difficulty, delights us with a new series of triumphs. He follows three purposes where his rival followed only two; and the change is of precisely the same nature as that from melody to harmony. Or if you prefer to return to the juggler, behold him now, to the vastly increased enthusiasm of the spectators, juggling with three oranges instead of two. Thus it is: added difficulty, added beauty; and the pattern, with every fresh element, becoming more interesting in itself.|$|E

40|$|The two aims of {{the project}} involved: 1. Devising a system for {{prediction}} o f areas of bathymetric change within the Fal estuary 2. Formulating and evaluating a method for interpolating single beam acoustic bathymetry to avoid artefacts o f interpolation. In order to address these aims, sources of bathymetric data for the Fal estuary were identified as Truro Harbour Office, Cornwall County Council and the Environment Agency. The data collected from these sources included red wavelength Lidar, aerial photography and single beam acoustic bathymetry {{from a number of}} different years. These data were input into a Geographic Information System (GIS) and assessed for suitability for the purposes o f data comparison and hence assessment of temporal trends in bathymetry within the estuary Problems encountered during mterpolation of the acoustic bathymetry resulted in the later aim of the project, to formulate an interpolation system suitable for interpolation of the single beam, bathymetric data in a realistic way, avoiding serious artefacts of interpolation. This aim was met, successfully, through the following processes: 1. An interpolation system was developed, using polygonal zones, bounded by channels and coastlines, to prevent interpolation across these boundaries. This system, based on Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation, was referred to as Zoned Inverse Distance Weighting (ZIDW). 2. ZIDW was found, by visual inspection, to eliminate the interpolation artefacts described above. 3. The processes of identification of <b>sounding</b> <b>lines</b> and charmels, and the allocation of soundings and output grid cells to polygons, were successfully automated to allow ZIDW to be applied to large and multiple data sets. Manual intervention was maintained for processes performed most successfully by the human brain to optimise the results o f ZIDW. 4. To formalise the theory of ZIDW it was applied to a range of idealised, mathematically defined chaimels. For simple straight and regular curved, mathematical channels interpolation by the standard TIN method was found to perform as well as ZIDW. 5. Investigation of sinusoidal channels within a rectangular estuary, however, revealed that the TIN method begins to produce serious interpolation artefacts where <b>sounding</b> <b>lines</b> are not parallel to the centre lines o f channels and ridges. Hence, overall ZIDW was determined mathematically to represent the optimum method o f interpolation for single beam, bathymelric data. 6. Finally, ZIDW was refined, using data from the Humber and Gironde estuaries, to achieve universal applicability for interpolation of single beam, echo soimding data from any estuary. 7. The refinements involved allowance for non-continuous, flood and ebb type charmels; consideration {{of the effects of the}} scale of the estuary; smoothing of the channels using cubic splines; interpolation using a 'smart' ellipse and the option to reconstruct <b>sounding</b> <b>lines</b> from data that had previously been re-ordered...|$|R
