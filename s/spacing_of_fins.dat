40|$|Nearly all cooling systems, and an {{increasing}} proportion of heating systems, utilize the vapor compression cycle (VCC) to provide and remove heat from conditioned spaces. Even though the application of VCC’s throughout the building environment is ubiquitous, effective and accessible models {{of the performance of}} these systems remains elusive. Such models could be important tools for VCC designers, building designers and building energy managers {{as well as those who}} are attempting to optimize building energy performance through the use of model-based control systems. Strides have been made in developing lumped parameter models for VCC’s. In spite of these contributions, widespread accessibility and use of VCC performance models has yet to be achieved. This work addresses one of the barriers in applying VCC performance models, the identification of model parameter values required to make performance models useful and accurate. A steady state spreadsheet-based model has been developed which, when combined with standard test data provided by system manufacturers, allows the modeler to identify the salient heat transfer parameters that govern the behavior of the condensers and the evaporators. Performance data provided by the system manufacturer was used to determine model parameter values. Data used from the test conditions for the determination of these parameters include the evaporating and condensing pressures, the input power, the cooling rate and the degrees of superheat and subcool. Most importantly, these data allowed for the computation of the effective heat transfer characteristics within the moving boundaries, as opposed to heat transfer values calculated strictly from the geometry. Using an effective heat transfer value allows for the spreadsheet-based model to use a broad spectrum of VCC models despite their potential differences in heat exchanger design conditions, that is not dependent on the number and <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fins</b> or other optimization design criteria. To validate the concept, the approach was used to identify parameter values for three different air conditioning units with three different sets of performance specifications. On average the model predicted a heat absorption rate within 1. 5 % - 3. 7 % error of what was measured by the manufacturer during testing. This model requires limited sensor information to provide parameters determined under steady state conditions that can be used in a dynamic model to assist in design, control and operation of traditional VCC systems over a range of operating conditions...|$|E

The TEG is installed in the tailpipe of a commercial vehicle (3. 5 tonnes) and a heavy-duty vehicle (40 tonnes). The exhaust gas is used as the heat source and the cooling water as the heat sink. Two different heat exchanger configurations are considered: plain fins and offset strip <b>fins.</b> The influence <b>of</b> the height, length and <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fins</b> on the electrical and net power is analysed for the fixed width and length of the TEG. The influence of the length and width of the TEG and of {{the height of the}} thermocouple legs is also investigated. According to the criteria used in this study, plain fins are the best choice, yielding a maximum electrical power of 188 W for the commercial vehicle and 886 W for the heavy-duty vehicle. The best recovery efficiency is about 2 %, with an average thermoelectric material efficiency of approximately 4. 4 %, for the light-duty vehicle.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} heat transfer and pressure drop associated with forced flow of deionized water over five micro pin <b>fin</b> heat sinks <b>of</b> different <b>spacing,</b> arrangements, and shapes was conducted experimentally. Nusselt numbers and friction factors were obtained over Reynolds numbers ranging from 14 to 720. The thermal and hydraulic results were obtained {{to evaluate and}} compare the heat sinks performances at fixed mass flow rate, fixed pressure drop, and fixed pumping power. Two distinct regions of the Nusselt number dependency on the Reynolds number separated by a critical Reynolds number have been identified for unstreamlined pin fin devices while the streamlined device showed no slope change. The effects <b>of</b> <b>spacing,</b> shape <b>of</b> pin <b>fins,</b> and arrangement on friction factor and heat transfer were in agreement with existing literature.

A finite-volume-based computational study of steady laminar natural convection from a finned isothermal vertical plate with different fin arrays {{has been carried out}} to determine the heat transfer augmentation factor with different fin aspect ratio, <b>fin</b> <b>spacing</b> and inclination <b>of</b> <b>fin.</b> Heat transfer behaviors with the fins have been analyzed by examining variations of the local and average Nusselt numbers in two- dimensional flow. Four different fin arrays heights (H = 6, 12, 18, 24 mm) and four different angles of inclination (θ = 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, 90 °) are considered. In order to understand the heat transfer characteristics of this problem, a total of 96 cases for each of conductive and non- conductive fins are considered. It is found that significant heat transfer augmentation is obtained for conductive (20 % higher augmentation factor when the fin aspect ratio is 6, and angle of inclination is 60 ° and pitch-to-length ratio is 0. 2) and non-conductive fins (10 % higher augmentation factor, at <b>fin</b> aspect ratio <b>of</b> 8, angle of inclination at 45 ° and pitch-to- length ratio at 0. 5).

40|$|Three species {{ascribed}} to the goby genus Lentipes include two from Hawaii, L. concolor (Gill 1860) and L. seminudus Gunther (1880), and one from the Gulf of Guinea, L. bustamantaei Boulenger (1916). The Hawaiian species were described from single specimens of different sex. Specimens collected recently provide evidence that Hawaiian Lentipes comprise a single, sexually dimorphic species. The African species differs significantly and more nearly resembles Sicydium. Lentipes now must be considered a monotypic genus (L. concolor) endemic to the Hawaiian archipelago. The genus is distinguished by weak scalation (2 - 150 cycloid scales per side on posterior trunk), five subequa 1 and one shorter spine in the first dorsal fin, 16 pectoral rays, and one projecting ossified gill raker on the first arch. The sexes differ mainly in head shape, relative mouth size, dentition, <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> dorsal <b>fins,</b> and coloration. The female is drab; the male is yellow to red posteriorly and has a white anal fin margin. Adult Lentipes, omnivorous and growing to nearly 140 mm TL, inhabit pristine steep-gradient streams. Larvae develop in the ocean and appear at stream mouths as post 1 arvae less than 20 mm 10 ng. Upstream'migrants are capable of ascending high waterfalls, where they reach areas of permanent residence. Surveys located Lentipes in 22 streams (6 {{percent of the total}} streams in the archipelago) but the goby was abundant in only a few of them.

40|$|The almost {{two-dimensional}} steady-state {{rates of}} heat loss from arrays of uniformly-spaced vertical rectangular fins, extending upwards [...] in otherwise stagnant air [...] from horizontal heated bases, have been measured. (The vertical air {{gaps between the}} fins were closed at their sides, by insulated vertical end-barriers.) The effects of various combinations of height, thickness and <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fins,</b> for different base temperatures (in the range 40 to 100 Â°C), have been studied. For the configuration considered, in a normal ambient environment (~ 20 Â°C), there is an optimal fin spacing ([reverse similar, equals] 16 mm) corresponding to the greatest steady-state rate of free convective/conductive heat loss through the air from the finned system, and this is almost independent of {{the temperature of the}} heat exchanger base (in the range 40 - 100 Â°C). At this optimal spacing for base temperatures not greater than 50 Â°C, the convective/conductive heat transfer rate from the array increases with the fin height up to about 60 mm, so that it would be uneconomic to employ taller fins if convection/conduction is dominant compared with radiation. If the radiation contribution is also considered, then the optimal spacing corresponding to the maximum total steady-state rate of heat loss through the air is somewhat less than the optimal spacing for which, under the same temperature conditions, the maximum steady-state rate of convective/conductive heat leak occurs. The greater the emissivity of the heat exchanger surfaces, the narrower the optimal uniform gaps between the fins. A two-dimensional finite-difference computer program has been composed to predict the temperature distribution throughout the heat exchanger for a stipulated ambient environmental temperature and experimentally-determined distribution of the heat transfer coefficient over the surfaces of the exchanger. This enables, for instance, any hot spots to be located prior to a proposed design being built. ...|$|R
