40|$|Abstract — In {{the first}} part of this paper, we derive a source model {{describing}} the relationship between bits, distortion, and quantization step size for transform coders. Based on this source model, a variable frame rate coding algorithm is developed. The basic idea is to select a proper picture frame rate to ensure a minimum picture quality for every frame. Because our source model can predict approximately the number of coded bits when a certain quantization step size is used, we could predict the quality and bits of coded images without going through the entire realcoding process. Therefore, we could skip the right number of picture frames to accomplish the goal of constant image quality. Our proposed variable frame rate coding schemes are simple but quite effective as demonstrated by simulation results.

40|$|International audienceOne {{possible}} way {{to estimate the}} solar resource required by the solar industry, is to use Regional Climate Models, which provide a comprehensive and physically-based state-of-the-art description of the atmosphere and its interactions with the Earth's surface. In this study, the regional climate model RegCM 4 is used to provide estimates of surface solar irradiation over the south-western Indian Ocean. The main objective {{of this study is}} to customize RegCM 4 for solar resource assessment. As a first step, two radiative transfer schemes are tested and evaluated: (1) the radiation scheme of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM) Version 3 (default); (2) the newly implemented Rapid Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM), which utilizes the correlated-k approach to calculate long-wave and short-wave fluxes and heating rates. A one-year simulation for 2000 is performed with RegCM 4 -CCM and RegCM 4 -RRTM driven by initial and boundary conditions from ERA-Interim reanalyses. The domain extends from 0 ° S to 40 ° S and 0 ° E to 100 ° E, centred on Reunion with two different grid spacings: 20 km and 50 km. Convective precipitation is calculated with the Emanuel scheme. A preliminary comparison of the seasonal radiation budget at the surface and top-of-atmosphere during austral summer and winter from RegCM 4 -CCM and RegCM 4 -RRTM shows good qualitative agreement, though RegCM 4 -CCM tends to overestimate the radiative fluxes when compared to RegCM 4 -RRTM.
