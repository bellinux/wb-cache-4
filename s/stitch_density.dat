40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the effect of <b>stitch</b> <b>density</b> on the delamination toughening and self-healing properties of carbon&ndash;epoxy laminates. The stitches provide the laminate with the synergistic combination of high mode I interlaminar fracture toughness to resist delamination cracking and healing properties to repair delamination damage. The results show that the fracture toughness of the laminate increased with <b>stitch</b> <b>density,</b> due to higher traction (crack closure) loads exerted by the stitches bridging the delamination. During the healing process these bridging stitches ﬁrst melt and then ﬂow into the delamination, leading to self-healing with full restoration of the mode I fracture toughness. Furthermore, the stitches were capable of repairing delamination cracks many times larger than the original size of the stitches. The effect of <b>stitch</b> <b>density</b> on the healing process of delamination cracks and restoration of fracture toughness was found to remain approximately the same under multiple repair operations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} support the {{development}} of the recent composite manufacturing processes involving resin infusion across dry preforms prior to cure, a big effort has been realized to obtain reliable experimental techniques for measuring the through-thickness permeability. Some of our previous works focused on the through-thickness permeability measured in saturated regime for some so-called Non Crimped New Concept (NC 2) multiaxial fabrics [Drapier S, Pagot A, Vautrin A, Henrat P. Influence of the <b>stitching</b> <b>density</b> on the transverse permeability of non-crimped new concept (NC 2) multiaxial reinforcements: measurements and predictions.

An experimental assessment of the saturated transverse permeability in Non Crimp New Concept (NC 2) multiaxial fabrics. To appear in J Compos Mater]. But since in the real processes, both saturated and transient permeabilities are encountered, experimental assessments of these two permeabilities has to be achieved. If in saturated regime the through-thickness permeability is relatively easy to assess, in transient regime, however, the flow front is hardly defined in such small dimensions (order of 1 mm). Relying on optical fibre sensors to detect the flow front, transient through-thickness permeabilities are assessed here for various fibre volume fractions. using a Darcy's law to deduce the permeability from the fluid pressure and velocity. These measurements exhibit a satisfying reproducibility and appear to be consistent with the saturated permeabilities, in the sense that here again the permeability measured depends on the face receiving the fluid [Elbouazzaoui O, Drapier S, Henrat P. An experimental assessment of the saturated transverse permeability in Non Crimp New Concept (NC 2) multiaxial fabrics. To appear in J Compos Mater]. Moreover, the transient permeabilities appear to be around a factor 10 larger than the saturated permeabilities. Since the differentiation between saturated and transient permeabilities is an open problem, these experimental results can be used for some process simulations as well as a basis for some theoretical developments of the permeability prediction in both regimes...|$|R

For both stitches, thread tension affects significantly in determination of thread consumption. In case of chain-stitch 401, there are combined effects of thread tensions together with fabric thickness and <b>stitch</b> <b>density</b> which determines accurate consumption values considering {{the properties of}} the stitch. The analysis of lock-stitch 301 shows a joint effect of thread tension and yarn count to the consumption of the needle thread. In comparison, inclusion of proposed thread tension variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. Once tension parameter is included in the formulae, apparel manufacturers need to optimize and measure the tension during garment pre-production stage as specified for the geometric requirement of the stitch. The average tension value set for a given stitch under selected <b>stitch</b> <b>density</b> can be measured using MLT Wesco tension meter and that figure need to be substituted in calculating the thread consumption.

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{faced by}} structural designers {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult as the imposed design criteria of energy absorbing structures requires weight reduction of structures without compromising cost and crushing performance. The current research is thus aimed at investigating the energy absorption of fibre reinforced composites measured {{as a function of}} geometry and scale within weight-critical structures. At the first stage, an innovative structure composed of four intersecting composite plates was tested. It was found that the structural stability {{played a crucial role in}} this intersecting structure. In order to avoid generating buckling failure before turning to a progressive crushing regime, Finite Element Method (FEM) was used on composite structures as a technical tool. At the second stage, three geometric structures containing corrugated composite laminates and possessing better structural stability were designed and examined. To increase the interlaminar fracture toughness properties of composite materials, through-thickness stitching methods were introduced. Fracture toughness (Mode-I and Mode-II) and flexure tests were performed on composite materials for comparing the effectiveness of different crushing mechanisms. Fracture toughness results presented a significant improvement of using stitching methods on Mode-I properties, while slight reduction on Mode-II properties was also detected. They also indicated the flexural properties of structural composites can significantly affect their energy absorption capabilities. At the final stage, six different factors including resin type, fibre architecture, crushing speed and stitching parameters were scaled in several levels in a modified geometric structure. An optimization approach based on Taguchi methods was utilised in order to statistically determine the relationship and assist in evaluating the contribution of each factor on crushing properties. It showed that by selecting the combinations of these factors with correct levels, the energy absorbed can be improved remarkably. It found that the crushing performance of this structural composite was mainly dominated by resin and fibre architecture, which contributed 71 % capability of energy absorption.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is desired}} {{that will allow}} a designer to select appropriate amounts of through-thickness reinforcement needed to meet design requirements. The goal {{is to use a}} relatively simple analysis to minimize the amount of testing that needs to be performed, and to make test results from simple configurations applicable to more general structures. Using this methodology one should be able to optimize the selection of stitching materials, the weight of the yarn, and the <b>stitching</b> <b>density.</b> The analysis approach is to treat substructure disbond as a crack propagation problem. In this approach, the stitches have little influence until a delamination begins to grow. Once the delamination reaches, or extends beyond a stitch, the stitch serves to reduce the strain-energy-release-rate (G) at the crack tip for a given applied load. The reduced G can then be compared to the unstitched materials toughness to predict the load required to further extend the crack. The current model treats the stitch as a simple spring which responds to displacements in the vertical (through-thickness) direction. In concept, this approach is similar to that proposed by other authors. Test results indicate that the model should be refined to include the shearing stiffness of the stitch. The strain-energy-release-rate calculations are performed using a code which uses interconnected higher-order plates to model built-up composite cross-sections. When plates are stacked vertically, the interfacial tractions between the plates can be computed. The plate differential equations are solved in closed-form. The code, called SUBLAM, was developed as part of this section in one dimension. Because of this limitation, rows of stitches are treated as a two-dimensional sheet. The spring stiffness of a row of stitches can be estimated from the stitch material, weight, and density. As a practical and conservative approach, we can assume that the stitch is bonded until a crack passes the stitch location. After the crack passes, it is fully bonded. A series of tests were performed to exercise this methodology and incorporated an attached flange such that the sudden change in thickness initiated a delamination. The analysis was used to estimate the materials' critical G from that of the unstitched specimens. With this data, a prediction was made for the load required to delaminate the stitched specimens. Using the methodology, design charts have been created for simplified geometries. These charts give stitch force, along with G(sub 1) and G(sub 2) as as function of the stitch spring stiffness. Using the charts, {{it should be possible to}} determine the stitch spring stiffness and strength required to reduce the G to a desired level. From these parameters, the actual stitching material, weight, and density can be computed...|$|R

Moderately stitched composite (SD = 0. 028 /mm 2; 'stitched 6 × 6 ') and densely stitched composite (SD = 0. 111 /mm 2; 'stitched 3 × 3 ') are tested and compared with composite without stitch thread (SD = 0. 0; 'unstitched').

Stitched 3 × 3 pattern is also able to postpone the stiffness degradation onset. The improvement of fatigue properties and postponement of stiffness degradation onset in stitched 3 × 3 is primarily due to an effective impediment of edge-delamination.

Two different simulation approaches for these antennas are discussed and one is linked to measurement results, pointing to a simplified model for simulating embroidered patch antennas...|$|E
