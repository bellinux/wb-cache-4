5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the <b>subjection</b> of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated {{with the idea of}} a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal <b>subjection</b> of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E
5|$|The ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}} {{within the}} kingdom of Somairle's predecessors was the far-flung Diocese of the Isles. Little is known of its early history, although its origins may well lie with the Uí Ímair imperium. In the mid twelfth century, {{during the reign of}} Ragnall's maternal uncle Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles (died 1187), the diocese came to be incorporated into the newly established Norwegian Archdiocese of Nidaros. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Isles—its territorial borders and nominal <b>subjection</b> to Norwayappears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles. Before the close of the twelfth century, however, evidence of a new ecclesiastical jurisdictionthe Diocese of Argyllbegins to emerge during ongoing contentions between the meic Somairle and the Crovan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the <b>subjection</b> of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{was called}} by the Long Parliament {{before and during the}} {{beginning}} of the First English Civil War. The Long Parliament was influenced by Puritanism, a religious movement which sought to further reform the church. They were opposed to the religious policies of King Charles I and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. As part of a military alliance with Scotland, Parliament agreed that the outcome of the Assembly would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called presbyterianism, rather than rule by bishops, called episcopalianism, which was used in the English church. Scottish commissioners attended and advised the Assembly as part of the agreement. Disagreements over church government caused open division in the Assembly, despite attempts to maintain unity. The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority, but political and military realities led to greater influence for the congregationalist party. Congregationalists favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the <b>subjection</b> of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism. Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government, but it lacked the power the presbyterian divines desired. During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, all of the documents of the Assembly were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in England.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile the British, Dutch, and German troops {{under the}} Duke of Wellington {{acquired}} {{from the outset}} the goodwill and kindly disposition of {{the inhabitants of the}} country through which they passed. The Anglo-Allied troops inspired the people with confidence: the Prussians awed them into <b>subjection.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) has {{recently}} united with the Moscow Patriarchate (MP); these two {{branches of the}} Russian Orthodox Church had separated {{from each other in}} the 1920s due to the <b>subjection</b> of the latter to the hostile Soviet regime (see Act of Canonical Communion).|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{is of the}} mafia type when its components use intimidation, <b>subjection</b> and, consequentially, silence (omertà), to commit crimes, directly or indirectly acquire the management or the control of businesses, concessions, authorizations, public contracts and public services to obtain either unjust profits or advantages for themselves or others.|$|E

25|$|Cosmic prelude and Tibet's early history: One motif {{explains}} {{how the world}} collapsed into anarchy: numerous demon kings (Tib.:bdud) had avoided <b>subjection.</b> As a result, hordes of cannibalistic demons and goblins, led by malignant and greedy rulers of many kingdoms, wreak havoc. Tibet's conversion from barbarity to Buddhism under the three great Dharma Rajas often features. Episodes relate how Padmasambhāva subdued Tibet's violent native spirits.|$|E
25|$|Head harnesses, {{like many}} other forms of bondage, also {{have the effect of}} {{creating}} a sense of objectification and erotic helplessness in the wearer, which can be erotic for the wearer, or for those observing them. Many head harnesses are designed with straps that pass in front of the wearer's eyes, restricting their vision, and further increasing the sense of objectification and erotic <b>subjection.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 12th century, German merchants {{travelled}} up the Daugava, establishing missionaries {{among the}} Livonian settlements. One important centre of Daugava Livonians, the small island Mārtiņsala (German:Kircholm) had a Christian church as early as 1186. So began the Christianizing and gradual <b>subjection</b> of the local Livonian tribes. In 1206, in the early phases of the Livonian Crusade, the Livonian chieftain Ako organized the first revolt against the German crusaders but suffered defeat.|$|E
25|$|After the war the Kurds {{tried to}} free {{themselves}} from Ottoman control, and in 1834, after the Bedr Khan clan uprising, it became necessary to reduce them to <b>subjection.</b> This {{was done by}} Reshid Pasha, also a Kurd. The principal towns were strongly garrisoned, {{and many of the}} Kurd beys were replaced by Turkish governors. A rising under Bedr Khan Bey in 1843 was firmly repressed, and after the Crimean War the Turks strengthened their hold on the country.|$|E
25|$|Robert Menli Lyon had {{commented on}} {{the fact that some of}} the {{soldiers}} from Tasmania would as soon shoot an Aboriginal as shoot a kangaroo and there had been Aboriginal payback attacks on settlers, including the killing of Hugh Nesbitt, a servant of Thomas Peel and the wounding of Edward Barron. Captain Frederick Irwin, the lieutenant governor in Stirling's absence, had inflamed the situation, adopting a soldier's attitude to crush a warlike group of Aborigines and reduce them to a state of <b>subjection.</b>|$|E
25|$|All Germanic {{languages}} {{are thought to}} be descended from a hypothetical Proto-Germanic, united by <b>subjection</b> to the sound shifts of Grimm's law and Verner's law. These probably took place during the Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe from c. 500 BC. Proto-Germanic itself was likely spoken after c. 500 BC, and Proto-Norse from the 2nd century AD and later is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from Proto-Indo-European suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the Nordic Bronze Age.|$|E
25|$|Islamic jurists later {{formulated}} {{the concept}} of the rule of law, the equal <b>subjection</b> of all classes to the ordinary law of the land, where no person is above the law and where officials and private citizens are under a duty to obey the same law. A Qadi (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, gender, colour, kinship or prejudice. There were also a number of cases where caliphs had to appear before judges as they prepared to take their verdict.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Jane Addams {{gathered}} {{inspiration from}} what she read. Fascinated by the early Christians and Tolstoy's book , she was baptized a Christian in the Cedarville Presbyterian Church, {{in the summer of}} 1886. Reading Giuseppe Mazzini's Duties of Man, she began to be inspired by the idea of democracy as a social ideal. Yet she felt confused about her role as a woman. John Stuart Mill's The <b>Subjection</b> of Women made her question the social pressures on a woman to marry and devote her life to family.|$|E
25|$|From 1212 to 1214 the mercenaries from Stedingen {{destroyed}} the castles at Beverstedt, Stotel ({{a part of}} today's Loxstedt), Riensberg and Seehausen (both a part of today's city of Bremen), all held by partisans of Valdemar's rival archbishop GerhardI, whom the Stedingers clearly identified as a proponent of their <b>subjection</b> to serfdom. The Oldenburgers successfully defended the Burghagen Castle in Hagen im Bremischen against the Stedingers and GerhardI mobilised the Count Henry I of Hoya to help, who inflicted the first defeat on the Stedingers in 1213.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland gained momentum throughout {{the early part}} of the 19thcentury, as women became increasingly politically active, particularly during the campaigns to reform suffrage in the United Kingdom. John Stuart Mill, elected to Parliament in 1865 and an open advocate of female suffrage (about to publish The <b>Subjection</b> of Women), campaigned for an amendment to the Reform Act 1832 to include female suffrage. Roundly defeated in an all-male parliament under a Conservative government, the issue of women's suffrage came to the fore.|$|E
25|$|This {{time the}} invaders came to stay, and they built for {{themselves}} a capital, called Sarai, {{on the lower}} Volga. Here {{the commander of the}} Golden Horde, as the western section of the Mongol empire was called, fixed his golden headquarters and represented his sovereign the grand khan who lived with the Great Horde in the Orkhon Valley. Here they had their headquarters and held parts of Rus' in <b>subjection</b> for nearly three centuries. All of the Russian states, including Novgorod, Smolensk, Galich and Pskov, submitted to the Tatar-Mongol rule.|$|E
25|$|With {{establishing}} Porta Coeli as a prince-archiepiscopal outpost {{to observe}} and surveil the peasants' ambitions Gerard and Simon of Lippe pursued Prince-Archbishop Gebhard's long-term project of enforcing the reign over the free peasants, e.g. manifesting in Gebhard's earlier <b>subjection</b> of the Stedingers. The integration of Himmelpforten Convent into the prince-archiepiscopal temporalities was fixed in a deed, issued in 1255, {{on the occasion of}} moving the convent to then Eylsede/ Eulsete village (literally: Eylo's/Eilhard's seat), later adopting the Low Saxon translation tor Hemmelporten or to der Himilporten of the convent's Latin name Porta Coeli (Gate of Heaven; modern standard German: Himmelpforten).|$|E
25|$|With the <b>subjection</b> of this kingdom by Pompey in 64 BC, {{in which}} little {{changed in the}} {{structuring}} of life, neither for the oligarchies that controlled the cities nor for the common people in city or hinterland, {{the meaning of the}} name Pontus underwent a change. Part of the kingdom was now annexed to the Roman Empire, being united with Bithynia in a double province called Pontus and Bithynia: this part included only the seaboard between Heraclea (today Ereğli) and Amisus (Samsun), the ora Pontica. The larger part of Pontus, however, was included in the province of Galatia.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese <b>subjection</b> of the Saint Thomas Christians was {{relatively}} measured at first, but they became more aggressive after 1552, {{the year of}} the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob and of a schism in the Church of the East, which resulted in there being two rival Patriarchs—one of whom entered communion with the Catholic Church. Both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese consistently managed to outmaneuver them, and effectively cut off the Saint Thomas Christians from their hierarchy in 1575, when the Padroado legislated that neither patriarch could send representatives to India without Portuguese approval.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Rostom’s {{willingness}} {{to cooperate with}} his Safavid suzerains won for Kartli a large measure of autonomy and relative peace and prosperity. However, the nobles and the populace of Kakheti continued to rally around the exiled Teimuraz {{in the hope of}} ending their <b>subjection</b> to Iran. In order to end resistance in Kakheti once and for all, Shah Abbas II revived a plan to populate the country with the Turkic nomads, a measure that incited a general uprising in 1659. The rebels succeeded in expelling the nomads but still had to grudgingly accept the shah’s suzerainty.|$|E
25|$|Georgescu {{points out}} that Earth is a closed system in the {{thermodynamic}} sense of the term: Earth exchanges energy, but not matter (practically) {{with the rest of}} the universe. Hence, mainly two sources of 'low entropy' are available to man, namely the stock of mineral resources in the crust of the Earth; and the flow of radiation, received from the Sun. Since the Sun will continue to shine for billions of years to come, the Earth's mineral stock is the scarcer one of these two main sources of low entropy. Whereas the stock of minerals may be extracted from the crust of the Earth at a rate of our own choosing (practically), the flow of solar radiation arrives at the surface of the Earth at a constant and fixed rate, beyond human control. This natural 'asymmetry' between man's access to the stock of minerals and the flow of solar energy accounts for the historical contrast between urban and rural life: The busy urban life, on the one hand, is associated with industry and the impatient extraction of minerals; the tranquil rural life, on the other hand, is associated with agriculture and the patient reception of the fixed flow of solar energy. Georgescu {{points out that}} this 'asymmetry' helps explaining the historical <b>subjection</b> of the countryside by the town since the dawn of civilisation, and he criticises Karl Marx for not taking this <b>subjection</b> properly into account in his theory of historical materialism.|$|E
25|$|The various autocephalous and {{autonomous}} {{churches of}} the Orthodox Church are distinct {{in terms of}} administration and local culture, {{but for the most}} part exist in full communion with one another, with exceptions such as lack of relations between the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) and the Moscow Patriarchate (the Orthodox Church of Russia) dating from the 1920s and due to the <b>subjection</b> of the latter to the hostile Soviet regime. However, attempts at reconciliation were made between the ROCOR and the Moscow Patriarchate with the ultimate purpose of reunification being reached on 17 May 2007. Further tensions exist between the New Calendarists and the Old Calendarists.|$|E
25|$|Artabazus, one of {{the generals}} that {{remained}} faithful to the king, advanced against him from Pisidia, but was entirely defeated. The great reputation that Datames had acquired induced Artaxerxes to direct his utmost exertions to effect his <b>subjection,</b> but Autophradates, who was sent against him with a large army, was obliged to retreat with heavy loss. Datames, however, though constantly victorious against open foes, ultimately fell a victim to treachery, and, after evading numerous plots that had been formed against his life, was assassinated at a conference by Mithridates, the son of Ariobarzanes, who had gained his confidence by assuming the appearance of hostility to the king.|$|E
25|$|Article 416 of the Italian Penal Code {{that has}} its origins in the fascist period (1930), defined simple {{organized}} crime {{on the basis of}} the presence of three elements: the associative bond, the organized structure, the criminal program. Organized crime of the mafia type presents additional specific characteristics: the associative bond has such an intimidating capacity to cause <b>subjection</b> and omertà. It is at such a level that it may be considered a system, an absolute rule of obedience and a law of silence that first of all demands, from the entire population, the refusal to collaborate with law enforcement. An actual submission to the power of the mafia.|$|E
25|$|He was an Indian {{with a white}} man's {{spirit of}} hatred and revenge {{for those who had}} wronged him and his. In his day he saw his son and his tribe {{gradually}} driven from their possessions: forced to give up their old hunting grounds and espouse the hard working and uncongenial avocations of the whites. And these, his conquerors, were marked in their dealings with his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery. What wonder that his wild nature, untamed by years of <b>subjection,</b> should still revolt? What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within his breast and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies.|$|E
25|$|Annesley {{was born}} in Dublin, Ireland to Francis Annesley, 1st Viscount Valentia and Dorothy, {{daughter}} of Sir John Philipps, Bt, of Picton Castle. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1634 as a Bachelor of Arts; that year, he was admitted into Lincoln's Inn. Having made the grand tour he returned to Ireland; and being employed by Parliament {{on a mission to}} the Duke of Ormonde, now reduced to the last extremities, he succeeded in concluding a treaty with him on 19 June 1647, thus securing the country from complete <b>subjection</b> to the rebels. In April 1647 he was returned for Radnorshire to the House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Thebes was {{a battle}} that took place between Alexander the Great and the Greek city state of Thebes in 335BC {{immediately}} outside of and in the city proper in Boeotia. After being made Hegemon of the League of Corinth, Alexander had marched to the north to deal with revolts in Illyria and Thrace, which forced him to draw heavily from the troops in Macedonia that was maintaining pressure on the Greek city-states of the south {{to keep them in}} <b>subjection.</b> Although Alexander did not desire to destroy Thebes, after sending several embassies requesting their submission on what he considered merciful terms, he eventually decided to destroy the city as an example to others.|$|E
