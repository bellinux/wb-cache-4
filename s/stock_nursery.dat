40|$|The {{implementation}} of a hypothetical aquaculture facility with hatchery, nursery and grow-out earthen ponds for raising the Amazon River Prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum in the Pantanal was considered. Eight larviculture cycles per year were projected: four to produce post-larvae for stocking in grow-out bait ponds, and four to <b>stock</b> <b>nursery</b> tanks to sell juveniles as seed to grow-out farms, which produce prawns for human consumption. Annual production would be 146, 880 dozen bait prawns and 2, 938 thousand juveniles. The assumed sale prices were US$ 1. 38 per dozen baits and US$ 15. 39 per thousand juveniles. The net present value was US$ 555, 890. 79, {{internal rate of return}} was 48 % per year, payback period was 2. 4 years and benefit-cost ratio was 3. 90. The breakeven price to cover total costs per dozen baits was US$ 0. 70 and per thousand juveniles was US$ 17. 00, indicating that the selling price assumed for juveniles in base scenario is not realistic. Net return was US$ 84, 773. 80. The results indicate that this activity would be a lucrative and attractive investment in the Pantanal...|$|E

40|$|Government {{regulations}} in the Netherlands are increasingly constraining {{and sometimes even}} banning conventional cultivation practices in <b>nursery</b> <b>stock</b> cropping systems. As a consequence, growers face problems concerning the use of manure, fertilisers and irrigation. In this study we analysed the production system and defined management options to improve input efficiency. Strategies based on results of small, preliminary experiments were then developed and tested in <b>nursery</b> <b>stock</b> production systems. Successful management tools included the use of alternative organic materials, such as black peat and compost of domestic and garden waste. The materials were applied after every harvest to maintain soil fertility. Split application of nitrogen and drip irrigation also proved to be successful.

2500|$|A plant nursery is an {{agricultural}} operation where (non-bonsai) plants are propagated and grown to usable size. <b>Nursery</b> <b>stock</b> {{may be available}} directly from the nursery, or may be sold in a garden centre or similar resale establishment. <b>Nursery</b> <b>stock</b> is usually young but fully viable, and is often potted with sufficient soil to allow plants to survive a season or two before being transplanted into a more permanent location. Because the nursery tree is already pot-conditioned, it can be worked on as a bonsai immediately. The large number of plants that can be viewed in a single visit to a nursery or garden centre allows the buyer to identify plants with better-than-average bonsai characteristics. According to Peter Adams, a nursery visit [...] "offers the opportunity to choose an instant trunk". One issue with <b>nursery</b> <b>stock</b> is that many specimens are shaped into popular forms, such as the standard or half-standard forms, with several feet of clear trunk rising from the roots. Without branches low on the trunk, {{it is difficult for}} a source specimen to be trained as bonsai.|$|R
