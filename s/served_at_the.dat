5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not old enough to have <b>served</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E
