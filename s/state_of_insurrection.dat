5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

However, the Colorado State Attorney General {{and the local}} {{district}} attorney refused to honor the writ. Moyer appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court. On June 6, 1904, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in In re Moyer, 35 Colo. 163, that Moyer's constitutional right to due process and habeas corpus had not been violated. The {{court held that the}} governor had acted under color of state law, and that the courts had no jurisdiction to review the governor's finding that a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> existed in Colorado.|$|E
25|$|After Kansas {{was opened}} for {{settlement}} in 1854, conflict broke out between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions. The first official militia of Kansas {{was created to}} pursue a band of men, who had broken an anti-slavery suspect out of a pro-slavery sheriff's custody into the town of Lawrence, Kansas. The sheriff informed the governor that the town of Lawrence, by refusing {{to turn over the}} suspects, was in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection.</b> The militia, however, was largely composed of men from Missouri from the pro-slavery faction. Anti-slavery activists, fearing the Missourians would use this government order as an excuse to destroy the largely anti-slavery town, formed their own militias and fortified the town. What would become known as the Wakarusa War, the bloodless siege ended when the governor arrived and a treaty between the factions was negotiated, and the Missouri militia was disbanded and returned home.|$|E

25|$|While Otto was {{fighting}} the Hungarians with his main army deployed in Southern Germany, the Obotrite Slavs {{in the north}} were in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection.</b> Count Wichmann the Younger, still Otto's opponent over the King's refusal to grant Wichmann the title of Margrave in 936, marauded through the lands of the Obotrites in the Billung March, causing the followers of Slavic Prince Nako to revolt. The Obotrites invaded Saxony {{in the fall of}} 955, killing the men of arms-bearing age and carrying off the women and children into slavery. In the aftermath of the Battle of Lechfeld, Otto rushed to the north and pressed far into their territory. A Slav embassy offered to pay annual tribute in return for being allowed self-government under German overlordship instead of direct German rule. Otto refused, and the two sides met on 16 October at the Battle of Recknitz. Otto's forces gained a decisive victory; after the battle, hundreds of captured Slavs were executed.|$|E

Mermaid was off Labaye, in company with , when a British blockhouse came under attack from a battery that the rebels had erected. Otway led a landing party of seamen and marines that stormed the battery and destroyed it. Soon thereafter, a large contingent of British troops landed near Labaye. At the same time two French vessels, under British colours, arrived with French troops from Saint Lucia. The British general wished to withdraw, but Otway declined to permit him to do so. Instead, Otway rode up a hill on which there were some field guns that he ordered to fire on the French vessels. The battery commander did so, with the result that the French vessels withdrew, having failed to land their troops. Favorite pursued the French vessels but could not keep up after losing her topmast. The British troops then attacked and captured Pilot Hill.|$|E
25|$|In October 1321 King Edward and {{his troops}} besieged Leeds Castle, after the governor's wife, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere, refused Queen Isabella {{admittance}} and subsequently ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella and her escort after the latter attempted to gain {{entry to the}} castle. Elizabeth, the third Badlesmere daughter, was married to Joan and Mortimer's eldest son, Edmund. King Edward exploited his new popularity {{in the wake of}} his military victory at Leeds to recall to England the Despensers, whom the Lords Ordainers, led by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, had forced him to banish in August 1321. The Marcher lords, already in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> for some time prior to the Despensers' banishment, immediately rose up against the King in full force, with Mortimer leading the confederation alongside Ordainer Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford. The King quelled the rebellion, which is also known as the Despenser War; Mortimer and his uncle Roger Mortimer de Chirk both surrendered to him at Shrewsbury on 22 January 1322. Mortimer and his uncle were dispatched as prisoners to the Tower of London, where they were kept in damp, unhealthy quarters. This was likely a factor in Roger Mortimer de Chirk's death in 1326. Joan's husband had fared better; by drugging the constable and the Tower guards, he managed to escape to France on 1 August 1323. It was there that he later became the lover of Queen Isabella, who was estranged from the King as a result of the Despensers' absolute control over him. She had been sent to France on a peace mission by Edward but used the occasion to seek help from her brother, Charles IV to oust the Despensers. The scandal of their love affair forced them to leave the French court for Flanders, where they obtained help for an invasion of England.|$|E

60|$|Under such {{a system}} the natives would soon {{perceive}} that European government was advantageous to them. They would begin to save money, and property being rendered secure they would rapidly acquire new wants and new tastes, and become large consumers of European goods. This would be a far surer source of profit to their rulers than imposts and extortion, and {{would be at the}} same time more likely to produce peace and obedience than the mock-military rule which has hitherto proved most ineffective. To inaugurate {{such a system}} would however require an immediate outlay of capital, which neither Dutch nor Portuguese seem inclined to make, and a number of honest and energetic officials, which the latter nation at least seems unable to produce; so that it is much to be feared that Timor will {{for many years to come}} remain in its present <b>state</b> <b>of</b> chronic <b>insurrection</b> and misgovernment.|$|R
500|$|The {{power of}} the {{governor}} to adjourn the General Assembly {{for a period of}} up to four months if the two houses cannot agree on a time to adjourn appears in all four constitutions. The governor is also empowered to convene the General Assembly [...] "on extraordinary occasions". Since the 1799 constitution, the governor has been permitted to call the legislature into session somewhere other than the state capital if the capital had, since the last legislative session, [...] "become dangerous from an enemy or from contagious diseases." [...] This was an important provision {{in the early days of}} the Commonwealth, when epidemics like smallpox posed a danger to the populace. One notable example of an attempt to employ this power was in 1900 when Republican Governor William S. Taylor attempted to adjourn the legislature and re-convene it in heavily Republican London, Kentucky following the shooting of William Goebel. Taylor claimed a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> existed in the capital, but defiant Democrats refused to heed the call to adjourn or to convene in London.|$|E
2500|$|Holmes {{began by}} refusing to {{question}} whether a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> actually existed in Colorado. [...] "It is admitted, as it must be, that the Governor's declaration that a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> existed is conclusive of that fact," [...] Holmes wrote. [...] "The facts that we are to assume are that a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> existed and that the Governor, without sufficient reason but in good faith, {{in the course of}} putting the insurrection down held the plaintiff until he thought that he safely could release him. Holmes then made what is considered a famous statement about due process: [...] "But it is familiar that what is due process of law depends on circumstances. It varies with the subject-matter and the necessities of the situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> was, therefore, critical. The state constitution and statutes both gave the governor the power to call out the militia, put down rebellion, and hold rebels without providing for relief. Holmes not only incorporated {{the findings of the}} Colorado Supreme Court in his opinion, but once more refused to entertain any arguments to the contrary: [...] "In such a situation we must assume that he had a right under the state constitution and laws to call out troops, as was held by the Supreme Court of the State." [...] But Holmes' assumptions were not ironclad. He left open the door for plaintiffs to challenge whether or not a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> did, in fact, exist. [...] In this case, however, the plaintiff did not do so.|$|E
60|$|But on a nearer {{approach}} to the Euphrates, the dissolution of every social tie becomes more striking. We find ourselves amid the independent tribes--the cruel Lendes; among the Tezdis--a people who adore the spirit of Erib. Towards the north we fall in with the Lazzi, and all those fierce natives who are entrenched like vultures amid the fastnesses of the Caucasus. Again, in the South we discover the wandering Arabs, the pirates of the desert, and the mountaineers of Lebanon, {{who live in a}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> perpetual discord. Over this immense line of countries centuries have passed, and left no trace behind; all that the ancients and the crusaders have related to us of them, is typical of their condition at this day. The bows and arrows, the armour, exhibited as objects of curiosity in our museums, are still in use among them. It is only by chance, or by profiting by their intestine divisions, that the authority of the Porte is recognised. The Pashas are mostly hereditary, and live in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> perpetual <b>insurrection.</b> Thus from the shores of the Archipelago to the banks of the Euphrates and the Tigris, civilisation and vegetation appear to obey the same law of decrease.|$|R

2500|$|The vexing {{problem of}} immediacy {{would cause the}} Supreme Court to later back away from Holmes' ruling in Moyer. Just {{a quarter of a}} century later, in Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932), the Court held (contra Moyer) that {{executive}} findings of a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> must be subject to judicial review. In Sterling, the governor of Texas had restricted production of oil from certain wells by claiming that a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> existed in some areas of his state. Not only did the Supreme Court conclude that such claims of insurrection were subject to judicial review, but after review the court actually rejected the governor's finding. Citing Mitchell v. Harmony, the Court endorsed [...] "the argument that without judicial review, the boundaries setting apart real emergencies will break down. Chief Justice Hughes explicitly articulated the fear that if emergency powers are beyond court scrutiny then soon all government action will be characterized as an emergency." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Whiskey Rebellion {{was a major}} {{test for}} the new {{government}} of the United States following the Revolution. The citizens of western Pennsylvania, mostly near Washington, Pennsylvania, were not pleased with the excise tax on liquor and distilled drinks. This tax had been proposed by United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, passed by Congress, and {{signed into law by}} President Washington in 1791. The tensions of the whiskey tax intensified {{over the next three years}} and in 1794 there was a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurrection</b> in the area. Thirteen thousand militiamen under the direct command of George Washington were sent to put down the insurrection. They passed through the Ohiopyle area on their way to arrest the rebels. The rebels [...] "could never be found," [...] according to Thomas Jefferson, but the militia rounded up twenty prisoners, clearly demonstrating Federalist authority in the national government. The men were imprisoned, where one died, while two were convicted of treason and sentenced to death by hanging. Washington, however, pardoned them on the grounds that one was a [...] "simpleton" [...] and the other [...] "insane." [...] The military suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion set a precedent that U.S. citizens who wished to change the law had to do so peacefully through constitutional means; otherwise, the government would meet any threats to disturb the peace with force.|$|E
