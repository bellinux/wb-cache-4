5|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box; senators and equestrians watching from the advantageous seats reserved for them; women <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else packed in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites {{of social and political}} protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{then returns}} to the trailer park setting, where Azalea rides a lowrider bicycle through the area. She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E

25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E
25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{table with a}} cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E

500|$|On August 21, 1945, the {{plutonium}} core produced {{a burst of}} neutron radiation that led to physicist Harry Daghlian's death. Daghlian made a mistake while performing neutron reflector experiments on the core. He was working alone; a security guard, Private Robert J. Hemmerly, was <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> desk [...] away. The core was placed within a stack of neutron-reflective tungsten carbide bricks {{and the addition of}} each brick moved the assembly closer to criticality. While attempting to stack another brick around the assembly, Daghlian accidentally dropped it onto the core and thereby caused the core to go well into supercriticality, a self-sustaining critical chain reaction. He quickly moved the brick off the assembly, but received a fatal dose of radiation. He died 25 days later from acute radiation poisoning.|$|E

500|$|James Fox, {{journalist}} {{and author of the}} non-fiction book White Mischief: The Murder of Lord Erroll, was credited, along with Keith Richards, as co-author. He had previously interviewed Richards in 1973 and the pair had been friends since then. Reportedly, $7.3 million was paid for the work in 2007, [...] "on the basis of a 10-page excerpt". Fox spent [...] "hundreds of hours" [...] with Richards at his Caribbean home, and also in the United Kingdom, to gather material for the book. He interviewed Richards at length and also talked to many associates. Fox said of Richards, [...] "I'd have to catch him like a salmon." [...] The interviews were conducted <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> table, but the two were not opposite each other. Richards always played music, so Fox provided him with a lapel microphone. [...] The subject matter was not handled chronologically; Fox allowed his subject to mentally [...] "dart about". [...] "Some sessions lasted hours and some, dealing with the more painful parts of Richards' life, lasted just minutes." [...] The project took five years to complete.|$|E

At the instrumental passage for [...] "Alive", Lopez embraces the music being played by the band and changes a few chords with Cory Rooney, who is <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> piano.

Gaga wore a dress made of guns and during the performance she pumped {{her hands in the}} air. For the revamped Monster Ball shows in 2010-11, Gaga was dancing around the stage while whipping a chain. It was also performed at the 52nd Grammy Awards, where she opened the show with the song while standing on a pedestal. Midway through the performance, she was flung into the garbage chute of the Fame Factory set, before emerging <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> piano, facing Elton John. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. The song was included on the set list of her 2012-3 Born This Way Ball Tour in which she sports a modified version of her infamous meat dress. Gaga and her dancers put themselves headfirst into enormous meat grinders during the performance. For her 2014 residency show, Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom she chose to perform the song in a piano-only rendition. In the same year, at the [...] tour, Gaga performed the song in a medley with [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Telephone" [...] while wearing knee-length white dress and heels, and a bob wig.|$|E
