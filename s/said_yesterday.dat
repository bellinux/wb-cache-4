25|$|The Hawaiian {{women are}} anxious to vote and {{they are ready to}} do all they can to gain equal suffrage. One of the members <b>said</b> <b>yesterday</b> that up to the present time the native women have not known just what steps to take and {{therefore}} have made no progress but she said that with Mrs. Dowsett as the president they feel that the cause will surely advance.

500|$|Media {{and public}} opinion was more hostile. The Sydney Morning Herald ran the {{headline}} [...] "Baggy Green Shame" [...] while The Australian wrote of the [...] "$11,000 price of disgrace". Many newspaper columns and {{letters to the editor}} attacked the players. The editorial of The Australian stated that [...] "Waugh and Warne <b>said</b> <b>yesterday</b> they had been naïve and stupid. Put the emphasis on the second adjective—and add greedy." [...] Readers called for the players to be banned from playing for Australia as well as the sacking of the ACB officials who had kept the matter secret; some said that the players should never be appointed to leadership roles in the cricket community. In the Weekend Australian of 12 December, Warwick Hadfield and Brian Woodley editorialised that [...] "Warne is in need of some good advice, but not from business managers and PR folk too happy to tell him how wonderful he is in order to flog a few more videos, books, pairs of duds, sports shoes or anti-smoking ads". Warne's major sponsors reviewed their partnerships with him, and three newspapers, the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom, The Age of Melbourne and the Sydney Morning Herald severed their ties with him.|$|E

2500|$|Howard's {{successor}} {{as leader}} of the Liberal Party, Brendan Nelson declared that his party has [...] "listened and learned" [...] from the Australian public. He also declared that WorkChoices was [...] "dead" [...] and would never be resurrected as part of Coalition policy, and called on Rudd to move quickly to introduce draft industrial relations legislation. Former IR minister Joe Hockey said the laws [...] "went too deep" [...] but were introduced with [...] "the best intentions". [...] "As I <b>said</b> <b>yesterday</b> and I've said since election day, WorkChoices is dead, and there is an overwhelming mandate for the Labor Party's policy of tearing up Work Choices," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November 2015, {{speaking}} {{shortly after}} the shootdown of a Russian Su-24 by Turkey, Russian president Vladimir Putin characterised {{the role played by}} Turkey in the Syrian conflict as that of [...] "the accomplices of terrorists." [...] Russia′s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov noted that the Turkish plan to create a buffer zone in the area where Syrian Turkmen lived in northern Syria stemmed from Ankara's wish to protect local terrorist infrastructure: [...] "According to the latest information, the area which our Turkish colleagues deem to be populated by Syrian Turkmen not only accommodates several hundreds, or thousands, of militants - citizens of the Russian Federation, as the [...] president <b>said</b> <b>yesterday,</b> who present a direct threat to our security, security of our people but also, according to the available information, that area accommodates infrastructures of the militants, including arms and ammo depots, command centers, and logistics centers." [...] Several Turkish and Western analysts, while not questioning that ISIS oil was being imported into Turkey, argued that Moscow′s accusations of the Turkish government in this regard were not well-founded.|$|E
