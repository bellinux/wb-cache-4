50|$|The {{standard}} symmetrical, parabolic, Cassegrain reflector {{system is}} very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the hyperbolic <b>sub-reflector</b> and its supporting struts (usually 3-4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when {{the size of the}} parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector.To avoid blockage from the <b>sub-reflector</b> asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe levels, beam squint, poor cross-polar response, etc.|$|E

40|$|Reflectarrays that emulate {{paraboloidal}} main-reflectors, and hyperboloidal or ellipsoidal <b>sub-reflectors,</b> {{have undergone}} {{a great deal}} of development over the past two decades. More recently, research on the topic has concentrated on overcoming some remaining disadvantages, re-examining certain design issues, and extending reflectarray functionality. This thesis concerns itself with fixed-beam offset-fed single-layer main-reflectarrays and sub-reflectarrays comprised of square or rectangular variable size conducting elements. Both full-wave analyses and experiment are used in all the deliberations. In order to examine reflectarray operating mechanisms the thesis first describes a component-by-component technique whereby the role of the various reflectarray parts can be assessed by determining their individual and aggregate contributions to the reflectarray near- and far-fields. This technique is used to diagnose the fact that feed-image-lobes that appear at off-centre frequencies are caused not only by the groundplane as first thought, but by an imbalance in the complex currents on the patches and groundplane at such frequencies. The use of sub-wavelength elements is shown to suppress such unwanted lobes. The thesis then uses receive- and transmit-modes analysis to show that beam squint at off-centre frequencies, often not accounted for when stating the gain bandwidth of a reflectarray, is due to the shifting of the true focal points away from the geometrical one at these frequencies. It is demonstrated that a two-feed reflectarray arrangement is capable of eliminating beam squint, and that the use of smaller focal length to aperture size (F/D) ratios removes the grating lobes that can appear in such two-feed reflectarrays due to clustering of the aperture amplitude distribution. Finally, the thesis studies the effect of the reality that the angle of incidence of the feed fields on the various reflectarray elements is not the same for all elements, even though this is most often assumed when using element reflection phase versus element size databases in performing reflectarray designs. Careful full-wave analysis reveals that {{it is not only the}} dependence of element reflection phase on incidence angle that is important, but that the individual element pattern beamwidths change and distort as this angle increases. This is important not only from the point of view of the coupling of the feed fields to the elements, but also as far as the angular sector within which the reradiated fields are important. Thus sub-reflectarrays, whose radiation patterns are considerably wider than main-reflectors, are more susceptable to incidence angle effects. It is shown that the use of sub-wavelength elements in a reflectarray largely ensures its immunity to such effects...|$|R

This system {{is based on the}} Mills Cross system used for radio astronomy imaging. It uses two pillbox antennas arranged in a T configuration. Each antenna generates a fan beam and the two fan beams are orthogonal to each other. By cross-correlating the two signals received from the two antennas, a pencil beam is generated. Beam scanning is achieved by rotating a small <b>sub-reflector</b> inside each antenna. Two outputs (real and imaginary) are measured from the complex correlator at each pixel position.

SKA 1 -Mid (350 MHz - 13. 8 GHz with an option for an upper limit of similar to 24 GHz) will consist of 133 reflector antennas using an unblocked aperture, offset Gregorian configuration with an effective diameter of 15 m.

40|$|Reflector antennas {{are widely}} used in {{communication}} satellite systems because they provide high gain at low cost. Offset-fed single paraboloids and dual reflector offset Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas with multiple focal region feeds provide a simple, blockage-free means of forming multiple, shaped, and isolated beams with low sidelobes. Such antennas are applicable to communications satellite frequency reuse systems and earth stations requiring access to several satellites. While the single offset paraboloid {{has been the most}} extensively used configuration for the satellite multiple-beam antenna, the trend toward large apertures requiring minimum scanned beam degradation over the field of view 18 degrees for full earth coverage from geostationary orbit may lead to impractically long focal length and large feed arrays.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is currently investigating {{the benefits of a}} ground based hybrid RF and deep space optical terminal based on limited modification of existing 34 meter antenna designs. The ideal design would include as large an optical aperture as technically practical and cost effective, cause minimal impact to RF performance, and remain cost effective even when compared to a separate optical terminal of comparable size. Numerous trades and architectures have been considered, including shared RF and optical apertures having aspheric optics and means to separate RF and optical signals, plus, partitioned apertures in which various zones of the primary are dedicated to optical reception. A design based on the latter is emphasized in this paper, employing spherical primary optics and a new version of a "clamshell" corrector that is optimized to fit within the limited space between the antenna <b>sub-reflector</b> and the existing apex structure that supports the subreflector.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing demand for reduced mass, small launch volume, and, at the same time, high-gain large-aperture antenna systems in modern space-borne applications. This {{dissertation}} introduces new techniques for dual-band reflectarray antennas to meet these requirements. A series of developments is presented to show the dual-band capability of the reflectarray. A novel microstrip ring structure has been developed to achieve circular polarization (CP). A C/Ka dual-band front-fed reflectarray antenna has been designed to demonstrate the dual-band circular polarized operation. The proposed ring structure provides many advantages of compact size, more freedom in the selection of element spacing, less blockage between circuit layers, and broader CP bandwidth as compared to the patches. An X/Ka dual-band offset-fed reflectarray is made of thin membranes, with their thickness equal to 0. 0508 mm in both layers. Several degrading effects of thin substrates are discussed. To overcome these problems, a new configuration is developed by inserting empty spaces of the proper thickness below both the X and Ka band membranes. More than 50 % efficiencies are achieved at both frequency ranges, and the proposed scheme {{is expected to be a}} good candidate to meet the demand for future inflatable antenna systems. An X/Ka dual-band microstrip reflectarray with circular polarization has also been constructed using thin membranes and a Cassegrain offset-fed configuration. It is believed that this is the first Cassegrain reflectarray ever developed. This antenna has a 0. 75 -meter-diameter aperture and uses a metallic <b>sub-reflector</b> and angular-rotated annular ring elements. It achieved a measured 3 dB gain bandwidth of 700 MHz at Xband and 1. 5 GHz at Ka-band, as well as a CP bandwidth (3 dB axial ratio) of more than 700 MHz at X-band and more than 2 GHz at Ka-band. The measured peak efficiencies are 49. 8 % at X-band and 48. 2 % at Ka-band. In summary, this dissertation presents a series of new research developments to support the dual-band operation of the reflectarray antenna.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{verification}} of the receiver optics for the Single-Pixel Heterodyne Facility Instrument (SHFI) of the APEX telescope [1]. The SHFI is designed to cover the frequency band 211 – 1390 GHz in 6 receiver channels. Four of the receiver channels have been designed, installed and characterized: 211 - 275 GHz (Band 1); 275 - 370 GHz (Band 2); 385 - 500 GHz (Band 3); 1250 - 1390 GHz (Band T 2). The first three bands employ 2 SB SIS mixer technology and Band T 2 employs HEB mixers in a waveguide balanced mixer configuration. The entire optics design was driven by the receiver position in the telescope Nasmyth cabin “A” (Fig. 1) and the aperture limit of Ø 150 mm, introduced by the elevation encoder inside the Nasmyth tube A. This layout and the telescope geometry (~ 6 m distance from the focal plane to the Cabin A) lead us to choose a single-pixel configuration and required using intermediate optics with long focal distances. The common optics path, coupling the receivers to the Cassegrain <b>sub-reflector,</b> consists of the three offset ellipsoidal mirrors, M 3, M 6, M 8 s, and three flat mirrors, F 4, F 5, and F 7 s. The combination M 3 and M 6 via flat F 4, F 5, creates a Gaussian telescope, providing frequency-independent re-imaging of the antenna focal plane from the Cassegrain cabin into the Nasmyth cabin A. Switching between channels is achieved by the precision rotating of the active mirror M 8 s. The mirror M 8 s in combination with each channel active mirror M 10 provides re-imaging of the secondary onto the feed horn aperture of the selected channel. Such a configuration provides frequency independent illumination of the secondary with the edge taper - 12 dB. The angular position of the flat mirrors F 9 is adjustable and gives additional possibility of fine-tuning of the beam alignment from the common optics to every receiver channels. Verification of the optical design through measurements is essential in order to align the beams from the cryostat windows to the common optics to minimize loss in the quasioptical guiding system. In order to verify {{the design of the}} cold optics (corrugated horn + M 10) in terms of Gaussian beam parameters, a new wideband vector field measurement system was developed [2]. Vector field measurements were performed for band 1, 2, and 3, and scalar measurements were employed for the THz band...|$|E
