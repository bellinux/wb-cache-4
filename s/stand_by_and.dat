5|$|Gale {{concluded}} that {{to relieve the}} pressure on the division, he had to take Bréville. The only units available for the attack were the division reserve, which consisted of the 12th Parachute Battalion (350 men), and 'D' Company 12th Battalion Devonshire Regiment (eighty-six men). Another unit, the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, the division's pathfinders, were to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> respond to any German counter-attack. To provide fire support, Gale was given a squadron of tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, three field artillery regiments armed with 25 pounder guns, a medium artillery regiment of 5.5 inch guns and the division's own artillery the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment. The attack on Bréville would start at 22:00, timed to catch the Germans tired and off-guard following the days fighting. The start line was on the outskirts of Amfreville, which had already been secured by No.6 Commando.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{as a child}} {{that she had a}} drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Prevost {{replied that}} as he was faced with such a large {{military}} force, {{he would have to}} take some of them prisoner before he could accept. Moultrie advised the council that he would never <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> allow the British to take Americans prisoner without fighting, so the council decided to fight it out. The city braced itself for an attack, but the next morning, the British had disappeared. Prevost had intercepted a letter from General Lincoln to Moultrie saying that he was marching to the aid of Charleston, and Prevost decided that he could not hold out if the Americans got reinforcements.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} {{sovereignty of}} Taiwan, the Japanese feared military resistance from both Taiwanese and Aborigines who followed the establishment {{by the local}} elite of the short-lived Republic of Formosa. Taiwan's elite hoped that by declaring themselves a republic the world would not <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> allow a sovereign state to be invaded by the Japanese, thereby allying with the Qing. The plan quickly turned to chaos as standard Green troops and ethnic Yue soldiers took to looting and pillage. Given the choice between chaos {{at the hands of}} Chinese or submission to the Japanese, the Taipei elite sent Koo Hsien-jung to Keelung to invite the advancing Japanese forces to proceed to Taipei and restore order.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December news reached Alden and Barker that two days earlier Japanese {{aircraft}} had sunk the US gunboat USS Panay in the Yangtze River near Nanjing. Alden and Barker discreetly prepared racks of ammunition for their 4"/50 caliber guns, but the IJN ships continued to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> assist. President McKinley moved closer inshore and embarked about 400 of President Hoovers passengers and about 230 of her crew. Japanese Navy flat-bottomed boats brought them from the shore out to meet President McKinleys boats and a motor launch, which then ferried {{them out to the}} liner. President McKinley then left for Manila, leaving behind President Hoovers officers, steerage passengers and the last 100 of her crew on Kasho-to.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{failed to}} take {{advantage}} of the chaos of the Crusaders army. As it marched across the Anatolian peninsula, it encountered frequent Turkish raids, despite official gestures of friendship from the Sultanate of Rûm under Kilij Arslan II. Not bearing to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> do nothing, Frederick sacked Iconium, capital of the Sultanate, before moving on. Isaac did not seize the initiative and Kilij Arslan II returned later to reclaim his fallen capital. Frederick's army would later slowly but surely disband after the Holy Roman Emperor was found dead (presumed to have either drowned in a river, suffered a heart attack or perhaps both). More looting and damage would be done by these weary soldiers as they retreated back to Europe.|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} {{now that the}} present {{situation}} cannot be allowed to continue. It is evident also that the Stormont government {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government {{to see to it that}} police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E

Hambleton wrote from an Air Force hospital after he was rescued. [...] "I had to <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> watch six young men die trying to save my life.

When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question [...] "What is the purpose of life?" [...] written in a bathroom, his response is, [...] "To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." [...] Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, [...] " [...] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> do nothing while such reports come in." [...] In the epigraph to Bluebeard, Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: [...] "We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is." ...|$|E

500|$|Liptak said it portrays {{people as}} victims of technology, while Joyner commented it denotes that [...] "the {{way in which we}} are spoon-fed an almost {{constant}} stream of information through technology has turned us into passive consumers". Joyner believes that Brooker implicates the viewer with the story's credits scene, noting [...] "we're the ones with the smartphones, passively absorbing abuses to human rights and decency, and yet revelling in the image from the safety of the screen". Jeffery and Parker affirmed it contains the idea that people are preferring to document life rather than living it, as exemplified by [...] "people who see violence break out ... and decide to film it rather than intervene." [...] Leigh Alexander of Boing Boing said the episode reflects how violence is easily accessed on the Internet and quickly arouses people's attention. She noted, [...] "you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitization, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow. It aims to ask: To what extent can you <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> watch horror before you are complicit, punishable?" ...|$|E
500|$|In the Easter 2007 episode, Dot {{takes an}} {{abandoned}} baby she finds in a church. This was filmed in Kent at Stansted, St. Giles Church in Wormshill, The Ringlestone Inn near Harrietsham and Court Lodge Farm. After being {{contacted by the}} child's Ukrainian mother Anya, Dot offers to care for both of them, however Jim turns Anya in to the authorities for being an illegal immigrant. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury questioned the plausibility of the storyline, observing: [...] "Babies aren't abandoned {{in the real world}} very often. But you can barely cross [...] Square [...] without tripping over poor tots who their mothers don't want." [...] Laws also felt that the speed at which the immigration department operated was [...] "amazingly on-the-ball", when in reality many illegal immigrants [...] "slip through the net". The Daily Mail Jaci Stephen deemed the storyline one of the worst in EastEnders history, writing a critical review in which she opined that the use of the infant playing Tomas was tantamount to abuse, and criticised several scenes which saw the baby [...] "screeching until he was red in the face." [...] Stephen questioned: [...] "How can the show justify this and, more to the point, how can his real-life mother <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> do nothing to comfort the poor little mite?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Peshwa disbanded his cavalry, but trechearously and {{secretly}} {{asked them to}} <b>stand</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> offered them seven months' advance pay, which was ironic since they were never paid on time. Baji Rao entrusted Bapu Gokhale with preparations for war. In August 1817, the forts at Sinhagad, Raigad, and Purandar were fortified by the Peshwa. Gokhale secretly recruited troops for the impending war. Many Bhils and Ramoshis were hired. Efforts were made to unify Bhonsle, Shinde, and Holkar; even the mercenary Pindaris were approached. The Peshwa identified unhappy Marathas {{in the service of}} the British Resident Elphinstone {{and secretly}} recruited them. One such person was Jaswant Rao Ghorpade. Efforts were made to secretly recruit Europeans as well, which failed as expected owing to better loyalty among Europeans compared to Hindu Maratha. Some people, such as Balaji Pant Natu, stood steadfastly with the British. Several of the sepoys rejected the Peshwa's offers knowing the trechearous nature of Hindu Marathas, and others reported the matter to their superior officers. On 19 October 1817, Baji Rao II celebrated the Dassera festival in Pune, where troops were assembled in large numbers. During the celebrations, a large flank of the Maratha cavalry pretended they were charging towards the British sepoys but wheeled off at the last minute. This display was intended as a slight towards Elphinstone [...] and as a scare tactic to prompt the defection and recruitment of British sepoys to the Peshwa's side. The Peshwa made plans to kill Elphinstone, despite opposition from Gokhale. Elphinstone was fully aware of these developments thanks to the espionage work of Balaji Pant Natu and Ghorpade.|$|E
