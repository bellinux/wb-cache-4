40|$|International audienceAn {{investigation}} was conducted from summer 2012 to winter 2013 at 25 stations along the Tunisian coast near Kef Abbed at Marsa Dhouiba (north-east Mediterranean Sea) to analyse grain size, sediment mineralogy and currents. Particle-size analysis shows that sand deposits at shallow depths are characterised by S-shaped curves, indicating {{a degree of}} agitation and possible transport by rip currents near the bottom. At greater depths (between 10 and 30 m), the bottom is covered by coarse sand and gravel. A current was observed transporting sediment eastward along the coast; another seaward current was also noted. Generated by wind, swell and especially waves from west to north-west, the two currents transport clay and silt-sized sediment seaward. An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler showed Marsa Dhouiba’s coastal current to follow a direction 175 ° East, with its main axis running north/north-west parallel to the coast and its minor axis also running north/north-west. Analysis of current components indicates that the velocities u and v are oriented north to south. <b>Sediment</b> <b>evolution</b> in shallow waters is dependent on detrital inputs from streams and winds.

Murray Gingras and Kurt Konhauser Throughout the Precambrian, marine sediments passed into the rock record largely undisturbed unless subjected to processes such as slope collapse, seismicity or rapid dewatering.

40|$|Abstract: Sediment {{management}} {{with the}} help of water jets in combined-sewer-overflow (CSOs) reservoirs in the Chicago area has motivated this work. Erosion caused by single and multiple submerged circular turbulent wall jets on a granular (non cohesive) sediment bed of finite thickness laying on a fixed boundary was studied {{with the help}} of laboratory experiments. Plane turbulent wall jets were also tested on sewer sediment in order to determine its critical shear stress. Though not strongly cohesive this sewer sediment presented some floculation. Regarding circular jets, different combinations of jet diameter, jet separation, and ratio between sediment thickness and jet diameter were tested. For granular sediments results show a relation between dimensionless parameters characterizing the steady state bed profile and the densimetric particle Froude number Fo given by the velocity at the nozzle, and the effective diameter and submerged specific density of the sediment. Sewer sediment is better characterized by the critical shear stress beyond which transport occurs.

40|$|Biomineralization {{by heavy}} metal {{resistant}} streptomycetes was tested {{to evaluate the}} potential influence on metal mobilities in soil. Thus, {{we designed an experiment}} adopting conditions from classical laboratory methods to natural conditions prevailing in metal-rich soils with media spiked with heavy metals, soil agar, and nutrient enriched or unamended soil incubated with the bacteria. As a result, all strains were able to form struvite minerals on tryptic soy broth (TSB) media supplemented with AlCl 2 , MnCl 2 and CuSO 4 , as well as on soil agar. Some strains additionally formed struvite on nutrient enriched contaminated and control soil, as well as on metal contaminated soil without addition of media components. In contrast, switzerite was exclusively formed on minimal media spiked with MnCl 2 by four heavy metal resistant strains, and on nutrient enriched control soil by one strain. Hydrated nickel hydrogen phosphate was only crystallized on complex media supplemented with NiSO 4 by most strains. Thus, mineralization is a~dominant property of streptomycetes, with different processes likely to occur under laboratory conditions and sub-natural to natural conditions. This new understanding may be transferred to formation of minerals in rock and <b>sediment</b> <b>evolution,</b> to ore deposit formation, and also might have implications for our understanding of biological metal resistance mechanisms. We assume that biogeochemical cycles, nutrient storage and metal resistance might be affected by formation and re-solubilization of minerals like struvite in soil at microscale...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} geomorphological and sedimentological {{study has}} been performed at a tidal sandbank, which has been dredged during 30 years. Localised intensive aggregate extraction created a depression in {{the central part of}} the sandbank, upon which the Government decided to close this section of the bank for further exploitation. Multibeam and side-scan sonar technology was used to survey the bank, in combination with extensive ground-truthing. Automated seabed classification was performed, but showed no direct correlation with the mean grain-size; the primary drivers influencing the classification being the sorting of the sediments, the presence of shells and of fine sediments. Very high resolution seismics revealed the internal architecture of the bank. In the central depression, the upper unit is locally severely dredged. The central depression is characterized by distinct morphosedimentary facies, compared to the western and eastern part of the bank and the Kwinte swale, adjacent of it. The difference between the western and the eastern part is essentially due to different tidal current characteristics, each having their particular sedimentation-erosion patterns. These processes seem to be rather stable, though the evolution of the sediments in the central depression shows similarities with the Kwinte swale <b>sediment</b> <b>evolution.</b> Since the depression is somewhat oblique to the normal crestline, it now forms an open transport pathway from the swale up to the crest of the sandbank. This led to a canalization of the flood current which is witnessed mostly by the northwards and faster progression of bedforms. Because of the difference in sediment characteristics between the dredged material and the present-day supply of sand, it is unlikely that natural processes will be able to counterbalance the severe dredging activities. Moreover, the presence of the central depression is located close to the kink of the sand bank, which is influenced by a high-energy hydrodynamic regime. Its presence could intensify the current action in this area and could enhance the evolution of the bank...|$|E

The first approach is based on the classical coupled Saint-Venant-Exner equations, as-suming one layer of pure water over a movable bed that can undergo erosion or deposition. Several empirical formulations are used to estimate the sediment transport capacity. The second approach assumes a fluid layer composed of a mixture of water and sediment, characterised by a depth-averaged density, for which the bed deformation rate is modelled as a function of both the erosion and deposition rates.

40|$|International audienceSewer {{deposits}} {{have been}} identified as a major cause of dysfunctions in combined sewer systems regarding sewer management, which induces different negative consequents resulting in poor hydraulic conveyance, environmental damages as well as worker’s health. In order to overcome the problematics of sedimentation, flushing has been considered as the most operative and cost-effective way to minimize the sediments impacts and prevent such challenges. Flushing, by prompting turbulent wave effects, can modify the bed form depending on the hydraulic properties and geometrical characteristics of the conduit. So far, the dynamics of the bed-load during high-flow events in combined sewer systems as a complex environment is not well understood, mostly due to lack of measuring devices capable to work in the “hostile” in combined sewer system correctly. In this regards, a one-episode flushing issue from an opening gate valve with weir function was carried out in a trunk sewer in Paris to understanding its cleansing efficiency on the sediments (thickness: 0 - 30 cm). During more than 1 h of flushing within 5 m distance in downstream of this flushing device, a maximum flowrate and a maximum level of water have been recorded at 5 m in downstream of the gate as 4. 1 m 3 /s and 2. 1 m respectively. This paper is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this type of gate for around 1. 1 km (from the point - 50 m to + 1050 m in downstream from the gate) by (i) determining bed grain-size distribution and <b>sediments</b> <b>evolution</b> through the sewer channel, as well as their organic matter content, and (ii) identifying sections that exhibit more changes in their texture after the flush. For the first one, two series of sampling were taken from the sewer length and then analyzed in laboratory, one before flushing and second after, at same points among the sewer channel. Hence, a non-intrusive sampling instrument has undertaken to extract the sediments smaller than the fine gravels. The comparison between sediments texture after the flush operation and the initial state, revealed the most modified zones by the flush effect, regarding the sewer invert slope and hydraulic parameters in the zone up to 400 m from the gate. At this distance, despite the increase of sediment grain-size rages, D 50 (median grain-size) varies between 0. 6 mm and 1. 1 mm compared to 0. 8 mm and 10 mm before and after flushing, respectively. Overall, regarding the sewer channel invert slope, results indicate that grains smaller than sands (< 2 mm) are more transported to downstream along about 400 m from the gate: in average 69 % before against 38 % after the flush with more dispersion of grain-sizes distributions. Furthermore, high effect of the channel bed irregularities on the bed material evolution has been observed after the flush...|$|R

Beta and gamma emissions from simulated sediments containing radioactive uranium, thorium and potassium are modelled in contexts that are spatially heterogeneous. Dose rate was modelled using Monte Carlo radiation transport codes MCNP and PENELOPE. A number of key issues that affect dose rate evaluation are examined and updated corrections are calculated. Granular structures used for geometrical input into the models were simulated using randomly packed ellipsoids. The pair correlation function and chord length distributions were derived. The effects of water content on dose rate were modelled and compared with cavity theory.

40|$|Sediment {{transport}} modelling in estuarine environments, characterised by cohesive and non-cohesive sediment mixtures, has {{to consider}} a time variation of erodibility due to consolidation. Generally, validated by settling column experiments, mud consolidation is now fairly well simulated; however, numerical models still have difficulty to simulate accurately the sedimentation and consolidation of mixed sediments {{for a wide range}} of initial conditions. This is partly due to the difficulty to formulate the contribution of sand in the hindered settling regime when segregation does not clearly occur. Based on extensive settling experiments with mud-sand mixtures, the objective of this study was to improve the numerical modelling of mixed-sediment consolidation by focusing on segregation processes. We used constitutive relationships following the fractal theory associated with a new segregation formulation based on the relative mud concentration. Using specific sets of parameters calibrated for each test—with different initial sediment concentration and sand content—the model achieved excellent prediction skills for simulating <b>sediment</b> height <b>evolutions</b> and concentration vertical profiles.

The geoarchaeological study includes the stratigraphy and the sedimentology of archaeological <b>sediments.</b> The <b>evolution</b> of the site followed three successive environmental phases, and the site was home to two distinct cultures.

The interplay of these factors is investigated for the latest Oligocene-Middle Miocene Northern Apennines Foredeep turbidite wedges by means of turbidite-system-based lithostratigraphy and field mapping, integrated with nannoplankton biostratigraphy and sedimentary petrogra-phy. Almost all recognized turbidite systems, unless tectonically truncated, show an overall stacking pattern formed by a lower sand-rich, t ickly bedded stage (depocentre stage) passing upward into mud-rich, thinly bedded stages, ventually grading up to mostly mudstone units (abandonment stage). This rhythmically repeated pattern is interpreted {{as the result of the}} abrupt switching on and off of coarse-grained input, coupled with an alternating increase/ decrease of depositional rate recorded in all detected systems. Biostratigraphy makes it possible to distinguish the switching-off of turbidite systems due to depocentre migration (a new system is switched on basinward) from that due to a regional decrease of clastic input...|$|R
40|$|The Yangtze River {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of the East Asia river system. In this study, sediments in the Jianghan Basin, middle Yangtze River, were selected for trace element and rare earth element (REE) measurements, in order to decipher information on the change of <b>sediment</b> provenance and <b>evolution</b> of the Yangtze River. According to the elemental variations, the late Cenozoic sediments of the Jianghan Basin could be divided into four parts. During 2. 68 – 2. 28  Ma and 1. 25 – 0  Ma, provenance of the sediments was consistent, whereas sediments were derived from variable sources during 2. 28 – 1. 25  Ma. Comparison of the elemental compositions between the Pliocene and Quaternary sediments revealed a change in sediment source from a more felsic source area to a more basic source area around the Pliocene–Quaternary boundary. Input from the Emeishan LIP should account for this provenance change. Based on the provenance analysis of sediments in the Jianghan Basin, we infer that the Yangtze River developed into a large river with its drainage basin extended to the Emeishan LIP no later than the Pliocene–Quaternary boundary...|$|R
40|$|The Pannonian basin-Carpathian system {{displays}} pronounced lateral {{variation in}} lithopsheric structure and sedimentary basin configuration. The tectonic {{history of the}} system is characterised by a polyphase history with Late Miocene extension in the Pannonian basin and simultaneously occurring compression in the Carpathian arc. Pre-existing structures {{play a key role in}} subsequent basin reactivation, explaining anomalous features in subsidence characteristics and inferred thinning factors. The area exhibits a relatively high level of neotectonic activity, imaged by high resolution seismic data, intraplate seismicity and stress indicator data. Major parts of the system have experienced a rapid late Neogene uplift and erosion, amounting up to several kilometres in the Romanian Carpathians. A major part of the present basin configuration, previously primarily attributed to basin formation mechanisms such as stretching in the Pannonian basin and lithospheric flexure in the Carpathians, appears to be strongly affected by recent deformation, postdating basin formation of the Pannonian basin and the Carpathian foredeep. These findings affect modelling predictions of basin subsidence, <b>sediment</b> sourcing, thermal <b>evolution</b> and hydrodynamic regime with implications for hydrocarbon play-concepts in the area. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
