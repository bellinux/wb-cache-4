40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the cause of}} {{premature}} failure of the upper <b>strut</b> <b>mount</b> of a McPherson suspension is investigated. The work was prompted {{by the fact that}} the failed component has been used for at least four decades by a car manufacturer without reporting any premature failure and therefore an in depth study of the structural behavior of the component was required. Both experimental tests and numerical analyses have been carried out in order to estimate the service life of the component. The fatigue life of the component has been assessed by a defect tolerant analysis. The result of the investigation is that the upper <b>strut</b> <b>mount</b> failure was due to an impulsive load that can not be justified by the static and dynamic loads acting on the component caused by road irregularities and vehicle manoeuvring during usual working conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} the experimental testing of a bluff {{body with a}} blunt base {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of end-plate tabs in reducing drag. The bluff body is fitted with interchangeable end plates; one plate is flush with the rest of the exterior and the other plate has small tabs protruding perpendicularly into the flow. The body is tested in the Cal Poly 3 ft x 4 ft low speed wind tunnel. Testing is conducted in three phases. The first phase was the hot-wire measurement of streamwise velocity of the near wake behind the bluff body. An IFA 300 thermal anemometry system with a hot-wire probe placed behind the model measures the wake velocity fluctuations. The power spectral density on the model without tabs shows large spikes at Strouhal numbers of 0. 266, 0. 300, and 0. 287 at corresponding Re = 41, 400, 82, 800, 124, 200 where vortex shedding occurs. The model with tabs shows no such peaks in power and therefore has attenuated vortex generation in the wake flow at that location. The second phase of testing was pressure testing the model through the use of pressure ports on the exterior of the bluff body. A Scanivalve pressure transducer measured multiple ports almost simultaneously through tubing that was connected to the model internally and routed through the model’s <b>strut</b> <b>mount</b> and outside of the wind tunnel. This pressure testing shows that the model with tabs is able to achieve up to 36 % increase in Cp at Reh = 41, 400 on the base region of the bluff body and no negative pressure spikes that occur as a result of vortex shedding. The last phase of testing is the measurement of total drag on the model through a sting balance mount. This testing shows that the drag on the model is reduced by 14 % at Re = 41, 400. However it also shows that as velocity increased, the drag reduction is reduced and ultimately negated at Re = 124, 200 with no drag loss at all. The addition of tabs as a passive flow control device did eliminate vortex shedding and alter the base pressure of the bluff body. This particular model however showed no reduction in total drag on the model at high Reynolds numbers higher than 124, 000. Further study is necessary to isolate the exact geometry and flow velocities that should be able to produce more favorable drag results for a bluff body with this type of passive flow control device...|$|E

50|$|In {{cars with}} double {{wishbone}} suspensions, camber angle may be fixed or adjustable, but in MacPherson strut suspensions, it is normally fixed. The elimination of an available camber adjustment may reduce maintenance requirements, {{but if the}} car is lowered by use of shortened springs, the camber angle will change. Excessive camber angle can lead to increased tire wear and impaired handling. Significant suspension modifications may correspondingly require that the upper control arm or <b>strut</b> <b>mounting</b> points be altered to allow for some inward or outward movement, relative to longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, for camber adjustment. Aftermarket plates with slots for <b>strut</b> <b>mounts</b> instead of just holes are available {{for most of the}} commonly modified models of cars.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in modern computing and simulation, wind tunnel testing {{remains the most}} trusted method for determining aerodynamic vehicle behavior.
