25|$|The {{church has}} often been {{associated}} with the legend of <b>Sweeney</b> <b>Todd,</b> the 'demon-barber' of Fleet Street.

25|$|The first {{project for}} which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics was A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962, 964 performances), {{with a book}} based on the works of Plautus by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart, and {{starring}} Zero Mostel. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past. Other early Sondheim works include Anyone Can Whistle (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars Lee Remick and Angela Lansbury), and the successful Company (1970), Follies (1971) and A Little Night Music (1973). Later, Sondheim found inspiration in unlikely sources: the opening of Japan to Western trade for Pacific Overtures (1976), a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the Industrial Age of London for <b>Sweeney</b> <b>Todd</b> (1979), the paintings of Georges Seurat for Sunday in the Park with George (1984), fairy tales for Into the Woods (1987), {{and a collection of}} presidential assassins in Assassins (1990).|$|E

Andy, upset that Erin is not in the audience, repeatedly checks for messages from her on his cell phone. While he is on stage, his phone rings in his pocket, disrupting the musical and forcing the performers to improvise. To make matters worse, Michael drops his bottle of wine, causing a commotion as it rolls. Then he loses grip of balloons he brought to his seat, which pop as they hit the top of the hall. This startles a baby, and the sound of her cries alerts Jim and Pam to the fact that Erin came to the play with CeCe, exciting Andy, but angering Jim and Pam. At the end of the show, everyone cheers except for Michael, who angrily boos the actor playing <b>Sweeney</b> <b>Todd.</b> During the party for the performers afterwards, the director compliments Michael on the [...] "energy" [...] of his audition and encourages him to audition again, suggesting that he felt that <b>Sweeney</b> <b>Todd</b> simply wasn't the right production for Michael's acting style.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} no clear author of the 19th century String of Pearls in the {{original}} penny dreadful, there are many theories surrounding its influences. In the Victorian time, when this story was first written, a semi-common trade was what was called a barber-surgeon. Barber-surgeons cropped up around this time as trained medical practitioners, not through school but through apprenticeship and they were illiterate. The story goes that in front of a barber-surgeons workplace there would be a red and white pole (much like in front of <b>Sweeney</b> <b>Todd’s</b> shop), symbolizing the blood and napkins used during the bloodletting. In 1745, surgery became an established and well regarded profession of its own and the two were officially separated by King George II.|$|R
