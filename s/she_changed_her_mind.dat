5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling {{too much on the}} classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when she realised she would be {{the focal point of the}} adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E

500|$|Hergé's main assistant, Bob de Moor, {{showed an}} {{interest}} in completing the book following Hergé's death. In de Moor's words, [...] "Personally I {{would have loved to}} finish Alph-Art. It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the writers}} of the show wrote [...] "Three Stories", the first episode in which Stacy appeared, the first name {{they came up with}} to play the {{character}} was Sela Ward. Although Ward was not initially interested in portraying Stacy, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> after watching tapes of the show. While she was originally hired to appear in only two episodes of the first season, the chemistry between Ward and Laurie was strong enough to have her appear in seven more second season episodes. She also appeared in the House finale [...] "Everybody Dies". Stacy was received mostly positively by critics who considered her arc a [...] "juicy subplot".|$|E
500|$|Berry {{portrayed the}} mutant superhero Storm {{in the film}} {{adaptation}} of the comic book series X-Men (2000) and its sequels, X2 (2003), [...] (2006) and [...] (2014). In 2001, Berry appeared in the film Swordfish, which featured her first topless scene. At first, she refused to be filmed topless in a sunbathing scene, but <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when Warner Brothers raised her fee substantially. The brief flash of her breasts added $500,000 to her fee. Berry considered these stories to be rumors and was quick to deny them. After turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she said she decided to make Swordfish because her then-husband, Eric Benét, supported her and encouraged her to take risks.|$|E

500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|Gordimer remarked that, {{more than}} just a story about white communists in South Africa, Burger's Daughter is about [...] "commitment" [...] and what she as a writer does to [...] "make sense of life". After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer {{considered}} going into exile, but <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and later recalled [...] "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we can make out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E
500|$|According to the {{producers}} of House, Stacy was brought into the show to give viewers some insight into House. The writers chose to start off Stacy's story arc [...] "very subtly", but to end it with a [...] "big blowout". Shore explained that he wanted Ward for the part {{because it was the}} first person the writing staff of House came up with, adding that she acts in a [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "convincing way". Initially, Ward was not interested in portraying the character, because, after the cancellation of Once and Again, she wanted to spend more time with her kids, which is why she had also turned down earlier roles on [...] and Desperate Housewives. However, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when she saw tapes of the show, because as she watched she realized that House [...] "would be fun to be a part of".|$|E

500|$|In {{a motion}} {{sent to the}} prosecutor, the boy's court-appointed lawyer, and reporters, Thompson asked to be {{recognized}} as the boy's lawyer in the case. Medina County Prosecutor Dean Holman, however, said Thompson would be faced with deeply conflicting interests if he were to represent Dustin Lynch because he also advised Mishne's parents. Claiming that delays had weakened his case, Thompson asked Medina County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Collier to disqualify himself from presiding over the case because the judge had not ruled on Thompson's request for two months. The boy himself eventually rejected Thompson's offer, withdrawing his insanity plea. Lynch's mother, Jerrilyn Thomas, who had demanded that Collier appoint Thompson to defend her son, said <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> after visiting with her son in jail, saying that the charge against him [...] "has nothing to do with video games or Paxil, and my son's no murderer." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher {{realized}} that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> after the success, commenting, [...] "I never thought I would want to do disco... it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1564 Dudley had {{realised}} {{that his}} chances of becoming Elizabeth's consort were small. At {{the same time he}} could not [...] "consider ... without great repugnance", as he said, that she chose another husband. Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued to say that she still would very much like to marry him. Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later. To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects. These he had and would continue to sabotage. In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old; but he still was hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> (and married an Englishman).|$|E
