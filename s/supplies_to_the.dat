5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals.|$|E
5|$|After {{the floods}} receded, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the Department of National Defense to utilize all {{resources}} {{to assist the}} people affected by the floods. More than 94,000people stayed at 896shelters after being evacuated due to the floods. The federal government allocated $234million (2.34 billion pesos) in relief, which was smaller than the damage total. Widespread medical teams assisted {{tens of thousands of}} homes, and due to prevention measures, there were no outbreaks of diseases. Roads and electrical systems were gradually restored, and students returned to school after repairs were made. Residents throughout Mexico sent <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mexican Red Cross, including 500tons of food and water, and international agencies sent money and <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flood victims.|$|E
5|$|Hyakutake {{immediately}} began to prepare for another attempt to recapture Henderson Field. The Japanese navy promised to support Hyakutake's next offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, and by stepping-up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.|$|E

5|$|Spokane {{became an}} {{important}} rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas. In the early 1880s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire; as a regional shipping center, the city furnished <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> miners who passed through {{on their way to}} the mineral-rich Coeur d'Alene, Colville and Kootenay districts. The mining districts are still considered among the most productive in North America.|$|E
5|$|The British did {{not return}} to Charleston until 1780, when General Clinton {{successfully}} besieged the city and captured an entire army. Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778, its states provided military <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort.|$|E

More than 8. 3 mln t of eolian matter are annually transported from the land over the shelf of the former USSR.

50|$|Coronary anastomoses are a {{clinically}} vital subject: the coronary anastomosis is <b>the</b> blood <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart.

Inadequate <b>supply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart will lead to chest pains (angina) or a heart attack (myocardial infarction). These can be ameliorated by surgical intervention to create a bypass using the anastomosis technique.|$|R
5|$|The former fort was {{captured}} by Murad Khan of Maqpon Dynasty, the ruler of Baltistan, in the Conquest of Khaplu in the 1590s by cutting off the water and other <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fort. The troops of Murad besieged the fort for three months, resulting in the surrender of Rahim Khan, the 62nd Yabgo dynasty ruler of Khaplu. The fort again fell to invaders in the 1660s and 1674.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Halifax/Dartmouth had increased to between 60,000 and 65,000 people by 1917. Convoys carried soldiers, men, animals and <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European theatre of war. The two main points of departure were in Nova Scotia at Sydney in Cape Breton and Halifax. Hospital ships brought the wounded to the city, {{and a new}} military hospital was constructed in the city.|$|E

5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH. The Partisan operations spread to eastern Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made their {{appearance on the}} Bosnian-Serbian border area. The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surrounded garrison of Vi≈°egrad.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} damage, Henderson {{personnel}} {{were able to}} restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours. Over the next several weeks, the CAF gradually recovered as Allied forces delivered more aircraft, fuel, and aircrew personnel to Guadalcanal. Observing the Japanese deliveries of troops and <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, American forces were expecting an imminent offensive by Japanese ground forces, {{but they were not}} sure where and when it would take place.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased {{the island}} for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate {{starting}} on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project. The project team operates the Lewis Alexander, a boat which was purpose-built for the crossing to Flat Holm and which is able to carry up to 45 passengers and essential <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Norwegian Polar Institute took an {{initiative}} to establish DROMLAN {{in cooperation with}} eleven other countries who operate research facilities in Queen Maud Land. On 5 January 2001, a test flight with representatives from eight countries was made to Henriksenskjera. From there, a DHC-6/300 Twin Otter, Basler BT-67 and a helicopter was used to distribute the crew and <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various bases. In addition to evaluating the airfield at Novolazarevskaya, an evaluation was performed at Troll in January 2002. The hub model was used {{during the summer of}} 2001 and 2002, operated by the South African company Antarctic Logistics Centre International.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{perceived}} of {{collaborating with}} the enemy have, on occasion, been impaled. For example, in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War, the German officer Fuchs was impaled on suspicion of defecting to the Swedes, a Swedish corporal was likewise impaled for trying to defect to the Germans. In 1654, under the Ottoman siege of the Venetian garrison at Crete, several peasants were impaled for supplying provisions to the besieged. Likewise in 1685, some Christians were impaled by the Hungarians for having provided <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Turks.|$|E
