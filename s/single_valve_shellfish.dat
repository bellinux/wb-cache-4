40|$|ObjectivesThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 {{cardiac surgery}} risk {{models have been}} {{developed}} for heart valve surgery with and without coronary artery bypass grafting. The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 cardiac risk models in Chinese patients undergoing <b>single</b> <b>valve</b> surgery and the predicted mortality rates of those undergoing multiple valve surgery derived from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 risk models. MethodsA total of 12, 170 patients underwent heart valve surgery from January 2008 to December 2011. Combined congenital heart surgery and aortal surgery cases were excluded. A relatively small number of valve surgery combinations were excluded. The final research population included the following isolated heart valve surgery types: aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, and mitral valve repair. The following combined valve surgery types were included: mitral valve replacement plus tricuspid valve repair, mitral valve replacement plus aortic valve replacement, and mitral valve replacement plus aortic valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair. Evaluation was performed by using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and C-statistics. ResultsData from 9846 patients were analyzed. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 cardiac risk models showed reasonable discrimination and poor calibration (C-statistic, 0. 712; P = . 00006 in Hosmer–Lemeshow test). Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models had better discrimination (C-statistic, 0. 734) and calibration (P = . 5805) in patients undergoing isolated valve surgery than in patients undergoing multiple valve surgery (C-statistic, 0. 694; P = . 00002 in Hosmer–Lemeshow test). Estimates derived from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models exceeded the mortality rates of multiple valve surgery (observed/expected ratios of 1. 44  for multiple valve surgery and 1. 17 for <b>single</b> <b>valve</b> surgery). ConclusionsThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 cardiac surgery risk models performed well when predicting the mortality for Chinese patients undergoing valve surgery. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models were suitable for <b>single</b> <b>valve</b> surgery in a Chinese population; estimates of mortality for multiple valve surgery derived from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models were less accurate...|$|R
40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. Aircraft ventilation systems are crucial in maintaining a good air quality during flight. The aim is delivering both fresh and recirculated air to the cabin and cockpit of the plane. Typical components in a ventilation system are heat units, fans, filters and valves. The latter are usually electronically controlled butterfly valves which regulate the flow rate in the system. These devices {{have a significant impact}} and the flow field after the valve affects the working of every component downstream in the network. In this paper the flow fields before and after a butterfly valve are studied using hotwire and stereoscopic PIV measurements. Two configurations are tested: one configuration consisting of a <b>single</b> <b>valve</b> (<b>single</b> <b>valve</b> configuration) and one configuration consisting of a valve closely coupled after a 90 ° bend (valve + bend configuration). The velocity is measured in both a horizontal and vertical measurement plane to study the spatial structure of the flow. Both PIV and hotwire measurements show good agreement. In both configurations, the flow field is highly 3 dimensional. The bend has a large impact on the flow field after the valve. The central wake is significantly increased in length and the turbulence intensities increase from around 50 % for the <b>single</b> <b>valve</b> configuration to more than 75 % for the valve + bend configuration. This significant impact shows the importance of the interaction of different components in a ventilation network on the general characteristics such as pressure drop or noise propagation.
