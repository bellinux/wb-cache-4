5000|$|Wildfires {{may also}} spread by jumping or {{spotting}} as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands (hot wood embers) and other burning materials {{through the air}} over roads, rivers, and other barriers that may otherwise act as firebreaks. Torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting, and dry ground fuels that surround a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from firebrands. Spotting can create <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> as hot embers and firebrands ignite fuels downwind from the fire. In Australian bushfires, <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> are known to occur as far as 10 km from the fire front.
