40|$|ABSTRACT III The term {{service network}} (SN) denotes {{a network of}} <b>{{software}}</b> <b>services</b> in which complex software applications are provided to customers by aggregating multiple elementary services. These networks {{are based on the}} service-oriented computing (SOC) paradigm, which defines the fundamental technical concepts for <b>software</b> <b>services</b> over electronic networks, e. g., Web services and, most re-cently, Cloud services. For the provision of <b>software</b> <b>services</b> to customers, <b>software</b> <b>service</b> providers (SPs) have to allocate their scarce computational re-sources (i. e., hardware and software) of a certain quality to customer requests. The SOC paradigm facilitates interoperability over organizational boundaries by representing business relationships on the software system level. Composite <b>software</b> <b>services</b> aggregate multiple <b>software</b> <b>services</b> into <b>software</b> applications. This aggregation is denoted as service composition. The loose coupling of ser-vices leads to SNs as dynamic entities with changing interdependencies betwee...|$|R
