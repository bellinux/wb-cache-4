Doznačena primjerna stabla razvrstana su prema najizraženijim vanjskim značajkama u devet grupa (kategorija). Istraživanje je provedeno na ukupno 36 objekata gospodarske jedinice Bjelovarska Bilogora. U objektima oplodnih sječa podaci su prikupljani u više navrata (sjekova). Na taj je način razvrstano 2. 308 doznačenih stabla u ukupno 46 navrata (sjekova). Svi objekti pripadaju ekološko-gospodarskom tipu II-D- 11 i uređajnom razredu BUKVA s ophodnjom od 100 godina. Postotna zastupljenost stabala s pozitivnim utjecajem na sorimentnu strukturu, ovisno o vrsti sijeka, kreće se oko 50 % kod proreda i pripremnog sijeka te oko 60 % kod naplodnog i dovršnog sijeka. Na ukupnost strukture drvnih sortimenata pojedine vrste sijeka najveći utjecaj imaju srednje debela i debela stabla, odnosno stabla iz debljinskih razreda većih od 41 cm prsnog promjera. Razlog tomu je činjenica da samo ta stabla potencijalno mogu sadržavati najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente (prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma iz 1995) zbog minimalnih dimenzija propisanih za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente. Postotna zastupljenost i razlika postotnog udjela broja stabala prsnog promjera većeg od 41 cm s pozitivnim utjecajem na sortimentnu strukturu raste od proreda prema dovršnom sijeku. Postotak zastupljenosti od strane čovjeka oštećenih stabala raste od proreda prema dovršnim sjekovima što se može povezati s intenziviranjem radova iskorištavanja šuma u vrijeme oplodnih sječa. Nužno je razlučiti sortimentnu strukturu sastojine od sortimentne strukture sječine (određene vrste sijeka). Porast postotnih udjela kvalitetnih drvnih sortimenata po debljinskim stupnjevima od proreda prema dovršnim sjekovima, pravilnost je uvjetovana našim odlukama, odnosno stručnim provođenjem uzgojnih zahvata doznake stabala za sječu. Ta je pravilnost stalna u onoj mjeri u kojoj su takvi načini gospodarenja i način nihovog provođenja. The {{subject of}} {{research}} were absolute and percentage share of assigned trees according to diameter class {{and type of}} felling and their influence on assortment structure of particular types of felling. The assigned exemplary trees were categorized {{according to the most}} prominent outward features into nine categories. The research was carried out on the total number of 36 areas of the economic unit Bjelovarska Bilogora. In the <b>seeding</b> <b>felling</b> areas data were collected on several occasions (felling). In that way, 2, 308 assigned trees were categorized in the total of 46 occasions (felling). All the areas belong to ecological-economical type II-D- 11 and structural class BEECH with the rotation of 100 years. The aim of the process was gaining more insight into the factors that influence assortment structure of stands, as well as completing the information on principles and ways of forest management in the past and nowadays. Analysis of the number of trees of particular categories according to the type of felling (stand age) and diameter class was carried out with the aim of finding the answers to questions pertaining to the criteria of assignment of one type of felling, as well as the degree of damage to stands during the exploiting of forest in the area subject to research. The assigned trees of group A (undamaged trees of normal growth) have, on the whole, extremely positive influence on assortment structure of particular type of felling. To these we can, to a certain extent, join pregrowth trees, i. e. group G, whose influence is limited mostly to thinning felling. Trees of all the other described groups have more or less negative effect on assortment structure of particular type of felling. The influence of suppressed trees (group H) on assortment structure is insignificant, and their importance for successful carrying out of <b>seeding</b> <b>felling</b> is considerable. The percentage of trees with positive influence on assortment structure according to the type of felling, stands about 50 % in thinning and preparatory felling, while in seeding and final felling it is about 60 %. Trees of medium diameter and large diameter, i. e. trees of diameter class between 41 cm and 60 cm, and those with breast diameter over 61 cm, have the greatest influence on the whole of tree assortment structure or particular types of felling. The reason for that is the fact that only those trees can potentially contain timber assortment of the highest quality (according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995) because of the minimal dimensions prescribed for timber assortments of the highest quality. Percentage of those trees with positive and negative influence on assortment structure is almost identical in case of thinning and preparatory felling, while in case of seeding and final felling the share of trees with positive effect is considerably higher than the percentage of trees with negative effect on assortment structure. It can be said that the percentage of trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with the positive effect on assortment structure grows from 5. 7 % in thinning felling to 57. 5 % in final felling. If we focus on the relation (difference) between the trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with positive and negative effect on assortment structure, we can easily say that this value ranges from – 2. 9 % in thinning felling to 22. 9 % in final felling. Trees damaged {{as a result of our}} activities, or human influence, are contained within groups with description marks of C, D, E and I. The percentage of trees damaged by human activity increases from thinning felling to final felling. For thinning felling, this percentage amounts to 11. 2 %, for preparatory felling it is 13. 1 %, for <b>seeding</b> <b>felling</b> it is 15. 8 %, while for final felling it amounts to 23. 3 % of damaged trees. The increase in participation of trees damaged in that way towards the end of rotation can be attributed to intensifying of exploitation of forests at the time of <b>seeding</b> <b>felling.</b> However, as much as 23. 3 % of damaged trees out of the assigned trees of final felling, i. e. almost one quarter of more or less damaged trees left for final felling, is the information which calls for some concern. The quality of assortment structure of stand varies within a large scope and depends on different kinds of influence, from timely and high-quality cultivation activities, over influence of habitats, to the extreme abiotic influences of accidental character. Assortment structure of beech stands is the focus of our interest only in the sense of increasing the overall quality of beech trees, i. e. achieving the largest possible percentage of high-quality beech trees in the stand. The percentage of timber assortments in beech stands of particular age (except for final felling and clear felling) is not our primary interest. The primary interest of forestry operational bodies (as well as science) is the quality and quantity of timber assortments that can be achieved through carrying out of particular type of felling, i. e. assortment structure of felling area. The share of timber assortments of particular type of felling is to a great extent a result of our decisions during the selection of trees for felling, by which we pursue the aim and the guidelines of stand management. The principles (rules) we apply while assigning trees for particular type of felling lead us to “save” the high-quality trees for the end of the rotation (<b>seeding</b> <b>felling,</b> final felling). Having that in mind, it is to be expected that the percentage of the timber assortments of the highest quality (within the same diameter class) will increase from thinning felling towards final felling. For that reason it is necessary to distinguish between the assortment structure of stand and the assortment structure of felling area (specific types of felling). The assortment structure of stand varies within a wide and unknown scope, and its quality is the result of the success of our management in the past. Only in that sense does the assortment structure of stand influence the assortment structure of felling area. The increase in percentage shares of high-quality timber assortments according to diameter classes from thinning felling to final felling is a pattern determined by our decisions, i. e. expert conduct of cultivation activities of assigning trees for felling. This pattern is constant in the same measure as the principles of management and the manner of their implementation are constant...|$|E

Postotni udjeli tehničke oblovine određeni ovim istraživanjem uspoređeni su s planskim vrijednostima (sortimentnim tablicama) koje se primjenjuju u šumarskoj operativi. Na temelju rezultata istraživanja izrađene su nove sortimentne tablice prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma od 1995. godine. Istraživanja su provedena na uzorku koji obuhvaća 787 stabala u proredama, 1025 stabala u pripremnim, 606 stabala u naplodnim i 583 stabala u dovršnim sjekovima. Sveukupno je istraživanjima obuhvaćeno 3001 primjerno stablo. Starost istraživanih sječina iznosila je od 59 do 91 godinu kod prethodnog prihoda (proreda), od 94 do 110 godina kod pripremnog sijeka, od 100 do 112 godina kod naplodnog sijeka te od 98 do 112 godina kod dovršnog sijeka. Dosadašnji je pristup određivanju sortimentne strukture jednodobnih bukovih sastojina u velikoj mjeri pogrešan. Operativne sortimentne tablice daju previsoke procjene za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente svih vrsta sjekova osim zadnjih sjekova oplodnih bukovih sječina. Tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata koje uvažavaju vrstu sijeka kao jedan od ulaza, omogućuju pouzdaniju procjenu sortimentne strukture sječine i preciznije planiranje sječivog etata. Pri tome su kao čimbenici razdvajanja uzeti kriteriji selekcije prilikom doznake stabala za sječu koji se primjenjuju do uključivo pripremnog sijeka. Iz tih su razloga tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata izrađene zasebno za prorede i pripremni sijek, a zasebno za naplodni i dovršni sijek. The {{subject of}} {{research}} was probability of appearance of technical roundwood timber assortments in trees according to type of felling, {{as well as}} the difference between shares of technical roundwood timber assortments according to diameter class and type of felling. The percentages of technical roundwood established in this research were compared to the planned values (assortment tables) which are applied in forestry operational bodies. Research was carried out on a sample consisting of 787 trees in thinning felling, 1025 trees in preparatory felling, 606 trees in <b>seeding</b> <b>felling</b> and 583 trees in final felling. An overall number of 3001 exemplary trees were included in the research. The age of the felling areas studied was between 59 and 91 years in the preliminary yield (thinning), 94 to 110 years in preparatory felling, 100 to 112 years in <b>seeding</b> <b>felling,</b> and 98 to 112 years in final felling areas. We think that the approach to establishing the assortment structure of even-aged beech stands taken so far is to a large extent wrong. The operative assortment tables give too high estimates of top quality timber assortments of all types of felling, except the final felling of seeding beech felling areas. Timber assortment tables that take into consideration the type of felling as one of the inputs, enable a more reliable estimate of assortment structure of the felling area and more precise planning of timber mass marked for felling. In this case, as a distinguishing factor, we took the selection criterion for marking trees for felling which is applied for the types up to, and including, the preparatory felling. For that reason, timber assortment tables were made separately for thinning and preparatory felling, and separately for seeding and final felling. On the basis of the research results, new assortment tables were made according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995. Seeding and final felling show by ca 8 – 14 % higher shares of top quality timber assortment (F and L) than thinning and preparatory felling. On the other side, thinning and preparatory felling show by ca 4 – 15 % higher shares of technical roundwood assortment of lower quality (second-class and third-class) than seeding and final felling...|$|E
40|$|Istraživana je čistoća i visina debla bukovih stabala, kao i postotni udio tehničke oblovine u deblima i krošnjama stabala s obzirom na prsni promjer, vrstu sijeka i primijenjenu normu za razvrstavanje tehničke oblovine. Čistoća debla definirana je kao dužina debla od perca do prve žive ili urasle grane, te ostalih grešaka koje nisu površinske naravi, a veće su od 15 % prsnog promjera. Visina debla definirana je kao dužina debla od perca do mjesta gdje se gubi jednostruka uzdužna os stabla, ili kao dužina debla od perca do prve deblje žive grane koja suvislo tvori krošnju. Prikrajanje i razvrstavanje (klasiranje) drvnih sortimenata tehničke oblovine izvršili smo prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma od 1995. godine (HRN) i hrvatskim normama HRN-EN 1316 - 1 : 1997. Na čistoću debla, pojavnost grešaka ima važan utjecaj. Pojavnost grešaka slučajnog je karaktera i nije u korelaciji ni sa jednim mjerljivim parametrom stabla. Iz tog razloga nismo uspjeli utvrditi čvršću vezu između čistoće debla i prsnog promjera stabla. Srednje vrijednosti visine debla po debljinskim stupnjevima rastu od proreda prema dovršnim sjekovima. Raspored srednjih visina debla po debljinskim stupnjevima i vrsti sijeka nije posljedica slučajnosti. Visina debla stabala u sastojini uvjetovana je nizom čimbenika. Raspored srednjih visina debla u sječinama određene vrste sijeka u velikoj je mjeri posljedica naših odluka kojima se rukovodimo prilikom odabira stabala za sječu pojedine vrsti sijeka. Postotni je udio tehničke oblovine u neto obujmu stabla kod primjene HRN-EN veći za stabla svih debljinskih stupnjeva. Utvrđena je razlika između udjela tehnike u deblu stabla kod proreda i pripremnog sijeka s jedne strane te naplodnih i dovršnih sjekova s druge strane. Udio tehničke oblovine debla raste od proreda prema pripremnim sjekovima. Srednje vrijednosti tehničke oblovine debla za cijeli uzorak primjernih stabala pokazuju linearnu ovisnost o debljinskim stupnjevima i padajući trend, koji je posljedica povećanja obujma tehničke oblovine izrađene iz krošnji s porastom prsnoga promjera stabala. Veće vrijednosti postotnih udjela tehničke oblovine u deblima stabala kod primjene HRN mogu se protumačiti većom količinom izrađene tehničke oblovine iz krošnji stabala pri primjeni HRN-EN. The {{subject of}} {{research}} were purity and height of beech trees, {{as well as}} the participation of technical roundwood in trunks and tree tops in relation to breast diameter and the type of felling. Research was carried out in the economic unit „Bjelovarska Bilogora“ of Forest Office Bjelovar, Forest Administration Bjelovar. Data gathering, i. e. measurement of exemplary beech trees was carried out in 36 areas on 46 occasions (fellings). All the areas belong to ecological-economical type II-D- 11 and structural class BEECH, with the rotation of 100 years, which participates {{in the area of the}} economic unit with 76. 1 %, and with 80. 6 % in its timber stock. Measurements of exemplary trees were made in relation to diameter class and the type of felling. Trunk purity was measured on 693 exemplary trees, of which 237 mere measured in the felling areas of preparatory felling, 139 in the areas of thinning felling, while 317 were measured in the areas of final felling. Trunk height was measured on samples including 787 trees in the areas of thinning felling, 788 trees in the areas of preparatory felling, 467 trees in the areas of <b>seeding</b> <b>felling</b> and 266 trees in the areas of final felling – a total of 2, 308 trees. Altogether, the research included 3, 001 exemplary trees. Trunk purity is defined as the length of trunk from the butt-end to the first live or ingrown branch, and other flaws which are not superficial, and take up more than 15 % of the breast diameter. Trunk height is defined as the length of trunk from the butt-end to the place where the single longitudinal axis of the tree disappears, or as the length of trunk from the butt-end to the first thicker live branch which coherently forms the top of the tree. Bucking and sorting (classification) of timber assortment of technical roundwood was carried out according to two standards: Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995 (HRN), and European Standards EN 1316 - 1 : 1997 (HRN-EN). Occurrence of flaws has crucial influence on trunk purity. Occurrence of faults is random in character and isn’t in correlation with any measurable tree parameter. For that reason we couldn’t establish a closer connection between trunk purity and breast diameter of tree. Average values of trunk height according to diameter class increase from thinning felling towards final felling. Thinning felling has an extremely falling (almost linear) trend of trunk height average with the increase of diameter class. The average values of trunk height of final felling show the highest values of all the diameter classes. Such distribution of average trunk height according to diameter class and the type of felling is not accidental. Trunk height of trees in the stand depends on a range of factors, from hereditary (genetic) predisposition of trees, over conditions of growth, to the position of trees in the stand. The distribution of average trunk heights in the felling areas of a certain type of felling is to a great extend a consequence of the decisions that we make during the selection of trees for felling in a particular type of felling. Because of their poor technical, (but not evolutionary) quality, forked trees are the first choice for assignation in thinning felling and preparatory felling. According to the European Standards, the participation of technical roundwood in the net tree volume is greater for trees of all diameter classes. The difference decreases with the increase of breast diameter of tree, and it ranges from over 20 % for the thinnest diameter classes to almost 5 % in the thickest diameter classes. Upon implementation of the two standards (HRN and HRN-EN), a difference was established between the participation of technical roundwood in the tree trunk in thinning and preparatory felling on one side, and seeding and final felling on the other side. Trend lines of average values of technical roundwood in the tree trunk of the thinning and preparatory felling have a falling and convex form, while the trend line form of the seeding and final felling is concave. Furthermore, we can conclude that the participation of technical roundwood of trunk increases from thinning felling towards preparatory felling. Average values of participation of technical roundwood of trunk of the whole sample of exemplary trees show a linear dependence on diameter class and the falling trend which is a consequence of the increased quantity of technical roundwood produced from the tree tops with the increase of the breast diameter. Higher participation of technical roundwood in tree trunks according to the Croatian Standards can be interpreted by larger amount of technical roundwood produced from tree tops according to the European Standards. This is the result of smaller minimal dimensions and higher tolerance of flaws for D quality class of technical roundwood according to the European Standards...|$|E

This script is a basic guideline for translation and recording in other languages. It should be adapted to different cultures and languages to make it relevant to each area where it is used. Some terms and concepts used may need a fuller explanation or even be omitted in different cultures. Script Text Jesus began to preach. Listen to what He told the people. One day a man went out to plant his garden. He scattered the seeds with his hands. Some <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> {{on the side of}} the path. The birds came and ate them. Some other <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> on stony ground only thinly covered with soil. These seeds grew quickly, but the roots could not go deep because of the stones. When the sun became hot, these plants dried up. The roots were not deep enough. Some other <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> among thorns and weeds. They grew up together. By and by the thorns became so thick that the plants could not grow any more. The plants never brought forth any good seeds. But some <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> into good ground. They grew well from the time they were small until they were big. Some plants brought forth 30 seeds; some had 60 seeds; some even had 100 seeds. Jesus said: "If you have ears, you ought to hear and understand this story! Jesus' friends said, "What does this story mean?" Jesus said, "The seed is the words of God. " They are the good news that God sends to all people. The ground is like the hearts of people who hear God's Word. Some people's hearts are hard like the ground {{on the side of the}} path. God's Word cannot penetrate them. For this reason Satan can steal the word away from them. Other people's hearts are like the stony ground. They are glad when they hear the story of God. They think that to be a Christian is easy. But when other people laugh at them or make trouble for them, they give up. Other people are like the ground where the thorns grew. They receive the Word of God, but they also love things of this life. They worry about many things instead of praying about them. They want to have a good time. At the finish they do not bear any seeds. But some people are like the good ground. These people hear God's Word and take it into their hearts. They obey it. Their lives show that they belong to God. They love Him with all their strength. They bear many seeds. Some of these good seeds are: Love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kindness, goodness, promise keeping, gentle behavior, control over desires (Gal. 5 : 22) and telling others about Jesus.

[...] "Her poor soul is so troubled {{for the preservation of}} her silly Mass that she knoweth not where to turn for defence of it," [...] says Randolph. {223a} These persecutions may have gone far to embitter the character of the victim.|$|R
60|$|In {{those days}} {{you were not}} a Federalist or a Democrat, you were an Aristocrat or a Jacobin. The French parties were our parties; the French issue, our issue. Under the {{patronage}} of that saint of American Jacobinism, Thomas Jefferson, a Jacobin society was organized in Philadelphia,--special guardians of Liberty. And flying on the March winds over the mountains the <b>seed</b> <b>fell</b> on the black soil of Kentucky: Lexington had its Jacobin society, Danville and Louisville likewise their patrons and protectors of the Rights of Mankind. Federalists were not guillotined in Kentucky {{in the summer of}} 1793, but I might mention more than one who was shot.|$|R

In the case of 38 ～ 76 kg/ 10 a fertilizer supplied, (Correspond to 3 ～ 6 kg/ 10 a nitrogen supply) 10 % chlorine contents repressed the germination ratio about 10 % lower than control. To keep higher germination tatio of the barley than 65 % and natural growth of bud, did not serve chlorine much more than 8 kg/ 10 a (when 38 kg/ 10 a fertilized) or 3 kg/ 10 a (when 76 kg/ 10 a fertilized) ...|$|R
40|$|The seed rain of Populus euphratica in Ejina Oasis was {{continuously}} {{studied in}} the years of 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008. The duration of P. euphratica seed rain in a community was usually 2 to 3 weeks, with a peak period of 7 to 14 days. Approximately 90 % {{of the total number}} of seeds were dispersed in the peak period, and for a single day most <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> between the hours of 10 : 00 to 16 : 00. It was found that the seed rain of P. euphratica was determined by a combination of biological rhythms and weather conditions. Wind speed and atmospheric humidity were the two main meteorological factors influencing seed dispersal. More <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> when there was higher wind speed and lower RH. After we completed our comprehensive study of the P. euphratica seed rain, temporal heterogeneity was found not only in different populations but also in different individuals, and not only in different phases of the seed rain but also in different times of the day. P. euphratica extends its seed rain season by these different kinds of temporal heterogeneity to ensure some propagules survive and germinate when floods occur. Furthermore, marked inter-annual fluctuation in the seed rain exists in P. euphratica in the study area. Finally, in relation to the water supply for P. euphratica in Ejina in recent years, we concluded that there is no dislocation in time of water supply and the seed rain of P. euphratica in Ejina Oasis, and the reason for the failure of sexual reproduction of P. euphratica may lie in the human disturbances of channeling and the cement lining of the channels...|$|R
