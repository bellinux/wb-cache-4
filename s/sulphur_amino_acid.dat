40|$|Soya beans, {{like other}} legumes, contain low {{concentrations}} of the nutritionally essential <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> methionine. Cysteine, although not an {{essential amino acid}} {{because it can be}} synthesized from methionine, also influences the nutritional quality of soya bean products when it is only present in low levels. A low cysteine content will also aggravate a methionine deficiency. Soya bean lines deficient in 7 S protein subunits have been identified. The 7 S proteins contain substantially less methionine and cysteine than the 11 S proteins. With the myriad of genetic null alleles for these subunits {{it may be possible to}} tailor the 7 S/ 11 S storage protein ratio and their total composition in seeds to include only those subunits with the richest <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> composition.

40|$|SUMMARY Three {{patients}} with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency who developed progressive generalised dystonia are described. Although cerebrovascular thrombosis is usually {{thought to be}} responsible for neurological dysfunction in homocystinuric patients, neuro-pathological studies in one case and clinical and radiological evidence in the other two suggested that dystonia was not caused by brain infarction. Movement disorder associated with homo-cystinuria may result from the neurochemical changes in the basal ganglia related to the inherited defect in <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism. Several inherited defects of <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism may result in homocystinuria (HCU). The commonest is a recessively inherited deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase leading to impaired transformation of homocysteine to cys-tathionine and elevated levels of plasma homocystine and methionine. ' (fig 1). The biochemical abnormal-ities in some patients are responsive to administration of pyridoxine. 2 Clinical features of HCU include skeletal abnormality, lens dislocation and spontane-ous arterial and venous thromboses. Neurological involvement may occur in the form of cerebral throm-botic episodes, seizures and mental retardation. 3 ' 6 The majority of {{patients with}} juvenile or adult onset dystonia do not have associated neurological disorders and pathological or neurochemical abnor-malities are seldom demonstrated. However, symp-tomatic dystonia may be seen in association with a variety of inherited and acquired neurological condi-tions. 7 Dystonia due to HCU has been described in two previous cases 8 9 and was attributed to multiple basal ganglia infarcts although pathological and neu-roradiological data were not available.

40|$|Background Tuberculosis is a {{world wide}} {{pandemic}} and {{a major problem for}} people in low income countries. The intracellular infection has a bidirectional link with under nutrition, and wasting is a common symptom of the disease. Wasting in tuberculosis patients is associated with the severity of lung disease, low serum level of selenium and higher mortality. Low serum levels may be due to low intake or high body consumption of the components. No assessment of intake of selenium and <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> has been done in tuberculosis patients. Objective The main objective is to calculate and compare the intake of selenium and <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in tuberculosis patients and appropriately matched healthy adults. Methodology Participants did a one day interactive 24 hour recall at their home together with a structured questionnaire about socio economic status. Results were compared on group level. Local food was collected and analysed with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy for selenium content. 7 local samples were collected and analysed for <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and compared to Kenyan and South African food composition tables. The intake was calculated on this basis. Result There {{was no significant difference in}} intake of selenium and <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> by the two groups. Both TB patients and healthy controls had a low intake of selenium and an adequate intake of <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Controls ate more staple food but had a lower diversity in the diet than the cases. TB patients had a significant lower body mass index than the healthy controls. Conclusion This study indicates that the deficiencies of selenium and thiols in serum found in earlier studies may not entirely be due to a low intake of selenium and <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the concentration of the nutritionally essential <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in seed protein, a transgene encoding a methionine- and cysteine-rich protein, sunflower seed albumin (SSA), was transferred to chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L). Transgenic seeds that accumulated SSA contained more methionine and less oxidized sulphur than the controls, suggesting that additional demand for <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> from {{the expression of the}} transgene stimulated sulphur assimilation. In addition, the activity of trypsin inhibitors, a known family of endogenous, sulphur-rich chickpea seed proteins, was diminished in transgenic, SSA-containing seeds compared with the nontransgenic controls. Together, these results indicate that the reduced sulphur sequestered into SSA was supplied partly by additional sulphur assimilation in the developing transgenic seeds, and partly by some diversion of <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> from endogenous seed proteins. Growth of chickpeas on nutrient with a high sulphur-to-nitrogen ratio increased the total seed sulphur content and the accumulation of <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in the seeds, and partly mitigated the effect of SSA accumulation on the trypsin inhibitor amount. The results suggest that free methionine and O-acetylserine (OAS) acted as signals that modulated chickpea seed protein composition in response to the variation in sulphur demand, as well as in response to variation in the nitrogen and sulphur status of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin B 12 -dependent {{methionine}} synthase is {{an important}} enzyme for <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> folate polyamine metabolism, S-adenosylmethionine metabolism {{and also in the}} methylation pathway of DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids. Consequently, studies aiming at exploring the control and regulation of methionine synthase are of particular interest. Here we report the modulation of enzyme activity in vitro by polyamines. Although putrescine, cadaverine, spermine and spermidine all stimulated enzyme activity, the last two were the most potent, causing increases in enzyme activity up to 400 %. The EC 50 for spermine was determined as 8 microM and for spermidine 40 microM. The physiological concentration for spermine has been reported to be 15 - 19 microM. Spermine was found to increase both the Km and the V(max) with respect to methyltetrahydrofolate for the enzyme. These data support the hypothesis that spermine and spermidine are feedback regulators of methionine synthase both in vivo and in vitro and are consistent with the polyamines' regulating cell signalling pathways...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the dietary}} {{management}} of severe acute malnutrition in children, {{there is evidence}} to support the WHO Manual's protocol of cautious feeding of a low energy and protein formula with small frequent feeds in the initial phase of treatment, particularly in kwashiorkor. However, this initial milk diet (WHO F- 75) might benefit from increasing the <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> phosphorus and potassium content and reducing the lactose content, but further studies are needed. Careful tube-feeding results in faster initial recovery and weight gain, but has a significant risk of aspiration in poorly supervised settings. Ready-to-use therapeutic food is an important recent advance in the dietary management of malnutrition in ambulatory settings, allowing more effective prevention programmes and earlier discharge from hospital where community follow-up is available. It should be included in future protocols. There is very good evidence on the use of micronutrients such as zinc, and preliminary evidence suggests that smaller doses of daily vitamin A are preferable to a single large dose on admission for severe malnutrition...|$|E

The membrane stabilizing, free radical scavenging, and osmoregulatory roles of taurine have been well documented.

40|$|A {{trade-off}} between immunity {{and growth}} has repeatedly been suggested, mainly based on laboratory and poultry science, {{but also from}} experiments where parasitism intensity was manipulated in field bird populations. However, as resource allocation to different activities (or organs) during growth is difficult to manipulate, this trade-off has only been experimentally tested by studying the effects of non-pathogenic antigens. By providing some nestling magpies (Pica pica) with methionine, a <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> that specifically enhances T-cell immune response in chickens, we investigated this trade-off by directly affecting allocation of limited resources during growth. Results {{were in accordance with}} the hypothetical trade-off because nestlings fed with methionine showed a lower growth rate during the four days of methionine administration, but a larger response when fledglings were challenged with phytohaemagglutinin (a measure of the intensity of T-lymphocyte-mediated immune responsiveness) than control nestlings. Surprisingly, we found that control and experimental nestlings fledged with similar body mass, size and condition, but experimental nestlings suffered less from blood parasites (Haemoproteus) and had fewer lymphocytes (a widely used measure of health status) than control nestlings, suggesting a negative effect of blood parasites or other pathogens on nestling growth...|$|E
40|$|Homocysteine is a non-protein-forming <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{that plays}} an {{important}} role in remethylation and trans-sulphuration processes. In recent years, a high plasma homocysteine concentration has been implied as a possible pathophysiological factor in atherosclerosis and artery and deep vein thrombosis, probably through generation of H(2) O(2), enhanced platelet activity and increased production of macrophage-derived tissue factor. Furthermore, an increase of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activity mediated by homocysteine-generated H(2) O(2) has also been reported. Because some preliminary experimental results in our laboratory did not confirm this effect of homocysteine on PMNs, we investigated the effect of homocysteine on the activity of PMNs, measured by their luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. Moreover, we also studied the effect of homocysteine in a luminol-hypochlorite chemiluminescent system. Our results clearly indicate that homocysteine at micromol/L concentrations (10 - 100 micromol/L) slightly inhibits neutrophil chemiluminescence, while it strongly inhibits the luminescence of the luminol-hypochlorite system. Therefore, the hypothesis that homocysteine induces an increase of H(2) O(2) -mediated neutrophil activity is not supported and, probably, the common opinion that views the H(2) O(2) generated by homocysteine as a possible mechanism for cardiovascular damage should be reconsidered...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{concentrations}} of several plasma amino acids increase in obesity. Notably, plasma total {{concentrations of}} the <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> cysteine (tCys) are linearly associated with fat mass in large population studies. Animal and cellular experiments support {{the concept that}} cysteine may be obesogenic. Here we review experimental and epidemiologic findings linking cysteine and related compounds with fat regulation and obesity. RECENT FINDINGS: tCys, {{and to a lesser}} extent cystathionine, are the only plasma sulphur amino acids consistently associated with human obesity, whereas glutathione is inversely associated with BMI. Supplementing cyste(i) ne in rodents decreases energy expenditure and promotes adiposity, whereas defects of cysteine-synthesizing enzymes decrease body weight. In adipocytes, cysteine inhibits lipolysis and promotes lipogenesis via H 2 O 2 production. Unlike most plasma amino acids, tCys levels do not decrease with gastric bypass-induced weight loss, further supporting the concept that elevated cysteine may be a cause, not a consequence of obesity. Although cysteine products (glutathione, taurine and H 2 S) are altered in obesity, they do not appear to explain cysteine's effects on body weight. SUMMARY: Cellular, animal and epidemiologic data are consistent with the view that cysteine is obesogenic. Targeted research linking in-vitro and in-vivo findings is needed to elucidate mechanisms involved...|$|E

None of the concentrations of hydrazine were overtly cytotoxic in hepatocyte suspensions (measured as lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] leakage) after 3 hr. However, after 24 hr in culture cells treated with 12 mM, hydrazine showed a significant increase in LDH leakage. Methionine synthase activity was reduced by hydrazine (8 and 12 mM) in suspensions (by 45 and 55 %, after 3 hr) and monolayers (12 mM; 65 - 80 % after 24 hr). This was not due to nitric oxide production and the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, failed to protect against the hydrazine-induced loss of ATP and GSH and the reduction in urea synthesis at 24 hr. Homocysteine export was increased by 6 mM hydrazine, and total taurine content of treated cells was increased by 12 mM hydrazine.

Soaking grass pea in water before cooking roughly halved the risk of neurolathyrism but cooking in clay utensils more than quadrupled it.

Increases in GCL activity in rat liver, as well as in HepG 2 cells, were due to the additive effects of changes in the amount of GCLC and the kcat for GCLC.

Furthermore, our results indicate that the GCLM level in rat liver is always limiting and that up-regulation of the GCLM level results in increased holoenzyme formation and an increase in the kcat.

The culture of chondrocytes taken from a pork articular cartilage was used for the study of aggrecan production. The monolayer culture method offers the model system which has enabled us to watch the aggrecan production into growth medium. The aggrecan synthesis was stimulated in the media with addition of L-methionin, L-serin and sodium selenite pentahydrate. Methionin and serin are antecedents of <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> of cysteine, whose role is incredibly important for the correct function of core protein. Growth media and chondrocytes were analysed {{with the help of the}} automatic amino acids analyzer unit after acid or oxidative hydrolysis. The analyse established the amino acid representation. The main attention was paid to cysteine. The changing concentrations of this amino acid were showing if the antecedents in the addition are used for its production and, therefore, if it is possible to stimulate the production of core protein with these antecedents. The results are discussed in the conclusion of this thesis. The next step should be the detection of the concentration of synthesized aggrecan by the immunological method. Presently this method is very expensive. Therefore, the method of setting the core protein of aggrecan with the help of suitable amino acid was used for the first tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of processing (alcoholic extraction, fermentation and germination) on protein quality of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L. var. Troll and Emir) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. var. Aroito) flours. Second, the effect of semolina supplementation with the processed legume flours on protein quality of pasta was also evaluated. For protein quality evaluation amino acid composition and chemical score (CS) were determined in raw and processed legume flours as well as cooked semolina pasta supplemented and non-supplemented with processed legumes. Alcoholic extraction did not cause important changes in the amino acid profile of lupin seeds. Certainly, <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> content of ethanol extracted lupin flours was reduced but levels remained similar to those usually found in other legumes. However, fermentation and germination of pigeon pea seeds improved some essential amino acids and slight changes in CS indexes were observed. Moreover, semolina supplementation with processed lupin and pigeon pea flours improved protein quality of pasta {{as a result of}} higher CS and EAA levels compared to the control cooked semolina pasta. Therefore, ethanol extracted lupin, as well as fermented and germinated pigeon pea seeds are suitable protein sources for formulating new pasta productsThe authors are indebted to the Spanish Comision Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología (CICYT) for the financial support of projects AGL 2002 - 02905 /ALI and AGL 2004 - 0886 /A.

40|$|Total and soluble nitrogen, {{protein and}} non-protein -nitrogen was {{determined}} {{as well as}} the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> composition of the caryopses of ten rye varieties including three bred in Poland and cultivated on a commercial scale: 'Dańkowskie Złote', 'Dańkowskie Selekcyjne' and 'Borkowskie Tetra'. and seven foreign varieties characterized by a high total protein content (11. 9 - 16. 4 % in dry weight). In the varieties examined the amount of protein nitrogen increased in the same degree as did the content of total nitrogen. The <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> limiting the nutritive value of the protein in rye caryopses were mostly lysine and methionine, and in the varieties with high protein content tryptophan. The low-protein varieties had a relatively higher content of lysine, <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> tryptophan and other <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (as % of protein) than the high protein ones, but their absolute <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> content (as % of dry weight) was lower...|$|R
40|$|The <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{compositions}} of flours {{made from}} cotyledons and whole {{seeds of the}} disease-resistant, stable and high-yielding chickpea cv. H 75 - 35, known locally as Gaurav, were analysed. These and similar analyses of the albumin, globulin, legumin and vicilin protein fractions were {{compared with those of}} other legumes. Seed protein content was 19. 8 % with globulin constituting 62. 4 % of the total seed protein. The ratios of albumin to globulin and legumin to vicilin were 1 : 4 and 6 : 1, resp. The proportion of basic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> was low in the albumin and high in the globulin. The legumin fraction was superior in terms of total essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> to those from other sources. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were the most limiting, followed by tryptophan or threonine depending on the fraction,but the ratio of methionine to cystine was high (2. 76 : 1).

40|$|A {{scheme is}} {{described}} for the fractionation of pea (Pisum sativum) albumin proteins. By using this scheme, two closely related major albumin proteins have been isolated and purified to homogeneity. The larger protein, designated PMA-L, has Mr approximately 53 000 {{and consists of}} two 25 000 -Mr subunits, whereas the smaller, PMA-S, has Mr approximately 48 000 and contains two 24 000 -Mr subunits. There {{was no evidence of}} mixed dimers of the two subunit sizes, despite their close homology as judged by immunological crossreaction, <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> composition, N-terminal <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> tryptic-peptide mapping and CNBr-cleavage products. Both proteins contained significant amounts of <b>sulphur</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> The proteins were shown to be located in the soluble cytosol fraction of cotyledon cells and are not significantly degraded on seed germination. Preliminary screening indicates the presence of homologous major albumin proteins in at least three different, though closely related, legume species...|$|R
