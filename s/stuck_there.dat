5|$|It is {{revealed}} in The King of Fighters XIV that Ash is trapped in time vortex, with an entity known as Verse enveloping him. It is later also revealed that Verse, along with an unnamed blue creature, whose half of their power fragments somehow implanted into young Shun'ei, was created from Ash's result on changing his timeline back in the previous last tournament, creating an timeline interferences, and resulting Samurai Shodowns Nakoruru travels to the present and <b>stuck</b> <b>there,</b> along with a time-displaced Mui Mui of Dragon Gal and Love Heart of Sky Love. The new tournament participant, Kukri of Official Invitation Team, is hired by Elisabeth to find Ash's whereabout. With Verse's defeat as his reality manipulation energy spreads around worldwide, Kukri and Elisabeth finally find Ash alive.|$|E
5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|Although Gambier had no {{intention}} of risking his fleet in the narrow waters of Basque Roads, he had permitted three more transports to be fitted out as fireships, and at 17:30 these were led into the anchorage by Stopford in Caesar, accompanied by Theseus and several launches quipped to fire Congreve rockets. At 19:40 however Caesar grounded on a shoal and remained <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> until 22:30, close to Valiant, which had also grounded at low tide. At this point six surviving French ships; Océan, four of the line and the frigate Indienne, remained aground close to the mouth of the Charente, while the remainder of the fleet had escaped upriver to secure anchorages. During the night the wind blew from the land, rendering a fireship attack impractical, and so the British contented themselves with setting Ville de Varsouvie and Aquilon on fire, both ships determined by John Bligh on Valiant, over Cochrane's objections, to have been damaged beyond repair. During this operation, one of the new fireships was wrecked on a shoal. The weather was so bad that night that the planned attack with the remaining fireships was abandoned as unfeasible.|$|E

25|$|The ninth {{round of}} the season was the European Grand Prix and Montoya held pole for most of {{qualifying}} only for both Michael and Ralf Schumacher to bump him down to third in the final seconds. At {{the start of the}} race, he kept third and ran three seconds behind the two leaders. After the first round of stops, the two leaders came ahead of the one-stopping David Coulthard but Montoya came behind. He was <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> for five laps and it cost him three seconds. He was forced to settle for third and that became second when Ralf was given a ten-second, stop-and-go penalty for a pitlane infringement. Montoya finished in second, and the result gave him more confidence than ever.|$|E
25|$|Aurobindo {{asserted}} that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, {{and freedom from}} normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.|$|E
25|$|The harsh {{climate and}} mountainous terrain of the Carpathians caused many {{logistical}} problems and caused the 2nd Army {{to suffer from}} a supply shortage. The spread of disease and the cold temperatures also took their toll on the Habsburg troops. Due {{to a change in}} weather the offensive was delayed until late February. The 2nd Army launched its assault on the same positions that the 3rd Army attacked last month, along the strategic roads leading to Przemyśl fortress, but on a narrower front. Its objective was to liberate the besieged garrison at Przemyśl, which had been <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> since Russia occupied Galicia in 1914. Although they received additional units the battle, the 2nd Army troops were unable to break through the Russian defenses and were pushed back by counterattacks. It sustained heavy losses in the process. The VII Corps under Archduke Joseph August dwindled to just 2,000 men. The Austro-Hungarians continued to fight throughout March, and chief of general staff Franz Conrad von Hotzendorf ordered the V Corps – the unit closest to Przemyśl – to liberate the fortress. Although the fortress garrison had surrendered after a failed break-out attempt on March 19, the 2nd Army was not informed, and so the offensive was attempted. The V Corps ended up being driven back with enormous losses. By the end of the campaign, the 2nd and 3rd Armies were nearly annihilated.|$|E

500|$|... "Lady Bouvier's Lover" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The episode {{was inspired by the}} fact that The Simpsons has many elderly characters, which the writers felt was unique for network television, so they sought to highlight those characters. Originally, the episode was supposed to be about Misery. One of the ideas was that Grampa would get injured on Mr. Burns's property and get <b>stuck</b> <b>there,</b> leading Grampa to think that Mr. Burns would kill him when he was discovered there. However, this idea was cut out in production because the script was over 85 pages long.|$|E
500|$|Judge Snyder {{is about}} to convict Bart when Principal Skinner bursts through the doors, disheveled and unshaven, and {{explains}} that neither Bart nor the mobsters assaulted him. Rather, when Fat Tony and his henchmen had come to his office meekly, Principal Skinner had yelled at them to not interfere with student discipline, and they left sheepishly. After Principal Skinner returned to his house, he became trapped beneath tons of old newspapers in his garage, and was <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> for over a week, until {{he was able to}} escape. Bart is cleared of all charges, despite the counsel for the prosecution unsuccessfully trying to convince the Judge to strike Principal Skinner's speech from the record. Fat Tony tells Bart {{that he did not want}} to get him into any trouble on his behalf, but Bart decides to resign after learning that [...] "crime doesn't pay".|$|E
500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|E

MI5 was afraid that Christie had a spy in Britain's top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park.

Healy reportedly {{took one look at}} Jerry, who had long chestnut red locks and a handlebar mustache, and remarked that he did not look like he was funny. Jerry left the room and returned a few moments later with his head shaved (though his mustache remained for a time), and then quipped [...] "Boy, do I look girly." [...] Healy heard [...] "Curly", and the name <b>stuck.</b> (<b>There</b> are varying accounts as to how the Curly character actually came about.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} later used in March 1984 by Gay Bryant. She was the {{former editor of}} Working Woman {{magazine}} and was changing jobs to be the editor of Family Circle.

2500|$|Beauvoir {{writes that}} [...] "to ask two spouses bound by practical, {{social and moral}} ties to satisfy each other sexually for their whole lives is pure absurdity". She {{describes}} the work of married women, including housecleaning, writing that it is [...] "holding away death but also refusing life". She thinks, [...] "what makes the lot of the wife-servant ungratifying is {{the division of labor}} that dooms her wholly to the general and inessential". Beauvoir writes that a woman finds her dignity only in accepting her vassalage which is bed [...] "service" [...] and housework [...] "service". A woman is weaned away from her family and finds only [...] "disappointment" [...] on the day after her wedding. Beauvoir points out various inequalities between a wife and husband and finds they pass the time not in love but in [...] "conjugal love". She thinks that marriage [...] "almost always destroys woman". She quotes Sophia Tolstoy who wrote in her diary: [...] "you are <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> forever and there you must sit". Beauvoir thinks marriage is a perverted institution oppressing both men and women.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1937, he took a trial trip, heading south from Moscow to Baku on the Caspian Sea. [...] The Intourist {{official}} tried to dissuade him, but he found a ship {{to take him to}} Lenkoran (Lankaran, Azerbaijan), where he witnessed the deportation of several hundred Turko-Tartar peasants to Central Asia. <b>Stuck</b> <b>there</b> for a few days, he bargained for horses with which to explore the countryside, and was arrested by the NKVD cavalry near to the Persian border. [...] He explained that he held diplomatic immunity, but his captors could not read his Soviet diplomatic pass. Eventually, as the only person literate in Russian, Maclean [...] "read out, with considerable expression, and such improvements as occurred to me" [...] the contents of his pass, and was set free. He took an 1856 paddle steamer back to Baku, and then a train on to Tiflis (Tbilisi, Georgia). British troops had supported the Democratic Republic after World War I, and Maclean sought out the British war cemetery, in the process discovering an English governess who had lived in the town since 1912. [...] He caught a truck through the Caucasus mountains, via Mtzkhet (Mtskheta), the former capital of Georgia but by then merely a village, to Vladikavkaz (capital of North Ossetia), and then a train to Moscow.|$|E
2500|$|Decatur {{immediately}} {{met with}} disaster. He had ordered gunboats as harbor pilots {{to mark the}} safe passage across the bar with anchored boats {{at the mouth of}} the harbor, but they failed to do so properly. President grounded on the bar and remained <b>stuck</b> <b>there</b> for almost two hours, enduring a pounding from the wind and heavy sea. Decatur claimed that by the time the frigate worked free it was heavily damaged: some copper was stripped away from the hull; the masts were twisted and some of them [...] "sprung," [...] i.e. had developed long cracks; and the hull was twisted and [...] "hogged," [...] i.e. the bow and stern sagged. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of the hogging when's when the ship was surveyed on its arrival in Britain, although damage to the copper and pintles was recorded. Furthermore, President's sailing performance was not hampered by the grounding as she managed to outsail every ship in the squadron including the fast Leda class frigate Tenedos, with the exception of Endymion which was considered the [...] "Fastest ship in the Royal Navy" [...] which logged speeds faster than the clipper ship Rainbow 1845. Furthermore, Endymion excelled in light winds such as those in which the chase was held. Although her accompanying vessels headed for safety, Decatur claimed it impossible for President to return to port as the gale was still blowing. The logs from the British squadron claimed the gale had stopped, though strong winds persisted. It was unlikely that the open [...] gunboats could have been safely put out to mark a passage if the gale had persisted also suggesting the gale had stopped. Decatur claimed was forced to put to sea. Whether he truly could not wait out the storm was not clear, but given the strong westerly winds, what appeared to be the best decision would be to put out to sea. He headed east, keeping close to the Long Island shore before heading southeast.|$|E
