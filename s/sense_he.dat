5|$|Aristotle {{did not do}} {{experiments}} in the modern <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> used the ancient Greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures, such as (in Generation of Animals) finding a fertilised hen's egg of a suitable stage and opening it {{so as to be}} able to see the embryo's heart inside.|$|E
5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the <b>sense</b> <b>he</b> looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this <b>sense</b> <b>he</b> tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{face had}} a {{hardness}} {{that he did}} not know. He perceived dimly that she was different from the Gyp of this hour yesterday--the last time when, in possession of his <b>senses,</b> <b>he</b> had seen or spoken to her. The novelty of her revolt stirred him in strange ways, wounded his self-conceit, inspired a curious fear, and yet excited his <b>senses.</b> <b>He</b> came up to her, said softly: ...|$|R

5|$|William Beebe {{was more}} {{famous in the}} United States than any other American naturalist prior {{to the days of}} television. As a {{scientific}} writer who participated in both the popular and academic worlds, he occupied a similar role to the role later occupied by Stephen Jay Gould. Beebe was a well-known figure in the Roaring Twenties of New York City, and was friends with numerous other well-known figures of the period, including Fannie Hurst and the cartoonist Rube Goldberg. Although he was not physically handsome in the traditional <b>sense,</b> <b>he</b> tended to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence and charisma. As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.|$|E
25|$|Lee was re-elected {{regularly}} by huge margins even as {{he managed}} to become embroiled in controversy. Defying every notion of political good <b>sense,</b> <b>he</b> unabashedly - and often indelicately - took stands considered taboo by most politicians. His shoot-from-the-hip style often made his closest advisers cringe even as it endeared him to voters.|$|E
25|$|Lex Luthor - The {{owner of}} the villain's bar, likes monologues and isn't trusted {{by any of the}} other villains. He has a {{tendency}} to create new grammars that doesn't make <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> installed cameras all over the Heroes' and Villain bar to spy on everyone, commented to have bought Google Earth.|$|E

25|$|In his ruling, Justice Cooperman {{stated that}} {{testimony}} by Guzman and Benefield {{did not make}} <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> also cited {{the fact that they}} had a pending $50,000,000 lawsuit against the city. After the ruling was made, the family, led by Sharpton and several others, went to Bell's graveside in Port Washington, Long Island for a memorial service.|$|E
25|$|In a wider <b>sense,</b> <b>he</b> was {{influential}} in three respects. Firstly his night scenes were highly original. His lighting effects in general were very subtle, and {{very different from}} those of Caravaggio. He often uses as many as five different sources of light, and graduates the light relatively gently, with the less well-lit parts of the composition often containing important parts of it.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} part of his book is {{about the nature of}} genius. Weininger argues {{that there is no such}} thing as a person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.|$|E

25|$|Producer David Puttnam {{was looking}} for a story in the mold of A Man for All Seasons (1966), {{regarding}} someone who follows his conscience, and felt sports provided clear situations in this <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> discovered Eric Liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon a reference book on the Olympics while housebound from the flu in a rented house in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} section of Analysis Situs, Poincaré defines a {{manifold}} as the level set of a continuously differentiable function between Euclidean spaces that satisfies the nondegeneracy hypothesis of the implicit function theorem. In the third section, he begins by remarking that the graph of a continuously differentiable function is a manifold in the latter <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> then proposes a new, more general, definition of manifold based on a 'chain of manifolds' (une chaîne des variétés).|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} of the story are also found in Greek mythology as well. The story is attested in the legend of Zeus slaying the hundred-headed Typhon from Hesiod's Theogony, {{but it is also}} in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra by Heracles and the slaying of Python by Apollo. The story of Heracles's theft of the cattle of Geryon is probably also related. Although Heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional <b>sense,</b> <b>he</b> bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and a knack for violence and gluttony.|$|E

25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things {{in a way that}} he never would have thought if he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful <b>sense</b> <b>he</b> has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October, the {{prosecution}} called Dr. Paul Bowden {{to testify in}} rebuttal of the psychiatrists who had testified for the defence counsel. Prior to Nilsen's trial, Dr. Bowden had interviewed the defendant on 16 separate occasions in interviews totalling over 14 hours. Over two days, Dr. Bowden testified that, although he found Nilsen to be abnormal in a colloquial <b>sense,</b> <b>he</b> had concluded Nilsen to be a manipulative individual who had been capable of forming relationships, but had forced himself to objectify people. Refuting the testimony of Dr. MacKeith and Dr. Gallwey, Bowden further testified he had {{found no evidence of}} maladaptive behaviour, and that Nilsen suffered from no disorder of the mind.|$|E
25|$|Even before {{becoming}} {{a president of the}} American Economic Association, Galbraith was considered as an iconoclast by many economists. This is partly because he rejected the technical analysis and mathematical modelling of neoclassical economics as being divorced from reality. Following Thorstein Veblen, he believed that economic activity could not be distilled into inviolable laws, but rather was a complex product of the cultural and political milieu in which it occurs. In particular, he posited that important factors, such as the separation between corporate ownership and management, oligopoly, and the influence of government and military spending had been largely neglected by most economists because they are not amenable to axiomatic descriptions. In this <b>sense,</b> <b>he</b> worked as much in political economy as in classical economics.|$|E

25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> thinks this position was what John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I {{will argue that the}} Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E
25|$|Reese (Justin Berfield): Hal and Lois' second son. He is {{the older}} brother of Malcolm, Dewey, and Jamie, and younger brother of Francis. Reese is the most {{impulsive}} and physical of the boys. He lacks common <b>sense,</b> <b>he</b> is frequently outwitted and outspoken by other family members, and is gleefully violent. Despite being unwilling to think, Reese {{is as much a}} genius as his brothers, although in less traditional or obvious ways. Reese is better than Malcolm at devising plans, and is masterful at the rare things which can pin his drifting focus, such as driving, or when he's revealed to be a Culinary prodigy, excelling at cooking and baking. In the series finale, he finally graduates from high school after intentionally failing many times before, he obtained full employment as a high school custodian, and shares an apartment with Craig.|$|E
25|$|A. L. Goodhart, Professor at Oxford, {{opposed the}} view that, because the judges were {{appointed}} by the victors, the Tribunal was not impartial {{and could not be}} regarded as a court in the true <b>sense.</b> <b>He</b> wrote: Attractive as this argument may sound in theory, it ignores the fact that it runs counter to the administration of law in every country. If it were true then no spy could be given a legal trial, because his case is always heard by judges representing the enemy country. Yet no one has ever argued that in such cases it was necessary to call on neutral judges. The prisoner has the right to demand that his judges shall be fair, but not that they shall be neutral. As Lord Writ has pointed out, the same principle is applicable to ordinary criminal law because 'a burglar cannot complain that he is being tried by a jury of honest citizens'.|$|E
