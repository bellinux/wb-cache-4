5|$|Metformin SR (<b>slow</b> <b>release)</b> or XR (extended release) was {{introduced}} in 2004. It is available in 500, 750, and 1000-mg strengths, mainly to counteract common gastrointestinal side effects, {{as well as to}} increase compliance by reducing pill burden. No difference in effectiveness exists between the two preparations.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E

5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{different}} carbon sources on growth {{and production of}} antifungal agent(s) by Gymnopilus spectabilis were investigated. Different carbon sources including; Glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, manitol and sucrose at the concentration of 10 g/l and <b>slow</b> <b>releasing</b> carbon sources including malt extract and soluble starch at the concentration of 2 g/l were used. Inhibition of spore germination of Aspergillus niger {{was used to test}} antifungal activity. The results showed that the highest activity (90 % inhibition of spore germination) and biomass concentration (2. 4 g/l) were obtained when glucose was used as carbon source. Other media with different carbon sources showed antifungal activity ranging from 30 % to 70 % inhibition of spore germination. Combination of glucose with malt extract as a <b>slow</b> <b>releasing</b> carbon source was also increased activity to 100 % inhibition...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} was conducted based on damage developed on pine nursery, which killed pine seedlings at a significant number. The damage started on 4 month-aged seedlings indicated by yellowing of needle, followed by development of brown {{spots on the}} needle and subsequently could kill the transplanted seedlings. Application of formulated Trichoderma and <b>slow</b> <b>released</b> fertilizer was aimed to avoid the initial symptom, which was assumed due to nutrient deficiency and to control the subsequent infection and disease development. Substitution of composting materials and rice hull into regular growth medium as the main treatment resulted 4 combination treatments. The results indicated that despite all treatments showed significant effects, application of Trichoderma together with <b>slow</b> <b>released</b> fertilizer (PJTJ) on regular medium (medium IV) gave the highest growth increment performance and suppression of damage in seedlings...|$|R

25|$|Researchers {{attribute}} copper’s {{resistance to}} biofouling, even in temperate waters, to two possible mechanisms: 1) a retarding sequence of colonization through <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> of copper ions during the corrosion process, thereby inhibiting the attachment of microbial layers to marine surfaces; and/or, 2) separating layers that contain corrosive products and the larvae of macro-encrusting organisms. The latter mechanism deters {{the settlement of}} pelagic larval stages on the metal surface, rather than killing the organisms.|$|E

25|$|In agriculture, {{clinoptilolite}} (a {{naturally occurring}} zeolite) {{is used as}} a soil treatment. It provides a source of slowly released potassium. If previously loaded with ammonium, the zeolite can serve a similar function in the <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> of nitrogen. Zeolites can also act as water moderators, in which they will absorb up to 55% of their weight in water and slowly release it under the plant's demand. This property can prevent root rot and moderate drought cycles.|$|E

25|$|Beta {{cells in}} the islets of Langerhans release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly {{triggered}} in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of type2 diabetes. First-phase release and insulin sensitivity are independent predictors of diabetes.|$|E

25|$|Nifedipine, {{sold under}} the brand names Adalat among others, is a {{medication}} used to manage angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud's phenomenon, and premature labor. It {{is one of}} the treatments of choice for Prinzmetal angina. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lungs and time to transfer the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery.

25|$|Vasodilators – {{calcium channel}} blockers, {{such as the}} dihydropyridines {{nifedipine}} or amlodipine, preferably <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> preparations – are often first line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema; {{but these are not}} typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Peoples whose RP is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to there being too much blood.|$|E
25|$|Potentially {{unstable}} methane deposits {{exists in}} permafrost regions, which {{are expected to}} retreat {{as a result of}} global warming, and also clathrates, with the clathrate effect probably taking millennia to fully act. The potential role of methane from clathrates in near-future runaway scenarios is not certain, as studies show a <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> of methane, which may not be regarded as 'runaway' by all commentators. The clathrate gun runaway effect may be used to describe more rapid methane releases. Methane in the atmosphere has a high global warming potential, but breaks down relatively quickly to form CO2, which is also a greenhouse gas. Therefore, slow methane release will have the long-term effect of adding CO2 to the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of drug solubility, inert pellet size and binders used in drug loading on release behavior from Eudragit NE- 30 coated pellets.
