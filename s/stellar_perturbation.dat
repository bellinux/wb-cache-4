40|$|Non radial {{oscillations}} of {{neutron stars}} {{are associated with}} the emission of gravitational waves. The characteristic frequencies of these oscillations can be computed using the theory of stellar perturbations, and they are shown to carry detailed information on the internal structure of the emitting source. Moreover, they appear to be encoded in various radiative processes, as for instance in the tail of the giant flares of Soft Gamma Repeaters. Thus, their determination is central to the theory of <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbation.</b> A viable approach to the problem consists in formulating this theory as a problem of resonant scattering of gravitational waves incident on the potential barrier generated by the spacetime curvature. This approach discloses some unexpected correspondences between the theory of stellar perturbations and the theory of quantum mechanics, and allows us to predict new relativistic effects.

40|$|This grant {{supported}} our ongoing {{project to}} characterize the accretion rate of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) to Earth over geologic time using He- 3 as a tracer. IDPs are derived from collisions in the asteroid belt and from disaggregation of active comets. Owing to their small size (few to few hundred micrometers diameter) these particles spiral into the sun under Poynting-Robertson drag typically {{in less than a}} few tens of kyrs. Thus IDPs must be continually resupplied to the zodiacal cloud, and because the processes of IDP production are likely to be sporadic, time variation in the IDP accretion rate to Earth is likely to be time-varying. For example, major asteroidal collisions and comet showers should greatly enhance the IDP accretion rate. Our ultimate objective (still ongoing) is to document this time variance so as to better understand the history of the solar system, the source of IDPs accreting to Earth, and the details of the mechanism by which particles are captured by Earth. To document variations in IDP accretion rate through time we use He- 3 as a tracer. This isotope is in extremely low abundance in terrestrial matter, but IDPs have very high concentrations of He- 3 from implantation of solar wind ions. By measuring He- 3 in seafloor sediments, we can estimate the IDP accretion rate for at least the last few hundred Myrs. Under an earlier NASA grant we identified the existence of a large increase in He- 3 flux in the Late Eocene (35 Myr ago), coincident with the two largest impact craters of the Cenozoic Era. The simplest interpretation of this observation is the occurrence of a shower of long period comets at that time, simultaneously increasing the impact cratering probability and accretion rate of IDPs to Earth (Farley et al., 1998). Comet showers produced by <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbation</b> of the Oort cloud should be fairly common in the geologic record, so this is not an unreasonable interpretation of our observations...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{three aspects}} of tidal interactions in close binary systems. 1) We first develop {{a framework for}} predicting and interpreting photometric observations of eccentric binaries, which we term tidal asteroseismology. In such systems, the Fourier transform of the observed lightcurve is expected to consist of pulsations at harmonics of the orbital frequency. We use linear <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbation</b> theory to predict the expected pulsation amplitude spectra. Our numerical model does not assume adiabaticity, and accounts for stellar rotation in the traditional approximation. We apply our model to the recently discovered Kepler system KOI- 54, a 42 -day face-on stellar binary with e= 0. 83. Our modeling yields pulsation spectra that are semi-quantitatively consistent with observations of KOI- 54. KOI- 54 's spectrum also contains several nonharmonic pulsations, which {{can be explained by}} nonlinear three-mode coupling. 2) We next consider the situation of a white dwarf (WD) binary inspiraling due to the emission of gravitational waves. We show that resonance locks, previously considered in binaries with an early-type star, occur universally in WD binaries. In a resonance lock, the orbital and spin frequencies evolve in lockstep, so that the tidal forcing frequency is approximately constant and a particular normal mode remains resonant, producing efficient tidal dissipation and nearly synchronous rotation. We derive analytic formulas for the tidal quality factor and tidal heating rate during a g-mode resonance lock, and verify our results numerically. We apply our analysis to the 13 -minute double-WD binary J 0651, and show that our predictions are roughly consistent with observations. 3) Lastly, we examine the general dynamics of resonance locking in more detail. Previous analyses of resonance locking, including my own earlier work, invoke the adiabatic (a. k. a. Lorentzian) approximation for the mode amplitude, valid only in the limit of relatively strong mode damping. We relax this approximation, analytically derive conditions under which the fixed point associated with resonance locking is stable, and further check our analytic results with numerical integration of the coupled mode, spin, and orbital evolution equations. These show that resonance locking can sometimes take the form of complex limit cycles or even chaotic trajectories. We also show that resonance locks can accelerate the course of tidal evolution in eccentric systems...|$|E

40|$|Discoveries of extrasolar {{planets in}} the {{habitable}} zone (HZ) of their parent star lead {{to questions about}} the habitability of massive moons orbiting planets in the HZ. Around low-mass stars, the HZ is {{much closer to the}} star than for Sun-like stars. For a planet-moon binary in such a HZ, the proximity of the star forces a close orbit for the moon to remain gravitationally bound to the planet. Under these conditions the effects of tidal heating, distortion torques, and <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbations</b> become important considerations for exomoon habitability. Utilizing a model that considers both dynamical and tidal interactions simultaneously, we performed a computational investigation into exomoon evolution for systems in the HZ of low-mass stars (≲ 0. 6 M_). We show that dwarf stars with masses ≲ 0. 2 M_ cannot host habitable exomoons within the stellar HZ due to extreme tidal heating in the moon. Perturbations from a central star may continue to have deleterious effects in the HZ up to ≈ 0. 5 M_, depending on the host planet's mass and its location in the HZ, amongst others. In addition to heating concerns, torques due to tidal and spin distortion can lead to the relatively rapid inward spiraling of a moon. Therefore, moons of giant planets in HZs around the most abundant type of star are unlikely to have habitable surfaces.

40|$|The S-stars {{discovered}} in the Galactic center (GC) are expected to provide unique dynamical tests of the Kerr metric of the massive black hole (MBH) orbited by them. In order to obtain unbiased measurements of its spin and the related relativistic effects, a comprehensive understanding of the gravitational perturbations of the stars and stellar remnants around the MBH is quite essential. Here, we study the perturbations on the observables of a typical target star, i. e., the apparent orbital motion and the redshift, due to both the spin-induced relativistic effects and the Newtonian attractions of a single or a cluster of disturbing object(s). We find that, in most cases, the Newtonian perturbations on the observables are mainly attributed to the perturbed orbital period of the target star, rather than the Newtonian orbital precessions. The Newtonian perturbations have their unique features when they peak around the pericenter passage in each revolution, which {{is quite different from}} those of the spin-induced effects. Looking at the currently detected star S 2 /S 0 - 2, we find that its spin-induced effects on both the image position and redshift are very likely obscured by the gravitational perturbations from the star S 0 - 102 alone. We also investigate and discuss the Newtonian perturbations on a hypothetical S-star located inside the orbits of the currently detected ones. By considering a number of possible stellar distributions near the central MBH, we find that the spin-induced effects on the apparent position and the redshift dominate over the <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbations</b> for target stars with orbital semimajor axis smaller than $ 100 - 400 $AU if the MBH is maximally spinning.

One possible mechanism for their production is planet-planet interactions, which produces hot Jupiters from planets born far from their host stars but near their dynamical stability limits.

Our N-body simulations of planetary systems inside star clusters answer this question in the affirmative, and show that hot Jupiter formation is not a rare event. We detail three case studies of the dynamics-induced births of hot Jupiters on highly eccentric orbits that can only occur inside star clusters.

To characterize these effects, we use direct numerical simulations to model the formation of the Oort Cloud around migrating stars that eventually attain solar-like galactic orbits within a simulated Milky Way analog. In general, we find that our stars tend to migrate outward over time, exposing the Oort Cloud to early perturbations that were more intense than those found in the current solar neighborhood. As a result, the Oort Cloud is usually more centrally condensed due to enhanced erosion of the outer cloud as well as enhanced trapping within the inner cloud.

Next, an orbital evolution that includes three perihelion passages (previous-observed-next) is investigated where a full model of Galactic perturbations and perturbations from passing stars have been incorporated. We show that the distribution of planetary perturbations suffered by actual large-perihelion comets during their passage through the Solar system has a deep, unexpected minimum around zero which indicates a lack of "almost unperturbed" comets. By a series of simulations we show that this deep well is moderately resistant to some diffusion of orbital elements of analysed comets. It seems reasonable to state that the observed stream of these large-perihelion comets experienced a series of specific planetary configurations when passing through the planetary zone. An analysis of the past dynamics of these comets clearly shows that dynamically new comets may appear only when their original semimajor axes are greater than 20 000 au. However, only for semimajor axes longer than 40 000 au dynamically old comets are completely not present. We demonstrated that the observed 1 /a_ ori distribution exhibits a local minimum separating dynamically new from dynamically old comets.

40|$|Sagittarius A*, the super-massive {{black hole}} {{at the center of}} the Milky Way, is {{surrounded}} by a small cluster of high velocity stars, known as the S-stars. We aim to constrain the amount and nature of stellar and dark mass associated with the cluster in the immediate vicinity of Sagittarius A*. We use near-infrared imaging to determine the K_s-band luminosity function of the S-star cluster members, and the distribution of the diffuse background emission and the stellar number density counts around the central black hole. This allows us to determine the stellar light and mass contribution expected from the faint members of the cluster. We then use post-Newtonian N-body techniques to investigate the effect of <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbations</b> on the motion of S 2, as a means of detecting the number and masses of the perturbers. We find that the stellar mass derived from the K_s-band luminosity extrapolation is much smaller than the amount of mass that might be present considering the uncertainties in the orbital motion of the star S 2. Also the amount of light from the fainter S-cluster members is below the amount of residual light at the position of the S-star cluster after removing the bright cluster members. If the distribution of stars and stellar remnants is strongly enough peaked near Sagittarius A*, observed changes in the orbital elements of S 2 can be used to constrain both their masses and numbers. Based on simulations of the cluster of high velocity stars we find that at a wavelength of 2. 2 μm close to the confusion level for 8 m class telescopes blend stars will occur (preferentially near the position of Sagittarius A*) that last for typically 3 years before they dissolve due to proper motions.

40|$|Observations of the precessing {{orbits of}} stars {{very near the}} massive black hole in the galactic center could provide {{measurements}} of the spin and quadrupole moment of the hole and thereby test the no-hair theorem of general relativity. Since the galactic center {{is likely to be}} populated by a distribution of stars and small black holes, their gravitational interactions will perturb the orbit of any given star. We estimate the effects of such perturbations using analytic orbital perturbation theory, and show that for a range of possible stellar distributions, and for an observed star sufficiently close to the black hole, the relativistic spin and quadrupole effects will be larger than the effects of <b>stellar</b> cluster <b>perturbations.</b> Our results are consistent those from recent numerical N-body simulations by Merritt et al.

40|$|The {{detection}} of small mass planets with the radial-velocity technique is now {{confronted with the}} interference of stellar noise. HARPS can now reach a precision below the meter-per-second, which corresponds to the amplitudes of different <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbations,</b> such as oscillation, granulation, and activity. Solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noise of a few meter-per-second. The aim {{of this paper is}} to simulate this activity and calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies. Based on Sun observations, we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on the surface of a rotating star. We then calculate the radial-velocity effect induced by these spot groups as a function of time. Taking into account oscillation, granulation, activity, and a HARPS instrumental error of 80 cm/s, we simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order to efficiently reduce all sources of noise. Applying three measurements per night of 10 minutes every three days, 10 nights a month seems the best tested strategy. Depending on the level of activity considered, from log(R'_HK) = - 5 to - 4. 75, this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2. 5 to 3. 5 Earth masses in the habitable zone of a K 1 V dwarf. Using Bern's model of planetary formation, we estimate that for the same range of activity level, 15 to 35 % of the planets between 1 and 5 Earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200 days should be found with HARPS. A comparison between the performance of HARPS and ESPRESSO is also emphasized by our simulations. Using the same optimized strategy, ESPRESSO could find 1. 3 Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of early-K dwarfs. In addition, 80 % of planets with mass between 1 and 5 Earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200 days could be detected. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
40|$|An {{equation}} of state for material in stellar envelopes, subject {{to the limits of}} temperature less than about 10 to the 7 th K and density less than about. 01 g/cu cm is presented. The equation makes it possible to express free energy as the sum of several terms representing effects such as partial degeneracy of the electron, Coulomb interactions among charged particles, finite-volume, hard sphere repulsion, and van der Waals attraction. An occupation probability formalism is used to represent the effects of the plasma in establishing a finite partition function. It is shown that the use of the static screened Coulomb potential to calculate level shifts and to estimate the cutoff of the internal partition function is invalid. For most of the parameter space relevant to <b>stellar</b> envelopes, <b>perturbations</b> arising from the plasma ions are shown to be dominant in establishing the internal partition function...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{numerical}} simulations {{have demonstrated}} that the Sun's dynamical history within the Milky Way may be much more complex than that suggested by its current low peculiar velocity (Sellwood, J. A., Binney, J. J. [2002]. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 336, 785 - 796; Roškar, R., Debattista, V. P., Quinn, T. R., Stinson, G. S., Wadsley, J. [2008]. Astrophys. J. 684, L 79 -L 82). In particular, the Sun may have radially migrated through the galactic disk by up to 5 - 6 kpc (Roškar, R., Debattista, V. P., Quinn, T. R., Stinson, G. S., Wadsley, J. [2008]. Astrophys. J. 684, L 79 -L 82). This has important ramifications for {{the structure of the}} Oort Cloud, as it means that the Solar System may have experienced tidal and <b>stellar</b> <b>perturbations</b> that were significantly different from its current local galactic environment. To characterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct numerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that end up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like disk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may belong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show that field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's extreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge sometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the chance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ˜ 20 - 30 % of the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find its median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained during the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar dependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar encounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of magnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that assumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material trapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits (a > 20, 000 AU) can be extremely low and may present difficulties for traditional models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet production...|$|R
40|$|Michels et al. (1982) {{observed}} the apparent impacting {{of the sun}} by a comet, and Sekanina (1982) showed that the comet, 1979 XI, was probably {{a member of the}} Kreutz group of sun-grazing comets, although its perihelion of 0. 35 solar radii was much smaller than the 1. 2 - 1. 9 solar radii common for this comet class. The perihelion change cannot be explained by planetary, <b>stellar,</b> or nongravitational <b>perturbations.</b> The most plausible explanation is collision with another body, probably a comet, at large heliocentric distance. The probability of such an event is, however, extremely small. The sublimation of the comet's nucleus before impact is discussed, and it is suggested that its ultimate destruction probably resulted from the shock of entry into the denser regions of the solar atmosphere, just above the photosphere...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The time {{dependent}} {{reactions of}} an isothermal spherically symmetric <b>stellar</b> atmosphere to <b>perturbations</b> {{of the external}} (interstellar) pressure are analysed by means of computer simulations. The system is seen to evolve, through the phases of wind, breeze, accretion and back, according to an hysteresis type cycle with two catastrophe points: {{the value of the}} external pressure relative to a static atmosphere and that corresponding to the fastest (critical) breeze. This behaviour is proved to be due to the instability of the outflow breeze solutions (due to their unfavourable stratification), while subsonic accretion is stable. A crucial factor of this instability is the position of the outer boundary: if this is placed too close {{to the base of the}} atmosphere the inflow/outflow breeze stability is reversed. These simulations confirm a scenario first proposed by Velli (1994). Key words: hydrodynamics – instabilities – (Sun:) solar wind – sun: atmosphere – stars: atmospheres – ISM: jets and outflow...|$|R
40|$|Galactic disks {{consist of}} both stars and gas. The gas is more {{dynamically}} responsive than the stars, and strongly nonlinear structures and velocities can {{develop in the}} interstellar medium (ISM) even while <b>stellar</b> surface density <b>perturbations</b> remain fractionally small. Yet, the stellar component still significantly influences the gas. We use two-dimensional numerical simulations to explore formation of bound condensations and turbulence generation in the gas of twocomponent galactic disks. We represent the stars with collisionless particles and follow their orbits using a particle-mesh method, and treat the gas as an isothermal, unmagnetized fluid. The two components interact through a combined gravitational potential, which accounts for the distinct vertical thickness of each disk. We ensure our results are not contaminated by particle Poisson noise, which can seriously compromise simulations of self-gravitating systems. Using stellar parameters typical of mid-disk conditions, we find that models with gaseous Toomre parameter Qg < Qg,crit ∼ 1. 4 experience gravitational runaway and eventuall...|$|R
