40|$|Our {{world is}} {{changing}} at ever-increasing rates {{and with that}} business environ-ments are changing as well. The context of business life has changed drastically over the last century, however the fundamentals of organisational constructs have remained largely the same (Friesen, 2005; Ritzer, 1993). Task specialisa-tion and hierarchic organisation structures are still the dominant forms of organis-ational management today (Friesen, 2005; Pruijt, 2000). These principles were developed and introduced in the times of Adam Smith and Frederic Winslow Tay-lor 1, when the technological, sociological and economical contexts of businesses were completely different than those of today’s (Friesen, 2000; Mills, 1987). One of the thoughts behind Taylorism is that for each task, the one best way is designed and laid down in rules (Adler & Cole, 1995). In today’s world where in-formation is considered a public good and decays at a rapid rate, the amount of options that a manager is confronted with are abundant (Friesen, 2005). It is therefore unthinkable that a manager can still choose the best possible answer to every problem, standardize it, and then delegate the job to a <b>specialised</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E
40|$|Multiple mating by {{females with}} {{different}} males (polyandry) {{is difficult to}} explain in many taxa because it carries significant costs to females, yet benefits are often hard to identify. Polyandry is a derived trait in social insects, the evolutionary origins of which remain unclear. One of several leading hypotheses for its evolution is that it improves division of labour by increasing intra-colonial genetic diversity. Division of labour is {{a key player in}} the ecological success of social insects, and in many successful species of ants is based on morphologically distinct castes of workers, each with their own task specialisations. Atta leaf-cutting ants exhibit one of the most extreme and complicated forms of morphologically <b>specialised</b> <b>worker</b> castes and have been reported to be polyandrous but with relatively low mating frequencies (~ 2. 5 on average). Here, we show {{for the first time that}} there is a significant genetic influence on worker size in Atta colombica leaf-cutting ants. We also provide the first estimate of the mating frequency of Atta cephalotes (four matings) and, by analysing much higher within-colony sample sizes, find that Atta are more polyandrous than previously thought (approximately six to seven matings). The results show that high polyandry and a genetic influence on worker caste are present in both genera of leaf-cutting ants and add weight to the hypothesis that division of labour is a potential driver of the evolution of polyandry in this clade of ants...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify components of PHC service delivery models for refugees in destination countries which were effective in improving access, quality and coordination of care. Methods: A systematic review of the peer reviewed and grey literature published between 1990 - 2011. We included any evaluations of PHC in the main developed destination countries. The models needed to refer to specific aspect of care for refugees and organisation and/delivery of primary health care. Findings: Of the 256 full text papers reviewed, only 25 met our inclusion criteria - ten from overseas and fifteen from Australia. Successful strategies that enhanced access were outreach services, multidisciplinary staff, use of interpreters and bilingual staff, no-cost or low-cost services, free transport for appointments, longer consultation hours, patient advocacy and use of gender-sensitive providers. These improved affordability, appropriateness and acceptability of the services. Training in cultural sensitivity and appropriate use of interpreters was associated with improved quality of care. Coordination between health and social services improved with case management by a <b>specialised</b> <b>worker</b> and team based primary health care. Implications: Taken together, these comprise the key components of an Australian model of refugee care including workforce planning and training. The next stage of our research examines the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies with stakeholders...|$|E

On the supply side, an increase in productivity of innovative workers, alongside with investment in infrastructure, human capital, and improvements in the market setting may stimulate growth.

40|$|The complex {{organization}} of social insect colonies and the seemingly industrious behaviour {{of their members}} has long fascinated naturalists and evolutionary biologists alike. In more recent times, substantial {{progress has been made}} towards understanding the selective forces that favour the evolution and maintenance of sociality (Hamilton 1964; Brockmann 1984). However, many characteristics of social insects are still poorly understood. Ranking prominently among these is the question of how the adaptive value of different morphological worker types (Fig. 1) might be explained, or, more generally, how the demography in terms of physical or age structure relates to fitness of colonies and their members. Morphologically <b>specialised</b> <b>workers</b> (e. g. soldiers) and age-dependent behaviour patterns (e. g. young bees that tend brood) are examples of caste structure. A caste is a set of individuals of a particular morphological type and/or age group that performs a specialised task in the colony (Oster and Wilson, 1978, p. 19).

40|$|International audienceThe European Union {{appears to}} be {{promoting}} {{at the same time}} both cross-national mobility of workers and an increased role for occupational pensions. There is, however, a potential tension between these two objectives because workers risk losing (some of) their pension rights under an occupational scheme as a consequence of their mobility. After long negotiations, the EU has addressed this issue through a minimum standards Directive. Shortly before the adoption of this Directive, the Court of Justice also delivered an important decision in the same field, in the case of Casteels v British Airways. By analysing the resulting legal framework for safeguarding pension rights under occupational schemes in the context of workers’ mobility, we argue that the application of the case law developed by the Court of Justice in the field of free movement of workers has the potential to offer superior protection compared to the Directive. We also highlight the fact that the present legal framework seems to afford a much fuller protection to the intracompany cross-national mobility of workers employed by multinational companies, while also seemingly favouring mobility for highly <b>specialised</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

This paper provides an insight into some of the challenges workers on 457 visas reported while working in Australia in a study that collected data in 2012. While the study focussed on costs and benefits of employing workers on 457 visas to business, the migrant worker and the larger Australian community, part of the data included the social and financial costs to these workers. It is this data that is reported in this paper. Workers on 457 visas stated that financial costs that directly affected them were the requirement to cover their medical and child care costs as well as some paid up to $ 3000 to overseas Migration Agents to arrange their visas. The social costs included extreme loneliness, acceptance by Australian workers and difficulties with spouse and family who may be large distances apart that is further exacerbated by fly-in/fly-out working arrangements. Relocation Agents appear to provide the very valuable connection to community for newly arrived migrants in that they facilitate introductions for people to establish new friendships. The emotional and social welfare of these workers emerged as key components of successful assimilation in Australia. Failure to acknowledge these problems resulted in threats to emotional well being of the workers and their families and in some cases led to workers returning home earl...|$|R

40|$|This Master’s thesis {{examines}} the optimal {{form of a}} firm’s organisation. Specifically, it discusses the efficient degree of labour specialisation in a firm. Specialisation of labour improves labour productivity through learning-by-doing. The problem of organisation arises, however, {{from the fact that}} the actions of <b>specialised</b> <b>workers</b> need to be coordinated in order to achieve gains from cooperation. Therefore, coordination costs may limit returns to specialisation. Moreover, changes in technology or workers’ human capital may change the returns to learning in favour of less specialisation. The thesis compares theoretically the relative efficiency of organisations, which feature different degrees of labour specialisation. The comparison is made by showing how learning and communication take place in different organisational structures, and how the costs and returns to these activities vary. The optimal degree of labour specialisation under different conditions is then derived. The model of Lindbeck and Snower (2000) addresses the efficient form of work organisation in terms of the degree of labour specialisation by work task. It examines when it is worthwhile to have <b>workers</b> <b>specialising</b> by task and when they should perform multiple tasks. It finds that it is optimal for workers to perform multiple tasks only if performing different tasks is sufficiently complementary to each other. As a result, the returns to task integration outweigh the returns to specialisation. Moreover, exogenous changes in technology or human capital may change the relationship of these returns in favour of one or the other type of organisation. The second model from Greenan and Guellec (1994) compares a centralised and a decentralised organisation focusing on the coordination of learning-by-doing among workers. It takes communication costs into account because learning requires information sharing among workers. A decentralised organisation is associated with low costs of producing knowledge and high communication costs, whereas the opposite holds for the centralised organisation. It turns out that the optimal organisational form depends on the size of the labour force. Furthermore, the relative efficiency of the two organisation styles may change in favour of decentralisation when the differentiation of products in the economy grows. Endast sammandrag.
