5000|$|The European Union {{has decided}} to include a small set of health expectancies among its European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) to provide {{synthetic}} measures of disability, chronic morbidity, and perceived health. Therefore the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM), composed of 3 general questions covering these dimensions, has been introduced into the Eurostat EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC) to improve the comparability of health expectancies between countries. In addition life expectancy without long term activity limitation, based on the disability question, was selected in 2004 {{to be one of}} the <b>structural</b> <b>indicators</b> to be examined every year, during the European Spring Council for assessing the EU strategic goals (Lisbon Strategy) under the name of “Healthy Life Years” (HLY). Furthermore the European Union is co-funding a Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across the Life Cycle (CHRODIS-JA). This aims to promote and facilitate a process of exchange and transfer of good practices between European countries and regions, addressing chronic conditions, with a specific focus on health promotion and prevention of chronic conditions, multi-morbidity and diabetes.|$|E

40|$|Background & aims Many {{residents}} in European healthcare institutions are malnourished, with reported malnutrition prevalence rates {{of up to}} 60 %. Due to {{the negative effects of}} malnutrition it is important to optimize the quality of nutritional care. If <b>structural</b> quality <b>indicators</b> of nutritional care might improve resident care and outcome is not yet known. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore whether <b>structural</b> quality <b>indicators</b> for nutritional care influence malnutrition prevalence in Dutch, German and Austrian nursing homes. Methods This study follows a cross-sectional, multi-center design. Data were collected by using a standardised questionnaire at resident, ward and institution level. Results Data from 214 nursing homes (NL = 133, G = 61, A = 20) were analysed. The prevalence of malnutrition varied significantly between the three countries (NL = 18. 2 % G = 20. 1 % A = 22. 5 %). Two <b>structural</b> quality <b>indicators</b> at ward level namely (1) the policy that the care file should include the nutritional intake for each patient and (2) having a weight measurement policy at ward level are predictive for malnutrition prevalence. Furthermore also the variable country was of influence. Conclusions A policy of registering nutritional intake in the file of the patient and a policy to assess the patient's weight regularly have a positive influence on malnutrition prevalence.

Considering the lack of evidence that ongoing professional training and curriculum have a positive impact on quality itself, we decided to focus on only two above-mentioned <b>indicators</b> of <b>structural</b> quality: teachers’ qualification level, which has been one of the indicators in the ‘iron triangle’ of <b>structural</b> quality <b>indicators,</b> and teachers’ salary level, which is proven to be a strong determinant of quality.|$|R
