40|$|Objective: This longitudinal, {{prospective}} study examines {{the role of}} <b>specialty</b> mental health <b>care</b> as provided by community-based, usual-care practice settings in predicting out-of-home placements among children served by a child welfare and juvenile justice system. Method: The mental health needs of 1, 249 children from 22 counties in Tennessee were assessed when the children were referred for child welfare and juvenile justice, in-home, case man-agement services. The outpatient <b>specialty</b> mental health <b>care</b> received by {{the children in the}} 6 -month period fol-lowing the referral was recorded using the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents and reimbursement records of TennCare. Children were then followed for 1. 5 years to identify those who were subsequently placed in out-of-home care. Results: A majority of the children needed <b>specialty</b> mental health <b>care,</b> but most of these children did not receive it. This is important because their need was the best predictor of subsequent out-of-home placement. The odds of an out-of-home placement in the follow-up period were reduced by 36 % to 40 % for those children who received <b>specialty</b> mental health <b>care.</b> Conclusions: Improved systematic screening for mental health problems and access to <b>specialty</b> mental health <b>care</b> for children referred for in-home child welfare and juvenile justice case management services are promising strategies for reducing out-of-home placements...|$|R
