50|$|What {{separates}} <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{from other}} regeneration systems, such as clearcutting or seed tree, {{is that the}} new seedlings are established before the mature trees are fully (or mostly) removed. This gives the forester more control over the species that are regenerated, and is more forgiving if the first regeneration effort fails. All mature trees may be removed, creating a young even-aged forest, or a considerable number of reserves may be kept to provide a two-aged structure. Small woodlot owners often prefer this method for the control it gives and also because the income from the harvest is spread out over a decade or more.|$|R

50|$|Clearcutting, or clearfelling, is {{a method}} of {{harvesting}} that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area. Depending on management objectives, a clearcut {{may or may not}} have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration, including wildlife habitat management, mitigation of potential erosion or water quality concerns. Silviculture objectives for clearcutting, (for example, healthy regeneration of new trees on the site) and a focus on forestry distinguish it from deforestation. Other methods include <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting,</b> group selective, single selective, seed-tree cutting, patch cut, and retention cutting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> {{refers to}} the {{progression}} of forest cuttings leading {{to the establishment of}} a new generation of seedlings of a particular species or group of species without planting. This silvicultural system is normally implemented in forests that are considered mature, often after several thinnings. The desired species are usually long-lived and their seedlings would naturally tend to start under partial shade. The shelterwood system gives enough light for the desired species to establish without giving enough light for the weeds that are adapted to full sun. Once the desired species is established, subsequent cuttings give the new seedlings more light and the growing space is fully passed to the new generation.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{probability of}} Taxus baccata (L.) decline given climate change brings forth many uncertainties for conservation management decisions. In this article, the authors present {{the effects of}} applying regeneration cuttings since the year 2000 on {{the viability of the}} understory yew population. By collecting data from a stand located at the centre of the largest population of European yew in Slovakia, containing approximately 160, 000 individuals, and analysing tree-ring records from 38 sampled trees, the improved performance of yews, including stem growth, seed production, and number of regenerated individuals, was revealed. Thinning the canopy by removing 15 % of the growing stock volume per decade, combined with the subsequent irregular <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cuttings,</b> was assessed as a useful strategy. Moreover, lower radial growth of females compared to males, but simultaneously their similar response to climate, suggests a possible trade-off between reproduction and growth. Release cuttings of up to 30 % of the standing volume {{in the vicinity of the}} female trees, executed in the rainy summers following warmer winters, and consistent elimination of deer browsing, can further enhance the positive effects of applied cuts on yew viability. Overall, the suggested active measures could be considered as an effective option to preserve the unique biodiversity of calcareous beech-dominated forests in Central Europe...|$|R
50|$|In general terms, the shelterwood {{system is}} a series of partial cuts that removes the trees of an {{existing}} stand over several years and eventually culminates in a final cut that creates a new even-aged stand. It is an even-aged regeneration method that removes trees in a series of three harvests: 1) Preparatory cut; 2) Establishment cut; and 3) Removal cut. The success of practising a shelterwood system is closely related to: 1. the length of the regeneration period, i.e. the time from the <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> to the date when a new generation of trees has been established; 2.the quality of the new tree stand with respect to stand density and growth; and 3.the value increment of the shelter trees. Information on the establishment, survival and growth of seedlings influenced by the cover of shelter trees, {{as well as on the}} growth of these trees, is needed as a basis for modelling the economic return of practising a shelterwood system. The method's objective is to establish new forest reproduction under the shelter of the retained trees. Unlike the seed-tree method, residual trees alter understory environmental conditions (i.e. sunlight, temperature, and moisture) that influence tree seedling growth. This method can also find a middle ground with the light ambiance by having less light accessible to competitors while still being able to provide enough light for tree regeneration. Hence, shelterwood methods are most often chosen for site types characterized by extreme conditions, in order to create a new tree generation within a reasonable time period. These conditions are valid foremost on level ground sites which are either dry and poor or moist and fertile.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> on the {{abundance}} of Jordan's salamander (Plethodon Jordan!) in western North Carolina were examined during 1997 and 1998. Terrestrial salamander assemblages were sampled before, immediately after, and one year after timber harvest on control and treatment plots to estimate abundance. We also sur-veyed salamanders immediately after the harvest along transects radiating out from cut plots to determine whether cutting triggered salamander emigration from disturbed plots. Both before and after timber harvest, the site was strongly dominated by Jordan's sala-mander. No significant effects of initial <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> on Jordan's salamander abun-dance were apparent after timber harvest. Abundance of this species decreased from pre-cutting to post-cutting sampling on both control and treatment plots, which likely reflected the drought that characterized both post-cutting sampling periods, but not pre-cutting sampling. No emigration of salamanders from the cut plots was detected after timber har-vest These findings suggest that at a stand scale, shelterwood harvests may pose less of a short-term threat to salamander populations than clearcutting, but more study is necessary to assess broad-scale tradeoffs between harvest yield and biological impacts associated with alternative timber harvest methods.

40|$|In Romanian forestry, skidders {{represent}} the most used equipment for wood extraction, while the group shelterwood system {{is one of}} the most used silvicultural forest management strategies. Production rates are important indicators when trying to assess the efficiency of a process, since they can be used in different practical applications, starting with operational planning and ending with energetic analyses or LCA studies. The reduced accessibility of forest stands {{is one of the}} main problems of Romanian forestry, and therefore a lot of time and energy is usually spent in harvesting operations. In the present days, it has become very important to know the effects of these operational conditions. In order to evaluate the effects of very long skidding distances on the time inputs and productivity, a time study was conducted for a Romanian skidder that operated in a mixed hardwood stand located in Central Romania, where group <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cuttings</b> were applied. We found out that the time input of a winching work cycle was most affected by winching distance and the number of logs, and developed time consumption models for the main groups of operations.

We related tree basal diameter growth as it responds to light availability and soil compaction (as measured by resistance to penetration) by fitting a growth model based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. Predicted growth of N. dombeyi was greater than N. alpina in high- and low-light levels, but without differences between species. Both species showed significant differences at high levels of penetration resistance (> 2, 000 kPa). Differences for N. dombeyi occurred above ~ 40 % in total light, and for N. alpina above ~ 20 %. However, they were not different when compared at low and intermediate levels of penetration resistance. The results suggest that partial shelterwood cuts may provide adequate light levels to achieve appropriate growth of underplanted Nothofagus seedlings. However, if regeneration of N. alpina is desired, scarification of topsoil needs to be implemented with more caution in canopy openings, as traffic and soil removal by heavy machinery can have detrimental effects on growth of this and other species that are more sensitive to soil compaction...|$|R

In all plots, potential final crop trees (between 400 and 489 trees/ha), mostly of silver fir, were selected based on the vigour-quality-spacing criteria. The main results of the field measurements and office analyses are as follows:- owing to the exceptional regeneration potential of silver fir, as well as its high shade-tolerance, the initial stocking of living trees was over 10, 000 stems in all plots. After intervention the stocking varies between 1, 350 trees/ha in RDP 2 and 10, 032 trees/ha in control plot;- following intervention stand basal area was reduced to 10. 87 sq. m/ha (RDP 2) and 20, 25 sq. m/ha (RDP 1); basal area shows the maximum value in control plot (31. 65 sq. m/ha);- the mean diameter ranges between 5. 60 cm (control plot) and 10. 19 cm (RDP 2);- the mean height is less variable than the mean diameter and ranges between 7. 56 m (control plot) and 8. 42 m (RDP 2);- the mean slenderness index h/d is the highest (over 130) in control plot and lowest (96) in RDP 2;- the variability of potential final crop trees in terms of their mean diameter, mean height and mea...|$|R

40|$|Cohesion {{contributed by}} plant root systems is an {{important}} factor in determining the stability of steep, vegetated slopes subject to shallow landslides. The effects of vegetation removal on root cohesion can be simulated by two functional relationships: (i) root deterioration as described by an exponential decay function and (ii) regrowth of newly planted or invading vegetation as described by a sigmoid relationship. The rates of these simultaneous functions determine the temporal changes in net rooting strength. The general root strength model developed in this paper is adapted to specific silvicultural systems such as clearcutting, partial cutting, <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting,</b> and thinning. The models simulate the long-term effects of vegetation management on root cohesion by overlaying the impacts of a prior vegetation removal on a more recent removal. Examples presented for specific silvicultural systems indicate that vegetation and site conditions that promote rapid root strength deterioration and slow regrowth may depress net rooting strength over several management rotations. Progressively shorter clearcut or partial cut rotations can cause a steady temporal decline in root strength.

40|$|The {{forests of}} {{the areas of the}} peninsular {{southern}} Italy, united since 1139 in the Reign of Sicily, together with the homonymous insular one, were managed from that time in a unit way, until the unification of our Country, with draws of fuelwood, forage phytomass, and structural timber, which started a long time before. The draw of the fuelwood, made by man for lighting and houses heating, and for the cooking of food, and the other one of shrubs and grasses sprouts, due to domestic and breeded stock for nourishment, started with the Neolithic transition which occurred between the 7000 and the 6500 b. C. in the above mentioned area. The other one of the structural timber was started long after with the woody cuttings, made at the beginning occasionally and later more regularly through choice modality from the age of the Roman domination, till the end of the XVIII century. The high intensity of the woody draws caused in many forestry communities a vegetation degeneration which assumed the characters of regression with clear cuttings with reserves, only 45 per ha, prescribed by law {{at the beginning of the}} XIX century, during the second Bourbon Restoration. All this situation finished finally, at the end of the same century, by merit of the forestry Administration that spread the <b>shelterwood</b> uniform <b>cuttings</b> largely of the woods and the forests considered, as well as in many others of our Country.

40|$|Forests cover about 31 % of European {{land area}} (excluding CIS countries). Except for some {{protected}} or inaccessible areas, {{all of these}} forests are used by humans. The influence of different silvicultural treatments on timber production {{and the amount of}} carbon ill tree biomass is well known. In contrast, data on the impacts of forest management, particularly of moderate silvicultural practices in hardwood forestry, on the amount of organic carbon in the mineral soil (SOC) are very limited. A case study on differently managed European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests in Germany showed that the successive removal of trees in a shelterwood system and a selection system reduces the amount of carbon stored in tree biomass on average by about 30 % compared to an unmanaged forest. Biomass carbon at the even-aged stands of the shelterwood system showed a clear age-related maximum curve (maximum at a stand age of about 100 years: 230 tC ha(- 1)). Leaf litter resting on the mineral soil at the end of September before litter fall began (0. 8 - 2. 8 tC ha(- 1)) was mainly affected by annual leaf litter fall of the previous year and the basal area (R- 2 = 0. 67). Excluding the effect of variations in the clay content and the C:N ratio via statistical analysis soil organic carbon in the upper mineral soil (0 - 15 cm soil depth, SOC 0 - 15) did not correlate with stand age, and mean SOC 0 - 15 of the study sites or silvicultural systems (ranging -between 40 and 48 tC ha(- 1)) did not differ significantly. These results indicate that the effects of disturbances due to <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cuttings</b> or selection cuttings on SOC 0 - 15 are small compared to the high small-scaled variability of soils, the favourable growing conditions at the Hainichi-Dun region that allow for a rapid canopy closure after tree harvesting, and potential long-term effects of historical forest use. However, there was a trend to lower mean SOC 0 - 15 at the managed sites (42 tC ha(- 1)) as compared to the Linmanaged site (48 tC ha(- 1)). This trend may represent a Cumulative effect of the cessation of timber use at the unmanaged forest for the last 35 years. The impacts of the investigated moderate silvicultural practices on the carbon budget of European beech forests were lower than those reported for clear cuttings in temperate forests. A major challenge of future research is to quantity the long-term effects of historical forest use on the Current amount of SOC and to separate them from the effects of recent forest management. A crucial precondition for these investigations is the establishment of representative long-term, managed and unmanaged study sites. [References: 124...|$|R
40|$|The 2 -cut shelterwood {{silvicultural}} {{system is the}} most reliable method we have for regenerating even-aged hardwoods. Unlike other systems {{it can be used}} for all hardwood species, both small- and large-seeded, but will probably be used most often for the small-seeded ones such as yellow birch, paper birch, and hemlock. In the Lake States the basic requirement for getting reproduction with any even-age method, including shelterwood, is that hardwood regeneration MUST be established BEFORE the overstory is removed. When we cut second growth stands and end up with raspberries, poor stocking, or both, it is usually because this requirement was not met. For hardwood regeneration to be established, seedlings should be 2 to 4 feet high; by then their root systems have penetrated mineral soil. The kind of shelterwood cut to use in the Lake States depends on the species. Light-seeded ones usually require scarification or fire.

Hydrologic effects of clear cutting (3 WS), <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> (1 WS), patch cutting (1 WS), and young forest thinning (1 WS) were examined in the Tsuga heterophylla zone at the H. J.

Climate of both sites is marine west coast with winter precipitation and dry summers, producing minimum streamflows in August and September. Changes in flow frequency distributions were detected by counting days below streamflow thresholds where the thresholds were established using percentiles from pre-cutting streamflow records. Changes in relative streamflow were established by the station pair method. Summer streamflow deficits were largest and most persistent in 35 to 50 -year-old forest plantations created from clearcutting and <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Summer streamflow deficits were smallest and most ephemeral in a stand that experienced 50 % overstory thinning in 1971. Summer streamflow deficits of intermediate size and persistence developed in watersheds in which 25 to 30 % of the area had been patchcut in the 1960 s or 1970 s. A sparse (12 %) precommercial thin of a 27 -year-old stand exhibiting summer streamflow deficits had comparatively little effect on streamflow deficits. Streamflow deficits emerged as early as March or April and persisted into October and November in the warmer, drier site in southern Oregon (Coyote Creek), whereas summer streamflow deficits were restricted to July through September in the cooler, wetter Andrews Forest. These {{findings are consistent with}} previous studies demonstrating (1) increases in water use in certain conifer species relative to others (e. g. Douglas-fir versus pine); (2) higher water use in young (i. e., 10 to 50 -yr-old) compared to old (100 to 250 -yr-old) stands of many tree species; and (3) decreased interception capacity of young relative to old forest stands associated with loss of canopy epiphytes. Results appear to be robust, despite gaps in data availability, uncertainties associated with changes in stream gauging, streamflow trends over time in control watersheds, and multi-decadal fluctuations in regional climate over the study period. These findings support the notion that variable-intensity logging prescriptions over small areas to approximate natural forest structure may have the least effect on summer streamflows. However, more research, preferably new paired watershed experiments, is needed to quantify {{the magnitude and}} duration of summer streamflow effects from various levels of overstory and understory thinning treatments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractâRestoring {{natural fire}} regimes and diverse ground cover to planted or old-field origin {{southern}} pine stands typically requires a substantial reduction in overstory density. While maintaining full canopy cover (CC) {{is consistent with}} maximizing fiber production, this approach does not allow sufficient light to reach the forest floor to accomplish a broader set of objectives. The relationship between stand basal area (BA) and CC {{has been used to}} regulate the overwood in <b>shelterwood</b> seed <b>cuttings</b> and is worth exploring for other purposes. Two factors potentially complicating the use of BA as a proxy for CC are: (1) the dynamic relationship between stem diameter and crown size and (2) species-level differences. Data collected as part of a regional inventory (Forest Inventory and Analysis Forest Health Monitoring plots) were used to construct regression models of crown projection area (CPA) for the four most common southern pines (Pinus taeda, PITA; P. elliottii, PIEL; P. echinata, PIEC; P. palustris, PIPA). Species, stem diameter, and live-crown ratio were all identified as important predictor variables (P < 0. 05). Relative to a stated objective of achieving 50 percent CC there were some substantial differences in the amount of BA suggested for retention in stands of different average diameter (5 - to 18 -inch d. b. h, PITA 46 to 70 square feet per acre; PIEL 46 to 64; PIEC 47 to 71; PIPA 50 to 74); the differences among species were somewhat less dramatic. There was a clear tendency for relatively small stems, e. g., < 10 inch d. b. h., to have larger crowns per unit stem diameter, implying a given CC could be achieved with less BA. Species shade tolerance also appeared to influence crown-stem allometry, with the more shade-tolerant species tending to provide a given amount of CC with less BA.

While the proportion of Euro-pean beech (Fagus sylvatica) remained relatively stable, Norway spruce (Picea abies) was gradually displaced and beech-fir forests became predominant. Other tree species played a much less significant role. Over the centuries, there was a growing human influence on the composition of the forest. By the 16 th cen-tury, glass manufacturing had become an important industry. It required firewood to run the furnaces and potash to reduce the melting point of quartz. Selective cutting was the practised method of forest use. By the end of this period, Norway spruce had become the most common tree species, followed by Euro-pean beech and silver fir. The age of planned forestry began in the first half of the 19 th century when owner-ship of the forests in the National Park area was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria. At first, forestry practices were based on <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> (until 1880) and later, on the Bavarian âfemelschlag â technique (expanding gap management). As a result of these types of forest management, the proportion of spruce in relation to silver fir increased even further, while the European beech component remained constant. This development continued in the 20 th century. The introduction of the principle of land rent theory led t...|$|E
40|$|Timber {{production}} {{and protection of}} biodiversity are two main issues in south Swedish forestry. This thesis explores the possibilities of combining the two issues in a nature-based silviculture. Different branches of science, palaeoecology, silviculture and forest vegetation ecology, were combined to give a multidisciplinary approach to the subject. Mimicking the historical forest composition and processes in the silvicultural measures {{for the benefit of}} both biodiversity protection and timber production was identified as one possible way of developing a nature-based silviculture. The long period of human influence on the landscape in southern Sweden has effectively removed all the remnants of natural forest that could have been used as references in the mimicking procedure. Consequently, historical references were searched. A method to describe former forest conditions was developed using palaeoecological data and methods. It was found that the historical deciduous dominance was pronounced. Over 2000 years southern Sweden has been transformed from a deciduous to a coniferous landscape. Human activities were shown to be a major driving force in this change. Several detected historical forest types were possible as references for the mimicking approach, but forest types common in the past and rare today were suggested for maximal efficiency in obtaining high biodiversity. Mixed nemoral deciduous forests were pointed out as a historically widespread forest type with very little resemblance in the present landscape. The small fragments left are important for present biodiversity and from many other aspects. Development of a nature-based silvicultural system for the management of mixed nemoral forest stands based on the theory of mimicking was begun. A silvicultural experiment was established in a near-natural, mixed nemoral forest stand in southern Sweden and the early effects of the silvicuitural treatments tested were evaluated with regard to floristic diversity. The early findings indicate that advance growth may be an effective source for regeneration of the forest type. Soil scarification is not recommended when regenerating mixed nemoral deciduous forest stands as the destruction of advance saplings was not compensated by new establishment, and because a tendency towards alteration of the ground flora typical of nemoral forest to a pioneer plant community was traced. Sparse <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> is suggested as an appropriate way of combining biodiversity consideration and timber production in mixed nemoral deciduous forest stands. Finally, a framework of an approach to obtain a nature-based silvicultural system was developed, based on the presented results and other informatio...|$|E
40|$|Forests provide {{wildlife}} habitat, {{water and}} air purification, climate moderation, and timber and nontimber products. Concern {{about climate change}} has put forests in the limelight as sinks of atmospheric carbon. The C stored in the global vegetation, mostly in forests, is nearly equivalent to the amount present in atmospheric CO{sub 2 }. Both voluntary and government-mandated carbon trading markets are being developed and debated, some of which include C sequestration resulting from forest management as a possible tradeable commodity. However, uncertainties regarding sources of variation in sequestration rates, validation, and leakage remain significant challenges for devising strategies to include forest management in C markets. Hence, the need for scientifically-based information on C sequestration by forest management has never been greater. The consequences of forest management on the US carbon budget are large, because {{about two-thirds of the}} {approx} 300 million hectare US forest resource is classified as 'commercial forest. ' In most C accounting budgets, forest harvesting is usually considered to cause a net release of C from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere. However, forest management practices could be designed to meet the multiple goals of providing wood and paper products, creating economic returns from natural resources, while sequestering C from the atmosphere. The shelterwood harvest strategy, which removes about 30 % of the basal area of the overstory trees in each of three successive harvests spread out over thirty years as part of a stand rotation of 60 - 100 years, may improve net C sequestration compared to clear-cutting because: (1) the average C stored on the land surface over a rotation increases, (2) harvesting only overstory trees means that a larger fraction of the harvested logs can be used for long-lived sawtimber products, compared to more pulp resulting from clearcutting, (3) the shelterwood cut encourages growth of subcanopy trees by opening up the forest canopy to increasing light penetration. Decomposition of onsite harvest slash and of wastes created during timber processing releases CO{sub 2 } to the atmosphere, thus offsetting some of the C sequestered in vegetation. Decomposition of soil C and dead roots may also be temporarily stimulated by increased light penetration and warming of the forest floor. Quantification of these processes and their net effect is needed. We began studying C sequestration in a planned shelterwood harvest at the Howland Forest in central Maine in 2000. The harvest took place in 2002 by the International Paper Corporation, who assisted us to track the fates of harvest products (Scott et al., 2004, Environmental Management 33 : S 9 -S 22). Here we present the results of intensive on-site studies of the decay of harvest slash, soil respiration, growth of the remaining trees, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO{sub 2 } during the first six years following the harvest. These results are combined with calculations of C in persisting off-site harvest products to estimate the net C consequences to date of this commercial shelterwood harvest operation. Tower-based eddy covariance is an ideal method for this study, as it integrates all C fluxes {{in and out of the}} forest over a large 'footprint' area and can reveal how the net C flux, as well as gross primary productivity and respiration, change following harvest. Because the size of this experiment precludes large-scale replication, we are use a paired-airshed approach, similar to classic large-scale paired watershed experiments. Measurements of biomass and C fluxes in control and treatment stands were compared during a pre-treatment calibration period, and then divergence from pre-treatment relationships between the two sites measured after the harvest treatment. Forests store carbon (C) as they accumulate biomass. Many forests are also commercial sources of timber and wood fiber. In most C accounting budgets, forest harvesting is usually considered to cause a net release of C from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere. However, it might also be possible for commercial use of forests to contribute to terrestrial sequestration of C. The objective of the our research project is to determine whether <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting</b> regimes now being adopted in the commercial forests of Maine and other areas of the country can achieve these multiple goals...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of seedling regeneration {{is a key}} process in and indicator of ecologically sustainable forest management. The availability of seed {{and the creation of}} a suitable seedbed are recognised as important factors limiting seedling recruitment. A silvicultural method commonly used across northern and eastern jarrah forest blocks is <b>shelterwood</b> <b>cutting.</b> The primary objective of treating jarrah forest to shelterwood is to promote seedling regeneration in areas lacking sufficient advanced growth. Despite the widespread and progressive implementation of the shelterwood method, its application in jarrah forest has shown varying degrees of success. This thesis sought to investigate and better understand the roles of seed supply and seedbed condition in promoting successful seedling regeneration in shelterwood-treated jarrah forest. It addressed two questions from an ecological and management perspective. Firstly, could adequate seed supply and favourable seedbed conditions be effectively managed and produced in shelterwood-harvested coupes? Secondly, could adequate seed supply and suitable seedbed conditions be reliably produced to facilitate successful seedling regeneration following disturbance events, in this case post-harvest burning? A major effort was dedicated to developing a more accurate and practical method of assessing seed crops in individual trees. The final model produced a high degree of predictability (RÂ² = 0. 85), while still maintaining a high level of practicality for field application, with three easily measured variables being used (stem diameter combined with subjective assessments of capsule clump density and capsule clump distribution). The refined model dramatically improved estimates of crown capsule numbers from the previous model, with the RÂ² value increasing from 0. 29 to 0. 85. The second major focus of the study was to assess the capacity of prescribed burns, under mild conditions, to produce seedbed conditions suitable for regeneration. Low intensity prescribed burns resulted in the production of suitable conditions for seedling regeneration; that is, leaf litter and understorey vegetation were reduced and ash beds were created. Ash bed production was heterogeneous within sites. This heterogeneity has been attributed to the capacity of low intensity prescribed burns to account for fine-scale variations in fuel quantity, continuity and condition. Patterns of pre-burn aerial seed crop size and seed fall following low intensity prescribed burning were also assessed. Canopy capsule crops showed a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, both in terms of seed quantity and maturation. Such variability has been attributed to individual trees or groups of trees responding differently to localised climatic events and/or interspecific site factors at each stage of the flowering cycle. The main source of this variability was shown to be the numbers and spatial distribution of super trees; that is, trees defined as having a stem diameter 3 Ìe 60 cm and 3 Ìe 20 000 capsules. The average rate of seed fall increased substantially following prescribed burning under mild conditions. Postharvest burning under the mild conditions of the current survey did not result in en masse seed fall. Rather, peaks in seed fall were observed in the first few weeks post-burn, followed by low level falls throughout the following year. Sites burnt in spring showed a higher and more consistent release of seed in the first few weeks following fire, whereas seed fall after autumn burning was more sporadic. The comparative and interactive roles that seed supply and seedbed conditions play in limiting recruitment of jarrah were also studied. Low seedling densities were recorded across all six burnt study sites. The fact that ample levels of post-burn seed fall produced such low seedling numbers suggested that adequate seed supply did not coincide with seedbed conditions suitable for mass seedling regeneration. Conditions favourable for seedling recruitment were highly variable within sites, since both seed supply and seedbed conditions were spatially heterogeneous. Fine-scale areas burnt to mineral soil showed an additive influence to the overwhelmingly dominant factor of seed supply on seedling recruitment. However, the capacity of low intensity burns to produce these seedbed conditions at a broad scale is limited. Results of this study suggest that successful stocking of shelterwood-treated jarrah forest is not always achievable following a disturbance event, such as post-harvest burning under mild conditions. The chances of a large seed supply coinciding with broad-scale seedbed conditions favourable for mass germination, emergence and establishment appear to be low. Successful stocking of shelterwood-treated jarrah forest is more likely to be a longer term outcome achieved through episodic recruitment, when favourable environmental conditions coincide with optimal seedbed conditions. Such episodic recruitment strategies may be common in resource-limited systems such as jarrah forest and other dry eucalypt forest systems, where conditions controlling the regeneration niche are often variable and unpredictable...|$|E
