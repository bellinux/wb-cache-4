5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene <b>space</b> <b>heaters,</b> and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning <b>space</b> <b>heaters,</b> stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E

25|$|Propane and butane are gases at {{atmospheric}} pressure {{that can be}} liquefied at fairly low pressures and {{are commonly known as}} liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles, butane in <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{gas heating}} systems may cause carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, <b>space</b> <b>heaters,</b> water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} acutely toxic indoor air {{contaminants}} is carbon monoxide (CO), a colourless, odourless gas that is a byproduct of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Common sources of carbon monoxide are tobacco smoke, <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> using fossil fuels, defective central heating furnaces and automobile exhaust. By depriving the brain of oxygen, high levels of carbon monoxide can lead to nausea, unconsciousness and death. According to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the time-weighted average (TWA) limit for carbon monoxide (630-08-0) is 25 ppm.|$|E
50|$|A micathermic heater {{is a type}} of <b>space</b> <b>heater</b> {{in which}} the heating element is covered in thin sheets of mica. Micathermic heaters produce both {{convection}} heat and radiant heat, and are usually thinner than other types of heaters.|$|R

500|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that more than 40,000 people per year seek medical attention for carbon monoxide poisoning in the United States. 95% of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in the United States are due to gas <b>space</b> <b>heaters.</b> In many industrialized countries carbon monoxide is the cause of more than 50% of fatal poisonings. In the United States, approximately 200 people die each year from carbon monoxide poisoning associated with home fuel-burning heating equipment. Carbon monoxide poisoning contributes to the approximately 5613 smoke inhalation deaths each year in the United States. The CDC reports, [...] "Each year, more than 500 Americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning, and more than 2,000 commit suicide by intentionally poisoning themselves." [...] For the 10-year period from 1979 to 1988, 56,133 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning occurred in the United States, with 25,889 of those being suicides, leaving 30,244 unintentional deaths. A report from New Zealand showed that 206 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the years of 2001 and 2002. In total carbon monoxide poisoning was responsible for 43.9% of deaths by poisoning in that country. In South Korea, 1,950 people had been poisoned by carbon monoxide with 254 deaths from 2001 through 2003. A report from Jerusalem showed 3.53 per 100,000 people were poisoned annually from 2001 through 2006. In Hubei, China, 218 deaths from poisoning were reported over a 10-year period with 16.5% being from carbon monoxide exposure.|$|E
2500|$|More {{ubiquitous}} {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, kerosene <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> were often built into kitchen ranges, and kept many farm and fishing families warm and dry through the winter. At one time, citrus growers used a smudge pot fueled by kerosene to create a pall of thick smoke over a grove {{in an effort to}} prevent freezing temperatures from damaging crops. [...] "Salamanders" [...] are kerosene <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> used on construction sites to dry out building materials and to warm workers. Before the days of electrically lighted road barriers, highway construction zones were marked at night by kerosene fired, pot-bellied torches. Most of these uses of kerosene created thick black smoke because of the low temperature of combustion.|$|E
2500|$|Line voltage {{thermostats}} {{are most}} commonly used for electric <b>space</b> <b>heaters</b> such as a baseboard heater or a direct-wired electric furnace. [...] If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat. With switching current often exceeding 40 amperes, using a low voltage thermostat on a line voltage circuit will result {{at least in the}} failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire. [...] Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of fan-coil (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system) [...] units in large systems using centralized boilers and chillers, or to control circulation pumps in hydronic heating applications.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the impact of {{different}} natural gas and electricity end-use technologies in the residential sector, which compete among themselves in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. The analysis of 17 different technology options, which were chosen in order to match the consumption behaviour of a typical Portuguese family, has shown that the use of electric heat pumps, both for space and water-heating, combined with the use of a natural gas cooker, leads to the lowest energy consumption and to the lowest environmental impacts in terms of carbon emissions. Considering only the running costs, this choice is 45 % more economic than having a natural gas centralised heating system combined with a gas cooker, and is 60 % more economic than having an electric resistance <b>space</b> <b>heater</b> combined with an electric storage water heater and electric cooker, which is the worst case. The life cycle cost (LCC) analysis shows that the economic optimum is reached by the combination of a natural gas water heater with an electric storage <b>space</b> <b>heater,</b> and a natural gas cooker. The cost of conserved carbon (CCC) analysis shows that the combination of an electric heat pump water heater with an electric storage <b>space</b> <b>heater,</b> and a natural gas cooker is the best option in terms of environmental performance.
