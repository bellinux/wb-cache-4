40|$|The {{manufacturing}} sector of Pakistan has at times {{played the role}} of the leading sector of the economy. The successful experience of planned growth in the 1960 s owes much to the special attention paid to the growth of {{manufacturing sector}}. Policies like the export bonus scheme, tax-holidays, <b>subsidised</b> <b>import</b> of capital, easy and subsidised loans and over-valued exchange rate, resulted in a substantial growth in the sector. However, with over-protection of the sector, nationalisation of some of the major industries in the 1970 s and, later-on, over-employment in the nationalised industries, the performance of the sector started to deteriorate gradually. It is now widely believed that many of the manufacturing industries in Pakistan have become inefficient because they have not been exposed to competitive environment due to protective and distortionary policies. It is to be expected that distortions like those mentioned would have not only eroded the performance but also affected the behaviour of the manufacturing sector. It is therefore important to determine how productivity growth in the manufacturing sector has been retarded over time and what type of changes in technology have taken place in terms of their effects on factor intensities and on the firms, reaction to such changes in factor prices. An analysis of the changes over time in production technology of the manufacturing sector may provide an answer to these questions. The present study aims at analysing changes in the cost structure of Pakistan’s manufacturing sector {{over the past two decades}} in order to study the nature and speed of productivity growth; determine whether there exists any factor bias in the technological changes; and to analyse how technology has adjusted to absorb changes in the relative factor prices. ...|$|E
50|$|A trade defence {{instrument}} is a European Union anti-dumping, anti-subsidy, or safeguard measure {{carried out to}} defend its producers against unfairly traded or <b>subsidised</b> <b>imports</b> and against dramatic shifts in trade flows {{in so far as}} these are harmful to the EU economy.|$|R
40|$|Countervailing {{investigations}} {{are aimed at}} determining whether <b>subsidised</b> <b>imports</b> cause material injury to a domestic industry producing the like product to the imported product (art VI. 6 (a) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994; art 19. 1 of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies Agreement)). The WTO GATT 1994 contains some rules regarding countervailing investigations (art VI), {{but most of the}} rules are contained in the Subsidies Agreement. If it is found that <b>subsidised</b> <b>imports</b> cause material injury to the domestic industry, the importing country may impose countervailing duties to offset the effect of the subsidisation (art VI. 6 (a) of GATT 1994; art 19. 1 of the Subsidies Agreement). South Africa, as a WTO Member and therefore signatory to the Subsidies Agreement, is required to conduct countervailing investigations in line with the Subsidies Agreement (art II. 2 of the WTO Agreement; Degussa Africa (Pty) Ltd and Another v International Trade Administration Commission and Others (22264 / 2007) [2007] ZAGPHC 112 (20 June 2007), available at [URL] The Subsidies Agreement specifically requires Members to indicate in their legislation how the margin of subsidisation will be determined (art 14).

50|$|After the 1992 famine, {{foreign aid}} was made {{conditional}} on re-establishing political liberalisation. The privatised ADMARC received limited state funding {{to create a}} Strategic Grain Reserve of 180,000 tonnes to stabilise prices for farmers and consumers and had to use commercial loans to import large quantities of maize {{each year in the}} 1990s. From 1997, after criticism from the World Bank that ADMARC was <b>subsidising</b> <b>imports</b> of maize, ADMARC lost responsibility for this, controlling only domestically-produced grain. The Malawi government required it to buy domestic maize at a fixed minimum price to support farmers, and this forced ADMARC to sell its strategic reserve in 1997, and again in 2000 to pay off its commercial loans, creating insecurity.|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims to {{illustrate}} how Food Aid, Free Trade Agreements, and Agricultural Dumping are closely related. By drawing the relation between these three seemingly separate issues, a divergent perspective upon the global trading system is exposed. The thesis reaches its outcome by using both macro and micro analyses. Where macro analyses allows the debate {{to have a more}} theoretical nature, the micro analyses of the case study on Agricultural Dumping in Mozambique shows a more practical side of the debate. By the use of these two analytical tools, the thesis illustrates how Agricultural Dumping is a negative effect of Food Aid, enabled through Free Trade Agreements. As open market policies and low domestic protection are part of these agreements, local agricultural markets in sub- Saharan Africa become unable to compete with <b>subsidised</b> <b>imported</b> agricultural goods. Hence, the three issues all contribute to an unequal market system that, in certain situations, provides advantages for the donor country and leaves the receiving country at a disadvantage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of trade policy responses to rising world food prices by carrying {{out a series of}} stylised experiments in the wheat market using a world trade model, GTAP. The sequence of events that is modelled comprises a negative wheat supply shock and subsequent implementation of an export tax by a major net exporter and a reduction in import tariffs by a small importer. The effects of trade policy responses are contrasted with those of full liberalisation of the wheat market. At the core are the (opposite) effects on producers and consumers, as well as the terms of-trade and trade tax revenue effects. Food security is shown to depend crucially on changes in prices but also in incomes that are associated with changes in factor returns. The results reveal that major net exporters are generally better off when implementing export taxes for food security purposes. Large exporting countries export price instability causing world food prices to rise further. Net importing countries lose out and have limited leeway to reduce tariffs or <b>subsidise</b> <b>imports.</b> Liberalising wheat trade mitigates rising prices and contributes to food security, but to the detriment of production in Africa and Asia, making them more dependent on and vulnerable to changes in the world market. Concerted action at the WTO forum is required, notably clarifying and sharpening the rules regarding export measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} State aids (or subsidies) in an {{international}} perspective is a permanent source of conflicts because {{it is at the}} junction of three opposite views — the mercantilist attitude, the pure trade theory and the political economy approach. First, in a mercantilist perspective focusing on exports and domestic producers (to the detriment of imports and domestic consumers), that subsidies increase imports or reduce exports of the trading partners of the subsidising country is ‘unfair’ competition. Firms under foreign subsidy pressures feel that they cannot ‘compete with foreign governments’ and they lobby for ‘countervailing’ those foreign subsidies. Second, the pure trade theory has two stands. It underlines the fact that <b>subsidised</b> <b>imports</b> from trading partners are a benefit for the consumers of the importing country. And it shows that subsidies are among the least distorting instruments for solving a long list of problems. In particular, they are less distorting than tariffs or non-tariff barriers (NTBs). If public action favouring a particular activity is desired or if {{there is a need to}} compensate for economic distortions, then subsidised production funded by general taxation is likely to be the best instrument to be used. Lastly, the third view based on a political economy approach stresses the fact that State aids are easily captured by vested interests for their own agenda — hence becoming a source of waste of scarce economic resources. This approach explains the wide reluctance among economists to support subsidies and their perception that State aids should be constrained for domestic reasons — in sharp contrast with the first view which focuses on disciplines to be imposed on foreign subsidies and with the second view suggesting the use of subsidies for many purposes ( [...] .) ...|$|R
25|$|Some theorists, such as Martin Khor of the Third World Network, {{point out}} that many {{developing}} nations have gone from being food independent to being net food importing economies since the 1970s and 1980s International Monetary Fund (and later the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Agriculture) free market economics directives to debtor nations. In opening developing countries to developed world food <b>imports</b> <b>subsidised</b> by Western governments, developing nations can become more dependent upon food imports if local agriculture does not improve.|$|R
40|$|Tanzania's 2005 push to {{increase}} rice production by ambitious rural {{investments in irrigation}} and by tariff protection of its rice industry from cheap <b>imported</b> <b>subsidised</b> rice has apparently highlevel political support. Yet, the implementation has run into problems: non-compliance with the tariff, substantial smuggling of cheap rice through Zanzibar, and low sustainability of irrigation schemes due to poor local-level operation and maintenance. These implementation problems arise because for the ruling elite, the political goals of winning elections and maintaining coalitions {{are more important than}} economic goals of strengthening the rice industry. Such political considerations influence how the enforcement capacity of tax authorities (to ensure tariff compliance and clamp-down on smuggling) and local governments (to ensure viable operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes) are actually used. Ideological notions about 'modernising agriculture' have also motivated the ruling elite to push for irrigation...|$|R
40|$|Magister Philosophiae - MPhilSub-Saharan African {{countries}} in general with particular reference to Ghana, Cameroon and Burkina Faso depend mostly on agriculture which {{is seen as}} the main source of income. Agriculture provides income for {{a large percentage of the}} rural population, and employs about 70 per cent of its labour force with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about 30 per cent. Ghana, Cameroon and Burkina Faso as well as a large majority of African countries depend on subsistence farming and the cultivation of subsistence crops helps provide food and ensures food security for the people. Although they mostly depend on subsistence crops, they also produce primary export crops such as cocoa for Ghana, coffee for Cameroon, and cotton for Burkina Faso which represent a major source of foreign exchange. Due to the significant importance of agriculture in the above countries Ghana, Cameroon and Burkina Faso, gave great importance to agriculture by part taking in international trade negotiations or agreements on agriculture. These countries were involved more vigorously in the Uruguay Round where agricultural products were fully covered by multilateral trade rules for the first time. Farmers from Ghana, Cameroon and Burkina Faso are faced with so many challenges in exporting their agricultural products to world markets despite their participation in the agricultural trade reforms. They have restricted access to rich countries agricultural markets and they also face unfair competition in their own domestic markets from <b>subsidised</b> <b>imports</b> of food staples from wealthy countries. Other challenges such as: trade barriers, inadequate trade infrastructure (logistics and transportation), and inadequate institution serving farmers and agriculture and lack of technology to transform traditional agriculture are also of great importance. With regard to the above challenges faced by Ghana, Cameroon and Burkina Faso this research is to examine or analyse the impacts that international trade reforms have on the agricultural exports focusing on primary products (cash crops), such as cocoa, coffee and cotton which are a major source of export revenue for these countries and the livelihood basis for millions of rural households who grow these crops. The research will also look at the challenges faced by Ghana, Cameroon and Burkina Faso in exporting their agricultural products to developed countries‘ markets despite their participation in the international trade agreements on agriculture. Taking a look at the international trade reforms it can be seen that while the Uruguay Round will have a significant impact on global trade and economic welfare, its effect on the above countries‘ agricultural exports is expected to be much smaller, and if anything maybe negative. Ghana, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and most African countries are likely to gain slightly from tariff cuts and the elimination of non-tariff barriers on manufactured products. These countries will find themselves slightly worse off as a result of cuts to developed countries' subsidies to their agricultural exports, which tends to increase world food prices...|$|R
40|$|In 1980 s, the Chinese-Pakistan {{all-weather}} friendship materialised {{with the}} creation of a modern highway that links Kashgar, in China, to Rawalpindi, in Pakistan. The highway has also enabled intense food goods exchanges between the North and the South of the country. As part of the national development trends of the Pakistani government, these economic exchanges of food, combined with modernisation, should contribute to food security. Yet according to official surveys, food security is declining. This research analyses the local conceptions of food security in the Northern areas {{in order to understand the}} complex food security situation in the North, using the Karakoram Highway as a temporal and spatial analytical tool. The results reveal issues of scale between Northern and national discourses of food security. The national development discourse of food security – strongly influenced by foreign donors such as the US and the FAO – focuses on economic growth, the productionist paradigm and globalisation. Local conceptions of food security are shaped by communities’ history, culture and relationships with nature. Most communities, except former ports on ancient trade routes, reject the highway as a mean to access <b>subsidised</b> and <b>imported</b> food, and instead only rely on tradition micro food systems to maintain their identity and their food sovereignty. The importance of relationships between people is fundamental to local concepts of food security, where survival depends on social cohesion amongst and within sister communities regarding food. The findings challenge the main contemporary concept of food security formulated by the FAO and the World Bank. This study denounces the invalidity of the FAO methodology and it calls for a reformulation of current institutional concepts of food security. It calls for a concept that excludes power relations embedded in the Western symbolic of hunger, and that includes the various local perceptions of food security...|$|R
40|$|On May 15, 2002, the EU {{posted a}} {{detailed}} {{critique of the}} US farm Bill on its web site. This memo pointed out that: it {{will result in a}} 70 - 80 % increase in US agricultural expenditures over the next six years; it will allow US farmers to be subsidised to the full extent of WTO limits; it will guarantee farmers a given level of income and reduce responsiveness to market signals; it could mean farmers gain more when prices are low, providing no disincentive to over production; it will increase production on marginal land; it will provide greater subsidies when prices are low and over stimulate production; it will drive down prices on world markets. The memo gives a detailed breakdown of the subsidies contained in the Farm Bill, which also includes rather vague environmental programmes. The EU's major criticism is that payments to farmers are directly production related. The EU memo outlines the various ways in which the US is seeking to 'stretch' WTO rules to accommodate the new Farm Bill. Nevertheless, the price depressing effects of the Bill will probably mean that US expenditure ultimately exceeds WTO ceilings. The memo outlines the likely external effects of the new Bill, including: greater volumes of cheap subsidised US products on world markets; a less attractive US market for third country exports as domestic prices are dragged down; more competitive US food processing industries through the availability of cheaper raw materials. The memo also strongly criticises the food aid components of the Bill and the predatory use of export credits and export promotion programmes. The memo seeks to compare EU and US farm aid programmes and raises the following points: The value of EU and US agricultural production was almost identical at about US $ 190 billion. In 2000, the producer subsidy equivalent in the US was US $ 49 billion compared to US $ 90 billion in the EU. Support per full time farmer was US $ 20 000 in the US and US $ 14 000 in the EU. The per capita cost in the US was US $ 338 per annum compared to US $ 276 in the EU. The EU receives 75 % of agricultural exports from developing countries. The EU exports far less to the developing world than the US, whose market share in $ terms is increasing, while the EU's is falling. The EU's system of export subsidies is transparent and disciplined by WTO reduction commitments. Export subsidies are declining in importance and no longer a major source of trade distortions. On the other hand, the US system of export credits is considered a major source of trade distortion. In addition to the EU, the Cairns Group has roundly condemned the new US Farm Bill, maintaining it 'will hurt farmers around the world' and 'undermine efforts to achieve global reform of this heavily subsidised and distorted sector'. Since reducing agricultural subsidies was seen as a key element in any 'Development Round', the US Farm Bill does not bode well for post-Doha agricultural negotiations. Particular concerns have also been expressed in Africa, where it is feared the Bill will drive down the prices of commodities on which Africa economies depend. Caribbean governments also feel let down by the new US Farm Bill particularly since their rural economies are already being undermined by cheap <b>subsidised</b> <b>imports.</b> According to Roger Clark, the Jamaican Agricultural Minister, the Bill will require Caribbean governments to 're-think our strategy'. Comment: A number of interesting points emerge from the EU memo on the new US Farm Bill. Firstly, even after the increase in US expenditures, the EU will still be spending more on agricultural support than the US in terms of total production value. Secondly, while EU exports to developing countries declined between 1998 and 2000 from US $ 16. 8 billion to US $ 16. 5 billion, this is largely due to the Euro's depreciation against the US Dollar, which also accounts for the declining US $ denominated value of EU imports from developing countries over the same period. Thirdly, although well founded, the criticisms of the US Farm Bill regarding the effects of the new Farm Bill simply mirror the effects of CAP reform. Beef prices for ACP suppliers have dropped 28 - 30 % since the Agenda 2000 reforms in the beef sector. Likewise EU cereal prices have dropped 50 % since 1992, improving the competitiveness of EU cereal-based food processing industries and the domestic and export competitiveness of the EU feed-based livestock industry: poultry exports have increased 150 % over the period. There has also been a greatly reduced need for export refunds. It is very clear that when the elephants fight, the grass suffers. Hence African and Caribbean governments are deeply concerned by the effects of the US Farm Bill. The situation emerging seems to be that if subsidised EU producers do not get your market, subsidised US producers will. On May 15, 2002, the EU posted a detailed critique of the US farm Bill on its [...] ...|$|R
