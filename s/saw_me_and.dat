I think {{he did not like}} me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E

500|$|By the {{following}} year, {{the case against}} Andrić was dropped {{due to lack of}} evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915. The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić's mother soon came to see her son, and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest. [...] "Mother is very happy," [...] Andrić wrote. [...] "It has been three whole years since she <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> she can't grasp all that has happened to me in that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother." ...|$|E
2500|$|On hearing {{screams in}} a room, I went up {{a sort of}} tunnel passage and saw an Arab {{in the act of}} cutting off a child's head with a sword. He had already hit him and was having another cut, but on seeing me he tried to aim the stroke at me, but missed; he was {{practically}} on the muzzle of my rifle. I shot him low in the groin. Behind him was a Jewish woman smothered in blood with a man I recognized as a police constable named Issa Sheriff from Jaffa. He was standing over the woman with a dagger in his hand. He <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> bolted into a room close by and tried to shut me out-shouting in Arabic, [...] "Your Honor, I am a policeman." ... I got into the room and shot him.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1990s, Steeleye often toured as part {{of double}} bill, {{supporting}} Status Quo, or featuring support from artists such as Rock Salt & Nails and The Rankin Family. When Steeleye Span supported Status Quo on tour in 1996, the latter had just issued their version of [...] "All Around My Hat" [...] as a single. [...] "The video was filmed at Christmas," [...] Prior recalled. [...] "We'd supported them, and I found myself down in the mosh pit. Francis <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> told the audience, 'Oh look, there's a Maddy lookalike down there… Fuck me, it is Maddy!' I was hoyed over the barrier , to join them for the encore.

2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
