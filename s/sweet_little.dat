Rashvin Bedi, writing for Malaysian newspaper The Star, praised the album, saying that [...] "Connie sings with ease and manages the high notes admirably", but asked whether [...] "people would buy an album of the same songs sung by a 20-year-old".|$|E
500|$|On 4 October 2006, it was {{announced}} that actress Nadine Lewington had been cast in the role of Maddy. Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and told him how lucky he was to have me and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really <b>sweet</b> <b>little</b> story actually. Very touching".|$|E

Conrad also released the fashion guide Lauren Conrad Style in 2010. She later made appearances on the syndicated game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, playing for her charity [...] "m.powerment by mark" [...] and , and {{also served as a}} guest judge on the thirteenth cycle of America's Next Top Model.

500|$|Coward won new {{popularity}} in several notable films {{later in his}} career, such as Around the World in 80 Days (1956), Our Man in Havana (1959), Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), Boom! (1968) and The Italian Job (1969). Stage and film opportunities he turned down in the 1950s included an invitation to compose a musical version of Pygmalion (two years before My Fair Lady was written), and offers of {{the roles of the}} king in the original stage production of The King and I, and Colonel Nicholson in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. Invited to play the title role in the 1962 film Dr. No, he replied, [...] "No, no, no, a thousand times, no." [...] In the same year, he turned down the role of Humbert Humbert in Lolita, saying, [...] "At my time of life the film story would be logical if the 12-year-old heroine was a <b>sweet</b> <b>little</b> old lady." ...|$|E
500|$|A few reviewers {{remarked on}} how the Hipsters {{seemed to be a}} {{reflection}} of the New Directions crew in fifty years, with Futterman getting into specifics: [...] "We see future Rachel start the number with a cane and future Mercedes break through to finish the song off with a riff, and it's hard not to be endeared to them." [...] Poniewozik wrote that Rachel's [...] "silent reminder to Kurt to smile on stage was a perfect, <b>sweet</b> <b>little</b> moment", a sentiment shared by Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly. Poniewozik also noted that [...] "Lea Michele had some of her strongest non-singing moments of the season by showing not just how Rachel dealt with her problems with Finn but with being {{on the periphery of the}} group." [...] The storyline that featured the disintegration of the Rachel–Finn relationship, when commented on at all, was viewed unfavorably; VanDerWerff called it a [...] "stupid twist".|$|E
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their <b>sweet</b> <b>little</b> girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum. The video was first shown on Disney Channel on August 25, 2006, following the premiere of The Cheetah Girls 2. Hudgens walks onto the set of a music video, applies her makeup and changes her shoes. She then performs while dancing against a brightly lit backdrop. Next, she is shown performing and dancing in a black room with numerous chandeliers flickering on and off. She later appears on a red stage with circles flickering in various colors. Afterwards, more shots of the black room is shown, including one in which she is swinging on a chandelier. In the last scene, she sings and dances {{in front of a}} colorful background. Black-and-white shots of her and her friends are interspersed throughout the video, and Hudgens' friend, actress Alexa Nikolas, makes an appearance. The Arizona Republic writer Bill Goodykoontz wrote that Hudgens shows a somewhat mature side in the video: [...] "hen your only context for ever having seen Hudgens is starring as Gabriella, the <b>sweet</b> <b>little</b> brainiac in High School Musical, it's certainly different to see her flouncing around in spaghetti-strap tops, rolling her shoulders and whatnot."

500|$|Nintendo first {{confirmed}} {{an unnamed}} Metroid title {{would be released}} for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console on March 23, 2001. Despite speculation that the game {{would be based on}} Super Metroid, Ken Lobb, Nintendo of America's Director of Game Development, quelled rumors by stating, [...] "One of the things I wanted to get across in today's meeting is that Metroid is not Super Metroid. It's something new. [...] And that's something that will hopefully be seen at E3 for our <b>sweet</b> <b>little</b> Game Boy Advance." [...] The first video footage from the game, a 10-second clip, was shown to the public on May 18, 2001, at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo; by then, the game was titled Metroid IV. At the E3 convention the following year, IGN awarded the game, titled Metroid Fusion, their Best of Show and Best Action Game awards. The game was scheduled for a North American release date of November 18, 2002. On August 22, 2002, Nintendo announced that the game can connect to Metroid Prime for the GameCube, a Metroid game that was released on the same day as Fusion. In Europe, the game was released on November 22, 2002, followed by the Australian release on November 29. The game was also released in Japan on February 14, 2003, and in China on March 2, 2006.|$|E

Gary Trust of Billboard reported that [...] "response among radio programmers {{to the song}} has been almost universally positive." [...] Among these were Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger, who {{felt it was a}} [...] "sweet, mid-tempo love song" [...] that, with [...] "orchestral strings" [...] and [...] "creamy backing vocals" [...] by Jackson's brothers, gave it a [...] "crisp beat." [...] In contrast, Darryl Sterdan of The Winnipeg Sun gave it a 3 out of 5 rating, saying, [...] "This may be something, but it's not 'It'... On the whole, it's a <b>sweet</b> <b>little</b> number -- but it doesn't live up to its authoritative title." [...] Todd Martens, of the Los Angeles Timess Pop & Hiss music blog, called [...] "This Is It" [...] a [...] "trifle" [...] and while the track [...] "certainly won't embarrass Jackson's legacy or break the hearts of fans eager to hear Jackson's voice again" [...] it does [...] "bring the fallen pop icon a little back down to earth." [...] Jessica Robertson, an AOL music editor, said, [...] "It's a safe, mid-tempo pop ballad that features what his fans love: his trademark breathy vocals and confident delivery. I don't think it will set the world on fire, because it's missing what fans and critics love most about his songs, which is a strong and powerful groove to carry it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{primary focus}} of the episode was on Mike and T.C.'s {{learning}} to trust and look out for each other, while many other denizens of Fenster were introduced who would have also comprised the cast of the spin-off.

She started touring Europe in 1952 and was hailed by critics as the [...] "world's greatest gospel singer". In Paris she was called the Angel of Peace, and throughout the continent she sang to capacity audiences. The tour, however, had to be cut short due to exhaustion. She began a radio series on CBS and signed to Columbia Records in 1954. A writer for DownBeat music magazine stated on November 17, 1954: [...] "It is generally agreed that the greatest spiritual singer now alive is Mahalia Jackson." [...] Her debut album for Columbia was The World's Greatest Gospel Singer, recorded in 1954, followed by a Christmas album called <b>Sweet</b> <b>Little</b> Jesus Boy and Bless This House in 1956.|$|E

Donna Kaufman of IVillage was amused with Swift's idea of what happened at a university library which was portrayed in the music video, writing [...] "it's all very cute in that patented Taylor Swift way." [...] Leah Collins of The Vancouver Sun complimented the video for its departure from music-video high school.
