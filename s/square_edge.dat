Nothing was ever, nor could be ever invented, fitter for its purpose, or more easily cut. From the arch it therefore found its way into every position where the edge of a piece of stone projected, and became, from its constancy of occurrence in the latest Gothic as well as the earliest Byzantine, most truly deserving of the name of the [...] "Venetian Dentil." [...] Its complete intention is now, however, only to be seen in the pictures of Gentile Bellini and Vittor Carpaccio; for, like most of the rest of the mouldings of Venetian buildings, it was always either gilded or painted--often both, gold being laid on the faces of the dentils, and their recesses colored alternately red and blue.|$|E

The jaws of bypass loppers may be straight, curved, or one curved with one straight. Anvil loppers have a single sharpened blade, with a straight or sometimes curved edge, that closes against a similarly contoured flat anvil like surface {{on the other side}} of the jaws, usually made of a softer metal than the blade.|$|E

50|$|Hall's babbler is {{the species}} most often {{confused}} with the white-browed babbler because of their similarity in size, the two can best be distinguished by comparing the supercilium. Hall’s babbler has a narrow and very dark brown crown-stripe with a much broader, vivid white supercilium. Secondly, Hall’s babbler {{does not have a}} ‘fading’ eye-stripe towards the rear of the head where there is more chestnut brown colouration. Individuals will have vivid colouration on the face and will never have a white dot under the eye which is sometimes present in the white-browed babbler. The tail will also have a <b>square</b> <b>edge</b> rather than a round edge which the white-browed babbler would have, however this feature is sometimes not as reliable in juvenile individuals.|$|E
50|$|Now, if one {{positions}} {{the snap}} ring with its flat side {{such that it}} is pushed into the rounded edge of the snap ring groove when load or force is applied, the flat and <b>square</b> <b>edge</b> of the snap ring will “bite” into the rounded edge of the retaining groove and as more force is applied the snap ring will distort as it rides up the rounded edge. This distortion will spread an external snap ring or compress an internal snap ring, leaving it prone to possibly being forced from the groove and releasing the part {{it is designed to}} hold.See the accompanying pictures as to how this works and how to properly orient the snap ring in the groove.|$|E

At {{the time of his}} death, Apple's laboratory was in Sullivan's Island near Charleston, South Carolina. In 2012 the David J Apple International Laboratory for Ocular Pathology was re-located and re-established at Heidelberg University, in the University Eye Department. Professor Gerd U. Auffarth, Eye Department Chairman - a former research fellow in the Apple Korps - outlined his plans to create an international laboratory for research on intraocular ophthalmic devices, thus continuing and extending the research work initiated by David Apple. [...] The laboratory in Heidelberg holds Professor Apple’s archives, historical laboratory samples and correspondence.:Amon-Apple Enhanced <b>Square</b> <b>Edge.</b> This is a barrier to cell proliferation at the haptic-optic junction of single-piece IOLs. The Edge was first developed by Peter Toop and Mike Ring - both engineers at the IOL manufacturer Rayner Intraocular Lenses Limited in 2003, after taking advice from Prof. Michael Amon, Ophthalmic Surgeon in Vienna, Austria and advice from David Apple. The design feature is intended to reduce Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO) by creating an insurmountable physical barrier to cell migration from the haptic surface onto the optic surface of the lens. Both Amon and Apple recognised in 2002 (through respectively a laboratory study on Centerflex minus power lenses and a clinical study of the regular power Centerflex lenses [...] ) that all modern single-piece, injectable IOLs in 2002 had a weakness (which Apple termed the [...] "Achilles heel") at the haptic-optic junction: where there is no <b>square</b> <b>edge</b> and thus an incomplete barrier to PCO.|$|E

Laboratory tests were conducted to determine graphical relationships and coefficients for estimating the head loss for orifices made from galvanized sheet metal. The loss coefficient, K 0, {{is a function of}} the orifice-to-pipe diameter ratio, 13, „ and can be expressed by an equation of the form Ko = afg where a and b are empirical constants determined from the tests. Comparisons made between machined, <b>square</b> <b>edge</b> orifices commonly used for flow measurement, and those made in sheet metal shops for irrigation showed that the irrigation orifices have a higher discharge coefficient and a lower head loss coefficient than do the <b>square</b> <b>edge</b> orifices. <b>Square</b> <b>edge</b> orifices placed in irrigation pipe couplings behaved similarly to those for flow measurement, particularly in the mid and lower ranges of the diameter ratio, P o.

40|$|AIM: To compare {{posterior}} capsule opacification (PCO) {{degree and}} visual functions after phacoemulsification in eyes implanted with 360 -degree <b>square</b> <b>edge</b> hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) (570 C C-flex, Rayner) and sharp edge hydrophobic acrylic IOL (Sensar AR 40 e, AMO) in diabetic patients. METHODS: Sixty diabetic patients underwent uneventful phacoemulsification and randomly implanted {{one of the}} two IOLs. The PCO value was measured by retroillumination photographs and Evaluation of Posterior Capsule Opacification (EPCO) 2000 image-analysis software at 1, 6, 12, and 24 mo after surgery. Visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity in photopic and mesopic conditions were also examined at each follow up time point. The incidence of eye that required Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy were also compared. RESULTS: There was not any statistically significant difference in PCO scores between Rayner C-flex 570 C group and Sensar AR 40 e group at each follow up time point. Visual acuity, Nd:YAG capsulotomy incidence and contrast sensitivity also had no significant difference during the 24 mo follow-up. CONCLUSION: For diabetic patients, Rayner 570 C C-flex and Sensar AR 40 e IOLs are same effective for prevent PCO. The 360 -degree <b>square</b> <b>edge</b> design maybe is a good alternative technique to improve PCO prevention...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the surgical outcome and complications of phacoemulsification and the implantation of an acryl foldable intraocular lens (IOL) with a <b>squared</b> <b>edge</b> in dogs with cataracts. Thirty-two eyes from 26 dogs were examined. The mean follow up period was 75. 9 days ranging from 23 to 226 days. The complications after phacoemulsification were posterior capsular opacity (PCO) around the IOL (n = 11), ocular hypertension (n = 4), focal posterior synechia (n = 4), hyphema (n = 3) and corneal ulcer (n = 2). The complications {{associated with the}} IOL were decenteration of the optic (n = 2) and ventral haptic displacement (n = 1). Most cases of PCO were found only around {{the margin of the}} IOL, and all eyes had vision during the observation period.
