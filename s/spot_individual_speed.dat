40|$|Highway {{and traffic}} {{engineers}} collect vehicular speed data with detectors {{based on a}} variety of fixed and mobile device technologies, to support analysis and design activities. Most acquisition units aggregate speed data into speed classes for ease of management and storage. An unfortunate result of this practice is a significant loss of content associated with <b>individual</b> <b>speed</b> data. Moreover, the use of <b>individual</b> <b>speeds</b> is often necessary to support road safety analysis and speed management decisions. For bridging of this gap, this paper introduces an algorithm that disaggregates speed data collected with automatic road detectors that can measure speed frequency only in intervals. The objective is to obtain backcalculated <b>individual</b> <b>speeds</b> that operate with continuous distribution functions rather than discrete ones. This information allows the derivation of more robust, basic descriptive measures (average, variance, and percentiles) according to normal, lognormal, and gamma probability distribution functions. Therefore, the information produced is more useful than that calculated from standard aggregated speed reports. In this investigation, <b>individual</b> <b>speed</b> data collected from video cameras were used to derive reference distributions and descriptive measures on the same road sections where inductive double-loop detectors were installed. Comparisons of the backcalculated <b>individual</b> <b>speeds</b> and those collected from video cameras support the validity of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of pointwise density estimation, we {{introduce}} the notion of best possible <b>individual</b> minimax <b>speed</b> of convergence over Hölder classes Pd(β, L), leading to a new uniform risk criterion, weighted according to the inverse of this <b>individual</b> <b>speed</b> of convergence. While it bears similarities to the oracle approach, our concept keeps the classical notion of minimax optimality and is not restricted to a prespecified class of estimators. The <b>individual</b> <b>speed</b> of convergence is getting faster as the density approaches zero, being substantially faster than the classical minimax optimal rate.

40|$|In many animals, melanin-based {{coloration}} {{is strongly}} heritable and is largely {{insensitive to the}} environment and body condition. According to the handicap principle, such a trait may not reveal individual quality because the production of different melanin-based colorations often entails similar costs. However, a recent study showed that the production of eumelanin pigments requires relatively large amounts of calcium, potentially implying that melanin-based coloration is associated with physiological processes requiring calcium. If this is the case, eumelanism may be traded-off against other metabolic processes that require the same elements. We used a correlative approach to examine, for the first time, this proposition in the barn owl, a species in which individuals vary in the amount, size, and blackness of eumelanic spots. For this purpose, we measured calcium concentration in the left humerus of 85 dead owls. Results showed that the humeri of heavily <b>spotted</b> <b>individuals</b> had a higher concentration of calcium. This suggests either that plumage spottiness signals the ability to absorb calcium from the diet for both eumelanin production and storage in bones, or that lightly <b>spotted</b> <b>individuals</b> use more calcium for metabolic processes at the expense of calcium storage in bones. Our study supports the idea that eumelanin-based coloration is associated with a number of physiological processes requiring calcium...|$|R

40|$|The V 85 speed {{reflects}} the 85 th percentile speed of vehicles in a traffic stream passing a given element {{on the highway}} section. The large amount of speed differential in V 85 between the two successive elements along a highway reflects lack of speed consistency in the highway section. This lack of speed consistency can result in increased crash risk. Recent research points to several {{problems associated with the}} conventional method of measuring [Delta]V 85 between successive highway elements: (1) failure to reflect <b>individual</b> vehicle <b>speed</b> profiles; and (2) failure to account for inter-dependence in <b>individual</b> vehicle <b>speeds</b> between successive elements. These problems have serious implications for justifying safety treatment when conventional [Delta]V 85 measure is applied. A number of researchers have suggested that the estimated speed differential based on <b>individual</b> vehicle <b>speed</b> profiles in successive elements is significantly higher than that obtained using the conventional approach. In this paper, we assess the safety implications of using the conventional [Delta]V 85 and introduce a hierarchical model for considering <b>individual</b> vehicles <b>speed</b> consistency. These findings lead to important implications for introducing engineering treatments to improve safety along in two-lane rural highways based on the criteria of speed consistency. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{a special}} {{application of a}} video-image system (AUTOSCOPE) to track main-street through movement vehicles and measure their <b>individual</b> <b>speeds</b> at two-way stop-controlled intersections. The initial objective of this application was to find an automated means to collect vehicle speeds at unsignalized intersections {{for the purpose of}} analyzing a driver’s gap-acceptance characteristics. To perform vehicle tracking for main-street through vehicles, a special application was developed which is beyond the basic system functions and features available in AUTOSCOPE. A vehicle-tracking program was developed that uses individual detector information and extracts the data associated with the main-street through vehicles. The study then addressed the issues that are related to speed measurement using video-image systems. Results from field tests indicated that the accuracy for tracking vehicle movements varies depending on the camera view. Under the worst-case scenario, the accuracy of vehicle tracking was about 87 percent. For speed measurements, the results were compared with those measured using a radar gun. The error was approximately ± 5 km/h while reporting <b>individual</b> <b>speeds.</b> Although the speed data obtained from AUTOSCOPE may still lack the precision required for studies such as gap acceptance characteristics at unsignalized intersections, the method developed through this study showed goo...|$|R
