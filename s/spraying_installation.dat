40|$|Practical problem: Lettuce {{cultures}} are routinely pesticide-treated to avoid widespread infestation with aphids {{which are not}} tolerated by consumers. An automated identification of infestation events would allow for selective spraying which reduces the costs for pesticide treatments and levels of pesticide residues. Project objectives: We aim to identify suitable sensors and algorithms for the remote detection of aphid-infested lettuce plants and to develop an improved spraying device for small-scale application of pesticides. Both techniques will be combined in a tractor-borne setup for the selective spraying of aphid-infested lettuce plants. Expected results: We expect that the biotic stress response of lettuce plants to aphid infestation leads to altered spectral reflectance signatures of the lettuce leaves. Suitable sensors and algorithms will be selected to remotely detect aphid-infested plants. Furthermore, we will develop a custom designed <b>spraying</b> <b>installation</b> for individual plants by combination of high-precision valves and jets for small-scale application of pesticides. Results so far: In a first experimental approach, lettuce plants with different infestation intensities of the polyphageous potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) were cultivated to do comparative spectral reflectance measurements. Furthermore, a detailed study of lettuce morphology and growth patterns was basis {{for the establishment of}} a technical test facility to develop the spraying device. Who will benefit: Farmers can reduce costs for pesticide treatments, and consumers benefit from products with lower pesticide residues...|$|E
40|$|Lettuce {{cultures}} {{are prone to}} aphid infestations, but consumer tolerance for aphids in fresh lettuce is close to zero. To avoid losses of harvest due to aphids, lettuce plants are routinely sprayed with pesticides, which is costly and leads {{to high levels of}} pesticide residues in lettuce. Typically, early aphid infestation of lettuce cultures is not uniform, but shows a heterogeneous distribution. An early identification of aphid-infested lettuce plants prior to widespread infestation of whole fields would allow for selective spraying which reduces the use of pesticides. Although aphids have been shown to trigger physiological adjustments in plants, optical detection methods for aphid-infested lettuce plants have yet to be developed. For other crop plants, aphid infestation has been shown to change the optical properties of leaves and canopies. Spectral reflectance measurements of wheat and soybean revealed an increased reflectance in the visible spectrum, but decreased reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) due to changed chlorophyll content and structural characteristics of leaves. We will compare different non-invasive detection techniques to determine suitable indicators for the biotic stress response of lettuce plants. As a first possible method, spectral reflectance measurements will be explored, followed by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and thermal imaging. We will use image-based approaches in the laboratory as well as point measurements of field-grown plants with different infestation intensities to identify suitable indicators for the biotic stress response of plants to aphid infestation. Ideally, we can determine specific spectral signatures that are characteristic for aphid-infested plants. Our results will be used in the interdisciplinary project “Optimization of lettuce cultivation by high precision detection and selective pesticide treatment of aphid-infested plants” to select suitable sensors for the detection of aphid-infested plants, which can be mounted on a tractor and combined with a custom designed <b>spraying</b> <b>installation</b> for small-scale application of pesticides. We propose, that the early detection of aphid infestation and selective spraying of infested plants contribute to a reduced use of pesticides. On the long term, the developed setup will contribute to reduce the costs and environmental impact of pesticide treatments in lettuce cultivation...|$|E

40|$|The air {{relative}} humidity in closed spaces of indoor swimming pools influences significantly on users thermal comfort and {{the stability of}} the building structure, so its preservation on suitable level is very important. For this purpose, buildings are equipped with HVAC systems which provide adequate level of humidity. The selection of devices and their technical parameters is made using the mathematical models of water evaporation rate in the unoccupied and occupied indoor swimming pool. In the literature, there are many papers describing this phenomena but the results differ from each other. The aim of the study was the experimental verification of published models of evaporation rate in the pool. The tests carried out on a laboratory scale, using model of indoor swimming pool, measuring 99 cm/ 68 cm/ 22 cm. The model was equipped with water <b>spray</b> <b>installation</b> with six nozzles to simulate conditions during the use of the swimming pool. The measurements were made for conditions of sports pools (water temperature 24 °C) and recreational swimming pool (water temperature 34 °C).

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{installations}} and sculptures were created at occupation sites, of {{which one of the}} largest is a patchwork hanging in the middle of Umbrella Square made of fabric taken from more than a hundred broken umbrellas which were sewn together. The concept was developed by Baptist University art students, to bolster the movement in the early days. A group of about ten other students stripped the fabric from umbrellas that were broken and had been stained by tear gas in the police bombardment of 28 September, and wove them together and deployed it above what is now referred to as [...] "Umbrella Square". Tse, the project leader, hoped that the umbrellas broken by the police, fashioned into canopy, symbolises an extended physical protection for citizens that also serves as a reminder of the presence of other citizens who are behind to support, in other ways. At Admiralty, large yellow umbrellas have been installed at many lamp posts; Happy Gadfly concept by mainland artist Miso Zo inspired by The Gadfly, by Ethel Lilian Voynich. Made from discarded umbrellas, plastic bottles and other discarded materials, the project's originator says the installation symbolises how [...] "They can destroy the movement, but like the fly it will come back." [...] Other sizeable installations include a pepper <b>spray</b> <b>installation</b> at Causeway Bay, a shrine to Kwan Yu at Mong Kok.|$|R
50|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} {{the tree was}} in severe decline, leading to {{successive}} die-off of the treetop, until the water table began to recover in the late 1990s.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of paint overspray is handicapped especially {{by the use}} of chemical detackifying agents. The chance to reuse booth wastes could be significantly improved by employing separation methods other than chemical, e. g. high tension fields, or ultrasonic waves. We examined these possibilities, starting the experimental work with simple paint components on a laboratory scale, and later on with model and commercials paint on a bench-scale <b>spray</b> <b>installation.</b> It turned out that the booth wastes spontaneously coagulate even without the assistance of coagulants, exhibiting a remarkably reduced water content of 20 - 30 % (as compared with about 50 % by chemical treatment). However, the handling of the wastes remained problematic due to their inherent tackiness, with the extent depending mainly on the type of binder. In the course of this work we set up a measure of the tackiness of booth wastes and were able to correlate this 'tackiness factor' with the rheological properties of the wastes. Moreover it could be shown that the technological conditions of the spray process as well as the storage period of the booth wastes, and the period of employment of the circulating water significantly influence the tackiness. These results could be verified on an industrial spray plant. Under controlled technology conditions we succeeded in generating detackified booth wastes with certain types of binders. The examined nonchemical methods, especially electrocoagulation, proved to be unsuitable to eliminate the tackiness of both wastes. Based on these results, we presented the working strategy for future investigations. (orig.)

40|$|There {{are many}} and good reasons why powder coating {{is a popular}} coating process {{for a lot of}} {{industrial}} products: the wide range of design possibilities; robust surface finish; and the total avoidance of polluting solvents, to name but three. In conventional powder coating <b>installations</b> <b>spray</b> guns are used for powder application on the workpieces. This requires voluminous spray booths and powder recovery systems. Thus conventional powder coating technique causes high consumption of compressed air and of energy for the exhaust air as well as high costs for maintenance. In view of this, the Fraunhofer IPA has designed the "TransApp"-powder coating technique, which operates without spray guns and therefore is very compact, highly energy-efficient, and has low operating costs. The new technique makes use of the well-known electrostatic fluidized bed principle. Its previous process limitations such as poor application uniformity and poor decorative surface quality have been overcome by using computer simulation as well as by adopting innovative technologies to regulate the electric field. In this connection, using pulsed corona charging has been a very successful approach. The periodical interruption of the electric field and of the generation of ions {{turned out to be an}} effective method to minimize the unwanted parasitic electrostatic effects like insufficient coating of edge zones and Faraday cages...|$|R

These spray dryers could provide an inexpensive S/S additive and an opportunity for CO 2 credits. These industrial by-products were investigated to determine their potential for stabilizing and solidifying the dredge solids from the Cox Creek confined disposal facility (CDF) for Baltimore, MD with the objective of making a structural fill material. Another lab study utilized harbor dredged material from the USCOE Ft. Mifflin Confined Disposal Facility near Philadelphia, PA. The performance of the spray dryer ash is compared with a blend of LKD and Class F fly ash. Adequate lime alkalinity needs to be added {{to take advantage of the}} pozzolanic and sulfo-pozzolanic, cementitious reaction potential. Raising the pH levels to 9 - 11 for pozzolanic hydration reactivity coincide with pH levels that stabilize leachable heavy metals, including oxyanions. Furthermore, in order to produce structural fill the moisture of the dredge spoil must be reduced as close as possible to the optimum moisture content resulting in compaction at or near maximum dry density. The addition of these by-products will add dry bulk solids and in addition are known to chemically reduce the free moisture through several types of hydration reactions. A “mellowing” period before compaction may help prevent swelling from Ettringite precipitation. Strength measurements with several curing times are presented...|$|R
40|$|Nearly 19. 5 {{million gallons}} of {{herbicides}} were sprayed on the Republic of Vietnam between 1961 and 1971 for military purposes. Amounts of spray and patterns of applications are available in an electronic file called HERBS that contains records of 9141 defoliation missions, including detailed coordinates of US Air Force Ranch Hand aircraft flight paths, along with chemical agent and gallonage sprayed. Two classes of models for use in epidemiological and environmental studies that utilize the HERBS data for estimating relative exposure opportunity indices are presented: a discrete "hits" model that counts instances of proximity {{in time and space}} to known herbicide applications, and a continuous exposure opportunity index, E 4, that takes into account type and amount of herbicide sprayed, distance from spray application, and time interval when exposure may have occurred. Both direct spraying and indirect exposure to herbicide (or dioxin) that may have remained in the local environment are considered, using a conservative first-order model for environmental disappearance. A correction factor for dermal versus respiratory routes of entry has been incorporated. E 4 has a log-normal distribution that spans six orders of magnitude, thus providing a substantial amount of discrimination between sprayed and unsprayed areas. The models improve on earlier ones by making full use of the geometry of the HERBS spray flight paths of Ranch Hand aircraft. To the extent possible so many decades after the War, the models have been qualitatively validated by comparison with recent dioxin soil and biota samples from heavily contaminated areas of Vietnam, and quantitatively validated against adipose dioxin obtained in epidemiological studies of Vietnamese. These models are incorporated within a geographic information system (GIS) that may be used, as one would expect, to identify locations such as hamlets, villages, and military <b>installations</b> <b>sprayed</b> by herbicide. In a novel application, the GIS also facilitates quantitative risk assessment in epidemiological and ecological studies by applying the models within a framework of historical reconstruction of exposure history of individuals based upon their location histories...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{possibilities for}} Metso Paper {{to lower their}} costs of spray pipes for their pulp wash press TRPE, with maintained good functionality and quality. Information {{that can be used}} by competitors has been censored in this version of the essay. To find solutions, alternative suppliers have been contacted and asked to quote. There has also been a new spray pipe designed. The manufacturing costs of the new design have been calculated. The thesis also contains a concept generation of an alternative product to the <b>spray</b> pipes in <b>installations</b> where a high pressure washer is used. To be able to ask other manufacturers of spray pipes to quote, a demand specification based on the currently used spray pipe was made. This was then sent to two alternative suppliers. An investigation of earlier used spray pipes, and the currently used, shows that the nozzles are {{a big part of the}} total costs of the spray pipes. To attempt to reduce the nozzles high cost an concept generation was made to find the best solution for a new design. There was a request that it should be possible to change the internal brushes in the spray pipe without cutting and welding. A concept generation was made to find a solution to easily change the brushes. When the results of the projects different parts were delivered, they were compared to each other to find the best overall solution to lower the costs of the spray pipes. The conclusion of this project is that the currently used spray pipe not is overpriced and therefore in short term the best option is to continue using the current supplier. There have though been some discussions regarding manufacturing of the newly designed spray pipe in cost competitive countries. It seems like the costs can be reduced if manufacturing the spray pipe or parts of the spray pipe in E. g. China...|$|R
