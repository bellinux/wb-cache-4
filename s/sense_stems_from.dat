In this context, the methods possibly most relevant for <b>sensing</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> multivariate data analysis (see a review on biosensors in Lindholm-Sethson et al. [4]). Typical data analysis covers both exploratory techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis for discrimination; as well as supervised techniques such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) or Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) for classification [5]. In particular, the need of handling data from many sensor configurations simultaneously drives an interest on exploratory approaches that can help users to interactively identify the solutions that deserve further investigation. These will possibly require additional analysis with traditional supervised pattern recognition techniques, which is the central topic in this review.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the thesis {{is to show that}} a man's beliefs must be imposed on him by {{the world as it is}} whereas his actions must in some <b>sense</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> himself and that these {{features}} of belief and action are respectively essential to our concepts of belief and voluntary action. The asymmetry between belief and action is located primarily in the reasons for belief and action. The constraint which is imposed on the reasons a man gives for his beliefs, if he is to count either as believing or as giving reasons for his belief, is imposed by the objective notion of good evidence whereas the constraint which is imposed are the reasons a man gives for his voluntary actions is imposed primarily and essentially by factors which <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> himself; his desires. Since the reason which motivates a man's action is composed of a belief and a desire of his, the question of whether a man can be responsible for his beliefs or his desires has important implications for whether he can be held responsible for his actions. A man cannot be held responsible for his beliefs, or only in a very limited sense, because they must be imposed on him by the world, so if he is to be a voluntary agent and, therefore, responsible for his actions, this must be in virtue of the fact that his desires form part of the reasons for his action. The sense in which a man can be held responsible for his desires is examined and it is found that he can and must have some control over which of his desires motivate his actions, but this is based on the essential feature or a man's most basic desires that they <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> himself. <p...|$|R

All the theoretical results are derived by adopting a general mobility model for the multiple mobile PUs. The analytical results are finally validated through simulations...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{three-dimensional}} imaging {{by means of}} SAR tomography has become a field of intensive research. In SAR tomography, the vertical reflectivity function for every azimuth-range pixel is usually recovered by processing data collected using a defined repeat pass acquisition geometry.

This imaging technique is appealing, since it is very simple. However, it has the drawback that large temporal baselines, which is the case for space-borne platforms, can severely affect the reconstruction.

40|$|We have {{developed}} zinc oxide thin film transistors {{with a unique}} device architecture that exhibit robust and high-performance pressure sensing while maintaining transparency for next generation pressure-sensitive touchscreen displays. We systematically studied and optimized the material growth and device fabrication for improved device performance. We then fabricated top and bottom gate TFTs using both top and bottom contact geometries and identified the optimal device architecture to attain high pressure sensitivity while maintaining excellent transistor performance. Simultaneous operation of a single device as a switch and a pressure sensor allows simple integration of sensors into arrays without the addition of external switching elements. The all-solid-state sensors are capable of measuring steady-state pressure and transient pressure variations. The <b>sensing</b> mechanism <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the piezoelectric characteristics of RF sputtered ZnO. When zinc oxide is used as the channel material in thin film transistors, its piezoelectric property results in a shift of the transistor threshold voltage upon pressure application. This shift causes a modulation of the drain current flowing through the transistor at a steady bias. A linear dependence of the current change with the applied pressure is observed. Our first-generation TFTs together with a readout circuit built on a breadboard allow discrete pressure measurements from a single sensor at a frequency of 2 kHz. We demonstrated the operation of a transparent 8 x 8 pressure sensor array fabricated on glass, and the integrated system of pressure sensors and actuators for the recording and reproduction of touch. We further advanced our pressure sensors by studying the effects of sputtering gas, substrate temperature, and seeding layer on the ZnO film properties. The second-generation devices achieved an on-off ratio of $ 10 ^ 5 $ and allowed us to successfully demonstrate a larger, 16 x 16 array. We designed a complete system for real-time pressure signal acquisition and display, including read-out electronics, mechanical integration, electrical connections, and display software for signal visualization. We measured the latency of the pressure sensors {{to be less than}} 1 ms and the recovery time to be less than 20 ms.

The overall aim of this thesis is to extend the operating range of 0. 18 um standard logic CMOS technology to millimetre-wave regime. To this end, microwave and millimetre-wave design, optimisation and modelling methodologies for active and passive devices and low noise circuit implementation are described. As part of the evaluation, new systematic and modular ways of making high performance passive and active devices such as spiral inductors, slow-wave coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines, comb capacitors and NMOS transistors are proposed, designed, simulated, fabricated, modelled and analysed. Small-signal and noise de-embedding techniques are developed and verified up to 110 GHz, providing an increased accuracy in the device model, leading to a robust design at millimetre-wave frequencies. Reduced substrate losses resulting in increased quality factor are presented for optimised spiral inductor designs, featuring patterned floating shield (PFS), enabling improved matching network and a reduced chip area. Based on the proposed shielded slow-wave CPW, both the line attenuation and structure length are decreased, resulting in a more compact and simplified circuit design. An optimised transistor design, aimed at reducing the layout parasitic effects, was realised. The optimisation led to a significant improvement in the gain and noise performance of the transistor, extending its operation beyond the cut-off frequency (ft). By combining all the optimised components, low noise amplifiers (LNAs) operating at 25 GHz and 40 GHz were implemented and compared. These LNAs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with the 40 GHz LNA exhibiting the highest gain and lowest noise performance of any LNA reported using 0. 18 um CMOS technology. On the other hand, the 25 GHz LNA showed a comparable performance to other reported results in literature using several topologies implemented in CMOS technology. These findings will provide a framework for expansion to smaller CMOS technology nodes with the view of extending to sub millimetre-wave frequencies...|$|R

We submit that the resulting neglect of the body and of bodily movements in the world has been detrimental in understanding how organisms develop a sense of identity. We examine the importance of sensing one’s own movements {{for the development of a}} basic, nonconceptual sense of self. More specifically, we argue that the origin of the <b>sense</b> of self <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the sensitivity to spontaneous movements. Based on this, the organism develops a sense of “I move” and, finally, a sense of “I can move”. Proprioception and kinesthesis are essential in this development. At the same time, we argue against the traditional dichotomy between so-called external and internal senses, agreeing with Gibson that perception of the self and of the environment invariably go together. We discuss a traditional distinction between two aspects of bodily self: the body sense and the body image. We suggest that they capture different aspects of the sense of self. We argue that especially the body sense is of great importance to our nonconceptual sense of self. Finally, we attempt to draw some consequences for research in cognitive science, specifically in the area of robotics, by examining a case of missing proprioception. We make a plea for robots to be equipped not just with external perceptual and motor abilities but also with a sense of proprioception.
