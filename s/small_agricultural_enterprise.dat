40|$|The role of <b>small</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> and thei {{effects on}} {{sustainable}} rural {{development has been}} studied both in developing countries (Ruben, Slingerland and Nijhoff, 2006; Latouche, 2007) and in developed ones (McCullough, Pingali and Stamoulis, 2008; Tasch, 2009). <b>Agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> in developed countries have found to face problems that drive them towards a more intense, and often less sustainable, way of growing crops. Maybe the most relevant problem derives {{from the fact that}} modern big food retailers demand a stable and large supply of fresh, raw and processed materials, ensuring year-round availability (Reardon, Timmer and Berdegue, 2008). When small farmers cannot warrant a large and continuous stream of products they have to sell their crops to raw commodities' brokers (Dolan and Humphrey, 2002) that further sell them to industrial processors or to distributors (Maloni and Brown, 2006). In fact, farmers are players in a more complex supply chain with a really small negotiation power (King and Phumpiu, 1996). Farmers use alliances and agreements to increase their negotiation power in order to keep a competitive position in the market, but it is not so obvious what are the effects of these strategies on sustainability of agricultural practices. To deepen our understanding of the sustainability of different models of alliances this chapter adopts the Bioeconomy model of sustainability (Passet, 1996) to evaluate how the different agricultural alliances follow its hierarchical order of economical, environmental and social dimensions and what kind of capabilities are needed to create and sustain a competitive advantage in these alliances. First we analyse the main impacts of agricultural practices on sustainable development processes, then we compile a framework that builds upon market driven capabilities to analyse opportunities and risks related to agricultural farms’ alliances.

30|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on entrepreneurship of small businesses, whereas some issues have remained unknown still. Previous studies have provided evidences for distinguishing between self-employment, business ownership, new business creation and entrepreneurship (Urbano and Aparicio, 2016). However, it is just less studies to develop a special index for entrepreneurship of small business in general and particularly in <b>small</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> due to the literature. Hjorth and Holt (2016) focused on social side of entrepreneurship and argue that entrepreneurship is different from enterprise, as the management is not leadership. Although there is an overlapping among definitions of entrepreneurship and creation of small businesses; small businesses are not always entrepreneurship companies and their owners are not always entrepreneurs (Carland et al., 1984). Small firms are more frequent incubators of entrepreneurs due to less hierarchical. Hierarchy is less prevalent in small businesses and is associated with more frequent transitions of employees into self-employment and entrepreneurship (Tåg et al., 2016). Reviewing previous studies, it is required to improve and develop the measurement methods of entrepreneurship and small businesses (Wang et al., 2015), because there is no comprehensive framework regarding the entrepreneurship process components. Thus, more entrepreneurship studies require for theory development (Davidsson et al., 2001). In any definition, entrepreneurship is a behavior and a dynamic phenomenon requires the provision of necessary conditions (Cheraghali, 2011). Therefore, it will be desirable to development an index, effective factors and obstacles for entrepreneurship in small businesses.|$|R

40|$|The {{role and}} effects of <b>small</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> on {{sustainable}} development processes in rural areas has been studied both in developing countries (Ruben, Slingerland & Nijhoff 2006; Latouche 2007) and in developed ones (McCullough, Pingali & Stamoulis 2008; Tasch 2009). <b>Agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> in developed countries have found to face several problems that drive them towards a more intense, and often less sustainable, way of growing crops. Maybe the most relevant of these problems is that these enterprises have to face in the modern markets {{is derived from the}} increased centrality the modern big food retailers have in the food supply chain. These distributors not only demand a stable and large supply of fresh, raw and processed material but they ask producers to be able to esensure year-round availability in order to stipulate contract with them (Reardon, Timmer & Berdegue 2008). As small farmers cannot assure distributors on their ability to supply a large and continuous stream of products by themselves they end up selling their crops to raw commodities' brokers (Dolan & Humphrey 2002) that will further sell them down the value chain to distributors or to industrial processors as well (Maloni & Brown 2006). In this way farmers become only small players that have to operate in a more complex supply chain where they have a really small negotiation power (King & Phumpiu 1996). Sporlerder (1992) hold that <b>agricultural</b> <b>small</b> and medium <b>enterprises</b> have tried to address this endemic weakness recurring to cooperation initiatives as a way to reduce risks while trying, at the same time, to increase their negotiation power in dealing with the other tiers of the value chain. The preferred partner for these initiatives have been other <b>agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> (Farrell & Tozer 1996) but they have often involved even players in other stages of the value chain (Holmlund & Fulton 1999). On the other hand the effect these alliances have on the sustainability of agricultural practices have not been so obvious. In this paper we try to deepen our understanding of the impact on sustainability each different models of alliances by <b>small</b> and medium <b>agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> have using the Bioeconomy model of sustainability (Passet 1996; Lethonen 2004), In particular we use the bioeconomy model to evaluate how the different agricultural alliances models are able to help these entrepreneurs to manage their farms according to the hierarchical order of economical, environmental and social dimensions developed in the model and how they can help them to develop a set of competences and capabilities useful to create and sustain a competitive advantage trough these alliances without dire effects on the other sustainability spheres. In particular we open the paper discussing the differences between the Triple Bottom Line model of sustainability (Elkington 1992, 1997) and the one proposed by Passet (1996). Later we focus on the various impacts agricultural practices can have on sustainable development processes both in the environmental sustainability sphere and in the social sustainability one. We follow on presenting the various model of alliances <b>agricultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> and we classify them in six different classes of alliances and agreements according to the kind of players participating in them and how they can be used to change the existing structure of the value chain itself. In this paper we use the lens of market-driven management (Shapiro 1988; Day 1994; Slater & Narver 1999; Sciarelli, 2008) to build a theoretical frameworks to assess how the various alliances model can help sustainable development processes. In the end we adopt the multiple case study method to investigate what kinds of capabilities are used in five successful Italian farmers’ alliances chosen according to a theoretical replication model (Glaser & Strouss 1967; Yin, 1998) so to use the broadest set of experiences in this first empirical test of the previously defined framework...|$|R

As development of SMEs has become the main economic policies of different countries (Yeh-Yun and Zhang, 2005). SMEs are defined as commercial-productive units which work at small scale (Rezaei and Safa, 2016 a). These SMEs are formed based on the four indices {{of the number of}} enterprise personnel, whole net properties, sales level as well as enterprise investment (Amin Bidokhti and Zargar, 2012; Soltani et al., 2012). The 44 th principle of Iran constitution made the route easier for the entrepreneurs` activities. These enterprises constitute less than 50 workers and work in agriculture, industry and mine sectors. They should achieve to the production phase in 12 to 14 [*]months, therefore they have named as quick-impact enterprises (Alsadat Aghili et al., 2013). These enterprises would provide a place for the country development. Considering comprehensive definition of entrepreneurship, this study was conducted to identify the factors and obstacles to entrepreneurship development in quick-impact enterprises in Iran. Providing credible strategy as in order to develop the entrepreneurship process in small enterprises is the main aim of measuring the entrepreneurship components. The importance of index development as well as determining the factors and obstacles in entrepreneurship process are three main areas which have been emphasized in the studies: measuring entrepreneurship; improving the understanding of who is an entrepreneur (Tåg et al., 2016); determining ideal condition to undertake an entrepreneurial business; presenting a comprehensive definition; identifying potential entrepreneurs (Coduras et al., 2016); distinguishing between entrepreneurship and other modes of occupation (Crecente-Romero et al., 2016).
