5|$|Geological {{evidence}} shows the Thera volcano erupted numerous times over <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> {{years before the}} Minoan eruption. In a repeating process, the volcano would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater-filled caldera, with numerous small islands forming the circle. The caldera would slowly refill with magma, building a new volcano, which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990 Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait. In {{the middle}} of the month U.S. President George H. W.

5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), {{walruses}} tend to form massive aggregations {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> Pacific walruses migrate from the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.|$|E
5|$|Hardware stores {{experienced}} great {{demand for}} portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and air movers following {{the passage of}} the hurricane. Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} benthic foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, presumably because {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the ocean {{is thought to have}} decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> years into the early Paleocene.|$|E

5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand.</b> It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Forrest spots Jenny at a peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C., {{required}} visual effects {{to create the}} large crowd of people. Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500 extras were used. At each successive take, the extras were rearranged and moved into a different quadrant away from the camera. With the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> people.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly as the game day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> dollars.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> dollars of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the state record at $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|While the North and South {{magnetic}} poles are usually {{located near the}} geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geo{{magnetic poles}} leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Judy Garland's {{four-year}} {{contract for}} the series called for 26 weekly shows, for which Garland's corporation, Kingsrow Enterprises, would be paid $140,000 per episode. Of that Garland was guaranteed between $25,000 and $30,000 per show. Kingsrow Enterprises would also retain ownership of the tapes, allowing Garland to sell the series into syndication. Although Garland had said as early as 1955 {{that she would never}} do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation. Garland was <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> dollars in debt to the IRS, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the commercial disappointment of the film A Star is Born meant that her share of any profits from that film would be eaten up immediately. A successful run on television would secure Garland's financial future.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the money}} went to Buckham and his wife, Alexander Strategy Group, and a 15-year lease on a Washington Redskins skybox used by Abramoff. The group closed in 2001 while under a Federal Election Commission probe, distributing <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousands</b> of dollars in {{remaining}} assets among people associated with USFN. The townhouse was sold at below market value to U.S. Representative Jim Ryun (R-KS).|$|R
5|$|On {{display in}} the house is an {{important}} collection of fine art and antiquities built up by many generations of the Bankes family, the core having been assembled by Sir Ralph Bankes in Gray's Inn before the house was built. One of the rooms, the Spanish room (named by reason of the paintings of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo which hang there), has walls hung with gilded leather. It was recently restored at a cost of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> pounds over a five-year period. Other important collections include paintings of the Bankes family stretching back over 400 years. Other artworks include works by Diego Velázquez, Anthony van Dyck, Titian and Jan Brueghel the Younger. A portrait of Nicolò Zen the younger by Titian was discovered in the collection in 2008.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
5|$|Late on September 1, {{when the}} storm began to retrograde, {{hurricane}} warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to Grand Isle, Louisiana, as advisories along {{the west coast of}} the Florida Peninsula were allowed to expire. By the time officials lifted evacuation orders, the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety. Roughly 250,000 people in the Florida Panhandle, 175,000 in Alabama, 70,000 in Mississippi, and 50,000 in Louisiana—a total of 545,000—were ordered to leave. <b>Several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> of the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier, and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve. Governor Graham's office reported that during the entire storm event, 1.25 million people from Florida evacuated at some point, and state police in Louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000. In total, nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course.|$|E
