5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} <b>soutane.</b> He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
25|$|Rwanda: The {{first novel}} on the Tutsi {{genocide}} {{written by a}} Rwandan, Le Feu sous la <b>soutane</b> ("The Fire Under The Cassock", Editions L'Esprit Frappeur), by Benjamin Sehene, was published on 1 June 2005.|$|E
25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed in the {{familiar}} white <b>soutane,</b> over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red chasuble. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of mourning for Popes. Around his collar, the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. In his arm rested Paul VI's pastoral cross-staff, used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His hands clasped a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{conservative}} church because it observes the traditional attire of men and women. Especially during the sacrifice of the Holy Mass, veils and decent dress are worn by women while men wear white shirts and pants but mostly white <b>soutanes.</b> Attire such as mini skirts and jeans by women and sando shirts by men are strictly prohibited. Members of the church are also known for their discipline and piety, youths are not allowed intimate relationships with one another. Adults are prohibited alcohol, cigarettes, gambling and drugs.|$|R
5000|$|On August 24, 1553, a ship of Richard Chancellor {{reached the}} salt-mining {{settlement}} of Nyonoksa, {{which is still}} famous for its traditional wooden architecture. The British sailors visited the Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery, where they were surprised to find a community of [...] "sailors in <b>soutanes</b> (cassocks)" [...] and a pier {{large enough to accommodate}} several ships. The main church of this extraordinary establishment was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the holy patron of sailors; hence, the whole White Sea became known in 16th-century English maps as [...] "St. Nicholas Bay". In late 1613, during the Time of Troubles in Russia, Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds, the Lisowczycy, captured and looted Severodvinsk with the monastery.|$|R
50|$|The Society of Jesus staffed {{the seminary}} {{and the first}} rector was Father Noel Hehir SJ with Fathers Leo Perry SJ and Gerard McGinty SJ to assist him. Their arrival (with the Apostolic Delegate) in New Zealand was {{dramatic}} as their ship, MS Wanganella, went aground on Barrett Reef {{at the entrance to}} Wellington Harbour, and they had to be rescued. The seminary was in effect a boys' secondary school for the early training of those boys who wished to become priests in later life. The course of studies was appropriately designed and included Greek, Latin and History. The first class consisted of 40 thirteen- and fourteen-year-old boys. They were dressed in <b>soutanes,</b> as was then common in all seminaries throughout the world.|$|R
60|$|He {{took off}} his <b>soutane,</b> beneath which he was wearing {{close-fitting}} breeches and a cloth waistcoat, and began changing his attire.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite's heart {{seemed all}} at once to stop beating; her eyes, large and dilated, had {{fastened}} {{on one of the}} newcomers, who, at this point, had taken a quick step forward towards Brogard. He was dressed in the <b>soutane,</b> broad-brimmed hat and buckled shoes habitual to the French CURE, but as he stood opposite the innkeeper, he threw open his <b>soutane</b> for a moment, displaying the tri-colour scarf of officialism, which sight immediately had the effect of transforming Brogard's attitude of contempt, into one of cringing obsequiousness.|$|E
60|$|The preacher took a chainless {{watch from}} a pocket within his <b>soutane</b> and, having {{considered}} its dial {{for a moment}} in silence, placed it silently before him on the table.|$|E
60|$|The {{two largest}} {{contributors}} to this gallery are Mr. Ferdinand Heilbuth and Mr. James Tissot. The {{first of these}} two artists sends some delightful pictures from Rome, {{two of which are}} particularly pleasing. One is of an old Cardinal in the Imperial scarlet of the Caesars meeting a body of young Italian boys in purple <b>soutanes,</b> students evidently in some religious college, near the Church of St. John Lateran. One of the boys is being presented to the Cardinal, and looks very nervous under the operation; the rest gaze in wonder at the old man in his beautiful dress. The other picture is a view in the gardens of the Villa Borghese; a Cardinal has sat down on a marble seat {{in the shade of the}} trees, and is suspending his meditation for a moment to smile at a pretty child to whom a French bonne is pointing out the gorgeously dressed old gentleman; a flunkey in attendance on the Cardinal looks superciliously on.|$|R
6000|$|And {{only the}} priest {{continued}} his pacing, flinging round the skirt of his <b>soutane</b> {{at each end}} of his beat. Decoud murmured to him ironically: [...] "Those gentlemen talk about their gods." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{her knees}} lay {{the head of}} a man of middle age, in the long <b>soutane</b> of a Romish priest. One look at the {{attitude}} of his limbs told them that he was dead.|$|E
60|$|Here comes Pater Bonif√°cius, who has {{finished}} saying his mass {{just in time}} to see the last of his lads. He has tucked his <b>soutane</b> well up under his sash, and he is running across the platform, his rubicund, kindly face streaming with excitement.|$|E
60|$|Lanty was purring {{over his}} foster-brother, and cosseting {{him like a}} cat over a newly-recovered kitten, {{resolved}} not {{to see how much}} shaken the poor Abbe's intellect had been, and quite sure that the reverend father would be altogether himself when he only had his <b>soutane</b> again.|$|E
60|$|The priest {{nodded and}} turned on the heels of his square-toed shoes with big steel buckles. Again, with his hands clasped behind his back, he paced to and fro, {{planting}} his feet firmly. When he swung about, the skirt of his <b>soutane</b> was inflated slightly by the brusqueness of his movements.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they crossed}} the inner hall, the dean of studies was {{in the act of}} {{escaping}} from the student with whom he had been conversing. He stood {{at the foot of the}} staircase, a foot on the lowest step, his threadbare <b>soutane</b> gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The King!' exclaimed Diane. 'M. l'Abbe, do {{you know}} where he is now? In the balcony {{overlooking}} the river, taking aim at the fugitives! Take care! Even your <b>soutane</b> would not save you if M. d'O and his crew heard you. But I must pray you to aid me with this poor child! I dread that her wild cries should be heard.' ...|$|E
60|$|The old man wore {{a tattered}} garment, {{a miracle of}} shining cleanliness, which {{had once been a}} <b>soutane</b> of smooth black cloth, but was now a mass of patches and threadbare at {{shoulders}} and knees. He seemed deeply intent in the task of polishing his shoes, and having delivered himself of his little admonition, he very solemnly and earnestly resumed his work.|$|E
60|$|Phelim Burke, {{otherwise}} l'Abbe de St. Eudoce, {{stood near}} her. He was a thin, yellow, and freckled youth, with sandy hair and typical Irish features, but without their drollery, {{and his face}} was what might have been expected in a half-starved, half-clad gossoon in a cabin, rather than surmounting a silken <b>soutane</b> in a Parisian salon; but he had a pleasant smile when kindly addressed by his friends.|$|E
60|$|He {{produced}} four candle-butts {{from the}} side-pockets of his <b>soutane</b> {{and placed them}} deftly among the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen the faded worn <b>soutane</b> draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord--in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden--and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity--a mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down.|$|E
6000|$|... (His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, {{appears in}} the doorway, dressed in red <b>soutane,</b> sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, {{cardinal}} sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:) ...|$|E
60|$|Marguerite was silently {{watching}} him, still {{leaning on}} her elbow. Evidently her brain was still numb and fatigued, for {{she did not}} seem able to grasp all {{that the old man}} said. She smiled to herself too as she watched him. How could she look upon him as a jailer? He did not seem at all like a Jacobin or a Terrorist, there was nothing of the dissatisfied democrat, of the snarling anarchist ready to lend his hand to any act of ferocity directed against a so-called aristocrat, about this pathetic little figure in the ragged <b>soutane</b> and worn shoes.|$|E
60|$|In the vestry a plump fresh-faced jesuit and {{an elderly}} man, in shabby blue clothes, were dabbling {{in a case}} of paints and chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly, {{touching}} their faces in a gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again, his hands thrust well forward into his side-pockets. His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his <b>soutane</b> and with his spotless shoes.|$|E
60|$|I {{clutched}} the creature in both hands, and, hurling him {{on to the}} floor of the coach, I stamped on him with my heavy boots. He had drawn a pistol from the front of his <b>soutane,</b> but I kicked it out of his hand, and again I fell with my knees upon his chest. Then, for the first time, he screamed horribly, while I, half blinded, felt about for the sword which he had so cunningly concealed. My hand had just lighted upon it, and I was dashing the blood from my face to see where he lay that I might transfix him, when the whole coach turned partly over upon its side, and my weapon was jerked out of my grasp by the shock.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{drew back}} his maimed and quivering {{right arm and}} held out his left hand. The <b>soutane</b> sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted and a loud {{crashing}} sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down his flaming cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{closed his}} eyes and held out in the air his {{trembling}} hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the <b>soutane</b> as the pandybat was lifted to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat.|$|E
60|$|And as {{the king}} brightened, {{so all the}} great court brightened too. The salons began to resume their former splendour, and gay coats and {{glittering}} embroidery which had lain in drawers for years were seen once more {{in the halls of}} the palace. In the chapel, Bourdaloue preached in vain to empty benches, but a ballet in the grounds was attended by the whole court, and received with a frenzy of enthusiasm. The Montespan ante-room was crowded every morning with men and women who had some suit to be urged, while her rival's chambers were as deserted as they had been before the king first turned a gracious look upon her. Faces which had been long banished the court began to reappear in the corridors and gardens unchecked and unrebuked, while the black cassock of the Jesuit and the purple <b>soutane</b> of the bishop were less frequent colours in the royal circle.|$|E
6000|$|Susan {{embraced her}} man. He stood unbending, then {{turned on his}} heels and went out. But afterwards, when a black <b>soutane</b> darkened his doorway, he did not object; even offered some cider himself to the priest. He listened to the talk meekly; went to mass between the two women; {{accomplished}} what the priest called [...] "his religious duties" [...] at Easter. That morning {{he felt like a}} man who had sold his soul. In the afternoon he fought ferociously with an old friend and neighbour who had remarked that the priests had the best of it and were now going to eat the priest-eater. He came home dishevelled and bleeding, and happening to catch sight of his children (they were kept generally out of the way), cursed and swore incoherently, banging the table. Susan wept. Madame Levaille sat serenely unmoved. She assured her daughter that [...] "It will pass;" [...] and taking up her thick umbrella, departed in haste to see after a schooner she was going to load with granite from her quarry.|$|E
6000|$|That {{was not a}} nice expression. His {{mother had}} {{told him not to}} speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see {{that she was going to}} cry. She was a nice mother but she was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two five-shilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had told him if he wanted {{anything}} to write home to him and, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, his <b>soutane</b> fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from the car, waving their hands: ...|$|E
60|$|The engineer-in-chief had not {{finished}} telling his amusing story. The humours of railway building in South America appealed to his keen {{appreciation of the}} absurd, and he told his instances of ignorant prejudice and as ignorant cunning very well. Now, Mrs. Gould gave him all her attention as he walked by her side escorting the ladies out of the room. Finally all three passed unnoticed through the glass doors in the gallery. Only a tall priest stalking silently in {{the noise of the}} sala checked himself to look after them. Father Corbelan, whom Decoud had seen from the balcony turning into the gateway of the Casa Gould, had addressed no one since coming in. The long, skimpy <b>soutane</b> accentuated the tallness of his stature; he carried his powerful torso thrown forward; and the straight, black bar of his joined eyebrows, the pugnacious outline of the bony face, the white spot of a scar on the bluish shaven cheeks (a testimonial to his apostolic zeal from a party of unconverted Indians), suggested something unlawful behind his priesthood, the idea of a chaplain of bandits.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{followed}} {{also with}} his ears the accents and intervals of the priest's {{voice as he}} spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference of masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily with its tale and in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on again with respectful questions. He knew that the tale was a prelude and his mind waited for the sequel. Ever since the message of summons had come for him from the director his mind had struggled to find {{the meaning of the}} message; and, during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour waiting for the director to come in, his eyes had wandered from one sober picture to another around the walls and his mind wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the summons had almost become clear. Then, just as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause might prevent the director from coming, he had heard the handle of the door turning and the swish of a <b>soutane.</b>|$|E
60|$|He had {{attracted}} the attention of some of the swimmers, and he now flung her to them. One caught her by an arm, another by a leg, and she was safely taken to the shore, where at once a shoe and a stocking were taken from her, in token of her becoming a captive; but otherwise her garments were not meddled with; in which she was happier than her uncle, whom she found crouched up on a rock, stripped almost to the skin, so that he shrank from her, when she sprang to his side amid the Babel of wild men and women, who were shouting in exultation and wonder over his big flapped hat, his <b>soutane</b> and bands, pointing at his white limbs and yellow hair--or, what amazed them even more, Estelle's light, flaxen locks, which hung soaked around her. She felt a hand pulling them to see whether anything so strange actually grew on her head, and she turned round to confront them with a little gesture of defiant dignity that evidently awed them, for they kept their hands off her, and did not interfere as she stood sentry over her poor shivering uncle.|$|E
6000|$|A {{score of}} the younger boys in white {{knickers}} and singlets came pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and to the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager masters and boys. The plump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean {{young man in a}} long overcoat, who was to give a special display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with interest, his silver-coated clubs peeping out of his deep side-pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of his <b>soutane</b> nervously and crying to the laggards to make haste. A little troop of Neapolitan peasants were practising their steps {{at the end of the}} chapel, some circling their arms above their heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsying. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she stood up a pink-dressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and an old-fashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was discovered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and nodding his head, approached the dark corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly: ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was unfair}} and cruel because {{the doctor had}} {{told him not to}} read without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had steadied his hand and at first he had {{thought he was going to}} shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the <b>soutane</b> sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them both that they might return to their places without making any {{difference}} between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel. The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and unfair. And his white-grey face and the no-coloured eyes behind the steel-rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and louder.|$|E
60|$|The French Church {{was called}} on {{to provide for the}} other two children. The daughter, Alice, became a nun in one of the Parisian convents, with {{promises}} of promotion. The younger son, Phelim, was weakly in health, and of intellect feeble, if not deficient, and was almost dependent on the devoted care and tenderness of his foster-brother, Laurence Callaghan. Nobody was startled when Berwick's interest procured for the dull boy of ten years old the Abbey of St. Eudoce in Champagne. To be sure the responsibilities were not great, for the Abbey had been burnt down {{a century and a half}} ago by the Huguenots, and there had never been any monks in it since, so the only effect was that little Phelim Burke went by the imposing title of Monsieur l'Abbe de St. Eudoce, and his family enjoyed as much of the revenues of the estates of the Abbey as the Intendant thought proper to transmit to them. He was, to a certain degree, ecclesiastically educated, having just memory enough to retain for recitation the tasks that Lanty helped him to learn, and he could copy the themes or translations made for him by his faithful companion. Neither boy had the least notion of unfairness or deception in this arrangement: it was only the natural service of the one to the other, and if it were perceived in the Fathers of the Seminary, whither Lanty daily conducted the young Abbot, they winked at it. Nor, though the quick-witted Lanty thus acquired a considerable amount of learning, no idea occurred to him of availing himself of it for his own advantage. It sat outside him, as it were, for 'Masther Phelim's' use; and he no more thought of applying it to his own elevation than he did of wearing the <b>soutane</b> he brushed for his young master.|$|E
6000|$|Many eminent {{characters}} have been biblioklepts. When Innocent X. was still Monsignor Pamphilio, he stole a book--so says Tallemant des Reaux--from Du Monstier, the painter. The amusing {{thing is that}} Du Monstier himself was a book-thief. He used to tell how he had lifted a book, {{of which he had}} long been in search, from a stall on the Pont-Neuf; [...] "but," [...] says Tallemant (whom Janin {{does not seem to have}} consulted), [...] "there are many people who don't think it thieving to steal a book unless you sell it afterwards." [...] But Du Monstier took a less liberal view where his own books were concerned. The Cardinal Barberini came to Paris as legate, and brought in his suite Monsignor Pamphilio, who afterwards became Innocent X. The Cardinal paid a visit to Du Monstier in his studio, where Monsignor Pamphilio spied, on a table, [...] "L'Histoire du Concile de Trent"--the good edition, the London one. [...] "What a pity," [...] thought the young ecclesiastic, [...] "that such a man should be, by some accident, the possessor of so valuable a book." [...] With these sentiments Monsignor Pamphilio slipped the work under his <b>soutane.</b> But little Du Monstier observed him, and said furiously to the Cardinal, that a holy man should not bring thieves and robbers in his company. With these words, and with others of a violent and libellous character, he recovered the [...] "History of the Council of Trent," [...] and kicked out the future Pope. Amelot de la Houssaie traces to this incident the hatred borne by Innocent X. to the Crown and the people of France. Another Pope, while only a cardinal, stole a book from Menage--so M. Janin reports--but we have not been able to discover Menage's own account of the larceny. The anecdotist is not so truthful that cardinals need flush a deeper scarlet, like the roses in Bion's [...] "Lament for Adonis," [...] on account of a scandal resting on the authority of Menage. Among Royal persons, Catherine de Medici, according to Brantome, was a biblioklept. [...] "The Marshal Strozzi had a very fine library, and after his death the Queen-Mother seized it, promising some day to pay the value to his son, who never got a farthing of the money." [...] The Ptolemies, too, were thieves on a large scale. A department of the Alexandrian Library was called [...] "The Books from the Ships," [...] and was filled with rare volumes stolen from passengers in vessels that touched at the port. True, the owners were given copies of their ancient MSS., but the exchange, as Aristotle says, was an [...] "involuntary" [...] one, and not distinct from robbery.|$|E
