Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string, but removed it because it hindered playing. In the 1940s, he exchanged gut with steel for the first string and {{found it easier to}} play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the <b>steel</b> <b>string</b> altered the sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{failed attempt}} to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was {{inspired}} by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, , in which the <b>steel</b> <b>string</b> of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.|$|E
25|$|Popular Hawaiian {{music with}} English verse (hapa haole) can be {{described}} in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A <b>steel</b> <b>string</b> guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such leaps and are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A musical scale that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} {{vibrations}} of plucked strings was investigated. The {{objective is to}} determine the vibrational behaviour of a guitar with nylon and <b>steel</b> <b>strings.</b> The derived Newton’s second law of motion [7] with damping coefficient was used and the equation of the form [...] . (1) Was considered. The method of separable variable was applied and we obtained [...] . (2) The result shows that nylon strings decay mainly as a result of internal damping in the <b>strings</b> while <b>steel</b> <b>strings</b> decay due to air viscosity. Therefore we conclude that nylon strings are under less tension than <b>steel</b> <b>strings</b> [5]...|$|R
25|$|In the 20th century, {{there have}} been {{attempts}} to standardize and improve the Erhu, {{with the aim of}} producing a louder and better sounding instrument. One major change was the use of <b>steel</b> <b>strings</b> instead of silk. The move to <b>steel</b> <b>strings</b> was made gradually. By 1950 the thinner A-string had been replaced by a violin E-string with the thicker D-string remaining silk. By 1958 professional players were using purpose made D and A <b>steel</b> Erhu <b>strings</b> as standard.|$|R
500|$|The characters, Jake and Elwood Blues, {{were created}} by Belushi and Aykroyd in {{performances}} on Saturday Night Live.

The fictional back story and character sketches of blood brothers Jake and Elwood were developed by Aykroyd in collaboration with Ron Gwynne, who is credited as a story consultant for the film. As related in the liner notes of the band's debut album, Briefcase Full of Blues, the brothers grew up in an orphanage, learned the blues from a janitor named Curtis, and sealed their brotherhood by cutting their middle fingers with a <b>steel</b> <b>string</b> said to have come from the guitar of Elmore James.|$|E
2500|$|Samuel Adelstein {{described}} the Lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and {{shorter than the}} Neapolitan mandolin, with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck, with six single strings to the regular mandolin's set of 4. [...] The Lombardi was tuned C–D–A–E–B–G. The strings were fastened to the bridge like a guitar's. [...] There were 20 frets, covering three octaves, with an additional 5 notes. When Adelstein wrote, there were no nylon strings, and the gut and single strings [...] "do not vibrate so clearly and sweetly as the double <b>steel</b> <b>string</b> of the Neapolitan." ...|$|E

He was widely touted as Australia's first singing cowboy {{complete}} with acoustic <b>steel</b> <b>string</b> guitar and yodel, {{in the style}} of American Gene Autry: Dawson had an extraordinarily long and prolific career, releasing his first single in 1941 and his last album in 2005, aged 92, making him at the time the world's oldest recording artist (now surpassed by Dame Vera Lynn who released an album aged 97, in 2014). Through his high-rating syndicated radio serials (at their height broadcast on 100 stations) [...] television appearances, comic books and songs he created the persona of a happy-go-lucky singing cowboy".

Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a <b>steel</b> <b>string</b> which furnished the pressure. By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom. As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught them up and [...] "backed" [...] them. This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, {{double bass}} strings were usually made of gut, (which despite its name {{is made from}} sheep intestine, not cats) but, since that time, steel has largely {{replaced}} it, because <b>steel</b> <b>strings</b> hold their pitch better and yield more volume when played with the bow.

50|$|Because of {{the higher}} tension {{required}} for <b>steel</b> <b>strings,</b> <b>steel</b> strung guitars are much more robustly made than 'classical' guitars which use synthetic strings.

50|$|The {{change from}} gut to steel has also {{affected}} the instrument's playing technique {{over the last}} hundred years. <b>Steel</b> <b>strings</b> {{can be set up}} closer to the fingerboard and, additionally, strings can be played in higher positions on the lower strings and still produce clear tone. The classic 19th century Franz Simandl method does not use the low E string in higher positions because older gut strings, set up high over the fingerboard, could not produce clear tone in these higher positions. However, with modern <b>steel</b> <b>strings,</b> bassists can play with clear tone in higher positions on the low E and A strings, particularly when they use modern lighter-gauge, lower-tension <b>steel</b> <b>strings.</b> For information on the strings used in regular and solo tuning (F#-B-E-A) and with different types of basses (e.g., four-string and five-string), see the section below on tuning.|$|R
