A one way repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated differences between plyometic exercises assessed for all of the variables assessed (P ≤ 0. 05), with post hoc analysis demonstrating the specific differences.

40|$|Palaeotemperature proxies {{based on}} {{glycerol}} dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) lipids {{have been established}} for marine and lacustrine environments, {{but there has been}} relatively little study of their application in speleothems. In this study we analyse the GDGT content of 33 speleothem samples from 16 different sites around the globe, and test whether proxies based on isoprenoid tetraethers (TEX 86) or branched tetraethers (MBT/CBT) are correlated with measured surface and cave mean annual air temperature (MAT). The results show that the TEX 86 has a strong relationship with measured temperature (r 2 = 0. 78, standard error of the estimate 2. 3 °C, when calibrated with <b>surface</b> <b>MAT).</b> Furthermore, the MBT/CBT also showed a significant relationship with temperature (r 2 = 0. 73, standard error of the estimate 2. 7 °C, when calibrated with <b>surface</b> <b>MAT).</b> Some issues remain requiring future work, in particular the development of a larger calibration sample set with measured cave temperature data, and the investigation of controls other than temperature on GDGT distribution, but overall the results indicate that GDGT based proxies derived from speleothems may be highly viable new methods for reconstructing continental palaeotemperatures...|$|R

The entire network was a mesh containing Chlorella sp. on upper <b>surface</b> of the <b>mat,</b> while Oscillotoria sp. and Phormidium occupied the lower side. The cyanobacterial physiology did not get affected by the presence of high concentrations of chromium possibly {{due to the fact that}} the <b>mat</b> <b>surface</b> could be highly negatively charged due to the hydrolysis of the surface polysaccharides causing more number of hydroxyl ions to be present on the <b>mat</b> <b>surface.</b> The charges would be possibly distributed along the filamentous cyanobacteria which would have provided an enormous surface area for binding of positively charged chromium ions. Thus, it was the ability of the entire <b>mat</b> <b>surface</b> which would be eventually responsible for higher sequestering of chromium (VI) ion.|$|R

40|$|Microspatial {{arrangements}} of sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) in <b>surface</b> microbial <b>mats</b> (~ 1. 5 mm) forming open marine stromatolites were investigated. Previous research revealed three different mat types {{associated with these}} stromatolites, each with a unique petrographic signature. Here we focused on comparing “non-lithifying” (Type- 1) and “lithifying” (Type- 2) mats. Our results revealed three major trends: (1) Molecular typing using the dsrA probe revealed {{a shift in the}} SRM community composition between Type- 1 and Type- 2 mats. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) coupled to confocal scanning-laser microscopy (CSLM) -based image analyses, and 35 SO 42 −-silver foil patterns showed that SRM were present in <b>surfaces</b> of both <b>mat</b> types, but in significantly (p < 0. 05) higher abundances in Type- 2 mats. Over 85 % of SRM cells in the top 0. 5 mm of Type- 2 mats were contained in a dense 130 µm thick horizontal layer comprised of clusters of varying sizes; (2) Microspatial mapping revealed that locations of SRM and CaCO 3 precipitation were significantly correlated (p < 0. 05); (3) Extracts from Type- 2 mats contained acylhomoserine-lactones (C 4 -,C 6 -,oxo-C 6,C 7 -,C 8 -,C 10 -,C 12 -, C 14 -AHLs) involved in cell-cell communication. Similar AHLs were produced by SRM mat-isolates. These trends suggest that development of a microspatially-organized SRM community is closely-associated with the hallmark transition of stromatolite <b>surface</b> <b>mats</b> from a non-lithifying to a lithifying state...|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky <b>surface</b> <b>mat.</b> Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|R

With the onset of autumn rains, the lateral roots form dense <b>surface</b> <b>mats</b> of cluster roots in the top [...] of soil, just below the leaf litter, where most minerals are concentrated. These roots exude chemicals that enhance mineral solubility, greatly increasing the availability and uptake of nutrients in impoverished soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. For as long as surface water is available, they take in water and a range of minerals. In B.prionotes they are principally responsible for the uptake of malate, phosphate, chloride, sodium and potassium. When soils are high in nitrates, they may also perform some nitrate reductase activities, primarily the conversion of ammonium into amino acids such as asparagine and glutamine.|$|R
40|$|The current {{generation}} of marine biogeochemical modules in Earth system models (ESMs) considers mainly the effect of marine biota on the carbon cycle. We propose to also implement other biologically driven mechanisms in ESMs so that more climate-relevant feedbacks are captured. We classify these mechanisms in three categories according to their functional role in the Earth system: (1)   biogeochemical pumps, which affect the carbon cycling; (2)   biological gas and particle shuttles, which affect the atmospheric composition; and (3)   biogeophysical mechanisms, which affect the thermal, optical, and mechanical properties of the ocean. To resolve mechanisms from all three classes, we find it sufficient to include five functional groups: bulk phyto- and zooplankton, calcifiers, and coastal gas and <b>surface</b> <b>mat</b> producers. We strongly suggest to account for a larger mechanism diversity in ESMs {{in the future to}} improve the quality of climate projections...|$|R

40|$|A filamentous, gliding, {{thermophilic}} bacterium, found growing abundantly as a <b>surface</b> <b>mat</b> in {{a limited}} number of alkaline hot springs in Oregon, is described and designated F- 1. The bacteria were studied in the field and in coculture with an aerobic chemoheterotroph. The bacteria are phototrophic and contain bacteriochlorophyll a and several carotenoid pigments. Unlike the other gliding phototrophic bacteria, members of the family Chloroflexaceae, F- 1 does not contain chlorosomes or bacteriochlorophyll c or d. The light-dependent uptake of simple organic compounds (acetate and glucose) was demonstrated in field populations. Near-infrared radiation sustained this uptake, which occurred equally well under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and was insensitive to 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea. The bacteria formed conspicuous dominant mats from about 35 to 56 °C, and they covered mats of cyanobacteria in the spring, summer, and autumn months.

The ctenidial filaments of Syssitomya pourtalesiana Oliver, 2012 are extended abfrontally and a dense layer of bacteriocyte cells cover the entire surface behind a narrow ciliated frontal zone. The bacteria are extracellular and held within a matrix of epithelial extensions and microvilli. There is no cuticular layer (glycocalyx) covering the bacteria as in many thyasirid symbi-oses. The bacteriocytes hold more than one morphotype of bacteria, but bacilli, 1 – 3 mm in length, dominate. Scanning electron microscopy observations show a <b>surface</b> <b>mat</b> of filamentous bacteria over the extreme abfrontal surfaces.

Laboratory experiments on motility with the use of sulfide gradients produced in agar revealed a negative response to sulfide at concentrations similar to those found in the natural mats. The motility response may help explain the presence of O. terebriformis below the <b>mat</b> <b>surface</b> at night. The movement back to the surface at dawn appears to be due to a combination of phototaxis, photokinesis, and the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis which consumes sulfide...|$|R

Four different activities were found, comprising two peptidases one of which had metalloprotease characteristics, a serine-type proteinase, and a proteinase active at pH 2. 5 which was not affected by any of the inhibitors tried. Both the latter were most active in starved mycelium. Isoelectric focusing showed peaks with activities corresponding to the serine-type proteinase and one of the manganese-activated peptidases.
