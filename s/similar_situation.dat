5|$|The congregation's {{building}} was expropriated and demolished {{to make way}} for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in the 1950s.

5|$|A <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> arose {{outside the}} apartment.

An officer dusted the bedroom window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|E
5|$|A <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> {{occurred}} in New Zealand, where the song hit {{number one in}} the early winter of 2007 as the country was experiencing some of the worst storms in its history. During the weather conditions, Taranaki, Tauranga, and Auckland had experienced tornadoes and flooding in the Far North of the country. Once the single was replaced on the top spot, weather conditions throughout New Zealand pacified, although Hawke's Bay was still stormy.|$|E

5|$|The CASA 2.111 {{was another}} Spanish-built {{version of a}} German aircraft, the Heinkel He 111, that was adapted to use the Merlin after the supply of Junkers Jumo 211F-2 engines ran {{out at the end}} of the war.

5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration.

A <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E

5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E
5|$|Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland noted it {{occurring}} under larch (Larix), oak, pine, birch {{and other}} introduced trees in South Australia in 1934, {{and it has}} subsequently been recorded in New South Wales, Victoria (where it was found near Betula and Populus) and Western Australia. It has been recorded under introduced birch (Betula) and hazel (Corylus) in New Zealand. Mycologist Rolf Singer reported a <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> in South America, with the species recorded under introduced trees in Chile. It {{is likely to have}} been transported to those countries in the soil of imported European trees.|$|E
5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is a <b>similar</b> <b>situation,</b> {{where the}} St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over a fragment of Siletzia. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia, and the nature and location of the contact between these two formations is unknown.|$|E

This resulted in a 190%-increase from the previous tracking week, in which the original record stood at number 31. A <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> occurred on the UK Albums Chart, where The Complete Confection helped Teenage Dream rise from number 34 to number six after the former was released. The Complete Confection peaked at number two on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, aided by the combined {{sales of the}} two versions.|$|E
5|$|In the season's {{penultimate}} game, Maryland lost to Penn State, 48–0. Penn State halfback Lydell Mitchell {{had been}} recruited by Lester and {{originally intended to}} go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead. Lester was bothered by a <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> with fullback Franco Harris, whose high school coach {{was a friend of}} Lester's. Lester attributed Maryland's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings. Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3–7 record.|$|E

Ashley and Ashlyn are later killed in a tanning salon when their tanning beds short circuit. Then, a shelf falls, trapping them inside, and the girls are burned alive. Now convinced that Death is after them, seeking to kill those who escaped Devil's Flight in sequence, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using omens hidden in photos taken by Wendy {{on the night of}} the roller coaster's derailment.|$|E

Sri tells him that she will ask her sister and has Mahmud hide in a wardrobe. After she leaves the room, Supono and Aminah enter from other doors. Supono, unknown to him, is in a <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> to Mahmud, and Aminah convinces him to hide beneath a table as she asks Sri.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{passes through}} much of Canis Minor, yet it has few deep-sky objects.

5|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} into all major languages, and in the United States it became the second best-selling book after the Bible. A number of the early editions carried an introduction by Rev James Sherman, a Congregational minister in London noted for his abolitionist views. Uncle Tom's Cabin sold equally well in Britain, with the first London edition appearing in May 1852 and selling 200,000 copies. In a few years over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were infringing copies (a <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> occurred in the United States).|$|E
5|$|At their nominating {{convention}} in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat Simon B. Buckner, a former Confederate general. In his acceptance speech, Bradley implored Kentuckians {{to realize that}} the Civil War was over and to discontinue their practice of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office. His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high protective tariff, and developing the state's resources. He pointed out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than Pennsylvania, the state bought half of its coal from that state. A <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> existed with regard to lumber. He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations. Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and {{the construction of a new}} state penitentiary. Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.|$|E
5|$|Benn {{continued}} his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had {{members in the}} same or <b>similar</b> <b>situation</b> to Benn's (i.e., {{who were going to}} receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made {{at the time of his}} election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.|$|E
