The Coens met filmmaker John Milius, {{when they were in}} Los Angeles making Barton Fink and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter. John Milius introduced the Coen Brothers to one of his best friends, Jim Ganzer, who would have been another source of inferences to create Jeff Bridges' character. Also known as the Dude, Ganzer and his gang, typical Malibu surfers, served as inspiration as well for Milius's film The Big Wednesday.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E

They can all <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> {{talk about it and}} call [...] afterward." [...] She found the role and the film to be [...] "lighter and fluffier" [...] compared with her earlier work. The actress connected with Silver through their shared dedication to their careers and their decisions to re-prioritize their lives. When approaching her character, Doherty felt that Silver's story arc was about [...] "honoring her grandfather and finding good friends, a sense of community and love"; she connected with this story line because of her close connections to her own family.|$|E
500|$|Gatski {{signed up}} for an Army reserve unit after the 1942 season as America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified. Marshall canceled its football program in 1943 as Gatski entered his senior year, but his unit was activated and he was sent with an infantry division {{to fight in the}} European theater of World War II. He went to England and followed American troops as they landed in Normandy and marched further into Europe. [...] "I wasn't in any heavy fighting," [...] he later said. He was a Private First Class in the Army. Gatski returned from duty in 1945, but Marshall had yet to resume its football program, so he enrolled at Auburn University in Alabama and finished out his studies, playing part of the season on the school's football team. [...] "Marshall hadn't started back up, and I hadn't played football for two years," [...] he later explained. [...] "I didn't want to <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> do nothing, so I went to Auburn." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her [...] "greatest ambition" [...] {{was to have a}} [...] "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, [...] "I was never really a career woman but [...] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> do nothing, so I became an actress." [...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E

500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan {{reviewed}} the episode for his website [...] "Heart of Stone". He {{felt that the}} main Odo/Kira plot was [...] "contrived" [...] in that the female Founder stole a Maquis ship {{and set up the}} entire situation simply to attempt to convince Odo to return to his people. He said that the Nog and Sisko plot was [...] "lightweight but amiable", and he gave the episode an overall score of 2.5 out of 4. Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for the website TrekNation, and also questioned the main plot. She wrote [...] "what was the shapeshifter going to do if someone OTHER than Kira was in the runabout with Odo? Did she <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> wait {{for the two of them}} to leave the station together?" [...] She had further concerns about the direction of the Odo and Kira relationship, and described the romance as a [...] "cop-out".

(Incidentally several actors and actresses connected to Disney {{have appeared in the}} Disney-produced Grey's Anatomy, broadcast on a Disney-owned network.) Those characters also frequently watch movies from Netflix, at that time an online DVD rental service; the company is referenced in one of the episode's semi-parodies of a Jonas Brothers song [...] "I've Got a Ring" [...] (which parodies [...] "SOS"): [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> watch Netflix?" [...] T.G.I. Friday's, a real-life American restaurant chain, is referenced several times as the place where Tammy gave her ex-boyfriend a blowjob. A can of Dr. Pepper appears repeatedly in the South Park Elementary cafeteria; David Hiltgrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer said of the product placement, [...] "I never thought I'd see this type of crass commercialism turn up on South Park, which may be the most brazenly iconoclastic show TV has ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{showing the}} songs to the band, McKinnon and Skaff worked on them alone. When the pair {{had all of}} the song ideas, they worked on them as a full-band, with {{pre-production}} being undertaken in, as Skaff commented, [...] "a makeshift studio" [...] by Andrew Wade. Woodard commented that the band had [...] "been going in from 11am until 9pm and all we do is <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> play." [...] Between demoing the songs, and their final forms on the album, Woodard said [...] "crazy things were happening – verses became choruses", with Chad Gilbert assisting the band with arrangements and writing. As the band thought they were getting better as songwriters, Woodard stated, [...] "it's getting more heavy and more pop." [...] One song that the band recorded was [...] "screwed up really bad and it didn't make the record", as Skaff comments, as the group recorded it at a fast pace and when McKinnon tried to [...] "sing it was like rap music.

500|$|Following his San Francisco sojourn, Divine {{returned}} to Baltimore {{and participated in}} Waters's next film Pink Flamingos. Designed by Waters to be [...] "an exercise in poor taste," [...] the film featured Divine as Babs Johnson, a woman who claims to be [...] "the filthiest person alive" [...] and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary). In one scene, the Marbles send Babs a turd in a box as a birthday present, {{and in order to}} enact this scene, Divine defecated into the box the night before. Filmed in a hippie commune in Phoenix, Maryland, the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines, although all of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand. The final scene in the film proved particularly infamous, involving Babs eating fresh dog feces; Divine later told a reporter, [...] "I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole," [...] waiting for it to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. The scene {{became one of the most}} notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that [...] "I run around doing it all the time. I've received boxes of dog shit– plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> talk about dog shit because they think it's what I want to talk about." [...] In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement that one time because it was in the script.|$|E
500|$|The 13th season also {{featured}} or spoofed real-life songs and bands. The episode [...] "Fishsticks", which prominently featured rapper Kanye West, includes a two-and-a-half minute song, [...] "Gay Fish", that parodies West's [...] "Heartless". [...] "Gay Fish" [...] satirizes the rapper's tendency {{to rely on}} audio processing to correct his mistakes in pitch. After [...] "Fishsticks" [...] aired, the full song was made available for download on South Park Studios. Several fake Jonas Brothers songs, with lyrics about the band members' physical attractiveness, were written for [...] "The Ring". Some songs also emphasize the band's belief in sexual abstinence, with lyrics like, [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> watch Netflix?" [...] The strongly erotic reactions of the young girls at their concert parody the frenzied female fan reactions the Jonas Brothers tend to elicit, even though their image projects wholesomeness and chastity. In the episode [...] "Whale Wars", Cartman plays the video game Rock Band and performs a rendition, praised by critics, of the Lady Gaga song [...] "Poker Face". [...] On March 16, 2010, Rock Band developer Harmonix released {{this version of the}} song (along with the original version) as downloadable content for the game. In [...] "W.T.F.", during an audition for the boys' professional wrestling league, one of the participants sings a Broadway-style number—parodying the song [...] "Nothing" [...] from A Chorus Line—about why {{he wants to be a}} wrestler. The episode [...] "Fatbeard" [...] received considerable press attention after Ike stated in a letter he would [...] "vomit his balls out through his mouth" [...] if he had to hear anything more about Susan Boyle, the Scottish amateur singer who had recently gained worldwide attention for her performance of [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] on Britain's Got Talent.|$|E

2500|$|Adult geladas use {{a diverse}} {{repertoire}} of vocalizations for various purposes, such as: contact, reassurance, appeasement, solicitation, ambivalence, aggression and defense. The level of complexity of these vocalizations {{is thought to}} near that of humans.

To some extent, calls {{are related to the}} status of an individual. In addition, females have calls signaling their estrus. Geladas communicate through gestures, as well. They display threats by flipping their upper lips back on their nostrils to display their teeth and gums, and by pulling back their scalps to display the pale eyelids.
