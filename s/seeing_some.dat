5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E

Among the general public, reaction was favourable, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> recognition as inevitable and acceptable. More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing {{majority of the}} population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with a slim majority favouring full marriage. The numbers in favour of adoption by same-sex couples were lower but less clear.|$|E
5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin after <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> of the {{electrical}} experiments {{done in the}} royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E

At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E

25|$|The borough (now city) of Easton in the mid-1700s {{and early}} 1800s {{did not see}} much success in {{building}} a sound educational system. Easton built its first school in 1755, and though <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> classes of students graduate, the school closed in 1798. In 1784, there was a desire to build an academy for young students called the Easton Union Academy. Though it was chartered in 1794 by the Trustees of the Union Academy, the school was unable to grow. The academy struggled with infrastructural upkeep and maintaining a cohort of teachers willing to provide instruction to students. In 1824, the academy closed and the School Board of Easton took over the property.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of Camellia sinensis in 1834 in Assam {{was followed by}} testing in 1836–37 in London. The British allowed companies to rent land from 1839 onwards. Thereafter tea plantations mushroomed in Eastern Assam, where the soil and the climate were most suitable. Problems with the imported labourers from China and hostility from native Assamese resulted in the migration of forced labourers from central and eastern parts of India. After initial trial and error with planting the Chinese and the Assamese-Chinese hybrid varieties, the planters later accepted the local Camellia assamica as the most suitable variety for Assam. By the 1850s, the industry started <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> profits. The industry saw initial growth, when in 1861, investors were allowed to own land in Assam and it saw substantial progress with invention of new technologies and machinery for preparing processed tea during the 1870s.|$|E

25|$|Between 1840 and 1850, Palatka {{was a major}} {{shipping}} {{port for}} oaks, cedar, cotton, sugar and syrup. Goods were shipped down the Ocklawaha, loaded onto larger steamers in Palatka and plied north on the St. Johns River. In 1855, Col. Hubbard L. Hart started {{the first line of}} barge freighters on the Ocklawaha River. Palatka had become a popular tourist destination, however its popularity as a tourist spot was interrupted by the Civil War, when gunboats cruised the waters and most of the town’s residents had abandoned Palatka leaving it destitute and largely deserted. Palatka was soon occupied by Confederate troops which included one of Sánchez's brothers. On October 7, 1862, the USS Cimarron fired several shells from the St. Johns River over the town after <b>seeing</b> <b>some</b> Confederate cavalry. Mary E. Boyd, wife of Robert T. Boyd, one of the wealthiest men in Palatka, pleaded with Union Commander Maxwell Woodhull to spare Palatka, assuring him that the horse soldiers were not residents; he complied with her and spared the town. At one time, the town was occupied by 5,000 federal troops.|$|E
500|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>some</b> {{remaining}} {{potential in}} the LC2, Lancia allowed the project to continue into 1986, but only as a one-car effort. [...] The year opened with a sprint event at Monza, {{with the speed of}} the LC2 allowing it to take second place, less than a minute behind the winning Rothmans Porsche. [...] The first endurance event at Silverstone however saw a return of the LC2's reliability problems, as the fuel pump failed and the car was unable to finish. [...] Feeling the cars were still not reliable enough nor fuel efficient enough to compete with the evolved Porsche 962C, Lancia determined that the project was no longer worth supporting, and Martini Racing pulled out of the championship. [...] Lancia turned their full attention instead to their efforts in the World Rally Championship.|$|E

[...] Paolini also said that Paradise Valley, Montana is [...] "one of the main sources" [...] of his inspiration for the {{landscape in}} the book (Eragon takes place in the fictional continent Alagaësia). Paolini [...] "roughed out" [...] the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted.|$|E

[...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect.

500|$|The Phillies invited Hollands {{to spring}} {{training}} in 2014. He made the team's Opening Day roster after compiling a 3.09ERA in nine exhibition appearances.
