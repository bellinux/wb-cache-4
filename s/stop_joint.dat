Finger movement efficiency in particular is an important factor when pianists perform at very fast tempi. We document the finger movement kinematics of highly skilled pianists as they performed a five-finger melody at very fast tempi. A three-dimensional motion-capture system tracked the movements of finger joints, the hand, and the forearm of twelve pianists who performed on a digital piano at successively faster tempi (7 – 16 tones/s) until they decided to <b>stop.</b> <b>Joint</b> angle trajectories computed for all adjacent finger phalanges, the hand, and the forearm (wrist angle) indicated that the metacarpophalangeal joint contributed most to the vertical fingertip motion while the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints moved slightly opposite to the movement goal (finger extension). An efficiency measure of the combined finger joint angles corresponded to the temporal accuracy and precision of the pianists ’ performances: Pianists with more efficient keystroke movements showed higher precision in timing and force measures. Keystroke efficiency and individual joint contributions remained stable across tempo conditions. Individual differences among pianists supported the view that keystroke efficiency is required for successful fast performance...|$|E

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a systemic}} disease characterized by chronic {{inflammation of the}} synovial joints damage and loss of the function. The ultimate goal in managing RA is to prevent joint damage and to maintain functional ability. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment is important, but predictive markers for RA are still confined to auto- antibodies and also magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sonography {{do not appear to}} sufficiently distinguish between early RA and non RA. Evidence shows that substantial and irreversible joint damage already occurs within the first 2 years after disease onset. This “window of opportunity” hypothesis for therapeutic intervention in RA is based on the existence of a time frame within which there is a potential for a greater response to therapy, resulting in sustained benefits or, perhaps most important, a chance of cure. There is increasing evidence for beneficial effects of early DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) therapy over delayed treatment in patients who present with arthritis of recent onset. However, no universal consensus exists concerning the choice of initial drug or whether single drug or combination should be given as initial treatments. Most studies demonstrated superiority of aggressive over conventional approaches. Because the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α inhibitors have proved to <b>stop</b> <b>joint</b> damage progression in severe progressive RA, the achievement of these agents in early RA are currently of great interest...|$|E

40|$|Recently, one {{attractive}} and challenging {{topic in the}} field of robotic manipulationis “hyper-dynamic manipulation”, which is defined as highly skillful manipulationwith high motion specifications, especially the kind of high-speed dynamicmanipulation such as in sport and is considered an extension of dynamic manipulation. It is hoped that the hyper-dynamic manipulation can be realized by robots, especiallyby a humanoid in the near future. However, conventional manipulators are designed with view of simplifying thedesign process by adopting fixed joint motion profiles and selecting actuators tosatisfy the torque and power needs of different joints resulting from the motion profile. In the case of serial manipulators, this method leads to a bad cycle of heavieractuators and heavier links in the mechanism and low efficiency dynamicmanipulation. Compared with the conventional manipulators, human beings display better skillin hyper-dynamic sports motion. This is due to the smart structure of the human body,in which the actuators near body are more powerful and heavier than those near theend of arm, and the power can be transferred from the body to the end of arm duringhyper-dynamic manipulation. This kind of power transfer is due to the utilization ofcoupling and is called dynamically coupled driving. Moreover, in dynamicmanipulation, human beings can utilize their <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> efficiently to improve andstrengthen the effect of dynamically coupled driving. This is a big difference fromconventional robots in which any collision between links and <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> should beavoided. Inspired by the merits of the human body’s structure and the motion control skill,this research aims to realize hyper-dynamic manipulation with a smart and versatilerobot using unique mechanism design and control. At first, the basic concepts of dynamically coupled driving and <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> arediscussed. A general dynamics expression about the dynamically coupled driving andthe <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> are derived and its meaning is explained. As an example, a two-linkmodel is introduced to show the effect of the dynamically coupled driving and thejoint stops in detail. Based on the concepts of the dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops,</b> anew manipulator design method is proposed for enhancing robot dynamicperformance through utilizing the dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops.</b> Inthis method, the actuators and links of robots are designed as light as possible initiallyto resemble the smart structure of the human body. A design index (DI) is formulatedby the weighted sum of the desired dynamic performance and the boundary conditionson initial/final configurations. By increasing the load capabilities of the actuators stepby step, an iterative process of searching for the solution of DI Jtolerance withminimal torque needs is implemented to yield a robot design with the lightestmechanism and minimal needs for the torque and power. An important issue of this design method is searching for the solution ofDI tolerance J. This issue is formulated to be a motion planning problem withcomplicated constraints due to the human-like smart structure and the utilization ofthe dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops.</b> A new method based on activetorque approximation and the convex hull property of B-splines is then proposed. Inthis method, the active torques of joints are approximated by B-splines and the hardconstraints on the active torque are transformed to be a series of linear inequalities onthe coefficients of the B-spline. Through combining the active torque approximationwith a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm, the proposed motionplanning method provides superior numerical stability with high accuracy in motiongeneration which brings great benefit to the proposed manipulator design method. By utilizing the proposed motion planning method, a real hyper-dynamicmanipulator, namely a golf swing robot, is designed with the new design method. Based on the robot, different hyper-dynamic manipulation with different costfunctions, e. g., for minimizing total consumed work (TCW), for minimizing the sumof the squared derivatives of torque (SSDT), and for maximizing the impact speed(IS), is generated to investigate the characteristics of hyper-dynamic manipulation. Many meaningful and interesting results for the hyper-dynamic manipulation for atwo-joint manipulator are obtained in simulation. Moreover, by adopting thegenerated active torque trajectories as the feedforward inputs to the controller of thereal robot, and the motion trajectories as the reference inputs to a PD controller of therobot, experiments are carried out. The experimental results prove the utilization ofthe dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> and verify that the hyper-dynamicmanipulation can be successfully realized by a real robot. Additionally, since the golfclub shaft is flexible, a three-link model is developed to describe the real golf swingrobot more accurately and is approved by experiments. Though the numerical optimization method is triumphantly used to solve thenonlinear motion planning problem so as to utilize dynamically coupled driving inhyper-dynamic manipulation, it is necessary to develop a control method to directlydeal with the motion planning problem, a target dynamics based energy controlscheme is then proposed for motion planning. This scheme maps the two Degree ofFreedom (DOF) golf swing robot to a one-DOF harmonic oscillator system (targetdynamics). Based on the target system, energy control is used to realize a specifiedimpact speed at a specified impact position, and PD control and PD plus gravity,dynamically coupled driving torque and active torque compensation control areadopted to slow down and stop the swing. By using this control scheme, the torquecompensation from a joint with a high-power actuator to another joint with a lowpoweractuator is realized to achieve higher speed in hyper-dynamic manipulation. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R

A Vicon motion analysis system captured movement, while a SmartWheel simultaneously collected three-dimensional forces and moments occurring at the hand-rim. A custom pediatric inverse dynamics model was used to evaluate three-dimensional upper extremity joint motions, forces and moments of 14 children with spinal cord injury (SCI) during the functional tasks.

The main consumption mode among all cannabis consumers is joints, while other ways of consuming such as food preparations and water pipes are rare and experimental. Joints always mix cannabis with tobacco for 3 reasons: to burn correctly, pure cannabis is too strong, and smoking cannabis alone is too expensive. Two cannabis consumers - one former tobacco smoker and one occasional tobacco smoker - consider rolling tobacco less addictive than cigarette tobacco alone, and hence use it in their joints. Overall cannabis is considered 'natural' and less harmful to health than tobacco. Thus, many users describe their wish, in the longer term, to quit tobacco consumption without excluding occasional cannabis consumption. Nonetheless, all coconsumers declare that they smoke cigarettes {{as a substitute for}} cannabis: For example, "If I don't have a joint, I need fags; if I don't have fags, I need joints; and if I don't have anything, I go crazy!" or "About 20 minutes after smoking a joint we feel like smoking something again, because in the joint there is pure tobacco without a filter as in cigarettes, and that creates a crazy dependency!". Finally, all co-consumers state that the consumption of one of the substances increases when trying to diminish the other: "A few months ago I <b>stopped</b> smoking <b>joints</b> for a month. Well I was smoking more than a pack [of cigarettes] a day. " Similarly, the 2 former cannabis consumers increased their cigarette use since quitting cannabis. Conclusions: The majority of cannabis users co-consume tobacco as a way of compensating for one substance or the other. Using tobacco within joints implies that there is a risk that even occasional joints can revive nicotine addiction. Consequently, health professionals wishing to help adolescents in substance use cessation and prevention efforts should consider both substances in a global perspective.
