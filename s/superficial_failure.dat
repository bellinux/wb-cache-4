40|$|We make a {{thorough}} {{study of the}} regions near finite-order metric-singularity boundaries of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. After distinguishing curvature singularities from other types of metric breakdown, we examine the eigenvalues of the energy tensor near the singularities for positivity and energy dominance, find the causal class of the t-translation (2 ̆ 2 static 2 ̆ 2) Killing field, and ascertain {{the presence or absence}} of timelike, null, and spacelike geodesic incompleteness for each spacetime. For a certain subclass of spacetimes, we also show the completeness of all timelike and spacelike curves despite the <b>superficial</b> <b>failure</b> of the metric...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the various}} parts found in a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), analyzation of every part is not {{feasible}} or needed. Based on previous mathematical modeling experience of high velocity cryogenic equipment, the environmental traits of location of the part, temperature range, fluid velocity, pressure range, and elevation variation of fluid flow as being significant factors were determined. Six parts categories were developed. The part categories are: (1) fuel turbomachinery, (2) oxidizer, (3) combustion devices, (4) valves, (5) ducts, and (6) lines. Due to a suspicion that <b>superficial</b> <b>failure</b> modes exist, six status codes were developed. The codes are: (1) part is in service presently, (2) part is out-of-service due to its own failure, (3) part is out-of-service due to engine (or some other part failure), (4) part is out-of-service because it's retired/obsolete (time related), (5) never fired-scrapped due to own problem or part is store, and (6) part is out-of-service for repair. It was suggested that to properly model failure behavior of SSME parts that: (1) significant factors contributing to failure must be examined, (2) relatively precision based on real life data must be examined, and (3) alternative definitions of failure must be initialized by the engineers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the more}} common cause of the <b>superficial</b> <b>failure</b> and the {{subsequent}} downgrading of hot rolled steel coils is the scale formed during the different technological phases which cannot be removed at adequate efficiency. The industrial test series launched by DUNAFERR Steelworks Co. Ltd. had the aim of following up the scale formation of six different steel grades – starting from the reheating furnace till the coiling of hot rolled strip – with the aim to assess the efficiency, possibilities and deficiency of the actually operating descaling system for the grades representing the {{major part of the}} production. The paper focuses primarily on the structure, phase composition and properties of scale formed in different stages of production and presents the measurement results in the mirror of accurately measured and recorded industrial parameters. Based on the results can be stated that due to the increased scaling susceptibility and the unfavourable characteristics of the formed scale the greatest challenge for industrial specialist is represented by the steel produced for electrotechnical use containing 1. 5 – 2. 1 wt % silicon. For this grades it is recommended to elaborate a more effective mechanical descaling and adequate pickling technology. Experimental The chemical composition of steels tested determined by optical emission spectrometry is given i...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the geotextiles on the deformation and failure of geotextile-reinforced slopes is a key issue in slope stability. Centrifugal model tests were conducted to investigate the failure of soil slopes reinforced using geotextiles. The deformation fields and their changes due to loading were measured using an image-based displacement measurement system. The failure and deformation of the geotextile-reinforced slope were investigated by comparing observations of reinforced and pure soil slopes. The {{results show that the}} geotextiles significantly change the slip surface so that only <b>superficial</b> local <b>failure</b> occurs. The strain localization on the soil slope reduces by the geotextiles, which increases the slope stability. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, about 1000 slope {{failures}} occur {{every year}} in Japan, and about 90 % of them are <b>superficial</b> slope <b>failures</b> that occur within 3 meters from the surface. Therefore this research suggests a new natural method for the slope stability. It takes environment and landscape into consideration, and can prevent <b>superficial</b> slope <b>failures</b> from occurring. Reinforcement members used in this method are rock-bolts, unit-nets, and pressure-plates. And we tried to preserve existing trees as much as possible. The purpose {{of this research is}} to establish more accurately designed method, and so the shearing test by the model of 1 / 10 scale was conducted. We made a model ground with reinforcement materials in shearing box and made it sheared by automatic load machine. Then we measured shear load with loadcells measures shear load and strain gauges attached to rock-bolt and unit-net. In the past research, we made it clear how the change of the effect of diameter of pressure plates gave to reinforcement mechanism in this method on sandy soil ground. The result was that enlarging diameters of pressure plates increases reinforcement effect comprehensively in this method. Shearing test was carried out on cohesive soil ground in addition to sandy soil ground in this research, and we examined how the difference of the grain size made the effect to the reinforcement mechanisms. As a result, it was clarified that the depression effect of transformation became bigger as the diameters of pressure plates was longer also in the mixed soil ground...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} how dynamic features of communication are realized in simulated processes. We hypothesize that ambiguity and context play important roles {{for maintaining the}} dynamics {{of success and failure}} in communication. We propose a game model of communication by adding ambiguity and context to Steels’ Language-Game. As a result of simulation experiments of two types of the game model, it was shown that ambiguous words are disambiguated at the situation of communication by utilizing contextual information. We claim that the disaccord of interpretation arose by the ambiguity is one of the integrant parts bringing the dynamics of communication, such as <b>superficial</b> communicative success, <b>failure</b> and re-establishment of communication...|$|R
