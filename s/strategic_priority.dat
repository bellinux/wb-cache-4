25|$|Prior to the {{earthquake}} and tsunami of March 2011, {{and the nuclear}} disasters that resulted from it, Japan had generated 30% of its electrical power from nuclear reactors and planned to increase that share to 40%.

The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant was completely shut down for 21 months following an earthquake in 2007 and owner TEPCO repeated scandals.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between cost management practices and competitiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. Based on resource based view, we argue that cost management is an important resource to develop competitiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities.</b> The results show cost management practices are positively associated with SME's competitiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities.</b> Further analysis demonstrates the relationship between cost management practices and SMEs’ competitiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> is mediated by entrepreneurship capabilities. This study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} effect of cost management practices and entrepreneurship on SME's competitiveness of <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} whether the <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> of an organization are associated with the use and effectiveness of specific performance measures. The results of a survey of Dutch firms indicate that specific <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> (i. e., the importance of market/customer orientation, innovation and personnel development) tend to be associated with the use of non-financial performance measures. In addition, institutional factors appear to affect the use of specific performance measures. However, we find no support for the claim that aligning the performance measurement system to the <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> of the firm positively affects performance. <b>Strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> Performance measures Performance Survey...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThe {{terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001 on the United States had minimal impact on U. S. -China relations. The attacks merely rearranged U. S. <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> in Asia while having no effect on Chinese <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities.</b> Before September 11, U. S. <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> in Asia were U. S. -China relations, and containing North Korean aggression and its development of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). After September 11, U. S. <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> in Asia became the U. S. war on terror (WOT), containing North Korean Aggression and its development of WMD, and U. S. -China relations. This reordering of priorities did not result from stabilizing U. S. -China relations, but rather because of the increased threat of international terrorism towards the United States and U. S. interests. The Chinese <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> of regime stability, territorial integrity, and increasing international prestige and power, did not change because of the attacks. The change in U. S. <b>strategic</b> <b>priorities</b> in Asia made the U. S. -China relationship more stable. Going forward, the PRC is likely to favor stable relations with the United States as long as China does not consider the expanding United States presence in Asia, because of the U. S.

25|$|Tenerife is the {{economic}} {{capital of the}} Canary Islands. At present, Tenerife is the island with the highest GDP in the Canary Islands. Even though Tenerife's economy is highly specialized in the service sector, which makes 78 percent of its total production capacity, {{the importance of the}} rest of {{the economic}} sectors is key to its production development. In this sense, the primary sector, which only represents 1.98 percent of the total product, groups activities that are important to the sustainable development of the island's economy. The energy sector which contributes 2.85 percent has a primary role in the development of renewable energy sources. The industrial sector which shares in 5.80 percent is a growing activity in the island, vis-a-vis the new possibilities created by technological advances. Finally, the construction sector with 11.29 percent of the total production has a <b>strategic</b> <b>priority,</b> because it is a sector with relative stability which permits multiple possibilities of development and employment opportunities.|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{arguing that}} Iraq {{was not the}} top <b>strategic</b> <b>priority</b> {{in the war on}} {{terrorism}} or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Advisor to George H. W. Bush. In a 15August 2002 Wall Street Journal editorial entitled [...] "Don't attack Saddam", Scowcroft wrote that, [...] "Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region ... there would be an explosion of outrage against us ... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes", and, [...] "could even swell the ranks of the terrorists." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair apologized for his 'mistakes' over Iraq War and admitted there were 'elements of truth' to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS.|$|E

2500|$|After the war, Irakli Okruashvili, {{who served}} as Defense Minister of Georgia, claimed that he and President Saakashvili had drawn up plans to retake South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2005, Abkhazia being the <b>strategic</b> <b>priority.</b> The alleged {{original}} plans called for a two-pronged offensive into South Ossetia aimed at taking Tskhinvali, the Roki Tunnel, and Java. Saakashvili believed that the United States would block a response by Russia through diplomatic channels, so he did not order the taking of the Roki Tunnel. When Russian forces responded, Georgian forces raced to contain them, but were outmaneuvered by the Russians. Okruashvili said that Russian response would be [...] "inevitable" [...] as after 2006, Russians repositioned and improved their military infrastructure in the North Caucasus, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. The Georgian Army could have defended a few key towns from the Russians, but President Saakashvili [...] "let the Russians in to avoid criticism and appear more of a victim".|$|E

Flight testing of the equipment in two Boeing B-29 Superfortresses began in May with such success that in June {{the decision was made}} to retrofit all of its first-line B-50 bombers with aerial refueling equipment. The world's first two dedicated air refueling units, the 43rd and 509th Air Refueling Squadrons, were constituted on June 30 and became operational in January 1949. With the development in 1948 of a [...] "flying boom" [...] delivery system, followed in 1949 by the [...] "probe-and-drogue" [...] system, in-flight refueling of fighter aircraft using single-point receiving equipment also became practical and USAF committed itself to the concept for the bulk of its future combat aircraft.|$|E

Among current obstacles to full membership is the ongoing objection by Greece over the country's name, which is also the reason why it is officially addressed by the European Union with the provisional appellation [...] "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", rather than its constitutional name, [...] "Republic of Macedonia". Another problem is the objections of Bulgaria which does not recognize Macedonians as a distinct ethnic group.

2500|$|Israel, feeling its {{security}} directly threatened, {{was the most}} strongly opposed to the AWACS deal of anyone involved. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin expressed [...] "profound regret and unreserved opposition" [...] to the Saudi AWACS proposal. Experts on Israeli defense said that AWACS could track every move of the Israel’s air force, denying it the chance to launch a [...] "surprise first strike, the basis of Israeli defense doctrine." [...] While Israel's [...] "unreserved opposition" [...] {{was based on the}} real security threat it faced, its [...] "profound regret" [...] could have been rooted in perceived betrayal by the United States. A protector of Israel since the Six-Day War, the U.S. was planning to sell military surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia, a country hostile towards Israel. A Boston Globe editorial from May 4, 1981 recognized this contradiction as well as other threats posed by the AWACS sale, noting, [...] "the intention to sell AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia constitutes not only a manifest contradiction of Reagan's campaign promise to enhance Israel's security, but also serves to further destabilize the Mideast, a region whose stability {{was supposed to be a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>priority</b> of the Reagan foreign policy." [...] The sensitivity of Congress to the threats against peace and stability, was matched by its sensitivity to Israel's concerns.|$|E
