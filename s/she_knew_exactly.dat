25|$|In April 2016 Roy's mother Lynn {{reportedly}} {{said she}} was not sure {{what she wanted to}} happen to Carter, referring to an interaction between two unwell people and that Carter could have saved him. After the guilty verdict Roy's father stated publicly that the family were pleased with the verdict but that they wanted privacy and time to process the events they have experienced; Lynn Roy appeared on the CBS '48 Hours' show saying she didn't believe Carter had a conscience and that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what she was doing.|$|E
500|$|To play Tracy, Witherspoon {{developed}} a distinct speech pattern combining strident intonations with a chipper Midwestern accent. She also worked on clenching her facial muscles {{and maintaining a}} clipped walking pace. [...] "That was just Tracy, it so escapes me how it came out!" [...] she said. [...] "I just imagined how uptight people carry themselves, and they grind their teeth at night and they clench their jaw because {{everything has to be}} just perfect." [...] Praising her performance, her co-star Matthew Broderick said, [...] "From the first <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what she wanted—a very aggressive person in a small and cute package... she comes out very funny and very scary at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{during her}} {{freshman}} year, {{knowing that she}} and her senior boyfriend, Brandon Borello, would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job writing songs for Sony/ATV [...] "with the idea and the melody. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what she wanted." [...] The nostalgic song describes a summer romance and Swift's hope that when Borello [...] "think Tim McGraw" [...] he would [...] "think [...] favorite song" [...] – McGraw's [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] – and remember her. Conversely, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] describes a girl furious after a break-up. Swift says that while the song is about [...] "just being mad" [...] and is [...] "completely, brutally honest"; she gave it a comedic edge. While at work after school, Swift [...] "found self just sitting there with [...] guitar going, 'I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!'," [...] a line which developed into the song's chorus. The up-tempo song is heavy with banjos and drums, while the chorus is marked by distorted guitars and big vocals.|$|E
50|$|Joey is {{everything}} Chaz isn’t: smart, classy, observant, sensitive, and subtle — once she finally admits to herself how worthless her husband is, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> where to probe his weaknesses {{and send him}} into a psychological corkscrew.|$|R
50|$|In {{their journey}} {{to escape the}} ever-growing doll, Tommy's Corvette is trashed, two cars are stolen, and one large boat is trashed. They arrive at Del's mother's home, which seems utterly odd. They claim {{to be able to}} listen to live stuff from the past with their radio. Del's mother shows an uncanny sense of time when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> when the rain will stop.|$|R

She {{has just}} the most exquisitely pearly, pure, delicate, saint-like look, at times, that you ever saw; and then <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how <b>she</b> does look, and just how to use her looks; and John can't be blamed for believing in her. I, who know all about her, am {{sometimes}} taken in by her." ...|$|R
500|$|Tisdale's music, {{which is}} {{predominantly}} considered pop, has included ballads, dance-pop, hip hop, and rock influences. Boys, heartbreak, and relationship breakups are common themes in Tisdale's songs. She defined her music {{career as a}} way to connect herself with the fans and to inspire them. She claimed that, while Headstrong (2007) allowed her to [...] "learn [...] as an artist", with her second album, Guilty Pleasure (2009), <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what she wanted to do}} as an artist. Tisdale has named many influences on her musical career, including Christina Aguilera, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Pat Benatar, [...] Pink, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Led Zeppelin, and AC/DC. Tisdale said that [...] "almost anything" [...] inspires her, but she is mainly inspired by female pop singers. She often co-writes the songs she records; for her debut album Headstrong, she had writing credits in four songs, while she co-wrote five tracks for her album Guilty Pleasure. The songs in which she has songwriting credits are often personal. In 2009, while discussing the songs she co-wrote for her second studio album, Tisdale said that [...] "a lot of the songs on the album [...] about survival and staying strong" [...] and that she wanted those songs to be [...] "a statement and a reflection of what [...] through over the past year and how [...] grown up." [...] She named the song [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song she co-wrote for Guilty Pleasure. She discussed the death of her grandfather in the song [...] "You're Always Here", which she wrote with her husband French.|$|E
2500|$|Bing {{later said}} that Callas {{was the most}} {{difficult}} artist he ever worked with, [...] "because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists, you could get around. But Callas you could not get around. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what she wanted, and why she wanted it." [...] Despite this, Bing's admiration for Callas never wavered, and in September 1959, he sneaked into La Scala in order to listen to Callas record La Gioconda for EMI. Callas and Bing reconciled in the mid 1960s, and Callas returned to the Met for two performances of Tosca with her friend Tito Gobbi.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, the Creature grows {{impatient}} with Victor's possessiveness of Lily, and confronts her while Victor is away. After Lily rejects him, {{he attempts to}} attack her, but she shoves {{him to the ground}} and berates him, mocking his ugliness and naivety. She reveals that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what <b>she</b> is, and that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> her resurrection made her immortal. Lily promises that she will never serve another man again, and instead swears that they will kneel to her. She offers the Creature to overthrow mankind with her, but he is terrified and refuses.|$|R
500|$|However, it {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the song was produced by Polow da Don and that Le Tigre only produced the song [...] "My Girls". Polow da Don talked about working with Aguilera in a Billboard interview, stating: [...] "There's two {{things you need to}} know about Christina Aguilera: The first is that, as far as her singing goes, she's a professionally trained animal. And the other is that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly,</b> absolutely what <b>she</b> wants." ...|$|R
5000|$|I'm {{absolutely}} delighted Britney and Demi {{are joining}} us. Britney {{remains one of}} the biggest stars in the world, she's talented, fascinating - and I believe <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how to spot the X factor. Demi's had an amazing career in music, TV and film for someone her age. She's young, confident, and enthusiastic. I think it's really important that she speaks to our younger audience. The new panel will be dynamic and will work really well with the changes we are making to the show." ...|$|R

60|$|The moment Mrs. Mander saw Captain Ichabod and her {{daughter}} standing together <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what had happened; she had noticed things on board the Belinda. She hurried up to Lucilla and drew her aside.|$|E
60|$|The girl saw {{his face}} in the firelight, and sighed as she noticed the {{gentleness}} in it. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how far his concern for her went. Leger noticed it, but his shrewdness failed him now and then.|$|E
50|$|A {{young girl}} with undeveloped psychic {{abilities}} {{who works at}} the local deli. Although <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what is going on with}} Eiri, her abilities allow her some insight into the paranormal roots of Eiri's obsession.|$|R

500|$|Lydia first {{arriving}} on-screen {{was first}} shown {{as different from}} other characters and it was stated from her inception that she was passionate about music and enjoyed getting people into the music scene. Speaking of her character, Kelly stated [...] "She's very down to earth. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what <b>she</b> wants, where she wants to go, {{and how to get}} there! She's also very level-headed." [...] From the characters inception, she was shown to be an opinionated, proud young student who wasn't afraid of her homosexuality and a person who could make friends very easily, as well as enemies.|$|R
60|$|Joan {{was puzzled}} what to say. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what {{she ought to}} say: what she would have said to any {{ordinary}} child. But to say it to this uncannily knowing little creature did not promise much good.|$|E
60|$|So Alan {{gave way}} {{bit by bit}} all along the line, overborne by Herminia's more perfect and logical {{conception}} of her own principles. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what she felt and wanted; while he knew only in a vague and formless way that his reason agreed with her.|$|E
60|$|When she {{had gone}} he {{explained}} to Philip that it made him uneasy {{if he was not}} certain that Mrs. Foster was within earshot; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what to do with him if anything happened.

50|$|Thunderbird Entertainment {{commenced}} {{production on}} a 10 episode first {{season of the}} new drama-thriller Somewhere Between in March, 2017. The series will air on ABC {{in the summer of}} 2017, and is written by Legend of the Seeker and Taxi Brooklyn co-creator Stephen Tolkin. Based on a Korean format, Somewhere Between centers on Laura Price (Paula Patton). She isn’t crazy: <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> her daughter Serena is going to be murdered. <b>She</b> doesn’t <b>know</b> who the murderer is or why she’ll be killed, but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> when it will happen, where and how. Despite this, all of her attempts to keep her daughter safe fail, and Serena’s fixed, unmovable, terrifying fate keeps her directly in the path of her killer. Tolkin executive produces with Thunderbird's Ivan Fecan and Joseph Broido.|$|R

60|$|Caswall said {{something}} in reply, but his words were carried away on the storm. However, one of her objects was effected: <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> now <b>exactly</b> whereabout on the roof he was. So she moved close to the spot before she spoke again, raising her voice almost to a shout.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Alec {{and aunts}} left on Monday morning. Poor Aunt Janet {{was full of}} dismal forebodings, and gave us so many charges and {{warnings}} {{that we did not}} try to remember any of them; Uncle Alec merely told us to be good and mind what Uncle Roger said. Aunt Olivia laughed at us out of her pansy-blue eyes, and told us <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what we felt like and hoped we'd have a gorgeous time.|$|E
60|$|Dressing {{tightly and}} well, she {{belonged to a}} Woman's Club, but {{was by no means}} the {{neurotic}} and dismal type of member who was always thinking of her rights. She took her rights unconsciously, they came natural to her, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how {{to make the most of}} them without exciting anything but admiration amongst that great class to whom she was affiliated, not precisely perhaps by manner, but by birth, breeding, and the true, the secret gauge, a sense of property.|$|E
6000|$|But {{unfortunately}} Mrs. Darling {{could not}} leave it {{hanging out at the}} window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him; besides, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what he would say: [...] "It all comes of having a dog for a nurse." ...|$|E
5000|$|... ===Islamic State and sacralised rape=== The New York Times {{claims that}} there is {{deep-seated}} religious justification for rape and sexual captivity within the 'Islamic State'. 'He said that by raping me, he is drawing closer to God', claimed a 12-year-old victim. A 15-year-old Yazidi captive reported, “He kept telling me this is Ibadah.” When a 32-year-old slave challenged her captor about repeatedly raping a 12-year-old, he reportedly retorted, [...] "No, she’s not a little girl, she’s a slave and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how to have sex and having sex with her pleases God." [...] The article highlights an extensive and deep rooted theological literature not only exonerating as others have claimed, but also glorifying and sacralising rape.|$|R
60|$|This was, as {{a matter}} of fact, correct, but the color grew plainer in Eleanor's cheek. <b>She</b> had <b>known</b> <b>exactly</b> what her companion's {{advances}} were worth, and at times it had cost her a strenuous effort to hold her anger in check. It was, however, characteristic of her that she had made the effort.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a darling!" [...] exclaimed Lady Maud looking {{round at}} her friends. [...] "Is not <b>she?</b> I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> what you feel. But really you {{shall not be}} the least embarrassed. It may feel strange at first, to be sure, but then I shall be there; {{and do you know}} I look upon you quite as my protege." ...|$|R
60|$|To Miss Biddums {{he confided}} with equal trust his tattered {{garments}} and his more serious griefs. She would make everything whole. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how the Earth had been born, and had reassured the trembling soul of His Majesty the King that terrible time in July {{when it rained}} continuously for seven days and seven nights, and--there was no Ark ready and all the ravens had flown away! She was the most powerful person with whom he was brought into contact--always excepting the two remote and silent people beyond the nursery door.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{used that}} short time well. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what to do. Darting into her chamber, she seized {{the end of}} the rope {{connected}} with the tank and pulled it violently. March saw the rock above the fireplace drop! A clear, sparkling cataract sprang as if by magic from the wall! Next instant there was black darkness and yells, steam, shrieks, and howls--a hissing, hurling hubbub, such as no man can possibly conceive of unless he has seen and heard it! We will not, therefore, even attempt a description.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Dale {{felt that}} she had begun wrong, {{and that she would}} have been able to make better {{progress}} had she omitted all mention of Crosbie's name. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what it was that she wished to say,--what were the arguments which she desired to expound before her daughter; but she did not know what language to use, or how she might best put her thoughts into words. She paused for a while, and Lily went on with her work as though the conversation was over. But the conversation was not over.|$|E
6000|$|But now--did <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what was}} {{the state of the}} case with regard to Mrs. Glasher and her children? She had given a sort of promise--had said, [...] "I will not {{interfere}} with your wishes." [...] But would another woman who married Grandcourt be in fact the decisive obstacle to her wishes, or be doing her and her boy any real injury? Might it not be just as well, nay better, that Grandcourt should marry? For what could not a woman do when she was married, if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> how to assert herself? Here all was constructive imagination. Gwendolen had about as accurate a conception of marriage--that is to say, of the mutual influences, demands, duties of man and woman in the state of matrimony--as she had of magnetic currents and the law of storms.|$|R
5000|$|In a mixed review, Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times {{felt that}} [...] "nothing else on The High Road ... is {{as great as}} Little Too Late'", adding that [...] "JoJo is a teen-pop star with an R&B singer's voice: that means she can outsing much of the competition, {{but it also means}} more ballads (the album's second half is infested with them) and more not-quite-credible lovesick lyrics. Still, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what to do with a good beat. In 'The Way You Do Me,' she sounds as hyped-up as Swizz Beatz's track. And in 'Anything,' she sings a lovely little song over a sample of the 1982 Toto hit 'Africa.' That's classic rock, if you're a singer of a certain age." ...|$|R
5000|$|Opening {{on a sunny}} high school, birds chrip, flags fly, {{and school}} mascots fight. A blonde woman arrives to end Andrew (the mascot)'s fight. The woman is Becky Freeley, the school's {{guidance}} counselor. Becky cheerfully intones that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how difficult high school can be. She meets with kids like Russell - who's failing remedial PE and {{may or may not}} have head lice. But she claims to love the kids, and that they love her back. She strolls past a group of African Americans, cluelessly spouting, [...] "What's the haps, peeps?" [...] She later swipes a Danish from a chunky girl, saying that it may fill the hole in her mouth, but [...] "not the hole in her soul." ...|$|R
