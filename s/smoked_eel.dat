60|$|When Lysbeth woke {{again she}} found herself lying upon the ground, or rather upon a soft {{mattress}} of dry reeds and aromatic grasses. Looking round her she {{saw that she was}} in a hut, reed-roofed and plastered with thick mud. In one corner of this hut stood a fireplace with a chimney artfully built of clay, and on the fire of turfs boiled an earthen pot. Hanging from the roof by a string of twisted grass was a fish, fresh caught, a splendid pike, and near to it a bunch of <b>smoked</b> <b>eels.</b> Over her also was thrown a magnificent rug of otter skins. Noting these things, she gathered that she must be in the hovel of some fisherman.|$|R
2500|$|Māori {{occupied}} the Westland coastal area for several centuries before Europeans began to colonize New Zealand. Māori refer to West Coast, New Zealand as Te Tai Poutini. [...] Population numbers probably never reached very high, {{no more than}} several hundred people probably lived in the area at any given time. Their settlements consisted mostly of small villages on the coast. Food sources were abundant in this area. Seafood was especially important to the Māori who <b>smoked</b> <b>eels</b> and seafish, dried whitebait, and often collected seaweed and mussels. Other local food sources included birds such as duck and pigeon. Stone working was also common among the Māori who had access to greenstone, a nephrite jade that was most often gathered near the Arahura River but was also collected from areas much farther away, including the Haast River and Lake Wakatipu.|$|R
40|$|Eels (Anguilla {{anguilla}} L.) were slaughtered {{using two}} procedures. The commercial method consisted of desliming {{the fish in}} dry salt followed by evisceration. The alternative method consisted of stunning and killing in water {{with a combination of}} electricity and oxygen removal. Eels slaughtered as commercially exhibited aversive reactions and consequently a higher level of muscular activity before death. In raw fillets, differences appeared clearly between the two batches. The alternative slaughter by electricity and gas led to redder, firmer flesh with a higher pH. Myofibrillar proteolysis, lipid oxidation and loss of freshness (as evaluated by K-value) were reduced. After hot-smoking, which is a process that greatly modifies the fish flesh properties, differences between batches were less pronounced. However, eels slaughtered by the alternative method were characterized by a higher pH and a redder colour of the dark muscle, a desirable property form a commercial point of view. When assessed by sensory difference tests, appearance seemed to be the only attribute that allowed panellists to discriminate the two batches. Overall, it is concluded that slaughter by electricity and gas improved the quality of raw and <b>smoked</b> <b>eels</b> compared with the commercial metho...|$|R

50|$|Historically, Belarusians {{had little}} access to seafood, {{and this is}} still evident in the cuisine. The most common sea fish (after herring, {{which has been the}} most common appetizer all along the Baltic coast and its {{vicinity}} ever since the 14th century) are hake and cod and there are relatively few dishes with such fish. Much more traditional and common are lake fish, notably zander, cooked in endless ways, and carp (especially the famous stuffed carp, the gefilte fisch of Jewish cuisine). <b>Eels,</b> <b>smoked</b> or stuffed, are the specialty of the lake country in the northwestern part of Belarus, adjacent to Latvia and Lithuania.|$|R
