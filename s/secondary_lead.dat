5|$|Production {{processes}} for primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>lead</b> are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and {{this trend is}} likely to increase in the future. Given adequate techniques, <b>secondary</b> <b>lead</b> is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. <b>Secondary</b> <b>lead</b> production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E
5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of <b>secondary</b> <b>lead</b> is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E

25|$|The supply {{transformer}} (T) {{secondary winding}} is connected across the primary tuned circuit. It might {{seem that the}} transformer would be a leakage path for the RF current, damping the oscillations. However its large inductance gives it a very high impedance at the resonant frequency, so it acts as an open circuit to the oscillating current. If the supply transformer has inadequate leakage inductance, radio frequency chokes are placed in its <b>secondary</b> <b>leads</b> to block the RF current.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the <b>secondary</b> <b>leads</b> Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.|$|R
