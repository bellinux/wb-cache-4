40|$|Introduction: There {{have been}} many {{operations}} documented {{for the treatment of}} hallux valgus and fifth metatarsal bunionette deformities in patients with <b>splay</b> <b>foot</b> carried out separately, with variable success rates. Our aim was to assess the radiological outcome following combined chevron osteotomy of the first and reverse chevron osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal in symptomatic patients with <b>splay</b> <b>foot.</b> To our knowledge, this procedure has not been described in the literature. Methods: Nine symptomatic patients (12 feet) were included in the study. The preoperative and postoperative angles were assessed on weight-bearing radiographs for statistical significance using non-parametric paired t tests. Results: The postoperative hallux valgus angles, intermetatarsal angles, first and fifth metatarsal head widths, and maximum distance between the first and fifth metatarsal heads decreased significantly (p <  0. 05). Conclusion: The results suggest a very good radiological outcome in symptomatic patients following simultaneous first and fifth metatarsal osteotomies. All the angles measured postoperatively, except the distal metatarsal articular angle, showed a statistically significant reduction...|$|R

The old gentleman had been remarkably tall in his earlier days, an advantage which he now lost by stooping to such a degree, that at a meeting, where there was some dispute concerning the sort of arch which should be thrown over a considerable brook, a facetious neighbour proposed to offer Milnwood a handsome sum for his curved backbone, alleging that he would sell any thing that belonged to him. <b>Splay</b> <b>feet</b> of unusual size, long thin hands, garnished with nails which seldom felt the steel, a wrinkled and puckered visage, the length of which corresponded with that of his person, together with a pair of little sharp bargain-making grey eyes, that seemed eternally looking out for their advantage, completed the highly unpromising exterior of Mr Morton of Milnwood. As it would have been very injudicious to have lodged a liberal or benevolent disposition in such an unworthy cabinet, nature had suited his person with a mind exactly in conformity with it, that is to say, mean, selfish, and covetous.|$|R

We made a rush at the first open door, and passed comfortably under the heels of some horses gathered under the arched court, and up a stone staircase, {{which turned out to be}} that of the Russian consul's house. His people welcomed us most cordially to his abode, and the ladies and the luggage (objects of our solicitude) were led up many stairs and across several terraces to a most comfortable little room, under a dome of its own, where the representative of Russia sat. Women with brown faces and draggle-tailed coats and turbans, and wondering eyes, and no stays, and blue beads and gold coins hanging round their necks, came to gaze, as they passed, upon the fair neat Englishwomen. Blowsy black cooks puffing over fires and the strangest pots and pans on the terraces, children paddling about in long striped robes, interrupted their sports or labours to come and stare; and the consul, in his cool domed chamber, with a lattice overlooking the sea, with clean mats, and pictures of the Emperor, the Virgin, and St. George, received the strangers with smiling courtesies, regaling the ladies with pomegranates and sugar, the gentlemen with pipes of tobacco, whereof the fragrant tubes were three yards long.|$|R

50|$|Compacted snow {{conditions}} allow mountaineers {{to progress}} on foot. Frequently crampons {{are required to}} travel efficiently over snow and ice. Crampons attach to a mountaineer's boots to provide additional traction on hard snow (névé) and ice. Using various techniques from alpine skiing and mountaineering to ascend/descend a mountain {{is a form of}} the sport by itself, called ski mountaineering. Ascending and descending a snow slope safely requires the use of an ice axe and many different footwork techniques that have been developed over the past century, mainly in Europe (e.g. French technique and German technique). The progression of footwork from the lowest angle slopes to the steepest terrain is first to <b>splay</b> the <b>feet</b> to a rising traverse, to kicking steps, to front pointing the crampons. The progression of ice axe technique from the lowest angle slopes to the steepest terrain is to use the ice axe first as a walking stick, then a stake, then to use the front pick as a dagger below the shoulders or above, and finally to swinging the pick into the slope over the head. These various techniques may involve questions of differing ice-axe design depending on terrain, and even whether a mountaineer uses one or two ice axes. Anchors for the rope in snow are sometimes unreliable, and include the snow stakes, called pickets, deadman devices called flukes which are fashioned from aluminium, or devised from buried objects that might include an ice axe, skis, rocks or other objects. Bollards, which are simply carved out of consolidated snow or ice, also sometimes serve as anchors.|$|R
40|$|Brachyphalangy, {{polydactyly}} and tibial aplasia/hypoplasia syndrome (OMIM 609945) {{is a rare}} congenital disorder. Only seven {{patients have}} been reported to date, and the etiology of this syndrome is unknown. Autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression has been suggested based on the presence of minor features in some parents and the fact that neither parental consanguinity nor pairs of affected siblings were observed. We report on the first patient with this syndrome who was born to consanguineous parents. Neither the mother nor the father, who were first cousins, had clinical features suggestive of a manifestation of brachyphalangy, polydactyly and tibial aplasia/hypoplasia syndrome.

Clinical problems included brachydactyly of hands and <b>feet,</b> <b>splaying</b> of fingers and toes, preaxial polydactyly of feet, bilateral tibial aplasia, shortened radius and ulna, and characteristic facial dysmorphic signs.

5000|$|Reverse, back, or {{backward}} kick {{is used to}} swim backwards {{along the}} main body axis. It {{is probably the most}} difficult finning technique, and is not suited to some styles of fin. The stroke starts with the legs extended backwards at full stretch, heels together and toes pointed [...] The power stroke involves flexing the feet to extend the fins sideways, <b>feet</b> <b>splayed</b> outwards as much as possible, close to right angles to the legs and pulling the fins towards the body by flexing the legs at the knees and hips in a motion that pulls the diver backwards. Part of the thrust is due to flow across the width of the fins, as they are swept outward and forward. The fins are then pointed backwards to reduce drag, heels moved together, and legs extended to the start position. Fairly stiff, wide bladed fins are reputed to be most suitable for this stroke, which generally produces very little thrust for the effort expended, but is the only method of finning which moves the diver backward. Reverse kick is generally considered an advanced skill.|$|R
