25|$|The Social Security Administration's {{authority}} to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e., redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities.

These criteria seek to balance financial and economic considerations with benefit adequacy and equity issues and the administrative challenges associated with various proposals.

First, no single measure of adequacy provides a complete picture; each measure reflects a different outlook on what adequacy means.

25|$|CBO {{reported}} that net {{interest on the}} public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion.

25|$|Social Security {{is funded}} {{primarily}} through payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are {{collected by the}} Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the two <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Funds.

Obama ultimately extended the Bush tax cuts for approximately 98% of taxpayers as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1–2% of income earners.

25|$|Many factors affect people's {{retirement}} decisions. Retirement funding {{education is}} a big factor that affects the success of an individual’s retirement experience. <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> clearly {{plays an important role}} because most individuals solely rely on <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> as their only retirement option, when <b>Social</b> <b>Security’s</b> both <b>trust</b> funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual’s retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as, Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people {{are much more likely to}} retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age a is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age a+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> earnings test or the tax system).|$|R

In 2011, there will be 56 million beneficiaries and 158 million workers paying in. In 2010, total income was $781.1 billion and expenditures were $712.5 billion, which meant a total net increase in assets of $68.6 billion. Assets in 2010 were $2.6 trillion, an amount {{that is expected to}} be adequate to cover the next 10 years. In 2023, total income and interest earned on assets are projected to no longer cover expenditures for Social Security, as demographic shifts burden the system. By 2035, the ratio of potential retirees to working age persons will be 37 percent—there will be less than three potential income earners for every retiree in the population.

The Trust Fund is a fiscal nullity but appears to be regarded by many as essential, hence the public debate is about how to "fix" it, rather than about the moral question of whether to fund scheduled benefits, which are clearly affordable. This misunderstanding indicates the need for a shift in emphasis in public descriptions of the program. For this, this paper lays out a set of data, arguments and analogies that are asserted to be accurate representations of the OASDI program and Trust Fund operation, and which are proposed as tools for public education. Finally, this paper argues that an important step in shifting public debate is to re-institute full recourse to Treasury funding for any payroll tax shortfall, which will force the public debate back to benefit levels and revenue sources. ...|$|R

Social Security's total expenditures have exceeded its non-interest income since 2010. The deficit of non-interest income relative to cost was about $49 billion in 2010, $45 billion in 2011, and $55 billion in 2012. During 2010, an estimated 157 million people paid into the program and 54 million received benefits, roughly 2.91 workers per beneficiary. [...] Since the Greenspan Commission in the early 1980s, Social Security has cumulatively collected far more in payroll taxes dedicated to the program than it has paid out to recipients—nearly $2.6 trillion in 2010. This annual surplus is credited to <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>trust</b> funds that hold special non-marketable Treasury securities. This surplus amount is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Social Security Trust Fund". The proceeds are paid into the U.S. Treasury where they may be used for other government purposes. Social Security spending will increase sharply over the next decades, largely due to the retirement of the baby boom generation. The number of program recipients is expected to increase from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. Program spending is projected to rise from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to 5.9% of GDP by 2030, where it will stabilize. The Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.8% of the payroll tax base or 0.6% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.3% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP. Various reforms have been debated for Social Security. Examples include reducing future annual cost of living adjustments (COLA) provided to recipients, raising the retirement age, and raising the income limit subject to the payroll tax ($118,500 in 2014). Because of the mandatory nature of the program and large accumulated surplus in the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Trust</b> Fund, the Social Security system has the legal authority to compel the government to borrow to pay all promised benefits through 2036, when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted.

40|$|IntroductionOne of the new, {{significant}} and complicated concepts in current {{world and in}} many political, social and economic discussions is the concept and subject of security. Security is considered as an individual’s and society’s constant need, whose lack or disruption brings consequences, and reflections which are perilous, and worrisome (Torabi and Goodarzi, 2004 : 32). Civil humans need peace {{in order to live}} together and make progress, but with the spread of crimes and social deviations, insecurity begins to increase feelings of anxiety and stress (Javid, 2006 : 119). On the other hand, one of the most fundamental factors that can lead to better security and an accepted level of tranquility and mental health in society is social capital, which plays a more effective role than the physical and humanistic capitals in society {{and in the case of}} its absence, it would be difficult or impossible to continue with the process of cultural, economic and security development. It can establish social consistency and provide social order that is the foundation of <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> In addition, security is improbable without the cooperation and participation of all members of society. So the lack or decrease of social capital leads to difficulties, crisis and a great deal of social problems. This article intends to explore feeling of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> and elements of social capital, examining the relationship between elements of social capital and feeling of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> in the city of Kashan. Methods and Materials Research method in this study is survey. A logical and structured combination of data, called variable matrix due to case data, is used in the sense that identical information about at least two cases is gathered to make a matrix (Devas, 2004 : 14). The information and data collected in this research are based on researcher-made questionnaire and SPSS software has been used for data analysis. Research population included all over 18 year-old citizens of Kashan, whose total number, according to a 2006 census, is above 185600 individuals. Kashan has two municipality territories and 10 districts. Based on land price, urban conveniences and location status, we divided these districts into three groups of affluent, mean and impoverished districts. Districts 1 and 5 are selected as affluent, 4 and 6 as mean and eventually 8 and 9 as impoverished. We used multistep Cluster Sampling to select 362 individuals and distribute questionnaire among them according to the above district divisions. Discussion of Result and Conclusions The purpose of this research was to clarify the relationship between social capital and feeling of <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> Our major hypothesis was that there is a meaningful relationship between the rate of social capital and feeling of security in the sense that the higher the rate of social capital, the more the rate of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> feeling among citizens. The results of the study show that there is not in fact a meaningful relationship between background variables (e. g. sex, age, educational level, marital status and the rate of family expenses) with feeling of <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> However, the results of the study indicate that there is a direct relationship between the amount of social capital and citizens’ feeling of <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> Also, the findings emphasize there is a direct relationship between social trust and feeling of <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> Likewise, there is a meaningful relationship between social consciousness and feeling of <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> However, the research results show that there is not a meaningful relationship between norm of mutual action and feeling of social secure among citizens.
