I am off, to scour the country as usual. I am off, to {{cultivate}} the field of public indigestion with the triple plowshare of aloes, <b>scammony</b> and gamboge." [...] He stopped and turned round at the door. [...] "By-the-by, a message from my unfortunate wife.

And {{how in the}} world did I find my way to this house? My dear girl, I have been occupied, since we last saw each other, in slightly modifying my old professional habits. I have shifted from Moral Agriculture to Medical Agriculture. Formerly I preyed on the public sympathy, now I prey on the public stomach. Stomach and sympathy, sympathy and stomach--look them both fairly in the face when you reach the wrong side of fifty, and you will agree with me that they come to much the same thing. However that may be, here I am--incredible as it may appear--a man with an income, at last. The founders of my fortune are three in number. Their names are Aloes, <b>Scammony,</b> and Gamboge. In plainer words, I am now living--on a Pill. I made a little money (if you remember) by my friendly connection with you. I made a little more by the happy decease (Requiescat in Pace!) of that female relative of Mrs. Wragge's from whom, as I told you, my wife had expectations. Very good. What do you think I did? I invested the whole of my capital, at one fell swoop, in advertisements, and purchased my drugs and my pill-boxes on credit. The result is now before you. Here I am, a Grand Financial Fact. Here I am, with my clothes positively paid for; with a balance at my banker's; with my servant in livery, and my gig at the door; solvent, flourishing, popular--and all on a Pill." ...|$|E

50|$|Scammonin, Jalapin or Scammonium is a {{glycoside}} derived naturally {{from the}} stems of the Jalap plant, and from <b>Scammony.</b> It {{is used in}} medicine as a strong cathartic.|$|E
50|$|The active {{principle}} is the glucoside scammonin or jalapin, C34H114O6. The dose of scammonium is 5 to 10 grains, of <b>scammony</b> resin 3 to 8 grains. Like certain other resins, <b>scammony</b> is inert {{until it has}} passed from the stomach into the duodenum, where it meets the bile, a chemical reaction occurring {{between it and the}} taurocholate and glycocholate of sodium, whereby it is converted into a powerful purgative. Its action is essentially that of a hydragogue, and is exercised upon practically {{the entire length of the}} alimentary canal. The drug is not a cholagogue, nor does it markedly affect the muscular coat of the bowel, but it causes a great increase of secretion from the intestinal glands. It acts in about four hours. In large doses it is a violent gastrointestinal irritant. In consonance with the statement that <b>scammony</b> acts only after admixture with the bile, is the fact that hypodermic or intravenous injection of the drug produces no purgation, or indeed any other result. The drug frequently kills both roundworm and tapeworm, especially the former, and is therefore an anthelmintic. It is not largely used, but is very effective in the treatment of severe constipation, especially in children.|$|E
5000|$|Convolvulus scammonia, known {{commonly}} as <b>scammony,</b> is a bindweed {{native to}} {{the countries of the}} eastern part of the Mediterranean basin; it grows in bushy waste places, from Syria in the south to the Crimea in the north, its range extending westward to the Greek islands, but not to northern Africa or Italy.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{recipe for}} [...] "True Daffy" [...] from 1700 lists the {{following}} ingredients: aniseed, brandy, cochineal, elecampane, fennel seed, jalap, manna, parsley seed, raisin, rhubarb, saffron, senna and spanish liquorice. Chemical analysis has shown {{this to be}} a laxative made mostly from alcohol. Other recipes include Guiuacum wood chips, caraway, Salt of Tartar, and <b>scammony.</b>|$|E
50|$|The hard {{transparent}} resins, {{such as the}} copals, dammars, mastic, and sandarac, are principally {{used for}} varnishes and adhesives, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins (frankincense, elemi, turpentine, copaiba), and gum resins containing essential oils (ammoniacum, asafoetida, gamboge, myrrh, and <b>scammony)</b> are more used for therapeutic purposes and incense. The resin of the Aleppo Pine is used to flavour retsina, a Greek resinated wine.|$|E
50|$|It is a twining perennial, bearing flowers {{like those}} of Convolvulus arvensis, and having irregularly arrow-shaped leaves and a thick fleshy root. The dried juice, virgin <b>scammony,</b> {{obtained}} by incision of the living root, {{has been used in}} medicine as scammonium, but the variable quality of the drug has led to the employment of scammoniae resina, which is obtained from the dried root by digestion with alcohol.|$|E
