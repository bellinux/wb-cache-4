500|$|On the {{characterization}} of Catwoman, Waters explained [...] "Sam Hamm {{went back to the}} way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{in spring}} 1948, actors were filmed on large soundstages mouthing to a {{playback}} {{of the dialogue}} soundtrack. Disney had previously used live-action reference on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, {{but as part of}} an effort to keep the production cost down, the footage was used to check the plot, timing, and movement of the characters before animating it. The footage was then edited frame-by-frame onto large Photoshat sheets to duplicate, in which the animators found too restrictive as they were not allowed to imagine anything that the live actors did not present since that kind of experimentation might necessitate changes and cost more money. Additionally, the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles. Frank Thomas explained, [...] "Anytime you'd think of another way of staging the scene, they'd say: 'We can't get the camera up there'! Well, you could get the animation camera up there! <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go with what worked well in live action." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E

50|$|The first Baby Alive doll was {{introduced}} by Kenner in 1973. It could be fed food packets mixed with water, and came with a bottle, diapers, and feeding spoon.

Defensemen found Gretzky a most elusive target. Fellow Hockey Hall of Famer Denis Potvin compared attempting to hit Gretzky to [...] "wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill." [...] The 205-pound (93 kg) Potvin, a three-time winner of the Norris Trophy for best defenceman, added that part of the problem in hitting Gretzky hard was that he was [...] "a tough guy to dislike... what was there to hate about Gretzky?

Laine's contract at Mercury would be up for renewal the following year, and Miller soon brought Laine to Columbia as well.
