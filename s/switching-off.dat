The two horizontal axes T_off and R_cb represent the <b>switching-off</b> time of different schemes and various resistance values respectively.

Before or after the recovery, the peak current is significantly reduced. Hence, it is suggested to avoid <b>switching-off</b> around voltage recovery. In practice, the instant of fault clearance is unpredictable, thus we cannot ensure crowbar deactivating before voltage recovery. Therefore, postponing <b>switching-off</b> is more practical.

And among the different rated powers of the DFIGs, the influence of crowbar <b>switching-off</b> time on I_r,off is similar [...]...|$|E
30|$|The {{comparison}} of the DC-link voltage is shown in Fig.  10 b. It is notable that combination 1 generates the most violent DC-link voltage fluctuation, and the maximum voltage exceeds the safety limit. Hence combination 1 may be impractical {{from the perspective of}} DC-link voltage safety. And combination 2 leads to a quite steady voltage during the grid fault and after the crowbar <b>switching-off,</b> while the voltage fluctuates during the crowbar operation after the voltage recovery. The combination optimum obtains the best performance from the voltage recovery to crowbar <b>switching-off,</b> and the fluctuation of voltage after <b>switching-off</b> is also acceptable.|$|E
30|$|When the crowbar is activated, the RSC {{is blocked}} {{so that the}} DFIG is {{temporally}} out of control, and thereby operates as a squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) that consumes reactive power.

Premature <b>switching-off</b> would not achieve sufficient damping for the inrush current, while postponed <b>switching-off</b> would prolong the uncontrolled time of the DFIG and consume additional reactive power.|$|E

40|$|International audience—In this work, {{we use a}} {{stochastic}} geometric {{approach in}} order to study the impact on energy consumption when base stations are switched off independently of each other. We present here both the uplink and downlink analysis {{based on the assumption}} that base stations are distributed according to an independent stationary Poisson point process. This type of modeling allows us to make use of the property that the spatial distribution of the base stations after thinning (<b>switching-off)</b> is still a Poisson process. This implies that the probability distribution of the SINR can be kept unchanged when <b>switching-off</b> base stations provided that we scale up the transmission power of the remaining base stations. We then solve the problem of optimally selecting the switch-off probabilities so as to minimize the energy consumptions while keeping unchanged the SINR probability distribution. We then study the trade-off in the uplink performance involved in <b>switching-off</b> base stations. These include energy consumption, the coverage and capacity, and the impact on amount of radiation absorbed by the transmitting user...|$|E
30|$|The global optimal {{coordinate}} combinations can {{be obtained}} with all these indicators taken into consideration. Based on the different priorities of these indicators, the global optimal combinations are not unique. For example, if {{the safety of the}} DC-link is the priority, the performances of premature <b>switching-off</b> and higher resistance values are contradictive with the requirements. Thus a trade-off should be considered. Due to the priority of the DC-link voltage, postponed <b>switching-off</b> and resistance under the DC-link limitation are adopted in coordination. And the requirements for reactive power could be satisfied by other reactive compensations. Thereby the indicators of reactive power could compromise with the other indicators for global optimal coordination.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that HER- 2 /neu (erbB- 2) {{blocking}} therapy strategies can cause tumor remission. However, the responsible molecular mechanisms are not yet known. Both ERK 1 / 2 and Akt/PKB are critical for HER- 2 -mediated signal transduction. Therefore, we used a mouse tumor model that allows downregulation of HER- 2 in tumor tissue by administration of anhydrotetracycline (ATc). <b>Switching-off</b> HER- 2 caused a rapid tumor remission by more than 95 % within 7 d of ATc administration compared to the volume before <b>switching-off</b> HER- 2. Interestingly, HER- 2 downregulation caused a dephosphorylation of p-ERK 1 / 2 by more than 80 % already before tumor remission occurred. Levels of total ERK protein were not influenced. In contrast, dephosphorylation of p-Akt occurred later, when the tumor was already in remission. These data suggest that in our HER- 2 tumor model dephosphorylation of p-ERK 1 / 2 may be more critical for tumor remission than dephosphorylation of p-Akt. To test this hypothesis we used a second mouse tumor model that allows ATc controlled expression of BXB-Raf 1 because the latter constitutively signals to ERK 1 / 2, but cannot activate Akt/PKB. As expected, downregulation of BXB-Raf 1 in tumor tissue caused a strong dephosphorylation of p-ERK 1 / 2, but did not decrease levels of p-Akt. Interestingly, tumor remission after <b>switching-off</b> BXB-Raf 1 was similarly efficient as the effect of HER- 2 downregulation, despite the lack of p-Akt dephosphorylation. In conclusion, two lines of evidence strongly suggest that dephosphorylation of p-ERK 1 / 2 and not that of p-Akt is critical for the rapid tumor remission after downregulation of HER- 2 or BXB-Raf 1 in our tumor model: (i) dephosphorylation of p-ERK 1 / 2 but not that of p-Akt precedes tumor remission after <b>switching-off</b> HER- 2 and (ii) downregulation of BXB-Raf 1 leads to a similarly efficient tumor remission as downregulation of HER- 2, although no p-Akt dephosphorylation was observed after <b>switching-off</b> BXB-Raf 1...|$|E

Although there exist large details in the literature of cell-breathing on energy-efficiency related to the Radio Resource Management (RRM) aspects, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there is still a lack of work on analysing the consequences of cell-breathing and BS <b>switching-off</b> schemes on the EM exposure issues related to the mobile terminal. In such approaches during low-traffic, whereas there are some BSs being switched-off, there are some other BSs that must remain active expanding their cell sizes to guarantee coverage. This requires a transmission power increase for both downlink and uplink side, that for mobile devices implies an increase of the specific absorption rate (SAR) [W/kg] on the mobile user. To conduct our study, we use one of our previously proposed techniques on cell-breathing to analyse the impact of uplink transmission power increase on resulting SAR levels. Here, different BS <b>switching-off</b> aggressiveness levels are considered to observe the resulting exposure levels using a 3 G/CDMA scenario.

Energy-efficient cell breathing and BS <b>switching-off</b> algorithms are an important tool for energy reduction in cellular networks. In this paper, an energy-effcient cell breathing and offoading mechanism in both macrocellular and heterogeneous networks is studied. First, the need for {{limiting the number of}} Macro-BSs switched off and the control of cell sizes are analyzed. An approach based on the use of a traffic threshold from a technique previously proposed by our team is applied in order to control the BS <b>switching-off</b> aggressiveness. One reason for limiting this aggressiveness is the trade-off we point out between the existing RAN power consumption and the transmission power in uplink for mobile devices.

30|$|Considering the {{significance}} of crowbar switching time, various switching schemes are proposed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In [5], <b>switching-off</b> before fault recovery is recommended to reduce the crowbar operation time and quickly restore {{the control of the}} RSC, but the risk of DC-link over voltage still exists. The switching scheme proposed in [6] activates the crowbar both at the occurrence and recovery of the grid fault respectively, and each time the crowbar operation is limited by a minimum current threshold to reduce the total operation time. The switching schemes proposed in [7, 8] enable multi-switching of the crowbar, and the activation and the deactivation of the crowbar are dependent on the rotor current [7] or the DC-link voltage [8]. The crowbar only operates for several times when the current or voltage exceeds the pre-set threshold to limit the total operation time. According to the codes of the power grid, if a grid fault is very severe, the time for the wind turbines maintaining their connection is relatively short. Hence some other schemes for short fault conditions, such as [9, 10, 11], suggest <b>switching-off</b> after the voltage recovery. Due to the relatively short crowbar activation time, these schemes can obtain preferable transient performance at the acceptable cost of reactive power consumption. Reference [9] reveals that the <b>switching-off</b> after the voltage recovery for 1 or 2 cycles could obtain ideal dynamic performance. And different switching schemes are compared in [10]. In order to further reduce reactive power consumption, the grid side converter (GSC), together with DC-link, can supply reactive power supply during the crowbar operation [10, 11].|$|E
