5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series. It was a spoof soap opera set in an {{antiques}} shop, which, despite its provincial high-street status, manages to supply an unending stream of works by Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always played by the <b>same</b> <b>two</b> actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based it on the long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E
5|$|Also in 1947, Chandler {{sold the}} rights to {{broadcast}} the World Series on the radio for $475,000; he used {{the money from the}} contract to establish a pension fund for baseball players. In 1949, Chandler negotiated a seven-year contract with Gillette and the Mutual Broadcasting System to broadcast the Series. Proceeds from the $4,370,000 deal went directly into the pension fund. The <b>same</b> <b>two</b> companies negotiated a six-year, $6million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950. Again, Chandler directed the proceeds into the pension fund.|$|E

5|$|As Grameen {{bank has}} {{developed}} and expanded {{in the years}} since its beginning, it continues to operate on those <b>same</b> <b>two</b> principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, {{they will be able to}} initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours. As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E

She was refitted in South Africa between November 1941 and February 1942 and then joined the Eastern Fleet at Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|Its first {{involvement}} {{came during}} the 2004 series, where the home Great Britain and Ireland national team defeated the Australians 24–12, with Terry Newton and Andy Farrell both scoring in their home town of Wigan. The venue was again selected for the 2005 series, and again the match was between Great Britain and Australia—this time the home team lost 6–20—with Greater Manchester born Adrian Morley scoring Great Britain's solitary try. Both matches were complete sell-outs, each having attendances above 25,000. The match in 2004 was the third highest attendance of the series, coming behind a match at the City of Manchester Stadium between Great Britain and Australia, and the series final between the <b>same</b> <b>two</b> teams at Elland Road.|$|E

After numerous frontal assaults, Kawaguchi's attack was repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese, who retreated back into the jungle on 14 September. Oka's assault {{in the west and}} the Kuma Battalion's assault in the east were also repulsed by the U.S. Marines over the <b>same</b> <b>two</b> days. Kawaguchi's units were ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau Valley to join with Oka's unit {{on the west side of}} the Lunga Perimeter.

In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.|$|E

Later work in 1967 at Berkeley and 1971 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory fully confirmed the discovery of element 102 and clarified earlier observations. In December 1966, the Berkeley group repeated the Dubna experiments and fully confirmed them, and used this data to finally assign correctly the isotopes they had previously synthesized but could not yet identify at the time, and thus claimed to have discovered nobelium in 1958 to 1961.|$|E
5|$|The Marriott School's {{accounting}} {{program is the}} only program {{in the country to}} receive the American Accounting Association's Innovation in Accounting Education Award twice.

The second award, received in 2007, was for the development of a PhD Prep Track to prepare MAcc students to enroll in a PhD program after graduation. For 2013, the bachelor's degree in the School of Accountancy received two #3 rankings, one by Public Accounting Report and the other by U.S. News & World Report.

Two laps later, Sam Hornish, Jr. {{collided}} with the wall and suffered three flat tires, prompting the second caution. During the caution, most of the leaders made pit stops. Kyle Busch remained the leader after the pit stops and maintained it at the lap 91 restart. Montoya moved into ninth, as Stewart passed Reutimann for third on the <b>same.</b> <b>Two</b> laps later, Jeff Gordon had moved up into ninth. Sunlight came off the track surface by lap 99, causing track temperatures to cool and drivers were reminded by their crew chiefs to drive cautiously in the turns. Martin moved into the thirteenth position by lap 102. Ambrose had moved into third nine laps later. On lap 113, Johnson rejoined the track, albeit without his car's rear bumper. Kyle Busch had built up a {{one and a half}} second lead over Kurt Busch by lap 116. Johnson drove to pit road to resolve tire rubbing problems two laps later.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} of the 1219 treaty with Galicia–Volhynia {{it is noted that}} Mindaugas took {{the wife of}} Vismantas from the Bulionis family for himself. It is assumed that Vismantas' wife and Morta are the same woman. It is known that Vismatas died in 1252 in a battle against Mindaugas; however the date of Mindaugas and Morta's wedding is unknown. There is no consensus on how many children Morta had. The chronicles mention two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, in 1261. In 1263 two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these are the <b>same</b> <b>two</b> sons, whose name got distorted by scribes, or they are four sons. There is no data on any rivals to the crown after the assassination, except for Vaišvilkas and Tautvilas; it would indicate that, whether there were two or four sons, they had perished in their youth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{a group of}} St. Louis {{residents}} drew up {{a plan for a}} revitalized downtown, which included a sculpture garden at the <b>same</b> <b>two</b> blocks where Citygarden is located. That plan was not immediately realized, but in 2006, the City of St. Louis asked the Gateway Foundation to prepare a master plan for the entire Gateway Mall strip. In early 2007, the foundation sponsored a competition, soliciting designs for the planned project; Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, a Charlottesville, Virginia landscape architecture firm, was the winner. The partnership to develop Citygarden was announced in June 2007. The project was initially proposed to the St. Louis Preservation Board in October 2007, while development of the land began in April 2008. Over 250,000 people visited Citygarden before Christmas, 2009, a figure that has since risen to an estimated one million or more. However, because Citygarden has no gates, there is no official visitor count.|$|E

Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins had been found in Grouville by two persons using metal detectors. The hoard may be worth up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic coins. In 2012 the <b>same</b> <b>two</b> men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at rock bottom now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out {{in the first two games}} of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the <b>same</b> <b>two</b> teams in the same order.|$|E
