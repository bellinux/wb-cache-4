5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career. Because knee surgeries, back <b>surgeries,</b> <b>and</b> hip surgeries made {{it much more difficult}} to run, cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape. As a result of the cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.|$|E

5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of <b>surgeries,</b> <b>and</b> {{is one of the leading}} causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E

5|$|Joyce {{set himself}} to {{finishing}} Ulysses in Paris, delighted {{to find that}} he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from Miss Shaw Weaver meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an eyepatch. He was treated by Dr Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929. Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye <b>surgeries</b> <b>and</b> for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung at the time, who after reading Ulysses {{is said to have}} concluded that her father had schizophrenia. Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.|$|E

He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two.

40|$|Aim: This article {{demonstrates}} {{the advantages of}} combined bone induction and orthodontics {{for the management of}} adult orthodontic patients with severe bone loss. Subjects: Five orthodontic patients with severe bone loss are presented. The treatment provided is either periodontal <b>surgery</b> <b>and</b> orthodontics or combined periodontal <b>surgery,</b> bone induction, <b>and</b> orthodontics. Results: The outcome of periodontal <b>surgery</b> <b>and</b> orthodontics resulted in regeneration of the periodontium. However, these successful results were unpredictable. The use of demineralized bone matrix, periodontal <b>surgery,</b> <b>and</b> orthodontics consistently resulted in considerable regain in bone height. Conclusion: Combined bone induction, periodontal <b>surgery,</b> <b>and</b> orthodontics should be added to the armamentarium available to the orthodontist for the management of orthodontic patients with severe bone loss.
