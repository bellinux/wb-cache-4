5|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{sufficient}} to indicate, {{in the first}} edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.|$|E
5|$|WHEN {{on board}} HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain {{facts in the}} {{distribution}} of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.|$|E
25|$|What a book Melville has written! It {{gives me}} an idea of much greater power than his {{preceding}} ones. It hardly <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points.|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, {{but it does}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
25|$|Marxian {{economics}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for {{the most}} part either false or obsolete or meaningless in application to contemporary economic phenomena. Those aspects of Marxian economics which retain validity do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> justify the theoretical structure of the economics.|$|R

25|$|My aim was {{a static}} {{representation}} of movement, a static composition of indications of various positions {{taken by a}} form in movement—with no attempt to give cinema effects through painting. The reduction of a head in movement to a bare line <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> defensible.|$|E
25|$|The {{beauty and}} variety of tone, the {{impeccable}} mechanism, and the noble, architectonic conception were great pianism and great musicianship. It is not customary to compare the work of local artists favorably {{with that of the}} foreign-born great, but I cannot refrain from doing so in this case, because it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Mr. Kirkpatrick was playing the piano as it is not often played by anybody.|$|E
25|$|Madison Square {{was then}} at the parting of the ways; had a double personality, half commercial, half social, with shops {{to the south and}} residences to the north. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so neat, after the raggedness of our Western cities; so {{protected}} by good manners and courtesy—like an open-air drawing-room. I could well imagine a winter dancing party being given there, or a reception for some distinguished European visitor.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> hard,' said Little Dorrit, 'that {{he should}} have lost so many years and {{suffered}} so much, and at last pay all the debts as well. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> hard that he should pay in life and money both.' ...|$|R
25|$|Samuel Pepys {{recorded}} {{in his diary}} for 13 April 1661: To Whitehall to the Banquet House and there saw the King heale, {{the first time that}} ever I saw him do it— which he did with great gravity; and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be an ugly office and a simple one. John Evelyn also refers to the ceremony in his Diary on the dates of 6 July 1660 and 28 March 1684.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{an absolute}} triumph for June Anderson. At a career stage {{where she could}} reasonably be expected to scale down effort, ambition and new projects, she has instead taken the admirable decision to continue expanding her artistic range - as this first-ever Daphne (follow-up to her recent first ever Capriccio Countess) demonstrated.... he singing offered countless ravishments: crystalline timbre, clean-cut line-delineation, dead-on-target intonation, awesomely easy projection of one perilously exposed high phrase after another.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of what I took the liberty to mention {{to you this}} morning was: You are on {{the borders of the}} grave, as well as I; shortly we must both appear before God. When it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> some months since, that my life was near an end, I was troubled that I had not dealt plainly with you. This you will permit me to do now, without any reserve, in the fear and in the presence of God.|$|E

60|$|I {{should be}} a fool to be that. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so natural, so horribly natural. He's young and nice-looking and cheery. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now {{inevitable}} {{that you should have}} fallen in love with him. You might be made for one another.|$|R
25|$|The oratory having increased, by {{the grace}} of God, with the coming {{together}} of prelates and of most important gentlemen, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> fitting in this second book to increase the harmony and the combination of parts, varying the music in diverse ways, now setting it to Latin words and now to the vernacular, sometimes with a greater number of voices and sometimes with fewer, with verses now of one kind and now of another, concerning myself as little as possible with imitations and complexities, in order not to obscure the understanding of the words.|$|E
25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E
25|$|I {{discovered}} {{a dark and}} hairy creature on a branch... The sedapa was also hairy {{on the front of}} its body; the colour there was a little lighter than on the back. The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached to a little above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> rather short. I did not see its feet, but I did see some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so different," [...] he said sadly, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> you {{can live}} your own life, and be independent, and think as you like without being choked with harassments. I feel as if I could keep on—like that——" ...|$|R
5000|$|Balch {{converted}} from Unitarianism {{and became a}} Quaker in 1921. She stated, [...] "Religion <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{one of the most}} interesting things in life, one of the most puzzling, richest and thrilling fields of human thought and speculation... religious experience and thought need also a light a day and sunshine and a companionable sharing with others of which it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there is generally too little... The Quaker worship at its best <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> give opportunities for this sort of sharing without profanation." ...|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone, It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are}} other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful; It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Prussia, Italy, France, [...] Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or India--talking [...] other dialects; And it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if I could know those men, I should become {{attached}} to [...] them, as I do to men in my own lands. O I know we should be brethren and lovers; I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E
25|$|Of this {{head and}} two other pieces of {{sculpture}} exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in The Nation, August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. But it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there was evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was no mere exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.|$|E
25|$|Bertrand Russell {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment on the}} Philosophical Investigations in his book My Philosophical Development:I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
