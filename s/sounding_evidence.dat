40|$|Range-bounding normal faults {{can present}} {{significant}} challenges for seismic exploration. This {{is the case}} of the fault system bounding the Vallo di Diano, the largest intermountain basin in the southern Apennines seismic belt. Industry reflection profiles define the large-scale structure of the basin but barely image the shallow fault system due to unfavorable topographic and near-surface conditions along the foothills of the eastern range. We present two high-resolution wide-aperture profiles recorded at the eastern margin of the basin across unreported scarps that affect Middle–Late Pleistocene alluvial fans and slope debris. The survey is aimed at iden- tifying possible recent faulting across these challenging terrains and at understanding the relationship between shallow structures and the master range-bounding fault at depth. Common depth point processing of wide-aperture reflection data and first- arrival travel-time tomography provide detailed images of the upper 200 – 300 m and <b>sounding</b> <b>evidence</b> of recent activity along previously unknown splays of the fault system. These splays dissect the Mesozoic limestone bedrock and alluvial-fan sequences, affecting their depositional pattern. Very high resolution V P and reflec- tivity images also give hints of possible coseismic surface faulting in Holocene colluvia. These results have relevant implications for the evaluation of the seismogenic potential of the range-bounding fault system and for seismic hazard assessment of the densely urbanized Vallo di Diano basin...|$|E
40|$|One of the tornadoes {{associated}} with Hurricane Able, 1052, occurred near Washington, D. C., and simultaneously with the upper air sounding made there. This {{led to a}} comparison between this particular tornado, along with others of similar environment, and conditions attributed to tornadoes in general. All such tornadoes {{associated with}} hurricanes have to date been observed only in the forward semicircle or along the advancing periphery of the tropical storm. The evidence is strong in favor of time of day having little relation to the occurrence of such tornadoes. A hypothesis is suggested wherein the weaker or nonexistent cyclonic horizontal wind shear of the environment {{may contribute to the}} lesser severity of these tornadoes. Unlike the typical tornado <b>sounding,</b> the limited <b>evidence</b> indicates the absence of (1) a low level temperature inversion, (2) sharp moisture stratification of dry air over moist air, (3) excessive instability...|$|R
40|$|Two {{prominent}} rock suites {{constitute the}} lithology of the Eastern Ghat mobile belt: (1) the khondalite suite - the metapelites, and (2) the charnockite suite. Later intrusives include ultramafic sequences, anorthosites and granitic gneisses. The chief structural {{element in the}} rocks of the Eastern Ghats is a planar fabric (gneissosity), defined by the alignment of platy minerals like flattened quartz, garnet, sillimanite, graphite, etc. The parallelism between the foliation and the lithological layering is related to isoclinal folding. The major structural trend (axial plane foliation trend) observed in the belt is NE-SW. Five major tectonic events have been delineated in the belt. A boundary fault along the western margin of the Eastern Ghats, bordering the low grade terrain has been substantiated by recent gravity and the deep seismic <b>sounding</b> studies. Field <b>evidence</b> shows that the pyroxene granulites (basic granulites) post-date the khondalite suite, but are older than the charnockites {{as well as the}} granitic gneisses. Polyphase metamorphism, probably correlatable with different periods of deformation is recorded. The field relations in the Eastern Ghats point to the intense deformation of the terrain, apparently both before, during and after metamorphism...|$|R
40|$|Our {{capacity}} {{to simulate the}} radiative characteristics of the Earth system has advanced greatly over the past decade. However, new space based measurements show that idealized simulations might not adequately represent the complexity of nature. For example, AIRS simulated multi-layer cloud clearing research provides an excellent groundwork for early Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) operational cloud clearing and atmospheric profile retrieval. However, it doesn't reflect the complicated reality of clouds over land and coastal areas. Thus far, operational AIRS/AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) cloud clearing is not only of low yield but also of unsatisfying quality. This is not an argument for avoiding this challenging task, rather a powerful argument for exploring other synergistic approaches, and for adapting these strategies toward improving both indirect and direct use of cloudy infrared <b>sounding</b> data. Ample <b>evidence</b> is shown in this paper that the indirect use of cloudy sounding data by way of cloud clearing is sub-optimal for data assimilation. Improvements are needed in quality control, retrieval yield, and overall cloud clearing retrieval performance. For example, cloud clearing over land, especially over the desert surface, has led to much degraded retrieval quality and often a very low yield of quality controlled cloud cleared radiances. If these indirect cloud cleared radiances are instead to be directly assimilated into NWP models, great caution must be used. Our limited and preliminary cloud clearing results from AIRS/AMSU (with the use of MODIS data) and an AIRS/MODIS synergistic approach have, however, shown that higher spatial resolution multispectral imagery data can provide much needed quality control of the AIRS/AMSU cloud clearing retrieval. When AIRS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used synergistically, a higher spatial resolution over difficult terrain (especially desert areas) can be achieved and with a much improved accuracy. Preliminary statistical analyses of cloud cleared radiances derived from (1) operational AIRS/AMSU, (2) operational AIRS/AMSU plus the use of MODIS data as quality control, and (3) AIRS/MODIS synergistic single channel and two field of views cloud clearing are Our {{capacity to}} simulate the radiative characteristics of the Earth system ha...|$|R
