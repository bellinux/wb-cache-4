5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} <b>signaling</b> <b>system,</b> but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E
5|$|The system {{currently}} uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside {{signals and}} automatic train stops {{in order to}} provide safe train operation across the whole system. The New York City Subway system has, for the most part, used block signalling since its 1904 opening, and many portions of the <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> were installed between the 1930s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E

5|$|Laying of {{the track}} was {{performed}} by Wiebe, signaling was installed by Norsk Jernbanedrift, Structon Rail installed the overhead wire, and YIT installed the power supply and telecommunications systems. The tunnel has the NSI-63 relay-based <b>signaling</b> <b>system,</b> although it {{was scheduled to be}} replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015. The last six weeks before opening, the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the new and old sections to be connected. This was the most hectic part of construction, as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg. The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100,000 man-hours.|$|E

5|$|Vestgrensa {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involved a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, and installation of a third rail power supply and a new <b>signaling</b> <b>system.</b> The electrified third rail {{made it impossible for}} passengers to cross at track level, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the Oslo Metro opened as {{an upgrade}} of two {{existing}} suburban tramways, the Østensjø- and Lambertseter Lines. By 1970, {{the system was}} supplemented by the Grorud- and Furuset Lines. They only operated to the eastern suburbs. In 1987, the system was expanded to connect to the western network, that remained a suburban tramway with overhead wires, two-car platforms and an inferior <b>signaling</b> <b>system.</b> In 1993, the Sognsvann Line was converted to metro standard, with the Røa Line following two years later. When the order for the MX3000 trains was placed, the Kolsås- and Holmenkoll Lines still used overhead wires, {{and would not be}} able to use the new stock. Both systems were at the time being considered for conversion to light rail systems, that would connect to the Lilleaker- and Ullevål Hageby Line, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a Gullfisk {{lost control}} {{on the line and}} derailed near Sjømansskolen, causing the tram to be scrapped. From 1977, Oslo Sporveier also put SM53 trams into service. This was not sufficient, and Oslo Sporveier {{considered}} introducing the old Ekeberg Line trams. But this would be costly, as the vehicles would have to be upgraded. Instead, used MBG trams from the Gothenburg Tramway were put into service. The section from Sæter to Ljabru had since the opening had a <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> that had worked fine with 15- and 20-minute headways, but did not work properly with 10-minute routes. A new system was installed, and proved to work just as poorly as the old system. During 1979, the section was rebuilt to double track, although the short bridge over Nordstrandsveien was kept single tracked.|$|E
40|$|As {{existing}} {{electrical and}} mechanical railway <b>signalling</b> <b>systems</b> are replaced with systems using computer technologies, system capability has improved {{in such a}} way that the system is intellectualised. The railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> is a vital system that is directly connected to massive life damage or economical loss due to its features. Therefore strict safety activity and assessment methodology are be required. There are several international standards for railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety activity requirements, which are required to demonstrate those safety activities. <b>Signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety assessment is performed by analysing and evaluating the system safety activity process and its results. In this paper, we suggest railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety activity techniques for the railway <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> safety assessment and its specific execution techniques at each activity phase.

50|$|The total {{construction}} {{cost was}} €1.42 billion. The <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> installed is the TVM-430 in-cab <b>signalling</b> <b>system,</b> {{the same as}} LGV Nord in France, and High Speed 1 in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The <b>signalling</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the two}} {{countries}} are also different. The problems were overcome by requiring all trains operating on the line to be dual voltage and have dual <b>signalling</b> <b>systems,</b> including a minority of the X2 trains operated throughout Sweden by SJ. The <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> switches on Peberholm in Denmark, while the entire bridge uses the Danish electrical <b>system.</b> The Danish <b>signalling</b> <b>system</b> is only approved for 180 km/h speed, while the Swedish system is approved for 200 km/h. The entire bridge has 200 km/h maximum speed, also the Danish part, as the only railway in Denmark.|$|R
5|$|Nordberg {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involves a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, installation of third rail power supply and a new <b>signaling</b> <b>system.</b> The third rail {{made it impossible to}} cross the line in-grade, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations. The transport authorities decided to close Nordberg, arguing that the access roads to the station were steep and dangerous, and icy during the winter. The residents of Nordberg opposed the closure of the station, arguing that it had served the area well with its central position in the area. Nevertheless, the station was closed, along with the level crossing that formerly had allowed for car traffic to cross the tracks. An underpass for pedestrians was constructed.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem that}} is slowing down {{high-speed}} rail in Sweden is the present <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> (ATC), which does not allow speeds over 200km/h.
