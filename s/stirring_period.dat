40|$|Quality Characteristics Of Aceh Cacao Beans Resulted From Different Fermentation Methods) ABSTRACT. Response {{of cocoa}} beans to any {{fermentation}} treatment may {{vary according to}} crop variety, farming conditions and practices, and fermentation methods; including type of beans stirring methods and stirring frequencies applied during fermentation period. The objective {{of this research is}} to study quality characteristics of Aceh fermented cocoa beans treated with different stirring methods and stirring frequencies. The cocoa beans of 40 cm mass depth were kept in 53 x 40 x 50 cm rattan buckets and were fermented for 5 days. Beans stirring during fermentation was conducted either by in-place stirring andreplace-stirring to other rattan bucket. <b>Stirring</b> <b>period</b> was set for each 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours of fermentation time. Beans temperature, pH, and total sugar content for each <b>stirring</b> <b>period</b> along five days-fermentationtime were recorded. The fermented beans were sundried for moisture content of approximately 6 %. The results showed that the beans temperature during fermentation increased up to 45. 7 - 46. 6 oC on the third-day and then decreased to 37. 9 - 40. 4 oC on the fifth-day. The highest temperature (46. 6 oC) was recorded for in-place stirring with <b>stirring</b> <b>period</b> of 48 hours. The pH value of the beans decreased from 5. 6 - 5. 9 on the first-day to 3. 2 - 3. 4 on the fourth-day and then slightly increased to 3. 4 in average on the fifth-day. The total sugar content decreased from 9. 1 - 9. 6 % on the first-day to approximately 0. 4 % on the fifth-day. Quality analysis of the fermented beans showed that pH value varied 5. 5 - 5. 8 and fat content was 47. 9 - 49. 1 %. The best quality of fermented beans was found for replace-stirring method with <b>stirring</b> <b>period</b> of 24 hours. This treatment resulted in fermented cocoa beans with 0. 4 % moldy, 17. 5 % partly purple, 3. 0 % slaty, and 76. 7 % fully fermented...|$|E

A combined route of stirring at semi-solid state followed by stirring at liquid state is proposed.

This paper presents work which examines the effect of viscosity during Al–SiC MMC production. Processing periods (up to 65 min), stirring speeds (50 – 500 rpm), and re-inforcement sizes (13 – 100 lm) for two different viscosity levels (1 and 300 mPa s) were investigated. Computer simulations, room temperature analogue fluid simulations, and MMC castings were performed. Volume fraction results of SiC at different locations within the fluids were assessed by each of these methods and compared. From these tests, a stirring speed of 200 rpm for the lower viscosity fluid and 300 rpm for the higher viscosity fluid {{were found to be}} best in order to produce uniform distributions of SiC. In order to obtain a uniform re-inforcement distribution in the lower viscosity system, <b>stirring</b> <b>periods</b> were found to range from 14 to 170 s and for the higher viscosity system from 540 to more than 3920 s.

The differential diffusion and salt finger fluxes were also dependent on the turbulence intensity. Differential diffusion fluxes were stronger for large values of the turbulent Richardson number RiT than for small values of RiT.

40|$|Stir casting is an {{economical}} {{process for}} the fabrication of aluminum matrix composites. There are many parameters in this process, which affect the final microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites. In this study, micron-sized SiC particles were used as reinforcement to fabricate Al- 3 wt% SiC composites at two casting temperatures (680 and 850 °C) and stirring periods (2 and 6 min). Factors of reaction at matrix/ceramic interface, porosity, ceramic incorporation, and agglomeration of the particles were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transition electron microscope (HRTEM) studies. From microstructural characterizations, it is concluded that the shorter <b>stirring</b> <b>period</b> is required for ceramic incorporation to achieve metal/ceramic bonding at the interface. The higher stirring temperature (850 °C) also leads to improved ceramic incorporation. In some cases, shrinkage porosity and intensive formation of Al 4 C 3 at the metal/ceramic interface are also observed. Finally, the mechanical properties of the composites were evaluated, and their relation with the corresponding microstructure and processing parameters of the composites was discussed...|$|E

Some highlights are: (1) Ashalloy ingot with ''C'' type fly ash was synthesized using stir casting techniques similar to the successful castings of ''F'' type fly ash. Agglomeration was noted. <b>Stirring</b> <b>periods</b> were increased up to 45 minutes compared to the normal 5 minutes {{to determine whether the}} shear force of stirring would disagglomerate the clusters noted with this type of fly ash. The resulting sample showed clustering. (2) The ashalloy ingots of ''C'' type fly ash were remelted and poured into permanent molds using a cloth filter to screen out clusters. There was no major reduction in clusters of fly ash particles in the composite since the filter with the mesh size larger than 1 x 1 mm was used. The composite melt would not flow through when filters with smaller openings were used. (3) The fly ash sample from Wisconsin Electric Power Company was sent for classification. (4) A 1 lb. sample of JTM-processed fly ash was sent to Wisconsin Electric Power Company for classification and 10 lb. of same fly ash was sent to The Jet Pulverizer Company for jet milling. (5) Experiments on fly ash pretreatment as well as synthesis of ash alloy are continuing. (6) Attempts are being made to apply high speed shear mixing with selected liquids to disperse the clusters noted in ashalloy with the ''C'' type fly ash base. Stir casting processes have been developed to incorporate type ''F'' fly ash of different sizes and measuring tensile data on cast bars. This data enables selection of the optimum size of fly ash to meet specific property requirements.

The models developed for predicting the flash point of partially miscible mixtures in the literature to date are all based on the assumption of liquid-liquid equilibrium. In real-world environments, however, the liquid-liquid equilibrium assumption does not always hold, such as the collection or accumulation of waste solvents without stirring, where complete <b>stirring</b> for a <b>period</b> of time is usually used to ensure the liquid phases being in equilibrium. This study investigated the effect of stirring on the flash point behavior of binary partially miscible mixtures.

The first series was aqueous-organic mixtures, including water + 1 -butanol, water + 2 -butanol, water + isobutanol, water + 1 -pentanol, and water + octane; the second series was the mixtures of two flammable solvents, which included methanol + decane, methanol + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, and methanol + octane. Results reveal that for binary aqueous-organic solutions the flash-point values of unstirred mixtures were located between those of the completely stirred mixtures and those of the flammable component.

Particular attention has attracted TiO 2 ceramic scaffolds due to its excellent mechanical properties compared to other ceramic materials, biocompatibility and good osteoconductivity. TiO 2 scaffolds were produced via polymer foam replica method. Commercially available anatase powder, polyvinyl alcohol solution, ethylene glycol, ammonia solution and deionised water were used as raw materials for ceramic slurry preparation. Homogenisation of the slurry was conducted by <b>stirring</b> for different <b>period</b> of time. Particle size distribution, viscosity and pH of titania slurry were monitored during stirring. Cylindrical polyurethane foams with fully interconnected pore structure serves as a sacrificial template for the ceramic coating.

Increasing sintering temperature to 1300 °C complete phase transition from anatase to rutile crystalline modification takes place and stable rutile modification has been obtained. By optimising thermal treatment regimes grain growth and collapse of struts can be controlled that may result in higher compressive strength. Effect of slurry parameters (pH, viscosity, particle size, solid content etc.) on characteristics of produced titania ceramic scaffolds (porosity, pore size, mechanical strength) were evaluated.
