2500|$|The capital {{expenditure}} {{to build the}} facility mostly depends on the physical characteristics of the reservoir. First of all, the development cost of a storage facility largely depends {{on the type of}} the storage field. As a general rule of thumb, salt caverns are the most expensive to develop on a Bcf of Working Gas Capacity Basis. However one should keep in mind that because the gas in such facilities can be cycled repeatedly, on a Deliverability basis, they may be less costly. A <b>Salt</b> <b>Cavern</b> facility might cost anywhere from $10 million to $25 million/Bcf of working gas capacity. The wide price range is because of region difference which dictates the geological requirements. These factors include the amount of compressive horsepower required, the type of surface {{and the quality of the}} geologic structure to name a few. A depleted reservoir costs between $5 million to $6 million/Bcf of Working Gas Capacity. Finally another major cost incurred when building new storage facilities is that of base gas. [...] The amount of base gas in a reservoir could be as high as 80% for aquifers making them very unattractive to develop when gas prices are high. On the other hand, salt caverns require the least amount of base gas. The high cost of base gas is what drives the expansion of current sites vs the development of new ones. This is because expansions require little addition to base gas.|$|E

40|$|AkzoNobel leaches {{rock salt}} in the Main Röt Evaporite member of the Hengelo brine field for {{maintaining}} the salt production and possible future usage of <b>salt</b> <b>caverns</b> for gasoil storage. Recent pressure tests on <b>salt</b> <b>caverns</b> selected for gasoil storage showed that hydrological connections could be formed between <b>salt</b> <b>caverns.</b> Fluid loss through created fluid pathways deteriorates {{the efficiency of the}} solution mining and makes storage opportunities more limited and more challenging. It is assumed that hydrological connections have been formed in the Solling Formation just below the Main Röt Evaporite member. The main goal {{of this study is to}} find out how these hydrological connections could have been formed. Moreover, the economic consequences of preventing hydrological connections in future <b>salt</b> <b>caverns,</b> by leaving a rock salt layer untouched in the lowest part of the Main Röt Evaporite member, will be investigated. Rock cores from the upper part of the Solling Formation, collected from locations in and surrounding the Hengelo brine field, showed a lithology consisting of fine sand-, silt-, and claystones, with a few thin anhydritic rock layers. Furthermore, gamma-ray patterns from wells in the upper part of the Solling Formation were very similar. A thin section of siltstone showed that interstitial pore spaces were tightly filled with halite cement. The rock volume in a fine sandstone sample had a rock salt volume of 35 percent. Some rock cores from the upper part of the Solling Formation contained small joints and fractures, with lengths up to a few decimetres. These fractures had apertures of a few millimetres, and larger fracture voids had widths up to a few centimetres. These apertures and fracture voids were tightly filled with halite or gypsum. Average rock permeabilities in fluid pathways between <b>salt</b> <b>caverns,</b> calculated from fluid inflow data into neighbouring <b>salt</b> <b>caverns</b> during pressure tests, varied mostly in the range of 0 and 1000 millidarcy. In comparison, the argon permeability of untreated silt- to fine sandstone sample was just 8. 06 E- 4 millidarcy. Also, a similar sample without halite cement had a water permeability of just 3. 46 millidarcy. Another similar sample with a tight joint showed a gradual permeability increase from 40 to 120 millidarcy within 7 hours. The cash flow model showed that rock salt layer A, in the 1 meter thick untouched rock salt layer case, needs at least a thickness of 35 meters to make preventing hydrological connections profitable. It was concluded that in the Hengelo brine field the upper part of the Solling Formation is uniform in composition, with “playa and mud flat” sedimentary facies. The tightly halite cemented interstitial pore spaces could be explained by hyperfiltration during Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, a period of decreasing burial depth. Fractures most probably played a role in accelerating the leaching process in the Solling Formation during the formation of fluid pathways. The sump phase is the most probable period in which these hydrological connections have been formed...|$|R
