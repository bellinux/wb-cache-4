2500|$|Siliconera criticized Climax {{for feeling}} {{more like an}} {{expansion}} pack than a sequel. They compared the game's Survival mode to GP Legends story mode and consider it not as deep, [...] "but the challenges are much tougher." [...] Siliconera thought the track editor {{and its ability to}} be shared with other players as the game's greatest feature. Bloodworth concluded Climax has plenty of Survival and Zero Test challenges, and <b>slots</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> created courses, but the lackluster Grand Prix holds back the game. Nintendo World Report and Siliconera felt that the game was a likely candidate for localization in regions outside Japan due to GP: Legends recent nondomestic release, but this never happened. F-Zero: GP Legend was released in Japan in late 2003, but the US version was delayed into late 2004 to coincide with the anime's release. Climax was the third F-Zero game on the GBA and the last to be released in the franchise before its hiatus.|$|E

40|$|Generally, in a DS-CDMA receiver, the {{received}} multipath fading signal s {{are resolved}} into each path having different time-delay with a searcher and then combined to generate original signal with a Rake combiner. One {{of the most}} important design objectives of the Rake combiner is how to search the paths accurately. Particularly from the viewpoint of power dissipation, the searcher operates during a discontinuous path-search mode only, i. e., it can turn power on/off periodically according <b>to</b> the time <b>slot,</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the battery. However, as this period for performing the path search becomes longer, accuracy of the path detection deteriorates. In this paper, a path-search algorithm that improves the path-detection accuracy without shortening the path-search period is proposed. Path detection was carried out by the proposed method utilizing the delay profile detected in the path searcher, the combined signal in the Rake combiner, and also three management tables for pathsdata. Computer simulation results show that the proposed approach performance is superior to that of the conventional path-search method...|$|R
5000|$|The game {{introduced}} a one <b>slot</b> <b>save</b> feature <b>to</b> <b>save</b> progress at inns throughout the game world. In the Japanese original Shion {{returned to the}} inn last saved at upon death (and was charged its fee accordingly), so returning to an inn in order <b>to</b> <b>save</b> is {{a simple matter of}} allowing Shion to be killed. In the English-language Mega Drive versions this was changed to a [...] "Game Over" [...] screen; this made it often tedious to return to the inns early in the game when Return magic hadn't been obtained yet.|$|R
50|$|This unit {{contains}} Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Mappy, Xevious, and Pole Position. After Jakks Pacific introduced their proprietary GameKey {{expansion card}} concept, {{a revision of}} this model included a GameKey <b>slot</b> and allowed <b>to</b> <b>save</b> high scores. Two GameKeys were released for this model: one with Dig Dug and New Rally-X and one with Pac-Man, Rally-X, and Bosconian. The third version of this unit removes the GameKey slot but it does save high scores. A fourth revision (identified by a grey colored joystick panel) has the two extra games (New Rally-X and Bosconian) of the wireless edition.|$|R
50|$|The game uses a battery-backed save system, {{which allows}} the player <b>to</b> <b>save</b> their {{progress}} at any time. However, it only allows the player <b>to</b> <b>save</b> a maximum of 15 times, with four different <b>save</b> <b>slots</b> <b>to</b> use.|$|R
30|$|Concerning smart PU {{emulation}} attacks [45, 46], malicious attackers {{remain silent}} during secondary transmission <b>slots</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>save</b> energy, and greedy attackers use the channel {{if it is}} effectively vacant (i.e., without PU traffic). Based on this assumption, Naqvi, Murtaza, and Aslam [45] propose a strategy that enables detecting and mitigating malicious PU emulation attacks. Their solution is based on allowing the SUs to perform sensing at random intervals other than the regular ones, i.e., when the attacker is supposedly quiet. That is, a SU senses the intended channel out of the sensing periods expected by the attacker and uses the remaining time <b>slot</b> <b>to</b> transmit data if the channel is actually vacant. According to Naqvi, Murtaza, and Aslam [45], their proposal {{is the only one}} that, beyond identifying PU emulation attacks, also provides countermeasures against this type of threat. Yu et al. [47] suggest that the utilization of a guard channel is a simple but effective solution to mitigate the effect of PU emulation attacks in CR networks. They also propose a defense strategy that includes reserving a portion of channels for spectrum handoff {{in order to reduce the}} resulting rate of secondary service disruption.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{two possible}} approaches, which enable multiple pairs of users to exchange information via multiple multi-antenna relays within one time-slot <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the communication bandwidth in low-latency communications. The first {{approach is to}} deploy full-duplexes for both users and relays to make their simultaneous signal transmission and reception possible. In the second approach the users use {{a fraction of a}} time <b>slot</b> <b>to</b> send their information to the relays and the relays use the remaining complementary fraction of the time <b>slot</b> <b>to</b> send the beamformed signals to the users. The inherent loop self-interference in the duplexes and inter-full-duplexing-user interference in the first approach are absent in the second approach. Under both these approaches, the joint users' power allocation and relays' beamformers to either optimize the users' exchange of information or maximize the energy-efficiency subject to user quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of the exchanging information throughput thresholds lead to complex nonconvex optimization problems. Path-following algorithms are developed for their computational solutions. The provided numerical examples show the advantages of the second approach over the first approach...|$|R

3000|$|BCO applies a saving {{variable}} to efficiently use the unused allocated slots of each burst to improve throughput. This {{is because the}} flow scheduler usually allocates {{the total number of}} slots of the downlink subframe to each connection, indicating that the sum of all allocated slots equals the total number of slots in the downlink subframe. In this case, even when satisfying the requested bandwidth by fewer <b>slots</b> <b>to</b> avoid internal fragmentation, the saved slots are still not utilized. Therefore, BCO uses saving to record the number of total <b>saved</b> <b>slots</b> <b>to</b> allow subsequent bursts <b>to</b> use the <b>saved</b> <b>slots</b> conserved from the previous bursts.
