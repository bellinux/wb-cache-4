40|$|PURPOSE: Dredging and {{disposal}} of dredged material in aquatic environments can expose animals and plants to episodic pulses of suspended sediment. Resuspended material can be deposited in thin layers adjacent to the dredging or disposal areas in some cases as much as several thousand meters distant (LaSalle et al. 1991). While {{our understanding of the}} potential effects of such far-field deposition is limited, some estuarine organisms may be highly sensitive to suspended sediments and certain life stages (eggs, juveniles) may be particularly affected by resuspension and deposition. In this report potential impacts of <b>sedimentation</b> (<b>bedded</b> materials) are reviewed with emphasis on those habitats believed to be most sensitive. BACKGROUND: Ambient conditions for estuarine organisms are rarely static, and most organisms are adapted to varying concentrations of suspended sediment (see bibliography in Kerr (1995)). The intensity and duration of resuspension from dredging {{and disposal}} operations is highly dependent on the type of equipment, operator, character of sediment, and local hydrodynamic conditions (Collins 1995; Clarke and Wilber 2000). While the effects of elevated concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and thin layers of sediment on estuarine organisms are poorly understood (Wilber and Clarke 2001, Wilber et al. in preparation), we do know that some of the defining characteristics of an estuarine environment are highly variable conditions in the water column for temperature, salinity, and particulate flux. The direct measurement of TSS is straightforward and can be complemented with indirect optical and acoustic measurements (optical backscatter sensors, transmissivity, acoustic doppler profiling) to achieve rapid characterization of large volumes of water over relevant spatial scale...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{economic}} growth, Lagos Harbour is expanding. Capital dredging {{is needed to}} allow larger vessels to call the port. As harbour siltation is already a problem, increase of maintenance dredging is a worry. In the past no data was available to understand the hydraulics and sediment transport to estimate maintenance dredging volumes. This paper presents the reconnaissance of the sediment dynamics in the harbour, based on field data and MIKE 21 model simulations. Measurements of sediment concentration, salinity and flow velocity show that estuarine circulation occurs, transporting sediment from the ocean into the port. However, more upstream in the Commodore channel, at the location where dredging will be carried out, this circulation is small. Model simulations show that at that location, bed shear stresses are large, also after dredging. Therefore, fine sediment can not accumulate in the deepened areas and this will not result in large dredging volumes. Sand transport however can cause <b>sedimentation,</b> as <b>bed</b> forms can migrate. These mechanisms are also observed in initial sand transport simulations, but need to be studied further to fully understand the sediment dynamics in the harbour.

40|$|Large {{high-grade}} bedded barite deposits {{occur in}} and near East Northumberland Canyon, northern Toquima Range, Nye County, Nevada. The barite beds, which con-sist of massive and rosette barite rock and minor amounts of conglomeratic barite rock, are interlayered with dark chert and shaly mudstone of the eugeosynclinal western siliceous facies of Ordovician age. The barite rock is mostly dark gray and massive, has a specific gravity that averages about 4. 0, and contains 70. 7 - 93. 9 percent BaSO 4. Silica and dark carbonaceous material {{are the principal}} impurities, and other elements are low in amount. Phosphatic nodules are common in the barite conglomerate and adjacent chert and shaly mudstone beds. Delicate Radiolaria tests form nuclei of many barite rosettes, which indicates space for growth of barite before sediment compaction. Barite intraformational conglomerate is evidence of submarine erosion and redeposition during barite <b>sedimentation.</b> Graded <b>bedding</b> and the lateral continuity and conformity of barite beds in the enclosing chert and shaly mudstone beds, together with phosphatic nodules and organic material, strongly affirm a sedimentary origin of the barite facies.

30|$|Graynoth (1979) and Thompson et al. (2009) both {{measured}} {{increases in}} stream <b>bed</b> <b>sedimentation</b> after harvesting. In {{the case of}} Baillie (2006), headwater streams were still impacted by sediment six years after harvest where woody debris and re-generating vegetation retained sediment within the stream channel. Recovery time will depend on shading out and die back of vegetation in the channel caused by the next rotation of trees, decomposition of woody debris and {{the capacity of the}} streams to flush sediment from the system. In spite of large increases in sediment yield during the harvest period (Figure  3), Fahey and Stansfield (2006) found no significant changes in water clarity, turbidity and suspended sediment after harvest. One possible explanation is that most suspended sediment was exported during elevated flows (Fahey et al. 2003; Phillips et al. 2005), and was occasionally captured during routine water quality monitoring.|$|R

40|$|In most aquatic ecosystems, {{hydrodynamic}} {{conditions are}} a key abiotic factor determining species distribution and aquatic plant abundance. Recently, local differences in hydrodynamic conditions {{have been shown to}} be an explanatory mechanism for the patchy pattern of Callitriche platycarpa Kutz. vegetation in lowland rivers. These local conditions consists of specific areas of increased shear zones, resulting in additional plant stress and erosion of the sediment on the one hand and local decreased shear zones resulting in zones favourable to plant growth and <b>sedimentation</b> of <b>bed</b> material on the other hand. In this study, the process of this spatial plant-flow-sedimentation interaction has been illustrated quantitatively by in situ flume measurements. By disturbing the incoming discharge on a single patch in such flume, we have quantified the behaviour and influence of a C. platycarpa patch under normal field conditions (base flow). Additionally, the behaviour of a C. platycarpa patch under different conditions of hydrodynamic stress has been examined in a laboratory flume. Indeed, flexible, submerged macrophytes are capable to adapt patch dimensions with changing stream velocities. At times of modest hydrodynamic stress, the species takes a position near the water surface and optimises its leaf stand, thereby maximising its photosynthetic capacity. At times of peak discharge, the patch will bend down towards the river bed and become more confined and streamlined, as such averting the stream velocity and diminishing the risk of breaking or being uprooted. In this paper, the processes of local hydrodynamic conditions on the patch and the patch' intriguing life strategy of avoiding negative feedback was shown...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of fine sediment within salmonid redds {{is generally considered}} {{to be one of the}} main factors contributing to a reduction in embryo survival (Chapman 1988; Reiser 1998; Greig et al. 2005 a). As a result, research activity has sought to understand the processes by which fine sediment degrades the incubation environment within a redd (Carling 1984; Lisle 1989; Diplas and Parker 1992; Acornley and Sear 1999). From the outset, we differentiate between the process by which fine sediment moves into the salmonid redd termed infiltration and the summation of this process over time that is accumulation. An additional term often used in the context of fine sediment impacts on salmonids is sedimentation. This is taken to refer to the development of a layer of fine sediment over the surface of the spawning gravels. We argue here that it is the {{accumulation of}} fine sediment within the redd and/ or the sedimentation of spawning gravels that result in deleterious impacts on incubating and emerging salmonids. The distinction between the two different survival mechanisms— incubation of the embryos within the egg and emergence of the alevins once hatched—is relevant to the type of infiltration process. Generally, one can hypothesize that the finer silt and clay fraction influences thesurvival of the incubating embryos, whereas the coarser sand-sized fraction affects theemergence of alevins. Thus, one might envisageconditions where there are low levels ofvery fine sediment within a spawning gravelbut poor overall survival as a result of entombment. This chapter deals predominantlywith incubation survival. In this chapter, we explain the theoretical basis for the relationship between fine-sediment accumulation in the redd, <b>sedimentation</b> of spawning <b>beds,</b> and the incubation of salmonid embryos. We then consider the processes of fine sediment transport over the riverbed and the nature of the interaction between it and the gravel bed. Empirical and laboratory measurements of fine-sediment accumulation are reviewed to determine the range of natural variability in fine-sediment accumulation within redds and <b>sedimentation</b> of spawning <b>beds</b> between and within river systems. Finally, we review the methods and techniques for quantifying and modeling fine-sediment accumulation...|$|R
40|$|The Anisian shallow-marine Karchowice Beds of the Upper Silesia {{represent}} reefal {{habitats and}} circum-reefal environments, where biological-mechanical interactions determine sedimentary processes and facies pattern. The {{purpose of this}} study was recognition of the interaction between biological and mechanical controls of carbonate deposition. Such interdependence resulted in considerable lateral variability of thickness and lithological features, observed at a distance of 25 km. The western part of the basin is dominated by proximal facies (reefal facies), whereas the eastern one represents distal facies (fore-reef). Sedimentary succession in the western area is twice as thick than the eastern one. It resulted from different rate of subsidence owing to block tectonics, controlled by reactivated ancestral Silesian-Moravian Fault. Small-scale synsedimentary faults confirm syndepositional tectonic activity in the region. Palaeogeographical position caused that the Upper Silesia was strongly affected by monsoon climate, generating storms.

40|$|The study {{looks at}} the {{rheology}} and pipeline flow properties of colloidal suspensions dispersed in electrolytes of different concentration and type. Fuso silica spheres (0. 8 pm) form the dispersed phase of the suspension, and KN 03, KCI electrolytes the continuous phase. The strength of the particle-particle interaction is significantly influenced by the electrolyte concentration. An increase in the electrolyte concentration from 10 4 M to IM results {{in the formation of}} aggregates, thus influencing the <b>sedimentation,</b> sediment <b>bed</b> structure and pipeline transportation properties. Silica aggregates formed in IM electrolytes are on average 5. 75 times bigger than the primary particle. Pipeline transportation studies have shown the aggregated suspension to have a lower minimum transport velocity than the dispersed suspension. Such behaviour is believed to be related to interfloc flows within the aggregate, enhancing the level of fluid turbulence. The centre-line and near wall turbulence intensities are enhanced in the presence of aggregates, while dispersed suspensions have negligible effect on modulating the fluid turbulence. Measurement of the streamwise RMS shows two critical Reynolds numbers with increasing flow velocity. The first critical Reynolds number (Re = 5500) occurs when the RMS profile of the aggregated suspension diverges (exceeds) from the RMS profiles of the dispersed and single phase flows. This enhancement is thought to be related to interfloc flows. A second critical Reynolds number (Re = 8000) is identified when the RMS profile of the aggregated suspension begins to converge with the dispersed and single phase RMS profiles. Convergence of the RMS profiles is related to the break-up of aggregates once a critical fluid shear stress is exceeded. Aggregate break-up data is verified with results collected using a Bohlin CVO-R rheometer. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Silt {{accumulation}} and <b>sedimentation</b> in canal <b>beds</b> {{leads to}} deterioration of watercourses over time. Every year a forced {{closure of the}} canals in the Indus basin is inevitable for canal cleaning, entailing a very large scale and costly operation. Silt removal precision is prone to inefficiencies due to subjective decision making in the cleaning process. In this paper, we lay out a theoretical framework to map the semi-structured (emptied) canal bed terrains with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system for quantitative inspection of deposited silt. The study employs Gaussian process regression on sampled points to determine a continuous distribution of silt surface, thereby, predicting the volume of silt on canal bed. Our theoretical analysis builds upon certain mathematical bounds on the variance of estimated volume, while explicitly considering localization error and sensor noise. Essentially, we setup a framework for studying how tolerable are the process and measurement uncertainties, while achieving a desired accuracy in silt profile and corresponding volume. We demonstrate the regression results in simulations as well as real world lab-scaled-model (LMS 151 laser scanner) with different sets of parameters. Volume estimation is verified practically and mathematical performance limits are proposed in established aerial canal inspection system. I...|$|R

The critical impeller speed Njs required to &lsquo;just suspend&rsquo; the solids off the tank bottom was determined by measuring the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>bed</b> height (HB) visually and defining the impeller speed at which HB becomes zero as Njs. The changes in the conductivity values of water due to the dissolution of benzoic acid from solid surface were measured as a function of time and used in determining the volumetric solid-liquid mass transfer coefficient kSLap. Experimental results show that, regardless of Cv used, kSLap increases with the impeller speed gradually up to Njs and remains more or less constant beyond that. It has been also found that kSLap increases rapidly with an increase in Cv from 3 to 10 % (v/v) and remains more or less constant beyond that, regardless of the active particle concentration used. It was interesting to note that kSLap values increases for solids with higher active particle mass fraction for all Cv used. These results suggest that higher values of kSLap can be achieved in agitated vessels by operating them at higher total solids loadings with higher active particle concentration than hitherto thought. When these results are considered in conjunction with the specific impeller power input results, it can be concluded that operating the agitated dissolution vessels with a higher solids concentration will lead to higher dissolution rate but with lower impeller specific power input or higher energy efficiency. Results from this work will provide a framework for achieving process intensification in industrial agitated solid-liquid systems and a further understanding of the design of solid-liquid agitated vessel handling high concentration solids...|$|R

We identify a clear relationship between faster ice flow and decreased basal roughness in significant parts of PIG. The central portion and two of its tributaries are particularly smooth, {{but the majority of}} the tributaries feeding the main trunk are rougher. We interpret the presence of a smooth bed as being a consequence of the deposition of marine sediments following disappearance of the West Antarctic ice sheet in the Pliocene or Pleistocene, and, conversely, a lack of marine <b>sedimentation</b> where the <b>bed</b> is rough. Importantly, we also identify a patchy distribution of marine sediments, and thus a bed over which the controls on flow vary. While there is a notable correspondence between ice velocity and bed roughness, we do not assume a direct causal relationship, but find that an indirect one is likely. Where low basal roughness results in low basal resistance to flow, a lower driving stress is required to produce the flux required to achieve mass balance. This, in turn, means that the surface in that area will be lower than surrounding areas with a rougher bed, and this will tend to draw flow into the area with low bed roughness. Since our studies shows that bed roughness beneath the tributaries of the trunk varies substantially, there is a strong likelihood that these tributaries will differ in the rate at which they transmit current velocity changes on the main trunk into the interior of the glacier basin...|$|R

To assess the emplacement processes of the tuffaceous sandstones we investigate modal and geochemical compositions of 24 thin sections that reveal systematic vertical changes within each bed. TST 1, 2 and 3 b are single beds whereas TST 3 a is composed of at least two beds suggesting several rapidly succeeding <b>sedimentation</b> events. The <b>beds</b> are density-graded such that low-density pyroclasts including pumice lapilli are enriched at the top whereas dense lithic components and minerals are enriched at the bottom. The volcanic glass particles (pumice and shards) that are the dominant modal constituents of each sandstone bed have homogeneous geochemical compositions in each bed. Moreover, TST 1, 2, and 3 a glass compositions overlap completely but TST 3 b glass has a different composition, as is analogously observed for the mineral compositions. This unique multistage approach of sedimentological and geochemical methods facilitated the detailed investigation of distal volcano-derived, probably tsunamogenic, turbidites in order to contribute to the distinction between primary and secondary induced mass flows. We interpret that all tuffaceous sandstones were emplaced by turbidity currents that were formed during major explosive volcanic eruptions. However, while TST 1, 2, and 3 a turbidity currents formed by the entry into the ocean of voluminous pyroclastic flows erupted at a volcano on mainland Japan, TST 3 b was emplaced by a turbidity current formed by a shallow submarine or subaerial volcanic eruption at the Izu–Bonin arc where it collided with Japan.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fine substrate sediments {{are considered to be}} important in the management of urban river systems. Urban construction activities have been reported to increase sediment loads causing the temporary siltation of channel substrates within the urban area. Nevertheless fine sediment derived from urban areas frequently carry toxic material well in excess of background concentration levels. While the soluble phase of heavy metals and the importance of their association with suspended sediment has received considerable attention, longer term studies of fine urban river-bed sediments are limited. Furthermore studies of heavy pollutants in active stream sediments, below mine waste tips, have shown the channel substrate can provide a long term store for heavy metals in association with fine sediments. This thesis investigates the variety of impacts that urbanisation has upon the <b>sedimentation</b> of gravel <b>bed</b> rivers. A freeze coring technique and infIltration baskets have been used to study the textural-geochemical properties of fme matrix sediment and its development within an urban river-bed framework, within and below a number of contrasting urban catchments in the U. K. Complex urban hydrological and sedimentological regimes are shown to have a variable influence upon matrix sedimentation. The actual volume of matrix present within the urbanised substrate is influenced by the degree of urbanisation within the catchment. Furthermore this sediment is finer in size and associated heavy metal concentrations are well in excess of natural background levels. Although heavy metal levels do correlate slightly with textural characteristics, the presence of maximum concentrations at depth in the substrate indicate possible mobilisation of metals within the urbanised river-bed. The temporal behaviour of matrix development within an urbanised substrate is shown to differ from natural river-beds. Despite high suspended sediment concentrations the magnitude of the potential rate of supply is lower, by 50 percent, and dominated by organic material. This sediment also contains elevated heavy metal cocnentrations. This contrasts to the inorganic sediment ingress of natural river substrates. It is concluded that fine matrix sediments within urban gravel bed rivers should be at least of concern to public health engineers, water authorities and conservationists...|$|R

At our Arctic study site at Hansneset, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, we repeated a quantitative diving study of 1996 / 98 in 2012 - 2014 in the shallow rocky sublittoral from 0 - 15 m depth. The overall seaweed biomass had increased 1. 7 × and 4. 7 × at shallow depths (2. 5 m), which supported predictions of increased productivity in the Arctic because of climate warming. The standing stock at the biomass maximum at 2. 5 m comprised 14. 4 kg fresh biomass m- 2, a leaf area index (leaf area/sampling area) of approx. 10 and a very high kelp density. Here, the kelp composition included four species, with pronounced dominance of digitate kelp species (Laminaria digitata and/or Saccharina nigripes). Our study showed 1) uplift of kelp biomass maximum from 5 m to 2. 5 m depth, 2) decrease in the lower depth limit of dominant brown algae by several m, 3) decrease in biomass of annual species, 4) considerable increase in richness from 20 to 45 species in the intertidal to shallow sublittoral (1 m depth). With respect to the associated fauna, both biomass and production increased, particularly in the shallow sublittoral (2. 5 - 5 m), and a functional change towards the dominance of suspension feeders became apparent. These observed changes are likely a consequence of recent Arctic warming. Lack of landfast sea ice and ice-scouring during winter would reduce physical abrasion and improve irradiance conditions. However, in summer increased sedimentation with reduced phases of clear water conditions has the opposite effect by reducing the radiance and causing less light to reach the deepest part of the kelp <b>beds.</b> <b>Sedimentation</b> had revealed a negative impact on germination and formation of juvenile kelp sporophytes. Moderate grazing could partly counteract the negative effect of sedimentation but not under complete sediment coverage of the recruits (~ 1 mm thickness). Arctic warming, with increased temperature, less sea ice, but increased sedimentation may cause species-specific differences in sporophyte recruitment, which may lead to “winner” and “looser” species in the kelp forest in Svalbard...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) {{blooms in}} water bodies present serious public health issues with {{attendant}} economic and ecological impacts. Llyn Tegid (Lake Bala) {{is an important}} conservation and amenity asset within Snowdonia National Park, Wales which since the mid- 1990 s has experienced multiple toxic cyanobacteria blooms threatening the ecology and tourism-dependent local economy. Multiple working hypotheses explain the emergence of this problem, including climate change, land management linked to increased nutrient flux, hydromorphological alterations or changing trophic structure - any of which may operate individually or cumulatively to impair lake function. This paper reports {{the findings of a}} sediment fingerprinting study using dated lake cores to explore the linkages between catchment and lake management practices and the emergence of the algal blooms problem. Since 1900 AD lake <b>bed</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rates have varied from 0. 06 to 1. 07 gcm⁻²yr⁻¹, with a pronounced acceleration since the early 1980 s. Geochemical analysis revealed increases in the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), calcium and heavy metals such as zinc and lead consistent with eutrophication and a rising pollution burden, particularly since the late 1970 s. An uncertainty-inclusive sediment fingerprinting approach was used to apportion the relative fluxes from the major catchment land cover types of improved pasture, rough grazing, forestry and channel banks. This showed improved pasture and channel banks are the dominant diffuse sources of sediment in the catchment, though forestry sources were important historically. Conversion of rough grazing to improved grassland, coupled with intensified land management and year-round livestock grazing, is concluded to provide the principal source of rising TP levels. Lake Habitat Survey and particle size analysis of lake cores demonstrate the hydromorphological impact of the River Dee Regulation Scheme, which controls water level and periodically diverts flow into Llyn Tegid from the adjacent Afon Tryweryn catchment. This hydromorphological impact has also been most pronounced since the late 1970 s. It is concluded that an integrated approach combining land management to reduce agricultural runoff allied to improved water level regulation enabling recovery of littoral macrophytes offers the greatest chance halting the on-going cyanobacteria issue in Llyn Tegid...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the behaviour of newly deposited soil is important because of its direct applications in fields such as harbour siltation and storage of dredge slurries. In coastal regions the dominant mode for deposition of fine-grained cohesive material is through flocculation- the electrostatic aggregation of mud particles. The present study focuses on the measurement of both flocculation conditions and bed properties, towards the {{understanding of}} the influence of the former on the latter. A computerised laboratory setup, complete from sedimentation and flocculation to the long term consolidation allows each of these processes to be observed in instrumented perspex columns without the many variables present in an estuary. The bed deposition rates resemble those found in natural estuaries, and therefore this technique is a much improved method for examining natural processes than the method of slurry deposition, which is normally employed in soil mechanics. An image acquisition and analysis system has been designed specifically for this work. Image sequences are analysed in real time to give information about the dimensions and concentration of the particles, and the particle velocities. Floc sizes increase as the particle concentration increases in the column. Increasing the concentration further leads to an overall hindering of the sedimentation rate and breakup of the flocs. Images of beds formed through slow sedimentation clearly show aggregate features that are not present in slurry experiments. From low to medium <b>sedimentation</b> rates the <b>bed</b> height, normalised by the mass of sediment in the bed, increases. From medium to high rates of sedimentation, however, the normalised bed heights decrease. Overall slurry experiments have lower bed heights than slowly deposited experiments. Image analysis of the bed surface (top 0. 5 mm) has revealed that aggregates which are present immediately after deposition are broken down over tens of hours. The ISIS instrument has been modified to gather information about the resistance to erosion of the beds. A bed is more easily eroded after it has had a long period of consolidation. X-ray density measurements and imaging techniques are used to link the strength of the bed to biological factors. X-ray bulk density and pore pressure measurements allow calculations of void ratio, porosity, and effective stress. Bender element apparatus has been constructed to measure shear stiffness of the soil, and bed strength measurements are made using a shear vane. It is found that variations in the sedimentation conditions have significant effects on bed density and on void ratio. These effects continue to be visible in the consolidated bed, even after an order of magnitude increase in the total vertical bed stress (equivalent to the range of metres of overburden pressure). The variations in the bed structure can have profound effects on bed strength. Methods to compare floc measurements to bed measurements are complicated by the inherent variation in floc data. Possible techniques include the use of solids volume fraction, fractal dimension and intrinsic sediment properties. The usefulness of each of these is assessed. It is suggested that it is the frequency at which the bed is bombarded by flocs, and not the properties of the flocs themselves, that largely determines the bed properties.

40|$|Critical {{increase}} of world population growth has revealed significant consequences {{in terms of}} food and wood needs for people on the globe. This alarming phenomenon inevitably gave rise to major changes on land use form or natural vegetation covered the earth surface due to the population pressure occured on readily available natural resources such as tropical rain forest. In order to fulfill the basic needs of food and wood through agricultural cultivation {{in one hand and}} to ease degradation rate of natural forest on the other hand, forest plantation have been established in many countries included Indonesia during the last two decades. Owing to the fact mentioned before, up to date, plantation forest has been an important land use system especially in the tropical area. For example Indonesian goverment has projected to establish 6. 2 million hectares of industrial forest plantation by the year 2000. In so far as ecological aspect is considered, that plantation forest are expected to play the important role of the productive and protective functions of the natural forest. However, some industrial forest plantations have been reported as an alternative technology causing not only environmental problems through reduction in species biodiversity, soil erosion, water pollution and stream <b>bed</b> <b>sedimentation,</b> but also socio-economical problems such as low market price due to over production, and conflicts between villagers and forest concession holder. To cope up with the overall adversed effects may rise from the plantation forest project, sustainable forest management has been espoused as the key tool by scientists from many countries all over the world. This sustainable forest management concept is therefore designed to ensure that the establishment of industrial forest plantation satisfy economic, ecology and social functions as compared to natural forests. In turn, to examine whether the sustainable forest management practices is still on the right tract with overall objectives, a comprehensive method of evaluation is needed. Currently, the concept of principles, criteria and indicator (P, C&I) has been developed in the forest sector as a method or guidelines to determine and evaluate sustainable forest management a the international, national and forest management unit level. Since its existence, Criteria and Indicator (C&I) have been developed by many institutions. For example, ITTO comes up with principles of sustainable forest management (SFM); WWF develops guidelines; FSC introduces general Principle, Criteria and Indicators; Smart Wood Program of Rainforest Alliance introduces its C&I; Lembaga Ekolabel Indonesia (LEI) also develops C&I for production forest. These variety of C&I can be applied at various levels: global, regional (eco-regional), national, and sub-national or at Forest Management Unit (FMU) level. However, one source of C&I is not necessarily applicable at all local/FMU level. Due to the significance of socio-economic and ecology are variable across the whole countries and forest management unit as well, the guidelines consisting P, C&I are unlikely final. In other words, set of P, C&I for use at any level is supposed to be developed to assess the quality of management and ecosystem in question in a way toward the achievement of sustainable goal. Therefore, CIFOR through project " Testing Criteria and Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management" has been trying to search C&I that fits with particular FMU, in this case, in Indonesia. The similar test also will be conducted in Brazil and Coté d'Ivore. The final findings of C&I are expected to generate a minimum number of cost effective and reliable C&I for each test site, based on iterative and comparative field evaluation of selected set...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} {{outpouring of}} the Oligocene Trap basalts over eastern Africa and western Arabia {{was interrupted by}} a period of quiescence marked by the deposition of terrestrial sediments. These so-called intertrappean beds are often lignitiferous and yield recurrent floras and faunas, sometimes represented by endemic mammals. We intended to highlight the peculiar features of these sedimentary intercalations using a large-scale approach including eastern Africa and the western Arabian peninsula. Starting from a new mapping in the Eritrean highland, the intertrappean beds resulted a continuous level that was a few tens of meters thick and traceable for some tens of kilometers. They consist of fluvial red, green and gray mudstones and siltstones with subordinate channelized pebbly sandstones, and lignite seams. Two new Ar-Ar datings constraint the age of the intertrappean beds between 29. 0 Ma and 23. 6 Ma. The outcrops near Mendefera have yielded the remains of two proboscidean families, the Deinotheriidae and the Gomphoteriidae. The morphological grade of the two Mendefera proboscideans would suggest a more derived stage than that of representatives of the same families from other Oligocene African sites (e. g., Chilga, Ethiopia). An Oligocene age could be inferred for them. The occurrence of the genus Prodeinotherium at Mai Gobro possibly represents the first occurrence of this taxon, while the Gomphotheirum sp. might represent the oldest occurrence of this taxon in Africa before its dispersal towards Asia and Europe. Proboscideans have also been found in the lowland intertrappean beds of Dogali near Massawa. These sediments were contiguous with the Eritrean highland intertrappean beds during the Oligocene, but are now tectonically displaced from them by two thousand meters of vertical topographical distance. Dogali is also known for the occurrence of possible Deinotheriidae remains and the primitive elephantoid Eritreum. Entering the Ethiopian highland, an inspection of the Agere Selam (Mekele) intertrappean beds revealed the occurrence of lacustrine limestones and diatomites, which were contrastingly quite subordinate with respect to the fine clastic sediments found in the nearby Amba Alaji area. Further south, the intertrappean section in the Jema valley (100 km north of Addis Ababa and close to the Blue Nile gorge) is 120 m thick with predominant clastic sediments and a few diatomites at the top. Literature information from 35 additional sites, including northern Kenya, Yemen, Sudan and Saudi Arabia sections, confirms the fluvial and lacustrine depositional environment of the intertrappean beds, underlines the interest in their mammal fauna (Chilga, Losodok), and reports exploitable coal seams for some of them. As for the vegetal landscape in which the intertrappean beds were deposited, pollen and plant analysis results indicative of a tropical wet forest, similar to that of present-day western Africa. Another common feature of the intertrappean beds is their relatively limited thickness, averaging a few tens of meters, but reaching a few hundred meters in graben-related basins, such as Delbi Moye in southern Ethiopia. In most cases only thin, lens-shaped successions were deposited above the hummocky topography of their volcanic substratum, commonly unaffected by significant faulting. An average duration of the intertrappean beds is from one to three million years. This time interval is commonly matched by a few tens (or more rarely, hundreds) of meters of sediments left over after erosive episodes or depositional starvation. As to the lateral continuity of the intertrappean beds, the present-day outcrops show large differences: from some tens of kilometers in the Mendefera area, to a few tens of kilometres in the Jema valley, and to a few hundreds meters in the Agere Selam (Mekele) area. Even if it is difficult to quantify the original size of the sedimentation areas, it nevertheless proves that the intertrappean basins exceed thousands of square kilometers in only a single case (Mendefera), but were quite restricted in most cases. Their most likely endorheic and local character, together with a regional ill-defined fluvial network, was the effect of a water-course rerouting caused by the progressive rising of the eastern African and Arabian plateaux. Chronological constraints for the intertrappean beds can be inferred from the age of the hosting Trap succession and by the stratigraphical position that they occupy. Intervolcanic sedimentary episodes are typically found in the basaltic and subordinately rhyolitic successions that followed the 31 - 29 Ma old basaltic widespread paroxysm. With due caveats deriving from the discontinuous availability of datings specifically dedicated to this issue, we regard the age of the intertrappean beds as mostly encompassed in the interval from 29 to 27 Ma at the transition between the Early and Late Oligocene in the Ethiopia/Yemen Trap core. In marginal areas, such as SW Arabia, Eritrea and Kenya, the volcanic activity above the intertrappean beds resumed later, and its quiescence allowed a more prolonged period of <b>sedimentation.</b> The intertrappean <b>beds</b> fall in the second cooling event of the Oligocene climatic deterioration. During the contemporaneous apparent drop in the global sea-level and closure of the Tethyan Ocean between Arabia and southwestern Asia, connections were established between the African and the Eurasian continents. At that time, southwestern Asia was experiencing severe aridity with faunal exchanges toward the luxuriously vegetated eastern Africa...|$|R
40|$|The European Water Framework Directive 2000 {{established}} a new emphasis {{for the management}} of freshwaters by setting ecologically-based water quality targets that are to be achieved through holistic, catchment-scale, ecosystem management. However, significant knowledge gaps exist in the understanding of the cumulative effectiveness of multiple mitigation measures on a number of pollutants at a catchment scale. This research contributes to improved understanding of the effectiveness of an ecosystem management approach to deliver catchment-scale water quality improvements on the National Trust Holnicote Estate on Exmoor, UK. This research {{is part of a larger}} multi-objective project funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), to demonstrate the benefits of land use interventions {{for the management of}} flood risk. This thesis evaluates the effects of upland ditch blocking on physico-chemical and biological parameters of water quality in an upland Horner Water catchment one year after habitat restoration, and establishes a solid baseline for the monitoring of the effects of current and future land management changes in a lowland, intensively managed, agricultural Aller catchment. The spatial variability of soil physical and chemical properties (bulk density, total carbon (TN), nitrogen (TN), C:N ratio, δ 15 N, total phosphorus (TP), inorganic phosphorus (IP), organic phosphorus (OP)) and water quality determinands (suspended sediment (SS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total particulate carbon (TPC), total oxidised nitrogen (TON) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP)) in the two study catchments with contrasting land use has been characterised and linked to the prevailing land use. Agricultural land use resulted in extensive homogenisation of soil properties. The spatial dependence of all soil properties, except for bulk density and δ 15 N, was stronger in the agricultural than the semi-natural catchment (nugget:sill ratio 0. 10 - 0. 42 in the Aller and 0. 15 - 0. 94 in Horner Water), while bulk density, TP, inorganic phosphorus (IP), organic phosphorus (OP), C:N ratio, δ 15 N and carbon storage showed a longer range of spatial auto-correlation in the agricultural catchment (2, 807 - 3, 191 m in the Aller and 545 - 2, 599 m Horner Water). The central tendency (mean, median) of all soil properties, except for IP and δ 15 N, also differed significantly between the two catchments (P < 0. 01). The observed extensive alteration of soil physical and chemical properties in the agricultural catchment is likely to have long-term implications for the restoration of ecosystem functioning and water quality management. The intensive land use seems to have resulted in an altered ‘catchment metabolism’, manifested in a proportionally greater total fluvial carbon (dissolved and particulate) export from the agricultural than the semi-natural catchment. The agricultural catchment supported significantly higher DOC concentrations (P < 0. 05) and the quality of DOC differed markedly between the two study catchments. The prevalence of more humic, higher molecular weight compounds in the agricultural catchment and simpler, lower molecular weight compounds in the semi-natural catchment, indicated enhanced microbial turnover of fluvial DOC in the agricultural catchment as well as additional allochtonous terrestrial sources. During an eight month period for which a comparable continuous turbidity record was available, the estimated SS yields from the agricultural catchment (25. 5 - 116. 2 t km 2) were higher than from the semi-natural catchment (21. 7 - 57. 8 t km 2). Further, the agricultural catchment exported proportionally more TPC (0. 51 - 2. 59 kg mm- 1) than the semi-natural catchment (0. 36 - 0. 97 kg mm- 1) and a similar amount of DOC (0. 26 - 0. 52 kg mm- 1 in the Aller and 0. 24 - 0. 32 kg mm- 1 in Horner Water), when normalised by catchment area and total discharge, despite the lower total soil carbon pool, thus indicating an enhanced fluvial loss of sediment and carbon from the intensively managed catchment. Whilst detection of catchment-scale effects of mitigation measures typically requires high resolution, resource-intensive, long term data sets, this research has found that simple approaches can be effective in bridging the gap between fine scale ecosystem functioning and catchment-scale processes. Here, the new macro-invertebrate index PSI (Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates) has been shown to be more closely related to a physical measure of <b>sedimentation</b> (% fine <b>bed</b> sediment cover) (P = 0. 002) than existing non-pressure specific macro-invertebrate metrics such as the Lotic Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE) and % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera & Trichoptera abundance (% EPT) (P = 0. 014). Further testing of PSI along a pronounced environmental gradient is recommended as PSI and % fine bed sediment cover have the potential to become a sensitive tool for the setting and monitoring of twin sedimentation targets. Upland ditch management has not had any discernible effect on water quality in the semi-natural upland catchment one year after restoration, which may be due to the short-term post-restoration monitoring period but may also reflect benign effects of large-scale earth moving works on this high quality environment. The conceptual understanding of catchment processes developed in this thesis suggests that cumulatively, the recently completed mitigation works in the lowland agricultural catchment will likely result in reduced sediment and nutrient input into the aquatic environment. However, further research is needed to build on this detailed baseline characterisation and inform the understanding of the effectiveness of combined mitigation measures to reduce the flux of multiple contaminants at the catchment scale.

40|$|Tropical {{mountain}} areas are highly susceptible {{to changes in}} land use. Over the last 50 years, the natural ecosystems of the Andean regions have increasingly been disturbed by rapid demographic growth and socio-economic development. Despite {{the fact that these}} environments are sources of water, energy and biological diversity that are essential tothe survival of {{a large part of the}} Andean population, they are endangered by human pressure and natural ecological imbalances caused mainly byland use and climate change. During the last few decades, an increase of land pressure in the southern Ecuadorian Andes led to a spatial redistribution of the population. Landless people were forced to move towards steep hillslopes with shallowor infertile soils not suitable for profitable agricultural activities. Forest was cut, and small parcels of often less than 1 ha were farmed or used for grazing animals. Soil degradation due to inadequate land use practices on these steep slopes lead to on-site and off-site erosion problems. The reduction of the soil chemical and physical quality caused by nutrient depletion and soil loss, and low moisture holding capacity of eroded topsoils reduced agricultural yields. The soil material transported by runoff water through rills and gullies is transported to the river network. Downstream, the eroded material accelerates sedimentationin channels, rivers, reservoirs and dams, leading to the disruption of aquatic ecosystems, and the contamination of drinking water. In some cases, increased runoff leads to downstream flooding causing large damage to property. The dramatic land use change occurred in the Paute basin hasaffected the mechanisms of runoff and sediment production on the hillslopes of degraded ecosystems, in particular the middle part of the catchment. At the scale of small catchments (0. 01 - 10 km²) sediment yield shows alarge spatial variablility. Sediment yield decreases exponentially withincreasing mean vegetation cover within the catchment, and with a decreasing percentage of the catchment underlain by argillaceous rocks (argillites, argillaceous sandstone and volcanic deposits). Sediment fluxes are a strong function of the overall vegetation cover in the catchment. Small changes in the surface vegetation cover have a large effect on catchment wide sediment fluxes. A small (10 to 25 %) increase in the contact vegetation cover can lead to a significant (60 %) decrease in sediment yield. This highlights the large potential of revegetation programs for erosion mitigation in this region. By targeting specifically highly erodingareas for vegetation restoration programs, a large reduction in sediment generation can obtained. Vegetation cover and land management largely control runoff generation on the slopes. Degraded and abandoned lands are the most important sitesof runoff generation. The hydrological response is rapid and sharp, as Hortonian overland flow is the dominant runoff generation mechanism. This is in strong contrast with arable and rangelands where Hortonian overland flow generation is very limited andsaturation overland, subsurface and return flow are the dominant runoffmechanisms. The measured differences in runoff mechanisms between various land use types indicate that changes in land use will have a significant effect on runoff generation on the hillslopes. It is important to note that it is not arable agriculture per se which is the culprit of runoff water and sediment generation in the region. Additionally the presence of large amounts of smectites in the outcropping rocks makes the surface material very prone to sealing and crusting, thereby enhancing runoffgeneration. Restoring vegetation cover on degraded and abandoned land is thus an efficient way to remediate off-site erosion problems. Water and sediment produced on degraded land reach the river through the dense rill and gully network developed in these areas which is not only the major conveyor of runoff water and eroded sediment to the river system but may also be an important sediment source itself. The mechanismsof transfer of water and sediment from the hillslopes towards intermittent or permanent river systems highly depend on the presence/absence of vegetation in the gully beds. The establishment of herbaceous and shrubby vegetation in gully beds gave rise to the formation of vegetated buffer zones, which enhance sediment trapping. Gully bed vegetation is the most important factor in promoting short term (1 to 15 years) sediment deposition and gully stabilization, whereas topographical factors only havea minor effect on gully <b>bed</b> <b>sedimentation</b> rates. The amount of sedimenttrapped is significant when compared to the annual sediment production rate observed at the small catchment level. Thus, vegetated buffer zonesmodify the connectivity of sediment fluxes, as they reduce the transport efficiency of gully systems. At the same time, the presence of vegetation causes gullies to evolve from sediment sources to relatively important sediment sinks. Vegetated buffer zones in the channel bed also retard the runoff flow and enhance infiltration of surface runoff. The efficiency of gully bed vegetation in reducing runoff water transfer is the highest when the gully bed is dry, i. e. at the beginning of a rainfall event. Predicting the outflows at the downstream end of the channel was successful by using a kinematic wave model. The error on the predicted outflow volumes is below 15 % for 14 out of 17 cases. We also applied the flow model to simulaterunoff water transmission in gully channels during a short duration, high-intensity rainfall event. This simulation confirms that the presence of vegetation is particularly efficient in retarding surface runoff and enhancing runoff infiltration in dry hydrological conditions. Once the gully bed is wetted, its storage and infiltrationcapacity are reduced. Vegetation cover reduces runoff and sediment production. Vegetation cover is the most important control on runoff generation and therefore on sediment production at the interrill/hillslope scale, although rock type is also important. The role of vegetation is not limited to sediment production: the presence of relatively small amounts of vegetation in the gully beds turns gully beds into sediment sinks and disconnects upslope sediment production areas. It is the combined effect of vegetation on several subprocesses that explain its dominant influence on the catchment-scale sediment yield. These findings have brought along new insights in the mechanisms of runoff and sediment production, transfer and delivery. They indicate that relatively small changes in landscape connectivity have the potential to createstrong feedback loops. status: publishe...|$|R
