50|$|The PleuraFlow {{system was}} shown to {{significantly}} improve drainage compared to a conventional chest tube {{of the same size}} in preclinical studies. The amount of drainage achieved was three times higher than that with the <b>standard</b> <b>tube,</b> and the amount of retained blood and clots inside the pleural space was significantly lower than that with the <b>standard</b> <b>tube.</b> In a subsequent study, significantly improved drainage was demonstrated with a smaller (20 Fr) PleuraFlow chest tube as compared to a larger (32 Fr) standard chest tube. This {{is the first time that}} a smaller diameter chest tube has been shown to provide superior drainage over a larger chest tube. A prospective clinical study from the Cleveland Clinic has highlighted a greater than 1 in 3 rate (36%) of failure of drainage tubes from clogging for patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. And, in 86% of those cases, the obstruction was inside the patient where the clotting couldn’t be observed by the nursing staff.|$|E
50|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that {{insertion}} and use of the <b>standard</b> tracheal <b>tube</b> is easy, providing a clear airway in the majority of cases. Comparative studies indicate that the <b>standard</b> laryngeal <b>tube</b> is generally as effective as the laryngeal mask airway, while some studies indicate that the Pro-seal laryngeal mask may be more effective than the <b>standard</b> laryngeal <b>tube</b> under controlled ventilation conditions in general anaesthesia.The indications and contraindications for use of the laryngeal tube {{are similar to those of}} the laryngeal mask airway and include the use in general anaesthesia for minor surgical operations. Several studies describe the usefulness of the device in securing a difficult airway, even in cases where insertion of the laryngeal mask had failed. The double-lumen laryngeal tube-Suction II, with the possibility of placing a gastric tube, has been found to have distinct advantages over the <b>standard</b> laryngeal <b>tube</b> and has been recommended as a first-line device to secure the airway in emergency situations when direct laryngoscopy fails in neonates and infants. The laryngeal tube is also recommended for medical personnel not experienced in tracheal intubation, and as a rescue device when intubation has failed in adults. According to the manufacturer the use of Laryngeal tubes is contraindicated in people with an intact gag reflex, known oesophageal disease, and people who have ingested caustic substances.|$|R
