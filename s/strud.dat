40|$|International audienceThe {{origin of}} {{tetrapods}} {{is one of}} the key events in vertebrate history. The oldest tetrapod body fossils are Late Devonian (Frasnian–Famennian) in age, most of them consisting of rare isolated bone elements. Here we describe tetrapod remains from two Famennian localities from Belgium: <b>Strud,</b> in the Province of Namur, and Becco, in the Province of Liège. The newly collected material consists of an isolated complete postorbital, fragments of two maxillae, and one putative partial cleithrum, all from <b>Strud,</b> and an almost complete maxilla from Becco. The two incomplete maxillae and cleithrum from <b>Strud,</b> together with the lower jaw previously recorded from this site, closely resemble the genus Ichthyostega, initially described from East Greenland. The postorbital from <b>Strud</b> and the maxilla from Becco do not resemble the genus Ichthyostega. They show several derived anatomical characters allowing their tentative assignment to a whatcheeriid-grade group. The new tetrapod records show that there are at least two tetrapod taxa in Belgium and almost certainly two different tetrapod taxa at <b>Strud.</b> This locality joins the group of Devonian tetrapod-bearing localities yielding more than one tetrapod taxon, confirming that environments favourable to early tetrapod life were often colonized by several tetrapod taxa...|$|E
40|$|The placoderm fauna of {{the upper}} Famennian tetrapod- bearing {{locality}} of <b>Strud,</b> Belgium, includes the antiarch Grossilepis rikiki, the arthrodire groenlandaspidid Turrisaspis strudensis and the phyllolepidid Phyllolepis undulata. Based on morphological and morphometric evidence, the placoderm specimens from <b>Strud</b> are predominantly recognised as immature specimens and this locality as representing a placoderm nursery. The <b>Strud</b> depositional environment corresponds to a channel in an alluvial plain, {{and the presence of}} a nursery in such environment could have provided nutrients and protection to the placoderm offspring. This represents one of the earliest pieces of evidence for this sort of habitat partitioning in vertebrate history, with adults living more distantly from the nursery and using the nursery only to spawn or give live birth...|$|E
40|$|The Famennian (Upper Devonian, c. 372 to 359 Ma) {{strata of}} Belgium have {{recently}} received much attention after the discoveries of early tetrapod remains and outstandingly preserved continental arthropods. The <b>Strud</b> locality has yielded a diverse {{flora and fauna}} including seed-plants, tetrapods, various placoderm, actinopterygian, acanthodian and sarcopterygian fishes, crustaceans (anostracans, notostracans, conchostracans and decapods) and a putative complete insect. This fossil assemblage {{is one of the}} oldest continental – probably fresh-water – ecosystems with a considerable vertebrate and invertebrate diversity. The study of the palaeoenvironment of the <b>Strud</b> locality is crucial because it records one of the earliest and most important phases of tetrapod evolution that took place after their emergence but before their terrestrialization. It raises the question of environmental and ecological conditions for the Devonian aquatic ecosystem and the selection pressures occurring at the onset of tetrapod terrestrialization. The present study characterized the fluvial facies of the Upper Famennian sedimentary rocks of <b>Strud</b> and the surrounding areas. The exceptional preservation of arthropods and plants in the main fossiliferous layers is explained by rapid burial in the fine-grained sediment of the quiet and confined flood plain environment. Newly investigated fossiliferous sections in the Meuse–Samson area led to the description and correlation of key sections (<b>Strud,</b> Wierde and Jausse sections, complemented by the less continuous Haltinne, Huy and Coutisse sections). Moreover, the investigated sections allowed a review of the age of the fossiliferous horizon, which is now definitely considered to be Late Famennian in age. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The placoderm fauna of {{the late}} Famennian tetrapod-bearing {{locality}} of <b>Strud,</b> Belgium, is studied {{on the basis of}} historical and newly collected material. It includes the previously described antiarch Grossilepis rikiki, the groenlandaspidid Turrisaspis strudensis sp. nov. and the actinolepidoideid Phyllolepis undulata. P. undulata is thoroughly described and joins the list of the valid Phyllolepis species conﬁdently diagnosed. A morphometrical analysis performed on the centronuchal and anterior ventrolateral plates of the Phyllolepis material demonstrates {{that there is only one}} species of Phyllolepis in Belgium (thus, Phyllolepis konincki becomes a junior synonym of P. undulata), that P. rossimontina (Pennsylvania) is a synonym of P. undulata and that the unity of the genus Phyllolepis is strongly supported, although the characterization of several species within this genus is blurred. The strong resemblance between the faunal compositions in <b>Strud</b> and Red Hill (Pennsylvania, USA) suggests important faunal exchanges between these regions of the Euramerica landmass.

40|$|The Devonian (419 - 359 {{million years}} ago) is the {{geological}} {{period when the}} terrestrial biota fully established. Early representatives from a terrestrial and continental aquatic biota have previously been reported from the Upper Devonian (Famennian) <b>Strud</b> quarry in Belgium, {{in the shape of}} seed-bearing plants and vertebrates (fish and early tetrapods). The palaeoenvironment is interpreted as a floodplain with slow accumulation of sediment in the river channels and adjacent shallow pools, subject to seasonal flooding and desiccation. This thesis presents the upper Famennian <b>Strud</b> ecosystem with representatives from the largest animal phylum – the Arthropoda. Pancrustaceans are dominating the arthropod assemblage by two eumalacostracans (previously described), three groups of branchiopods, and a putative insect, all collected in fine shales likely deposited in the shallow pools. The branchiopods from <b>Strud</b> comprise new members from all three extant clades, i. e. notostracans, anostracans, and spinicaudatan diplostracans. The notostracan Strudops goldenbergi is remarkable for its close resemblance with the extant genus Triops by the overall body plan and telson morphology. A phylogenetic analysis including modern and extinct notostracans and anostracans was performed, where Strudops appears as the earliest undisputed notostracan ever found. In addition, new genera of Anostraca (Haltinnaias serrata) and Spinicaudata (Gesvestheria pernegrei) are described herein. The insect Strudiella devonica consists of a single specimen and is interpreted to have been a nymph due to its minute size and wingless appearance. The chelicerates are represented by one or several species of eurypterids. So far unnamed juvenile eurypterid remains have also been found within the pool strata, and fragments of adult individuals in the coarser river deposits. The branchiopod community displays a unique insight to the ecosystem that these crustaceans inhabited. This is partly because of their co-occurrence, but mainly because they are preserved in close association to draught-resistant encysted eggs, {{in the same manner as}} modern day branchiopods do to survive and disperse during periods of drought and freezing. Altogether, the arthropod assemblage offers insight to Late Devonian freshwater ecosystems, and provides further understanding of the evolution of respective groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} microremains assemblage {{from the}} Famennian (Upper Devonian) of the Belgian locality of Durnal is {{compared with those}} of the Famennian of <b>Strud,</b> Latvia and Gondwanan Frasnian localities. These faunal comparisons allow palaeoenvironmental and palaeobiogeographical considerations on the faunal interchanges between Gondwana and Euramerica during the Middle-Late Devonian. Isolated acanthodian spines and scales, usually relatively scarce in the Famennian deposits in Belgium, constitute the major part of the Famennian microremains assemblage from Durnal, together with actinopterygian scales and sarcopterygian teeth and scales. This acanthodian fauna from Durnal is the first known association of spines and scales in Northern France and Belgium...|$|E
40|$|The Becco {{locality}} (Liège province), {{belongs to}} the Theux tectonic window and represents a proximal, probably fluvial, environment corresponding to a channel infill. We present here a preliminary report of the fossil assemblage discovered at the locality. The Becco site has yielded a diverse flora of early seed plants including Moresnetia zalesskyi, Dorinnotheca streeli and Condrusia sp. This assemblage, characteristic of the Belgian Famennian, highlights the diversity of early spermatophytes in the country. Becco has also delivered a rich vertebrate fauna with antiarch, groenlandaspid and phyllolepid placoderms, diplacanthiform acanthodians, as well as actinopterygians and various sarcopterygians. The fossiliferous assemblage of Becco resembles those of several Devonian tetrapod- bearing localities, including that of <b>Strud</b> in Belgium, and could therefore provide a favorable palaeoecological setting {{in the search for}} early tetrapods.

40|$|Here {{we present}} a new species of placoderm fish, Africanaspis edmountaini sp. nov., and redescribe Africanaspis doryssa {{on the basis of}} new {{material}} collected from the type locality of Africanaspis. The new material includes the first head shields of Africanaspis doryssa in addition to soft anatomy for both taxa. Hitherto Africanaspis was entirely described from trunk armour and no record of body and fin outlines had been recorded. In addition the first record of embryonic and juvenile specimens of Africanaspis doryssa is presented and provides a growth series from presumed hatchlings to presumed adults. The presence of a greater number of juveniles compared to adults indicates that the Waterloo Farm fossil site in South Africa represents the first nursery site of arthrodire placoderms known from a cold water environment. The preservation of an ontogenetic series demonstrates that variation within the earlier known sample, initially considered to have resulted from ontogenetic change, instead indicates the presence of a second, less common species Africanaspis edmountaini sp. nov. There is some faunal overlap between the Waterloo Farm fossil site and faunas described from <b>Strud</b> in Belgium and Red Hill, Pennsylvania, in north America, supporting the concept of a more cosmopolitan vertebrate fauna in the Famennian than earlier in the Devonian...|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of the phlyctaeniid arthrodire genus Groenlandaspis from the upper Famennian of Belgium is described. The remains of Groenlandaspis potyi sp. nov. consist of dissociated {{thoracic}} armor elements, but the specimen designed to be the holotype displays the median dorsal, anterior and posterior dorsolateral plates in connection. Though incomplete, the new species is characterized by an equilateral triangle-shaped median dorsal plate, a protruding posterodorsal apron of the posterior dorsolateral plate behind the overlap area for the median dorsal plate, and an overall lack of ornamentation. Groenlandaspis potyi sp. nov. constitutes the second occurrence of a Groenlandaspis species in continental Europe after the description of Groenlandaspis thorezi from upper Famennian quarries of Belgium. Another probable {{new species of}} Groenlandaspis is also described, though of unknown locality and horizon; it can however be deduced from the upper Famennian of Belgium without more precision. Together with some unpublished material of groenlandaspidids from the Famennian tetrapod-bearing locality of <b>Strud,</b> this material highlights {{the richness of the}} Groenlandaspididae diversity in Belgium. The discovery of Groenlandaspis potyi sp. nov. in Belgium reinforces the Famennian global distribution of this widespread genus during this period. Also, since those organisms have possibly been considered as non-marine indicators, this material is another argument pleading for close relationships between Euramerica and Gondwana around the Frasnian-Famennian boundary.

40|$|Anatomical, systematic, and paleobiogeographical {{data on the}} Devonian antiarchs from Belgium are reviewed, updated and {{completed}} thanks to new data {{from the field and}} re-examination of paleontological collections. The material of Bothriolepis lohesti is enhanced and the species redescribed in more detail. An undetermined species of Bothriolepis is recorded from the Famennian of Modave (Liège Province), one species of Asterolepis redescribed from the Givetian of Hingeon and another one described from the Givetian of Mazy (Namur Province). Grossilepis rikiki sp. nov. is recorded from the Famennian tetrapod-bearing locality of <b>Strud</b> (Namur Province) and from the Famennian of Moresnet (Liège Province). It is the first occurrence of Grossilepis after the Frasnian and on the central southern coast of the Euramerican continent. Its occurrence in the Famennian of Belgium {{may be the result of}} a late arrival from the Moscow Platform and the Baltic Depression, where the genus is known from Frasnian deposits. Remigolepis durnalensis sp. nov. is described from the Famennian of Spontin near Durnal (Namur Province). Except for the doubtful occurrence of Remigolepis sp. in Scotland, this is the first record of this genus in Western Europe. Its occurrence in Belgium reinforces the strong faunal affinities between Belgium and East Greenland and the hypothesis of a hydrographical link between the two areas during the Late Devonian.

40|$|The {{development}} of new CH functionalization protocols based on inexpensive cobalt catalysts is currently attracting significant interest. Functionalized 8 -aminoquinoline compounds are high-potential building blocks in organic chemistry and pharmaceutical compounds and new facile routes for their preparation would be highly valuable. Recently, copper has been applied as catalyst for the functionalization of 8 -aminoquinoline compounds and found to operate through a single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, although requiring elevated reaction temperatures. Herein, we described the first example of a cobalt-catalyzed remote CH functionalization of 8 -aminoquinoline compounds operating through a SET mechanism, exemplified using a practical and mild nitration protocol. The reaction uses inexpensive cobalt nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO 3) 2 ⋅ 6 H 2 O] as catalyst and tert-butyl nitrite (TBN) as nitro source.
