60|$|It was no {{laughing}} matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these remembrances from any <b>shallow</b> <b>place.</b> I {{would not have been}} the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.|$|E
60|$|They fished on, and {{presently}} {{came to a}} wide, <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> {{with smooth}} rock bottom, where the trail crossed. Neale waded across alone. And he judged that {{the water in the}} middle might come up to Allie's knees.|$|E
60|$|At length, {{he reached}} the brook. There was a rude bridge over it made of two logs, placed side by side, and short boards nailed across them for a foot-way. It was only wide enough for persons to walk across. The cattle and teams always went across through the water, at a <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> just below the bridge.|$|E
50|$|This species likes <b>shallow</b> <b>places</b> {{because it}} is a photophilous species, that means it needs {{sunlight}} to maintain alive its symbiotic micro-algae.|$|R
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are rivers in primary forest. During the day, {{they can be}} found on emergent rocks in <b>shallow</b> <b>places.</b> Tadpoles have been collected under large rocks in a moderate-sized forest stream.|$|R

6000|$|Halfman {{sank down}} under {{the water from the}} force of the fall, but before he touched the bottom a fish came and said to him, 'Fear nothing, Halfman; I will help you.' And the fish guided him to a <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> so that he {{scrambled}} out. On the way it said to him, 'Do you understand what your brothers, whom you saved from death, have done to you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think there}} is any fear of their beating us," [...] Harry said; [...] "certainly not here. We ought {{properly}} to be one on each side, but really I shirk the thought of wading through the river waist-deep at that <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> we found a hundred yards up; it would be bad enough to go through it, worse still to lie for four hours in wet clothes." ...|$|E
60|$|Paul {{looked up}} {{in time to see}} his friend's legs disappear. He ran to the spot in {{considerable}} alarm, supposing that the boy might have taken a fit, and not knowing whether he could swim. He was relieved, however, to find that Olly, on reappearing, struck out manfully with one hand for a <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> {{at the lower end of}} the pool, while with the other he pressed some object tightly to his bosom.|$|E
2500|$|The {{water level}} had fallen again by October 1910, and by October 9, Mascot {{was no longer}} able to reach Woodland. [...] On its last trip to Woodland, Mascot had to line over <b>shallow</b> <b>places</b> in the river.|$|R
50|$|In former times, {{horses were}} pulled {{across the river}} in <b>shallow</b> <b>places.</b> A real ford did not exist, so {{travellers}} needed local leaders and risked their lives again and again. However, it was always regarded as quite dangerous, with deep and drifting quicksand.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} several reports of corn {{seedlings}} being damaged from ammonia, even fall applied anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia injury has been noted in past springs and more frequently occurs with <b>shallow</b> <b>placed</b> ammonia, ammonia applied near the time of planting, urea placed near the seed, and with dry soil conditions...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to the road to watch for any fish-man," [...] I replied, a little more testily than I should have spoken. [...] "What sort of a camping out would that be? But we must not be talking here or I shall never get a bite. Those fish are a little soiled from jumping about in the dust. You might wash them off at that <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> while I go a little further on and try my luck." ...|$|E
60|$|The stag {{was afraid}} of the river; still, he was much more afraid of being laughed at, and he plunged in after the puma; but in an instant the current had swept him away, and if it had not borne him by {{accident}} to a <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> on the opposite side, where he managed to scramble up the bank, he would certainly have been drowned. As it was, he scrambled out, shaking with terror, and found the puma waiting for him. 'You had a narrow escape that time,' said the puma.|$|E
60|$|The trail led {{across the}} brook at a wide, <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> where the {{splashing}} made by Pronto sent the trout scurrying for deeper water. Columbine kept to that trail, {{knowing that it}} led up into Sage Valley, where Wilson Moore had taken up the homestead property. Fresh horse tracks told her that Wade had ridden along there some time earlier. Pronto shied at the whirring of sage-hens. Presently Columbine ascertained they were flushed by the hound Kane, that had broken loose and followed her. He had done so before, and the fact had not displeased her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Plenty for us, signor; but if {{the boom}} goes right across the channel, heavy rowboats {{would not be able}} to pass. There are few <b>shallower</b> <b>places</b> in the lagoons than just about here. It may be that in one or two places even we might touch, but if we do, the bottom is firm enough for us to get out and float the boat over." ...|$|R
60|$|But Jerry Muskrat worked steadily, {{digging and}} piling sods {{in a circle}} for the {{foundation}} of his house. In the center he dug out a chamber from which he planned a long tunnel to his secret burrow far away in the bank, and another to the deepest part of the Smiling Pool, where even in the coldest weather the water would not freeze to the bottom as it would do in the <b>shallow</b> <b>places.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But {{before we}} leave them, I wish to show you, {{at the very end}} of this article, {{something}} which is a little curious in its appearance. Let us take a step down to the very bottom of the sea; not in those comparatively <b>shallow</b> <b>places,</b> where the divers descend to look for wrecks and treasure, but in deep Water, miles below the surface. Down there, on the very bottom, you will see this strange thing. What do you suppose it is? ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{a strong}} effort, {{he held the}} {{chestnut}} back, and saw the first red-coated figure rise above the willows and alight with the mire flying among the rushes across the stream. Then he swung to the right, where he remembered there was a broad, <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> and drove the chestnut at its widest part. They came down with a great splash and the horse floundered badly, for the bottom was soft, but Blake had done what he meant to do, and as the second horseman leaped across a narrower spot he caught a sympathetic, [...] "Hard luck!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you think}} you have the stag to deal with?' asked the monkey, laughing. 'I should prefer to follow; if not I shall go no further. The puma {{understood}} that it was useless trying to make the monkey do as he wished, so he chose a <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> and began to swim across. The monkey waited till the puma had got to the middle, then he gave a great spring and jumped on his back, knowing quite well that the puma would be afraid to shake him off, lest he should be swept away into deep water. So in this manner they reached the bank.|$|E
60|$|The Adelantado {{advanced}} with caution, {{and finding}} a <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> entered the river with his troops. They were scarcely midway in the stream when the savages, hideously painted, and looking more like fiends than men, burst from their concealment. The forest rang with their yells and howlings. They discharged a shower of arrows and lances, by which, notwithstanding the protection of their targets, many of the Spaniards were wounded. The Adelantado, however, forced {{his way across the}} river, and the Indians took to flight. Some were killed, but their swiftness of foot, their knowledge of the forest, and their dexterity in winding through the most tangled thickets, enabled the greater number to elude the pursuit of the Spaniards, who were encumbered with armor, targets, crossbows, and lances.|$|E
60|$|As if only waiting {{till the}} story was done, the dragon-fly flew off with a whirr, and darted to and fro, hunting for its breakfast, {{glittering}} splendidly as it flashed among the leaves or darted close above the water. Daisy forgot her disappointment in a minute, and went fishing for lilies; while the turtles came up to sun themselves on the rocks, the merry little tadpoles wiggled in the <b>shallow</b> <b>places,</b> and a wild duck paddled by with a brood of ducklings following in her wake.|$|R
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning they brought out the {{shivering}} team and piled into the box all the quilts and robes they had, and bundling little Flaxen in, started across the trackless plain toward the low line of hills to the east, twenty-five or thirty miles. From four {{o'clock in the morning}} till nearly noon they toiled across the sod, now ploughing through the deep snow where the unburned grass had held it, now scraping across the bare, burned earth, now wandering up or down the swales, seeking the <b>shallowest</b> <b>places,</b> now shovelling a pathway through.|$|R
5|$|The {{bodies were}} buried in {{separate}} <b>shallow</b> graves, <b>placed</b> in the fetal position (knees raised towards their heads), which {{was the most common}} form for Egyptian burials of the time.|$|R
60|$|So he and Beechnut {{walked along}} after the oxen. They found a narrow, but very pretty road, or rather path, {{overhung}} with trees and bushes, which led {{down to the}} water. The road terminated at a broad and <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> in the stream, where the sand was yellow and the water very clear. The oxen {{went out into the}} water, and then put their heads down to drink. Presently they stopped, first one and then the other, and stood a moment considering whether they wanted any more. Finding that they did not, they turned round in the water, and then came slowly out to the land. They walked up the bank, and finally emerging from the wood at the place where they had entered it, they went toward home.|$|E
60|$|It {{was too hot}} to {{run about}} in the open, so Dan asked their friend, old Hobden, to take their own dinghy from the pond and {{put her on the}} brook {{at the bottom of the}} garden. Her painted name was the Daisy, but for {{exploring}} expeditions she was the Golden Hind or the Long Serpent, or some such suitable name. Dan hiked and howked with a boat-hook (the brook was too narrow for sculls), and Una punted with a piece of hop-pole. When they came to a very <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> (the Golden Hind drew quite three inches of water) they disembarked and scuffled her over the gravel by her tow-rope, and when they reached the overgrown banks beyond the garden they pulled themselves up stream by the low branches.|$|E
6000|$|... "First, I cut a lot {{of brush}} and young trees and placed them in the Laughing Brook in that <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> with the butts {{pointing}} up-stream. I kept them in place by piling mud and stones on them. Then I kept piling on more sticks and brush and mud. The water brought down leaves and floating stuff, and this caught in the dam and helped fill it in. I dug {{a lot of}} mud {{in front of it}} and used this to fill in the spaces between the sticks. This made the water deeper in front of the dam {{and at the same time}} kept it from getting through. As the water backed up, of course it made a pond. I kept making my dam longer and higher, and the longer and higher it became the bigger the pond grew. When it was big enough and deep enough to suit me, I stopped work on the dam and built my house out there." ...|$|E
5000|$|MacDonald Island {{is part of}} Princess Louisa Inlet in British Columbia, {{between the}} {{entrance}} of the inlet at Malibu Rapids {{to the head of the}} inlet at Chatterbox Falls. [...] It is a popular mooring place for it is one of the few <b>shallow</b> <b>places</b> of the deep fjord. The island was originally named after the man who built a cabin at Chatterbox Falls - James F. MacDonald. In 1940 the Island was renamed Hamilton Island after Thomas F. Hamilton, who built the Malibu Club and purchased the land from MacDonald for $18,000. In 1972 the land's name reverted to the original name of MacDonald Island.|$|R
60|$|In {{advancing}} {{along this}} path {{it was very}} curious to observe the totally {{different aspects of the}} water on the two sides of it. On the one side it was turbid and gray, and perfectly opaque. You could not have seen the pollywogs in the <b>shallowest</b> <b>places</b> along the margin. On the other side it was so clear and transparent that you could have seen fishes swimming where it was ten feet deep. It was of such a rich and beautiful blue color, too, {{as if it had been}} tinted with a dye, and the color was of so rich and brilliant a hue, that Mrs. Holiday was continually admiring and praising it.|$|R
60|$|But {{we shall}} not {{find it easy to}} walk through all these beauties. As I said before, we shall often be obliged to cut a path with our hatchets, and even then we may be unable to {{penetrate}} very far into this jungle of beauties. The natives of these countries, when they are compelled to pass through these dense forests, often take to the small streams and wade along in the water, which is sometimes up to their shoulders, occasionally finding <b>shallower</b> <b>places,</b> or a little space on the banks where they can pick their way along for a few hundred yards before they are obliged to take to the stream again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It couldn't be better! There are sixty or seventy {{of them in}} a sort {{of little}} ravine three hundred yards away, on the {{left-hand}} side of the river. They don't seem to be keeping guard at all, and if they are not more careful to-morrow night we shall take them completely by surprise. We are going to saddle all the mules directly it gets too dark for any of the fellows on the hills to see us, then we must set to work and pull down enough of the barricade here to allow them to pass. We ourselves, when we go down, will cross at that <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> above here, and go down the river at that side, otherwise we sha'n't be able to cross it except at some distance beyond {{the other end of the}} torrent. Of course the mules must go down this side, as we shall want to turn to the right when we get off. We shall make our attack about ten o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{reached the}} bank I gave a shout of satisfaction. The river was in flood; {{there must have}} been rain up in the hills, and you know how quickly the streams rise. Unless the Boers knew of some very <b>shallow</b> <b>place,</b> there would be no {{crossing}} it; for it was running like a mill- stream, and except at some waggon drift the banks were almost perpendicular. At any rate I could not hope to swim half across before the Boers came up, and so I must fight it out where I was. I had scarcely found a point where I could get a comfortable foothold on the bank, with my head just above the level, when the Boers appeared {{on the top of the}} hill. They stopped for a minute and then broke up, and scattering rode forward. They felt sure that I must have made for the river, as there was no other place where I could be concealed. When they came within a couple of hundred yards of it they dismounted, and three or four came forward on foot. When the nearest was within a hundred yards of me I fired.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} don't {{like to hear}} her mentioned," [...] said the marine, turning to the blacksmith, [...] "but I am bound {{to say that in}} course of the {{afternoon}} Miss Minturn came on deck several times, to ask if anything new had happened, and if I had seen a vessel. I showed her all that I had done, and told her I was going to hang out lights at night, and did everything I could to keep her on deck as long as possible; for {{it was easy to see}} that she needed fresh air, and I needed company. As long as I was talking to her I didn't care a snap of my finger for the Water-devil. It is queer what an influence a beautiful woman has on a man, but it's so, and there's no use arguing about it. She said she had been puzzling her brains to find out what had stopped us, and she supposed it must be that we had run onto a <b>shallow</b> <b>place</b> and stuck fast in the mud, but thought it wonderful that there should be such a place so far from land. I agreed with her that it was wonderful, and added that that was probably the reason the captain and the crew had been seized with a panic. But sensible people like herself and her father, I said, ought not to be troubled by such an occurrence, especially as the vessel remained in a perfectly sound condition.|$|E
60|$|The wall-spaces {{between the}} {{projections}} ought {{also to be}} turned to account for shallow bookcases, so far as they are not occupied by windows. If {{the width of the}} interval be two feet six, about sixteen inches of this may be given to <b>shallow</b> cases <b>placed</b> against the wall.|$|R
60|$|Circumstances {{conspired to}} aid Jack in the {{investigation}} that succeeded. The sun was near setting, but a stream of golden light gleamed over the waters, particularly illuminating the portion which came {{within the field of}} the glass. It appeared then that Harry, in his efforts to escape from the rock, and to get nearer {{to the edge of the}} main channel, where his chances of being seen and rescued would be ten-fold what they were on his rock, had moved south, by following the naked reef and the <b>shallow</b> <b>places,</b> and was actually more than a league nearer to the brig than he would have been had he remained stationary. There had been hours in which to make this change, and the young man had probably improved them to the utmost.|$|R
60|$|We {{saw some}} fresh moose-tracks along the shore. The stream was only from one and one half to three rods wide, quite winding, with {{occasional}} small islands, meadows, and some very swift and <b>shallow</b> <b>places.</b> When {{we came to}} an island the Indian never hesitated which side to take, as if the current told him which was the shortest and deepest. It was lucky for us that the water was so high. We had to walk but once on this stream, carrying {{a part of the}} load, at a swift and shallow reach, while he got up with the canoe, not being obliged to take out, though he said it was very strong water. Once or twice we passed the red wreck of a bateau which had been stove some spring.|$|R
