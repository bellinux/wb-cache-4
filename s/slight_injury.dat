5|$|The assailants were {{apparently}} targeting Rami Amira, {{who was sitting}} at a table nearby with Moti Hassin and Simantov Hatayeb, who are all identified with the Abergil group, in an effort to resolve an internal dispute. Amira sustained a <b>slight</b> <b>injury</b> in his cheek {{as a result of the}} attack. He was killed on 2 February 2011 in Rishon Letzion, presumably by the Abergil organization which, according to police sources, continued to operate while the two Abergil brothers were extradited and awaiting trial in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a <b>slight</b> <b>injury</b> scare in training the night before the final, requiring a bandage on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit enough to play in the match.|$|E

One evening in June 1958 Leggio was walking across a field when some of Navarra's men opened fire on him. He escaped with just a <b>slight</b> <b>injury</b> to his hand.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates motorcyclist’s {{willingness}} to pay (WTP) for <b>slight</b> <b>injuries</b> reduction due to motor vehicle accidents {{in the city of}} Denpasar, Bali Province, using logistic regression technique. The study found that total travel distance per day by all motorcyclists in the household, groups of motorcyclists aged between 25 and 34 years old, between 35 and 44 and between 55 and 64 years old influenced about 50 %, 36 %, 35 % and 86 % respectively on motorcyclist’s WTP for 25 % <b>slight</b> <b>injuries</b> reduction and about 50 %, 64 %, 65 % and 14 % respectively on motorcyclist’s WTP for 15 % <b>slight</b> <b>injuries</b> reduction. Total travel distance per day by all motorcyclists in the household shared equal probabilities in influencing motoryclist’s WTP for both 15 % and 25 % <b>slight</b> <b>injuries</b> reductions. Groups of motorcyclists aged between 55 and 64 years old prefered 25 % to 15 % <b>slight</b> <b>injuries</b> reduction compared with younger motorcyclists...|$|R

25|$|Struggling with a <b>slight</b> <b>injury</b> {{midway through}} the season, Babel managed to play a total of 16 league matches for Ajax, scoring four goals in total in the Eredivisie. He also made four {{appearances}} in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, {{as well as two}} more appearances in the 2012–13 KNVB Cup, where he scored the second goal in the '15 minute of the second round fixture against FC Utrecht, with the match ending 3–0 for the Amsterdam side prior to his injury. He would return to action after being sidelined to help his side secure their 3rd consecutive national title and 32nd overall.|$|E
500|$|During the {{following}} season Bruce {{was offered the}} job of manager by three different clubs, but Ferguson refused {{to allow him to}} pursue the opportunities as he felt the player still had a role to play in the United team. Bruce made a further 30Premier League appearances, as United managed to overcome a 12-point deficit to Newcastle United to win the championship once again. A week later he was left out of United's squad for the FA Cup final due to a <b>slight</b> <b>injury.</b> At the end of the match Eric Cantona, who had captained the team and scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Liverpool, attempted to persuade Bruce {{to be the one to}} receive the trophy, but Bruce declined.

500|$|He {{played for}} only 32 minutes against Groningen, after a display which lacked creativity. He said {{afterwards}} {{he was tired}} and was carrying a <b>slight</b> <b>injury</b> during the match, but Koeman criticised Mido saying he was not giving everything. He revealed in September 2002 {{that he wanted to}} leave Ajax in the transfer window in late December. However, Mido soon apologised to Koeman and Leo Beenhakker regarding the transfer comments, saying he was [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "unthoughtful". He was handed a fine and suspended from Ajax's game against Olympique Lyonnais. In December of that year, he revealed that he wanted to stay at Ajax. He scored for Ajax during their 6–0 defeat of Willem II in February 2003, but Koeman again criticised Mido, commenting negatively on his performance against Roda in the KNVB Cup. He was dropped for Ajax's next game against Feyenoord, only featuring as an unused substitute. He suffered a muscle strain in his upper thigh after a friendly for Egypt, and was ruled out of Ajax's game against Groningen. Mido was relegated to the Ajax reserve team for disciplinary reasons, surrounding a perceived lack of effort in training. His situation at the club led to interest from Serie A clubs Juventus and Lazio and he later admitted to have thrown a pair of scissors at Ajax teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović following an argument in March 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Septic sores became {{common in}} the EFF {{during the summer of}} 1917. In July, 22 per cent of the Anzac Mounted Division was {{suffering}} from these sores, and that number increased in August. The sores were blamed mainly on poor diet, which was lacking in variety, vegetables, and clean water. Mosquito bites contributed to the prevalence of septic sores, but flies were the main reason minor cuts and scratches became septic. Flies were everywhere, in the men's drinks, food, and tents. The sores, which took the form of superficial ulcerations {{on the surface of the}} skin, often occurred following a <b>slight</b> <b>injury</b> to the hands. They were painful and hard to treat except by antiseptics, and such treatment was [...] "hardly practicable in the field." [...] The majority of the men suffering sores on hands or faces had to wear bandages, which [...] "had a lowering and irritating effect upon the men." [...] On the hands these dressings made work difficult; and, although dressings were changed twice daily, they became [...] "filthy in no time," [...] due to the dust. [...] After the advance in November 1917 to the Jaffa and Ramleh region, where oranges were grown and easily obtained, the septic sores cleared up.|$|E

6000|$|In {{order to}} answer these questions, we must {{consider}} {{why it is that}} [...] "natural selection" [...] acts so powerfully upon animals; and we shall, I believe, find, that its effect depends mainly upon their self-dependence and individual isolation. A <b>slight</b> <b>injury,</b> a temporary illness, will often end in death, because it leaves the individual powerless against its enemies. If an herbivorous animal is a little sick and has not fed well for a day or two, and the herd is then pursued by a beast of prey, our poor invalid inevitably falls a victim. So, in a carnivorous animal, the least deficiency of vigour prevents its capturing food, and it soon dies of starvation. There is, as a general rule, no mutual assistance between adults, which enables them to tide over a period of sickness. Neither is there any division of labour; each must fulfil all the conditions of its existence, and, therefore, [...] "natural selection" [...] keeps all up to a pretty uniform standard.|$|E
60|$|Albinia {{understood}} whence came Gilbert's heroism. He had charged at first, {{as he had}} hunted with Maurice, {{because there}} was no doing otherwise, and in the critical moment the warm heart had done the rest, and equalled constitutional courage: but then, she saw the gentle tender spirit sinking under the <b>slight</b> <b>injury,</b> and far more at the suffering of his friend, the deadly havoc among his comrades, and his own share in the carnage. The General coolly mentioned the two enemies who had fallen by his pistol, and Maurice shouted about them {{as if they had been}} two rabbits, but she knew enough of Gilbert to be sure that what he might do in the exigency of self-defence, would shock and sicken him in recollection. Poor Fred! how little would she once have believed that his frightful wound could be a secondary matter with her, only enhancing her gratitude on account of another.|$|E
