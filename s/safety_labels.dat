30|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{finding is}} {{the response from}} participants in the group who saw the E. coli/Vaccinated food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> version, {{who were willing to}} pay $ 1.44 as price premium for a pound of ground beef with this label, approximately 19 % lower than the price premium for the food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> without the words “vaccines” or “E. coli” (Safer Choice/Enhance). While the 95 % confidence interval for the Safer Choice/Vaccinated food label overlaps with the Safer Choice/Enhance version, the latter overlaps only slightly with the confidence interval for the E. coli/Vaccinated food <b>safety</b> <b>label.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{location}} {{variables were}} interacted {{with the food}} <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> variables to investigate interaction effects between grocery store location {{and the type of}} food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> shoppers chose. The interaction effects were not statistically significant in any of the three model variations, and a likelihood ratio test suggests that the interaction models were not significantly different from models without interaction.|$|R
30|$|Results {{show that}} {{consumers}} {{were willing to}} pay a price premium for ground beef with a food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> while the most preferred food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> was the one that did not provide information about the intervention and its role in enhancing food safety. Results also show that preferences and WTP for safer foods are affected by demographic characteristics. For example, participants who had a high school education or less {{were willing to pay}} more for a food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> relative to those with higher educational backgrounds. We also found that some segments of consumers who chose the ground beef with a food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> such as natural food shoppers, were willing to pay a higher price for them, relative to shoppers in stores located in suburban neighborhoods. This suggests that having a good understanding of the demographic composition of the consumers that they target can help processors/retailers to more effectively use food labels to communicate food safety attributes.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} cinderella and bogus stamps {{have been issued}} over the years {{including}} official traffic <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> available free from Bahraini post offices in 1981 and a bogus Bahrain Camel Post series between 1986 and 1990. The Camel Post series {{was based on the}} famous desert postman stamps of Sudan and sold in aid of a home for disabled children.|$|E

5000|$|Concerned about [...] "failure to warn" [...] lawsuits, NEMA began {{exploring}} ways {{of warning}} young children {{about the dangers}} of exposed high-voltage equipment. Member companies within NEMA's Transformer Section formed a task force—the Task Force on <b>Safety</b> <b>Labels</b> for Pad-Mounted Switchgear and Transformers Sited in Public Areas—to design a safety label that very young children would understand, as well as standards on how that label was to be used.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} WTP {{premiums for}} the ground beef {{with the additional}} food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> participants who chose option B (the standard label plus the food <b>safety</b> <b>label)</b> answered follow-up questions using the double-bounded contingent valuation (DBCV) elicitation format which presented two random premium bid amounts, with the second bid contingent on the first, following Hanemann et al. (1991). By asking the second question, the DBCV uses more information to determine WTP values, which improves {{the efficiency of the}} estimation (Hanemann et al. 1991).|$|R

Examples of permanent applications include <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> for power equipment, foil tape for HVAC duct work, automotive interior trim assembly, and sound/vibration damping films. Some high performance permanent PSAs exhibit high adhesion values and can support kilograms of weight per square centimeter of contact area, even at elevated temperature. Permanent PSAs may be initially removable (for example to recover mislabeled goods) and build adhesion to a permanent bond after several hours or days.|$|E
40|$|Food safety {{incidents}} occur {{frequently in}} China. Chinese people 2 ̆ 7 s health {{is at risk}} due to the variety of Chinese food safety problems. The Chinese government has enacted many programs and policies to address this issue. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand how Chinese college students perceive these food safety risks and what motivates them to take preventative measures toward reducing their risk. To better understand Chinese college students 2 ̆ 7 perception and their behavioral intention related to food safety, this study tested the relationships between threat appraisal (severity and vulnerability) of food safety and behavioral intention to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels,</b> coping appraisal (response efficacy and self-efficacy) and behavioral intention to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> in Protection Motivation Theory. Chinese students in a large Midwestern university were recruited via an email invitation to take an online survey asking about their perception of food safety in China and their intentions to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels.</b> Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 22. 0. Positive relationships were detected between severity, vulnerability, response efficacy, self-efficacy and behavioral intention. Severity was the strongest factor (β=. 365, p 3 ̆c. 01) that influenced behavioral intention in this study after controlling for knowledge and mass media dependence. These outcomes suggested that Chinese college students 2 ̆ 7 intentions to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> were increasing as their perception about food safety went up. Meanwhile, they were more likely to follow the recommendations to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> when severity of food safety was stressed...|$|E
30|$|Despite {{evidence}} that consumers value safe food products, communicating food safety enhancing attributes/technologies on food labels is challenging, {{partly due to}} consumer apprehension and insufficient understanding of food safety interventions. Extending previous studies that show that consumers {{are willing to pay}} for specific food safety interventions when they are provided with information about them (Fox et al. 2002; Nayga Jr et al. 2006; Teisl and Roe 2010), this study explored diverse ways of communicating food safety attributes through labeling cues, on consumer choices, and WTP for such attributes. The study also examined the influence of individual characteristics on preferences for food <b>safety</b> <b>labels.</b> These objectives were achieved through a survey that asked shoppers to choose between two types of ground beef: one with a standard/generic label and one that, in addition to the standard label, also had a food safety label. Three of such food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> were designed, each providing different information about the food safety intervention, and randomly assigned to participants.|$|E
30|$|Among {{demographics}} variables, {{college was}} statistically significant in models I and III at the 10 % and 5 % level of significance, respectively. Remarkably, the coefficient of this variable is negative, suggesting that respondents with a college background or better were not {{willing to pay more}} for ground beef with a food <b>safety</b> <b>label.</b> Although this finding may require further investigation, the fact that more educated respondents would pay less does not necessarily indicate their aversion for the food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> or the vaccine intervention. It could suggest that highly educated respondents were likely to be skeptical about the E. coli reduction claim from vaccine use on the food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> or the unsupported claim about enhanced safety from cattle raised under strict health standards, to warrant an extra cost to them. Strijbos et al. (2016) reported that among their sample of Dutch residents who participated in a study examining health claims of reduced nitrate levels in meat, those with relatively lower educational backgrounds were more likely to perceive such claims to be credible. The statistically significant income variable in models I and III indicates a higher WTP among respondents with high household incomes.|$|R
30|$|We {{examine the}} impact of food labels that make {{unsupported}} claims of food <b>safety</b> and <b>labels</b> that provide information to support such claims on consumer choices and examine consumers’ willingness to pay for beef products with these different food <b>safety</b> <b>labeling</b> cues. Empirical results from a survey of grocery shoppers in a Midwestern city in the USA show that more than two thirds of respondents who received a label with unsubstantiated food safety claims chose this option and were willing to pay the highest price premium for it, compared to the less preferred labeling options that provided information to support food safety claims.|$|R
30|$|Overall, consumers’ WTP a {{price premium}} for ground beef with a food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> option {{suggests}} that {{its presence in}} retail markets could potentially drive down the price of regular beef, similar to findings by Kanter et al. (2009) who showed in an experimental study {{that the presence of}} rBST-free milk reduced WTP for conventional milk.|$|R
30|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this study is}} to examine the impact of {{different}} ways of communicating food safety attributes on consumer choices and WTP for various food safety labeling cues on food products. Secondary goals include examining how factors such as demographic characteristics, personal health issues, knowledge and acceptance of food safety interventions, and views about the government’s role in regulating and ensuring food safety influence consumer preferences and WTP for food <b>safety</b> <b>labels.</b>|$|E
40|$|The study {{analysed}} consumer {{willingness to}} pay for <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> in Nigeria by {{a case study of}} potassium bromate in bread” in Benin City, Edo State. It specifi cally investigates factors that promote {{willingness to pay}} for label among consumers of bread in Benin City, Edo State. Data used for the study were obtained through a well-structured questionnaire from 200 respondents. Both descriptive analytical methods and probit regression models were used for the analysis. The study revealed that 73 % of the respondents are in their active working age with 50 percent of the respondent being male and female respectively. 67 percent of the respondents are married with 55 percent having an average of 5 members per household. 99 percent of the respondents are educated i. e. they have the capability of being able to read and write. Respondents purchased bread mainly from hawkers (60 %) with about 60 % of them being aware of the presence of bromate in bread. 40 % of the consumers used labeling as a way of identifying bromate free bread. Other methods reported deal with differences in price of bread with same weight, aroma and taste. Result also revealed that 60 % of the respondents got to know about the negative effect of bromate from news (both print and mass media). Econometric results show that variables like education, gender, income, prior knowledge of bromate and perception held by respondents of negative implications of bromate signifi cantly infl uence the willingness to pay for <b>safety</b> <b>labels.</b> Education, gender, income and prior knowledge of bromate positively infl uence the probability of consumers’ decision to pay for safety label, while price of bread and confi dence and perception held by respondents of negative implications of bromate on human health infl uence consumers willingness to pay more for <b>safety</b> <b>labels.</b> The study, thus, suggests a defi ned market for bread purchases, community based awareness programme and extension of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) role beyond media advertisement...|$|E

40|$|Concerns of Thai {{consumers}} on {{food safety}} have been recently increasing, especially {{in urban areas}} and for fresh produce because food safety scandals, such as chemical residues on fresh produce (e. g., cabbage) still frequently occur. The Thai government tried to meet consumer needs by imposing in the domestic market a stronger regulation aimed at increasing the baseline level of food safety assurance and by introducing a voluntary standard (based on Good Agricultural Practices or GAPs and known as Q-GAP) and the related food safety label (i. e., Q mark). However, since standards and regulations are weakly implemented in the domestic market compared to exported products, {{there is still a}} lack of Thai consumers’ confidence in the safety of local food products. In this work the current situation of GAPs adoption in Thai fresh produce production is analysed. Furthermore, it is studied whether Thai consumers place value on food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> available on the market, to know whether consumer demand could drive the market of certified safer products. This study contains three essays: 1) a review of the literature, 2) a qualitative study on stakeholders' perception toward GAPs adoption and 3) a quantitative study, aimed at analysing consumers' preferences and willingness-to-pay for food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> on fresh produce using a discrete choice experiment. This dissertation contributes to the economics of quality assurance and labelling, specifically addressing GAPs and food safety label in the fresh produce supply chain. Results show that Q-GAP could be effectively used to improve food safety in Thai domestic market, but its credibility should be improved. Stakeholder’s awareness toward food safety issues and the delivery of reliable and sound information are crucial. Thai consumers are willing to pay a premium price for food safety labelled produce over unlabelled ones. Implications for both government and business decision-makers are discussed...|$|E
30|$|A {{chi-square}} {{test was used}} to test differences among the three options (i.e., option A, option B, will not purchase); the test result was significant at better than the 1 % level (Table  4), indicating that differences in response among the food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> were not due to chance. Key demographic characteristics such as household income, age, and education were not statistically different from each other among participants in the three food safety label groups (see tests in section B of the Appendix). Consequently, it can be concluded that a participant’s choice was influenced by the type of food safety label they were exposed to. Furthermore, the fact that the proportion of respondents who chose the not-purchase option was almost identical (approximately 15 %) for each group provides additional support to the robustness of the experimental design.|$|E
30|$|Respondents {{randomly}} assigned to the Safer Choice/Enhance food label {{were willing to pay}} more, in both models II and III, compared to respondents who saw the E. coli/Vaccinated label (the reference category), a further indication that the food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> with no justification for the food safety claims was more appealing.

30|$|Focusing on a {{technology}} that the public may be unfamiliar with and/or apprehensive about, the case study {{contributes to the literature}} by exploring different ways by which health claims attributed to the food safety intervention may be presented on food labels. Specifically, previous literature elicited bidding behavior/WTP for food safety attributes by providing respondents with different types of information such as negative and/or positive information (Fox et al. 2002; Nayga Jr et al. 2006; Teisl and Roe 2010). Our study extends the literature by examining and comparing food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> that use vague food safety claims to labels that include more precise descriptions of a food safety intervention to substantiate these claims without providing any additional information {{about the nature of the}} food safety intervention. By tweaking the description of health claims on food product labels, the study closely gauges labeling preferences with a design that matches an actual food purchasing scenario between competing product choices.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the deeper {{analysis}} {{of the interaction between}} Country-of-Origin, QUALITY & <b>SAFETY</b> <b>labels,</b> retailer brands and individual specific data with the target of identifying the best labelling strategies for the GERMAN BEEF market. For this purpose Discrete-Choice-method was applied. The empirical findings have interesting implications with respect to information economics in general, and the signalling effects of GIs, brands and QUALITY & SAFETY -labels in particular. Economic theory suggests that certificates reduce information asymmetries as far as consumers attribute product quality to producers' participation in quality assurance schemes. However, CO-labelled products may already be associated with a superior quality, rendering additional certification less effective. The results show a tendency in that direction. Mostly negative or no interaction effects for the analysed QUALITY & SAFETY-Country-of-Origin combinations were found. Nevertheless, there is the possibility that control labels can support the sales of certain origin as shown for the combination of BAVARIAN BEEF and CONTROLLED QUALITY-BAVARIA. ...|$|E

The questionnaire offered answers with three grade of importance. Our research showed that groups of students formed {{on the basis of}} their education and gender, in our survey considered as representatives of young adults, had different interest for selected set of information included in the statements connected with food quality, safety and food choice.
