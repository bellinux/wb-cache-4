40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} simultaneous surgery for correcting senile blepharoptosis combined with upper eyelid entropion. METHODS: From June 2010 to June 2013, 30 cases(60 eyes) patients with senile blepharoptosis combined with upper eyelid entropion, received simultaneous surgery. The simultaneous surgery was upper eyelid entropion correction with levator palpebrae superioris muscle shortening and advancement. RESULTS: All cases were performed surgery successfully. The position of upper eyelid and the management of upper eyelid entropion were observed. The upper eyelid margin rested 1. 68 ± 0. 71 mm below the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> at 1 wk, 1. 71 ± 0. 69 mm below the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> at 1 mo, and 1. 70 ± 0. 65 mm below the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> at 6 mo. Compared with the preoperative values, the difference were statistically significant(P CONCLUSION: Most of patients with senile upper eyelid entropion has senile blepharoptosis, Ophthalmologists should pay attention to those patients {{and give them the}} correct surgery techniques. It is effective to use upper eyelid entropion correction with levator palpebrae superioris muscle shortening and advancement to correct senile blepharoptosis with upper eyelid entropion...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. In the epidermis, {{the highest}} clonogenicity, {{a feature of}} stem cells (SCs), {{is found in the}} {{smallest}} keratinocyte. In the limbal-corneal (LC) epithelium the SCs are exclusively localized in the basal epithelial layer of the limbal domain. The current study was conducted to determine whether this spatial SC arrangement is reflected in differences in the cell size between limbal and corneal cells. METHODS. In vivo confocal microscopy was used to scan and measure the size of the cells of the central cornea and the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> in five normal subjects, from the superficial to the basal cell layer. Limbal and corneal pure epithelial sheets were isolated by dispase digestion from human tissues and dissociated into single cells by trypsin digestion.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare and {{investigate}} morphometric characteristics of limbal vasculature within the superior and inferior limbal regions using ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography. Method: Cross-sectional images of the human corneo-scleral limbus were acquired with a research grade ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomographer (UHR-OCT) from 14 healthy subjects after manual retraction of the upper and lower eyelid. The UHR-OCT provides an axial and lateral resolution in biological tissue of ~ 3 μm and ~ 18 μm, respectively. 3 D stacks of OCT images (1000 x 1024 x 256) were acquired of the transition from cornea to bulbar conjunctiva at the superior and inferior limbal region. All visible vessels within the limbal region were measured using an Image J circle or ellipse tool. Vessel depth and size measurements were repeated for the same vessel and the concordance correlation coefficient was computed. Quantitative differences in vessel size and depth in the limbal region were analyzed using repeated measured ANOVA. R and SPSS were used for all data analysis procedures. Results: The average vessel size for superior and inferior limbus were 29. 28 µm ± 17. 649 µm (SD) and 23. 68 µm ± 18. 118 µm (SD) respectively. The average vessel depth for superior and inferior limbus were 176. 76 µm ± 108. 698 µm (SD) and 205. 62 µm ± 131. 991 µm (SD) respectively. The concordance correlation coefficient for superior and inferior limbal vessel size were 0. 95 (95 % CI, 0. 935 to 0. 964) and 0. 994 (95 % CI, 0. 991 to 0. 995) respectively, while that of vessel depth were 0. 998 (95 % CI, 0. 997 to 0. 999) and 0. 998 (95 % CI, 0. 997 to 0. 998) respectively. The vessels within the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> were larger than the vessels found in the inferior limbus (RM-ANOVA POS p = 0. 004), and the vessels within the inferior limbus were on average deeper than the vessels found within the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> (RM-ANOVA POS p = 0. 042). There was a positive linear relationship between limbal vessel depth and size within the superior and inferior limbus with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 803 and 0. 754, respectively. There were on average 9 vessels per subject within the superior limbal region as compared to 13 vessels per subject with the inferior limbal region. Conclusion: This study provided evidence that the UHR-OCT was capable of imaging (and therefore measuring) morphometric characteristics such as the size and depth of vessels within the limbus in a repeatable manner. A positive linear association between vessel depth and size was identified in the superior and inferior limbal regions. The results of this study suggest a definite difference in the size and depth of vessels across different positions of the limbus, and this may be indicative of adaptations to chronic hypoxia caused by the constant covering of the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> by the upper eyelid. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|Ocular {{trauma is}} one of the leading causes of visual {{impairment}} worldwide. Because of the popularity of cataract surgeries, aged individuals with ocular trauma commonly have a surgical wound in their eyes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the visual outcome of cases that were coincident with intraocular lens (IOL) ejection in the eyes with ruptured open-globe ocular injuries. Consecutive patients with open-globe ocular injuries were first reviewed. Patients' characteristics, corrected distance visual acuities (CDVAs) over 3 years after the trauma, causes of injuries, traumatic wound patterns, and coexistence of retinal detachment were examined. The relationships between poor CDVA and the other factors, including the complications of crystalline lens and IOL ejection, were examined. A total of 105 eyes/patients [43 eyes with rupture, 33 with penetrating, 28 with intraocular foreign body (IOFB), and 1 with perforating injuries] were included. Rupture injuries were common in aged patients and were mostly caused by falls, whereas penetrating and IOFB injuries were common in young male patients. CDVAs of the eyes with rupture injuries were significantly worse than those of the eyes with penetrating or IOFB injuries. CDVA from more than 50 % of the ruptured eyes resulted in no light perception or light perception to 20 / 500. CDVA of the ruptured eyes complicated by crystalline lens ejection was significantly worse than that of those complicated by IOL ejection. The wounds of the ruptured eyes complicated by IOL ejection were mainly located at the <b>superior</b> corneoscleral <b>limbus,</b> whereas those of the eyes complicated by crystalline lens ejection were located at the posterior sclera. There were significant correlations between poor CDVA and retinal detachment and crystalline lens ejection. These results proposed a new trend in the ocular injuries that commonly occur in aged patients; history of cataract surgery might affect the final visual outcome after open-globe ocular injuries...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the form of the pupil in normal human subjects. Using a modified slitlamp, photographs of pupils were taken in steady illumination and 10 – 20 sec after darkness. Transparencies were projected and digitized, and the pupil margin was represented as a circular Fourier series. Best-fit ellipses were also determined. The placement of the pupil relative to the limbus was determined in a number of subjects. Results from 23 subjects indicated that in both darkness and light, average pupil noncircularity was 0. 0166. (A value of 0. 0200 is easy to detect with the unaided eye from the photographs.) On average, the best-fit ellipse accounted for about half of the noncircularity (59. 6 % in darkness; 47. 7 % in light). Most of the contribution to shape was made by the first 4 or 5 harmonics. Shapes were usually stable within a session and could remain fairly stable for at least a year; however, shapes for different subjects were not very similar, especially in the light. (Average pairwise similarity: 0. 106 in darkness; 0. 034 in light; similarity can have values from − 1 to 1.) For a given subject, shapes in light and dark were often failry similar (average similarity 0. 260), but there were systematic differences: in eyes where the ellipse contributed > 20 % of noncircularity, ellipse major axes clustered around vertical in darkness, and horizontal in light, implying greater contraction near the vertical meridian. Even pupils with little elliptical contribution turned out to contract more near the vertical meridian. There was some tendency for left and right eyes of an individual to show mirror symmetry of shape. In the dark, pupils were located 0. 27 ± 0. 09 mm nasal and 0. 20 ± 0. 15 mm <b>superior</b> to the <b>limbus</b> center, and usually moved slightly further nasal or superior in the light. Noncircularity increased with age (0. 0015 /decade). It was concluded that pupils show individuality of shape, with significant regularities within and across subjects...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} considered {{that the development of}} secundum atrial septal defect (ASDII) or oval fossa defect is the result of excessive resorption of the embryological atrial septum primum, but this does not seem to explain all defects.

In 86 % of the specimens, the defects were the result of a malformation of the valvula foraminis ovalis or embryological atrial septum primum, and in 14 % an absent <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> (septum secundum) was the cause of the interatrial communication. The "septum primum" ASDs were divided into four subgroups based on the degree of deficiency of the septum primum and position of the ostium secundum within the septum primum.

Patients and methods: A prospective comparative randomized single-center study enrolled 110 patients with bilateral congenital ptosis. One group (n= 55) underwent AFLS and the second group (n= 55) underwent GTS. Exclusion criteria were good levator function, absent Bell’s phenomenon, and abnormal ocular motility. Follow-up period was 2 years. Functional outcome was measured from digital photos by analysis of upper eyelid margin position relative to the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> and classified as very good ( 5 mm), and recurrent. Aesthetic outcome was assessed in terms of lid contour, symmetry of eyelid height, and lid crease presence. Complications were also reported. Results: Failure rate (recurrence and complications) was less in AFLS (P= 0. 035). Symmetrical lid height and good contour were more frequently attained by AFLS (P= 0. 007 and 0. 047, respectively). However, the frequency of very good, good, poor, recurrence, lagopthalmos, ectropion, infection, and formed lid crease individually showed {{no statistically significant difference}} (P= 0. 252, 0. 482, 1, 0. 489, 0. 438, 1, 0. 618, and 0. 506, respectively).

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the clinical and genetic {{characteristics of a}} Japanese family in which one member exhibited Bietti’s crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy (BCD). Methods: Using direct sequencing, mutation screening was performed in the CYP 4 V 2 gene of both the patient with BCD and her daughter. Ophthalmic examinations were performed to determine the clinical features of both subjects. Results: The 64 -year-old female patient had a bilateral visual acuity of 0. 4. Slit lamp examination revealed bilateral crystalline-like deposits at the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> of the cornea. Fundus examination revealed there was chorioretinal atrophy along with numerous glistening yellowish-white crystalline deposits that were scattered throughout the posterior pole and the mid-peripheral retina. Standard flash electroretinography showed an extinguished electroretinogram and Goldmann kinetic perimetry detected a relative scotoma. Genetic analysis revealed that the patient had a heterozygous mutation in the CYP 4 V 2 gene (IVS 6 – 8 delTCATACAGGTCATCGCG/GC), {{which is the most}} commonly found mutation in Japanese patients with BCD. Furthermore, the patient was also shown to have a novel heterozygous point mutation in exon 9 of the CYP 4 V 2 gene (c. 1168 C>T). In contrast, her daughter exhibited no clinical findings for BCD even though she carried the same heterozygous mutation in the CYP 4 V 2 gene (c. 1168 C>T). Conclusion: A novel compound heterozygous mutation was found in the CYP 4 V 2 gene of a patient with BCD. This previously unreported c. 1168 C>T mutation causes a missense mutation (p.

He underwent trabeculectomy with an adjunctive agent (mitomycin C; concentration, 0. 2  mg/mL) smoothly on the right eye. After the removal of releasable sutures, the filtering bleb was prominent over the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> for 3 consecutive clock hours with an IOP of about 4 – 5  mmHg. The Seidel test result was negative, and the anterior chamber depth was moderate to deep. The BCVA of the right eye decreased to 20 / 100, and optical coherence tomography revealed macular edema. We injected sodium hyaluronate (Healon, Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA, USA) into the anterior chamber 2 months after the operation, and repeated the same procedure 4 days later. After each injection, the IOP spiked up to 50  mmHg, and an intravenous infusion of mannitol was required. Sodium hyaluronate was found migrating into the bleb on post-injection day 1.

40|$|SUMMARY Forty {{patients}} {{subjected to}} extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in whom a sphincterotomy was required are reported on. This method {{was used to}} counter the problems created by a small pupil during surgery. The technique is described and results evaluated. Extracapsular cataract surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation has gained widespread popularity over the last 10 years. How-ever, there is reluctance to perform this procedure in eyes known to have poor dilatation of the pupil {{because of the potential}} for increased surgical prob-lems. We describe techniques using a peripheral iridectomy extended to form a sphincterotomy, designed to overcome the technical difficulties. We evaluate the results of 40 operations and review the literature. Material and methods We tried to dilate the pupils preoperatively with 2 drops of phenylephrine 10 % and 4 drops of cyclo-pentolate 1 % at 10 -minute intervals starting one hour before surgery. Eleven patients received general and 29 local anaesthesia. The latter consisted of a retro-bulbar injection of a mixture of 2 ml 2 % lignocaine and 2 ml 0 - 5 % bupivacaine with 1 / 200 000 adrenaline in which was dissolved 1500 IU hyaluronidase, followed by 10 minutes of gentle manual bulbar compression. A Pierse wire speculum was inserted. A superior rectus fixation was used only when exposure of the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> was inadequate. A reverse slope corneal section down to Descemet's membrane was made from 10 to 2 o'clock at the apex of the limbal arcade of vessels with a diamond knife, skirting anterior to any drainage bleb present.

For 30 days, the left eye of each animal received one drop of eye solution with the fixed combination of timolol 0.5 % associated {{with one of the}} following prostaglandin analogues at 5 pm: group 1 received bimatoprost 0.03 %; group 2, travoprost 0.004 %; group 3, latanoprost 0.005 %. The right eyes served as controls and received no medication. The assessment was conducted within 30 days, as in previous studies, and observed changes in the conjunctiva and the use of immunohistochemistry showed higher accuracy and evaluated data very early. After 30 days, all rabbits were euthanized, and subsequent bilateral enucleation was performed. The eyes were immediately treated with 10 % formaldehyde for 24 h. The <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> was marked before processing because we tried to assess the location of a possible filtering surgery and to compare similar areas in two eyes; because there may be a change according to the location, there should be less depot medications, nasal and temporal greatest environmental exposure and keratinization. Next, eyes were sectioned and passed through pattern processing dehydration with increasing degrees of alcohol, up to 90 % absolute alcohol, and subsequent clarification with xylene, embedded in paraffin [17]. Microtome was used for sectioning the paraffin block stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and sustained immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the following label: anti-actin (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA, USA; dilution 1 : 10) blades. Specimens stained with HE, PAS and anti-actin were photographed under × 400 magnification and analysed with the Image-Pro Plus 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Points of each blade were chosen, corresponding to a conjunctival flap closest to the limbus. Each image, including the epithelium and lamina propria, was virtually barred (150 × 200 mm), and the three subfields closer to the epithelium were then evaluated to enable a more specific analysis of the subepithelial region of the conjunctiva, and not of its lamina propria in each slide.|$|E

Ma te ri al and Met hod: One-year follow-up results of five unilateral LSCD {{patients who had}} undergone CLEC transplantation were evaluated. Parameters for this evaluation were: fluorescein staining of ocular surface, corneal vascularization and status of epithelium with slit lamp, and visual acuity. 1. 5 -mm limbal biopsy was performed from the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> of the healthy eyes, broke into two equal pieces, expanded on human amniotic membrane (hAM) and inserts for 14 days until getting 20 mm in size. CLECs on hAMs were used directly, and cells on inserts were usedafter detachment procedure. The symblepharon and pannus tissues were removed, superficial keratectomy was performed. CLEC on hAMs were transplanted with the epithelial side up onto the bare corneal stroma, sutured to the conjunctiva with 10 - 0 nylon sutures. Free CLEC layer from insert was placed on hAM as a second layer, additional hAM {{was used as a}} protective layer all over other tissues. Re sults: Median age was 44. 4 years (14 - 71). The etiology was chemical burn in all patients. Median duration of symptoms was 10 years (2 - 18), median follow-up period was 12. 6 (12 - 12. 5) months. Preoperative best corrected visual acuities (BCVA) were light perception in three patients, counting fingers at 50 cm in one patient and 3 / 10 in one patient. Visions were improved in all patients. Postoperative BCVA 12 months after the surgery were between counting fingers at 3 meters to 6 / 10.

40|$|Abstract Both in {{the closed}} and open eye state the <b>superior</b> <b>limbus</b> {{is covered by}} the upper lid. This region is of {{physiological}} interest and clinical importance because in chronic hypoxia, neovascularization of the cornea commonly occurs here. The limbal region in general is additionally of importance as the stem cells which {{are the source of}} the new corneal cells are located in the epithelium of the limbus and these are vital for normal functioning and are affected under certain adverse conditions. Purpose: In this experiment I examined corneal morphology in the limbal area and in particular under the upper lid in order to primarily examine the variation in the corneal limbal epithelial and total thickness as well as epithelial and endothelial cell density. Methods: I measured 30 eyes OD/OS (chosen randomly) of thirty healthy subjects aged from 18 to 55 years in the first study and twelve participants in the second study, with refractive error ≤ ± 4 D and astigmatism ≤ 2 D. The thickness and cell density of five positions: superior, inferior, temporal, nasal limbal and central cornea was determined with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy. At least three scans of each position were taken in both studies with OCT. At least 40 of 100 adjacent sagittal scans of each image were measured using OCT software program. In the confocal study, image J software was used to determine cell densities. Results: The epithelial and corneal limbal thickness were significantly thicker than the epithelial and central corneal thickness (p< 0. 05). The limbal, inferior cornea is thinner than the three other positions and the temporal region of the cornea is the thickest both in epithelial and total cornea. Epithelial cell density was significantly lower in the superior cornea than the four other positions. There {{was no significant difference in}} the endothelial cell density. Conclusions: Using OCT with high resolution and cross-sectional imaging capability and confocal microscope with high magnification, I found that the limbal cornea is significantly thicker than the central cornea both in total and in epithelial thickness. In the limbus, one might expect the superior cornea (under the lid) to be thickest (because of the expected hypoxia) whereas I found the temporal cornea was thickest. The epithelial cell density was lower in the superior cornea but there was no significant difference in cell densities in the endothelium. Further morphological investigation is of interest...|$|E
