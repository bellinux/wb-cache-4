5|$|Following the Civil War, {{minstrel}} <b>shows</b> {{became the}} first distinctively American form of music expression.

Minstrel <b>shows</b> used African American elements in musical performances, but only in simplified ways; storylines in the <b>shows</b> depicted blacks as natural-born slaves and fools, before eventually becoming associated with abolitionism. The minstrel show was invented by Daniel Decatur Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels. Minstrel <b>shows</b> produced the first well-remembered popular songwriters in American music history: Thomas D. Rice, Daniel Decatur Emmett, and, most famously, Stephen Foster. After minstrel shows' popularity faded, coon songs, a similar phenomenon, became popular.|$|E
