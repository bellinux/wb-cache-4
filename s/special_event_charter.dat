40|$|Shopping centre {{managers}} {{often use}} <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment to create emotionally-based experiences for their patrons and, in turn, to entice them {{to engage in}} positive behaviours (e. g. longer duration of stay, more spending, willingness to spread positive word-of-mouth to others and repatronage intention). <b>Special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment refers to the range of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> convened by a shopping centre on a seasonal, temporary and intermittent basis. Moreover, <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment is also typically offered free of charge to consumers. Due to these unique characteristics, the consumption experience of <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment is deemed as low (enduring) involvement in nature. Popular examples of <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment include school holiday events, fashion events, celebrity appearances, and market days. Despite the common use of <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment by shopping centre managers, little research in experiential consumption literature has paid attention to consumers’ experiences with <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment convened by shopping centres. Consequently, we have scant knowledge of what factors are important in explaining consumers’ experiences with these entertainment events staged by shopping centres. The acquirement of this knowledge can facilitate shopping centre managers in planning, communicating and executing their marketing strategies of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> and, in turn, in fostering shoppers’ approach behaviours. For this reason, this research program attempts to fill this knowledge gap relating to consumers’ experiences with <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment in the existing experiential consumption literature. In particular, this research program seeks to determine: i) the key factors {{that are important in}} explaining shoppers’ experiences with <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment; and ii) the relationships between these key factors in explaining shoppers’ experiences with <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment. The first stage of this research program involved a review of experiential consumption literature, especially, in the domains of shopping centre consumption and event consumption. This research stage aimed to identify possible factors that are meaningful in illuminating consumers’ experiences with <b>special</b> <b>event</b> entertainment, and to develop a preliminary model that illustrates the relationships between these factors. The second stage involved a qualitative study, which was conducted to explore the relevance of and the relationships between the theoretical factors identified from the first stage. The third and final stage comprised mall intercept survey with shopping centre patrons during the occurrence of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> at shopping centres. This stage sought to collect real-time, empirical data to test the validity and reliability of the theoretical factors and the conceptual model hypothesised in stage one. This research program makes several contributions. It provides an extension to experiential consumption literature that has somewhat neglected consumers’ experiences with low (enduring) involvement, seasonal and intermittent <b>special</b> <b>events</b> convened by retail institutions such as shopping centres. It identifies a set of cognitive, emotional, behavioural and personal factors that are meaningful in explaining shoppers’ experiences with the <b>special</b> <b>events</b> convened by shopping centres. In terms of marketing practice, this study employs a ‘real-time’, as opposed to a retrospective, data collection approach when measuring shoppers’ experiences with the <b>special</b> <b>events</b> convened by shopping centres. Studies on experiential consumption in the event literature have predominantly relied on a retrospective data collection approach, which often ask attendees or participants to recall and record their experiences in mail survey. This research program seeks {{to bridge the gap between}} theory and practice by developing a theoretical model that aims to help retail operators (e. g. shopping centre managers) to understand the strategic roles of <b>special</b> <b>events,</b> especially in creating entertaining and enjoyable experiences for patrons and stimulating approach behaviours (e. g. increased duration of stay andspending) ...|$|R

40|$|Art {{galleries}} {{have traditionally}} been seen as entertainment venues aimed at the elite. In an attempt to alter this perception, galleries are shifting their focus to become more responsive to visitor needs. Contemporary policies explicitly pursue more equal access and participation, and new strategies are being developed to make galleries more appealing to people who would not usually visit them. One such visitor-focused strategy that is increasingly being utilised is the staging of <b>special</b> <b>events.</b> <b>Special</b> <b>events</b> enable galleries to inspire and attract new visitors, as well as respond to changing visitor needs and expectations. With {{the increased use of}} <b>special</b> <b>events</b> however, it is important that galleries develop an awareness of how their visitors understand and respond to such events. To explore this issue, this study investigates visitors’ perceptions of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> in galleries and their motivations to attend such events. A qualitative approach is taken to facilitate the ability to illustrate, in visitors’ own words, the contemporary perceptions of, and motivations for attending <b>special</b> <b>events</b> at galleries. Intensive interviews and focus group interviews were conducted with visitors attending two different <b>special</b> <b>events</b> at two different galleries: The Nature Machine Summer Children’s Festival, a week long festival at the Queensland Art Gallery; and International Women’s Day at the National Gallery, an afternoon of fundraising lectures at the National Gallery of Australia. From the interviews, a set of categories were developed that represent the main motivations visitors have for attending <b>special</b> <b>events</b> at galleries. A set of categories were also developed to represent the perceptions visitors have of what defines a <b>special</b> <b>event</b> at a gallery, and how <b>special</b> <b>events</b> differ from a gallery’s day-to-day program. These findings are important because they can help galleries more fully understand both their visitors and their programs. This therefore enables the development of more relevant events, programs, marketing campaigns and audience-development strategies. By exploring visitor perceptions, this study augments the understanding of how the <b>special</b> <b>events</b> at galleries are changing people’s perceptions of galleries. The research into motivation is subsequently essential for understanding the attributes of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> that are important to stimulating visitation...|$|R

This paper presents findings from a systemati c literature review {{on the impact}} of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> to promote breast, cervical or colorectal cancer education and screening. Methods. Articles in English that focused on <b>special</b> <b>events</b> involving breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer conducted in the U. S. and published between January 1990 and December 2011 were identified from seven databases: Ovid, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstract, Cochrane Libraries, and EconLit. Study inclusion and data extraction were independently validated by two researchers. Results: Of the 20 articles selected for screening out of 1, 409, ten articles on <b>special</b> <b>events</b> reported outcome data. Five types of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> were found: health fairs, parties, cultural <b>events,</b> <b>special</b> days, and plays. Many focused on breast cancer only, or in combination with other cancers. Reach ranged from 50 - 1732 participants. All <b>special</b> <b>events</b> used at least one evidence-based strategy suggested by the Community Guide to Preventive Services, such as small media, one-on-one education, and reducing structural barriers. For cancer screening as an outcome of the events, mammography screening rates ranged from 4. 8 % to 88 %, Pap testing was 3. 9 %, and clinical breast exams ranged from 9. 1 % to 100 %. For colorectal screening, FOBT ranged from 29. 4 % to 76 %, and sigmoidoscopy was 100 % at one event. Outcome measures included intentions to get screened, scheduled appointments, uptake of clinical exams, and participation in cancer screening. Conclusions: <b>Special</b> <b>events</b> found in the review varied and used evidence-based strategies. Screening data suggest that some <b>special</b> <b>events</b> can lead to increases in cancer screening, especially if they provide onsite screening services. However, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that <b>special</b> <b>events</b> are effective in increasing cancer screening. The heterogeneity of populations served, event activities, outcome variables assessed, and the reliance on self-report to measure screening limit conclusions. This study highlights the need for further research to determine the effectiveness of <b>special</b> <b>events</b> to increase cancer screening. © 2014 Escoffery et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
