He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together means we can make a huge difference.

25|$|Under some circumstances, {{perturbation}} theory is an invalid approach to take. This {{happens when the}} <b>system</b> <b>we</b> wish to describe cannot be described by a small perturbation imposed on some simple system. In quantum chromodynamics, for instance, the interaction of quarks with the gluon field cannot be treated perturbatively at low energies because the coupling constant (the expansion parameter) becomes too large.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get an {{estimate}} of the critical speed, we use the fact that the condition for which this kinematic solution is valid corresponds to the case where there is no net energy exchange with the surroundings, so by considering the kinetic and potential energy of the <b>system,</b> <b>we</b> should be able to derive the critical speed.|$|E

25|$|In {{three-dimensional}} space, if one coordinate is {{held constant}} {{and the other}} two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a coordinate surface. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding ρ constant in the spherical coordinate system are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate <b>system</b> <b>we</b> may speak of coordinate planes.|$|E

25|$|Dispersivity is {{actually}} a factor which represents our lack {{of information about the}} <b>system</b> <b>we</b> are simulating. There are many small details about the aquifer which are being averaged when using a macroscopic approach (e.g., tiny beds of gravel and clay in sand aquifers), they manifest themselves as an apparent dispersivity. Because of this, α is often claimed to be dependent on the length scale of the problem — the dispersivity found for transport through 1m3 of aquifer is different from that for transport through 1cm3 of the same aquifer material.|$|E
40|$|Artifact {{systems are}} a novel {{paradigm}} for implementing service oriented computing. Business artifacts include both data and process descriptions at interface level thereby providing {{more sophisticated and}} powerful service inter-operation capabilities. In this paper we put forward a technique for the practical verification of business artifacts {{in the context of}} multi-agent <b>systems.</b> <b>We</b> extend GSM, a modelling language for artifact systems, to multi-agent systems and map it into a variant of AC-MAS, a semantics for reasoning about artifact <b>systems.</b> <b>We</b> introduce a symbolic model checker for verifying GSM-based multi-agent <b>systems.</b> <b>We</b> evaluate the tool on a scenario from the service community. ...|$|R

Mian has two candidate classification systems, differing completely in their formal realization but overlapping considerably in their semantics. To determine whether to analyse Mian as a single system or concurrent <b>systems</b> <b>we</b> adopt a canonical approach. Our criteria – orthogonality of the <b>systems</b> (<b>we</b> give a precise measure), semantic compositionality, morphosyntactic alignment, distribution across parts of speech, exponence and interaction with other features – point mainly to an analysis as concurrent <b>systems.</b> <b>We</b> thus improve our analysis of Mian and make progress with the typology of nominal classification...|$|R
40|$|Semiconstrained {{systems were}} {{recently}} suggested as a generalization of constrained systems, {{commonly used in}} communication and data-storage applications that require certain offending subsequences be avoided. In an attempt to apply techniques from constrained <b>systems,</b> <b>we</b> study sequences of constrained systems that are contained in, or contain, a given semiconstrained system, while approaching its capacity. In the case of contained <b>systems</b> <b>we</b> describe to such sequences resulting in constant-to-constant bit-rate block encoders and sliding-block encoders. Surprisingly, {{in the case of}} containing <b>systems</b> <b>we</b> show that a "generic" semiconstrained system is never contained in a proper fully-constrained system. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
