25|$|Criticism {{has also}} been {{directed}} at the 1981 change of policy that directed that persons who disassociate from (formally leave) the group were {{to be treated as}} though they were disfellowshipped. Holden <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a result, those who do leave are seldom allowed a dignified exit. Heather and Gary Botting claim inactive Witnesses are often pressured to either become active or to disassociate themselves by declaring they no longer accept key Watch Tower Society doctrines.|$|E
25|$|The Beowulf poet <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a consequence, without {{naming the}} antecedents, Finn {{and all the}} Frisians were slaughtered. Most likely the antecedents are both of the actions {{described}} above, that Hengest and a returning faction of Danes banded together in force to slaughter Finn and the remnants of his forces, avenge Hnæf, pillage Finnsburg, {{and return to the}} Danish people with Hildeburh. This is usually understood to mean that Hengest had been brooding over whether fealty or oaths were strongest, and that he and the Danes broke the terms of the peace treaty, though Zocco argues otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Pueri delicati {{might be}} {{idealized}} in poetry. In the erotic elegies of Tibullus, the delicatus Marathus wears lavish and expensive clothing. The {{beauty of the}} delicatus was measured by Apollonian standards, especially in regard to his long hair, {{which was supposed to}} be wavy, fair, and scented with perfume. The mythological type of the delicatus was represented by Ganymede, the Trojan youth abducted by Jove (Greek Zeus) to be his divine companion and cupbearer. In the Satyricon, the tastelessly wealthy freedman Trimalchio <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a child-slave he had been a puer delicatus servicing both the master and the mistress of the household.|$|E

25|$|Ulrich Nieß <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a {{consequence}} of the appearance of Teutonic Order forces in the castle, the Brandenburgers left, and soon left also the initial Pomerelian and Kuyavian garrison of the castle after a dispute with the Teutonic Knights. The town, though still preferring Brandenburg rule, offered asylum to the garrison, and in relying on its Lübeck law charter refused to allow the Teutonic Knights to enter and to follow an order to lay down its fortifications. On 13 November, the order's forces with personal involvement of Plotzke forced their way into the town, though no larger battle took place. The order then held a tribunal in the town and ordered large-scale demolishments of its buildings.|$|E
25|$|A devil of the Gremory clan, one of {{the highest-ranking}} devil families, Rias {{initially}} saves Issei after he was attacked by a fallen angel, Raynare. Issei wakes up the next morning, thinking that the events that occurred were all just a dream, but then notices Rias naked in his room. Rias reveals to Issei her true identity as a devil and <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of his}} death at the hands of Raynare, she has reincarnated him as a devil, becoming his new master in the process. Rias is the head of Kuoh Academy's Occult Research school club, where Issei, Rias, and the club members interact with various groups and organizations, some of which are run by devils who compete against them in sanctioned combat matches called Rating Games, where the characters have been assigned positions akin to chess pieces.|$|E
25|$|Polovtsian maidens sing {{comparing}} love to {{a flower}} that droops {{in the heat}} of the day and is revived by night. They dance together (Dance of the Polovtsian Maidens). Konchakovna joins in the singing hoping that her own lover will join her soon (Konchakovna's Cavatina). The Russian prisoners arrive from their day's work and express their gratitude when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day is fading (Vladimir's Cavatina). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (Love Duet). While her father will consent to the marriage, they know that his will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (Prince Igor's Aria). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes for the chance to regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (Konchak's Aria) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows what it is to be a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (Polovtsian Dances).|$|E

500|$|The marriages were ordained by the Providers {{because the}} zones had stagnated {{and the birth}} rate of both humans and animals had fallen. Author Thelma J.

But after a push in the right direction, the individual triumphs: Al•Ith and Ben Ata initiate changes in both their own and their neighbouring zones.|$|E
500|$|Today Glastonbury Abbey {{presents}} itself as [...] "traditionally the oldest above-ground Christian {{church in the}} world," [...] which according to the legend was built at Joseph's behest to house the Holy Grail, 65 or so years {{after the death of}} Jesus. The legend also <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a child, Jesus had visited Glastonbury along with Joseph. The legend probably was encouraged during the medieval period when religious relics and pilgrimages were profitable business for abbeys. William Blake mentioned the legend in a poem that became a popular hymn, [...] "Jerusalem" [...] (see And did those feet in ancient time).|$|E

500|$|Sarcosphaera coronaria has no {{distinctive}} taste or odor, {{although one}} source <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> it gets older the odor becomes [...] "reminiscent of rhubarb". Although older literature {{describes it as}} a good edible species, modern literature does not recommended it for consumption. It gives some individuals gastrointestinal discomfort, reputedly similar to poisoning symptoms caused by morels. A number of poisonings attributed to this species have been reported from Europe, including one fatal poisoning in the Jura area in 1920, following which a warning was issued not to eat it raw or in salads. Although the fruit bodies are edible after cooking, they are rarely collected by mushroom pickers, and have no commercial value.|$|E
500|$|Continuing the Bad Wolf story {{arc of the}} series, {{the nuclear}} power station is named [...] "Blaidd Drwg", which means [...] "bad wolf" [...] in the Welsh language. This was the first {{reference}} to be explicitly addressed by the Doctor and Rose. The Rift was established earlier in the series in [...] "The Unquiet Dead", and the Doctor refuels there again in [...] "Utopia" [...] (2007). The place where the TARDIS lands in Roald Dahl Plass develops unusual properties, {{as seen in the}} spin-off series Torchwood. Rose mentions that she and the Doctor have been to Justicia, which is the star system that they visit in the New Series Adventures novel The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole. Blaine <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a child she was threatened with being fed to venom grubs; these creatures appeared in the First Doctor serial The Web Planet (1965).|$|E
500|$|At {{national}} {{level in the}} UK, Mosley competed in over 40 races in 1966 and 1967; he won 12 and set several class lap records. In 1968, he formed the London Racing Team in partnership with driver Chris Lambert to compete in European Formula Two, which {{at that time was}} the level of racing just below Formula One. Their cars were prepared by Frank Williams, later a Formula One team owner. It was a dangerous time to race. Mosley's first Formula Two race was the 1968 Deutschland Trophäe, at Hockenheim in which double world champion Jim Clark was killed, and within two years both of Mosley's 1968 team mates, Piers Courage and Chris Lambert were dead in racing accidents. Mosley's best result that year was an eighth place at a non-championship race at Monza. Engine builder Brian Hart <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a driver, Mosley [...] "might not have been particularly quick, but he was a thinking driver. He kept out of trouble and generally used his head." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Æsir exclaimed {{that they}} were ready, Fenrir shook himself, knocked the fetter to the ground, {{strained}} hard, and kicking with his feet, snapped the fetter – breaking it into pieces that flew far into the distance. High <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> a result, to [...] "loose from Leyding" [...] or to [...] "strike out of Dromi" [...] have become sayings for when something is achieved with great effort. The Æsir started to fear {{that they would not}} be able to bind Fenrir, and so Odin sent Freyr's messenger Skírnir down into the land of Svartálfaheimr to [...] "some dwarfs" [...] and had them make a fetter called Gleipnir. The dwarves constructed Gleipnir from six mythical ingredients. After an exchange between Gangleri and High, High continues that the fetter was smooth and soft as a silken ribbon, yet strong and firm. The messenger brought the ribbon to the Æsir, and they thanked him heartily for completing the task.|$|E
500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could he know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E
