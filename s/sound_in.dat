5|$|The {{speed of}} <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> helium is {{nearly three times}} the speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity {{is proportional to the}} speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
