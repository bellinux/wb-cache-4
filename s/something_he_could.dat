5|$|Hastings {{settled in}} Benicia, California. In September 1849, {{he served as}} Prosecuting Attorney for the newly {{established}} court in Alameda County. A few months later, California legislature selected {{him to be the}} first Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court. He started his term on December 20, 1849, but the court did not assemble until March 4, 1850. In 1851, his family moved from Iowa to live with him in California. During his term as Chief Justice he ran for the office of Attorney General of California. Elections were held on September 3, 1851, and he won with 52.2% of the votes. The Whig candidate, William D. Fair, received the rest of the votes. His term as Chief Justice ended in December 1851, and he assumed office as Attorney General on January 5, 1852. While serving as Attorney General, he could practice law as well, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not do as Chief Justice. The wealth he earned during this time became the foundation of the larger fortune he would later earn in real estate. He ended his two-year term on January 2, 1854.|$|E
25|$|Oliver Twist is an {{adaptation}} of Dickens's classic, written by The Pianists Ronald Harwood and shot in Prague. Polanski said in interviews that he made the film as <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> show his children, and that {{the life of the}} young scavenger mirrored his own life, fending for himself in World War II Poland.|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{noted that}} the episode [...] "was a really good show for me, because I had not {{got a chance to}} work with Mitch. And they wrote a great script, you know? It was really <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> sink his teeth into and he just did a great job. Bill Davis was fabulous in that show too". This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last {{appearance}} in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in [...] "Piper Maru", [...] "Avatar", [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori".|$|E

6000|$|Miss Price {{gathered}} up her things slowly. Philip waited behind after {{the others to}} say to her <b>something</b> consolatory. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> think of nothing but: ...|$|R
60|$|Compton {{was looking}} through the papers and letters on his desk, evidently searching for <b>something</b> which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not find, while the girl sat {{waiting for him to}} {{continue}} his dictation.|$|R
500|$|The notice {{caught the}} {{attention}} of Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman, who according to journalist and former Arsenal player Bernard Joy wanted to manage a London club: [...] "Arsenal appealed to him because it was a struggling club, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> work on and make a power in the land." [...] He joined Arsenal in June 1925, and laid the foundations for the club's first period of success. Considered the [...] "great innovator" [...] of English football, Chapman introduced numbered shirts, advocated floodlights at Highbury and successfully campaigned for Gillespie Road station to be renamed to Arsenal on the London Underground. He also introduced new training techniques and tactics, adopting a [...] "WM" [...] formation in order to counter a change in the offside law.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome to the Occupation" [...] {{is about}} a teacher limited with his career who strives to be an artist. Willett was {{inspired}} by his job as an English high school teacher in Torrance to write the song, saying that it didn't give him [...] "a lot of creative space to really be very inspired to be a teacher." [...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] {{is about a}} woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away. The tracks [...] "Avalanche in B" [...] and [...] "I've Seen Enough" [...] were originally conceived by the band as one-long track but instead cut into two songs. The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when it is coming straight towards you. The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session. [...] "Every Man I Fall For" [...] is about a woman's perspective on relationships. Inspired by his own mother's relationship with men, Willett saw <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> craft from that emotion, saying that it stuck with him as having importance [...] "because it was something I always saw in relationships; like my mom being a single mother and seeing how men treat these women and how they operate in relationships." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can imagine}} that in the {{confusion}} of flight something precious, <b>something</b> which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not bear to part with, had been left behind. That would explain his persistence, would it not?" ...|$|R
60|$|Stanley nodded. In truth, <b>he</b> {{had noticed}} <b>something,</b> though what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have said.|$|R
60|$|Pritchard {{stared at}} him. There was {{something}} amazing about this young man's attitude, <b>something</b> which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not wholly grasp. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see, too, that Tavernake's words were so few {{simply because he}} was trembling {{under the influence of}} an immense passion.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{his service}} in the Wu government, Shi Yi had never made any mistake before. When Lü Yi, the {{supervisor}} of the audit bureau, was looking for flaws in officials' work {{so that he could}} maliciously make a case and accuse them of <b>something,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find at least four problems with the work of every official he accused. However, when it came to Shi Yi's work, he could not find a single flaw. Sun Quan also once sighed, [...] "If everyone were like Shi Yi, would there still be a need for laws, rules and regulations?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{director}} {{wanted to}} make an independent film and collaborate with people who could work fast, like cinematographer Robby Müller and his handpicked crew who were non-union members. Friedkin shot everything on location and worked quickly, often using the first take to {{give a sense of}} immediacy. He did not like to rehearse but would create situations where the actors thought they were rehearsing a scene when actually they were shooting a take. Friedkin did this just in case he got <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use. To this end, he let scenes play out and allowed the actors to stay in character and improvise. For example, during the scene where Chance visits Ruthie at the bar where she works, Friedkin allowed Petersen and actress Darlanne Fleugel to devise their own blocking and told Müller, [...] "Just shoot them. Try and keep them in the frame. If they're not in the frame, they're not in the movie. That's their problem".|$|E
2500|$|Durant {{and one of}} his men- Skip (who has a false left leg)- {{intercept}} Julie, kidnapping her as {{the prelude}} to his attack on Westlake's lair. Two of his men, Guzman and Smiley, then enter the lab to locate and kill him, only to be outmaneuvered and eliminated. Durant fires upon him from a helicopter, as Westlake dangles from a cable attached to the aircraft, until he succeeds in causing the helicopter to crash. He impersonates Durant when he meets up with Strack and a captive Julie as Strack plans to make [...] "one less attorney." [...] Westlake's ruse is broken by Strack, who fights him 650 feet above ground. When Westlake gets the upper hand, Strack calls his bluff, saying that killing him would not be <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> live with. Westlake drops Strack, remarking: [...] "I'm learning to live with a lot of things." [...] Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, but he tells her he has changed on the inside as well, and can not subject anyone to his new vicious nature. In the final scene, he runs from Julie as they exit an elevator, and is seen from behind pulling on a mask which, when he turns around, reveals the face of Bruce Campbell. During this scene, Westlake can be heard off-screen: [...] "...I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me... Darkman." ...|$|E
60|$|Chauvelin {{looked on}} in silence, vaguely stirred by <b>something</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not define, <b>something</b> that right through his triumphant satisfaction, his hatred and final {{certainty}} of revenge, had roused {{in him a}} sense almost of admiration.|$|R
60|$|And {{what did}} St. John see? Something beyond even an apostle's understanding. <b>Something</b> which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only see himself dimly, and {{describe}} {{to us in}} figures and pictures, as it were, to help us to imagine that great wonder.|$|R
6000|$|Their {{heads were}} close together, their fingers often met; {{he would have}} liked to say <b>something,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only add: [...] "Are you sure you will feel quite safe? It is a little steeper as we near the bank." ...|$|R
2500|$|The family {{returned}} to Rosa Rushmore's hometown of Mexico, Missouri sometime during 1925–26, where they settled temporarily at her nearby family's house. Clifford Rushmore found {{work as a}} brickyard worker but the family was hit hard economically by the Great Depression, which started Rushmore's lifelong interest in politics. Rushmore grew up in poverty in Mexico, where the family would be constantly moving from house to house. A defeated man, Clifford Rushmore was apolitical, but his wife was an optimistic Democrat and strong supporter of President Franklin Roosevelt, which influenced her son's early political outlook. In appearance, Rushmore was usually described as an gangly, 6'5" [...] teenager. Political columnist and friend George Sokolsky would later describe Rushmore as [...] "at heart a hillbilly, proud of his colonial ancestry ... he himself was an enormous disappointment to himself ... a sad mountain boy, morose, looking for <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never find." [...] As {{a result of his}} appearance and manner, he was held in ridicule by his peers in high school. The social pariah wanted to make his mark as a progressive journalist and at the age of 16 wrote for two newspapers—the Mexico High School Yellow Yap and The Mexico Ledger. During his junior year of high school, he was expelled for publishing several exposés in the Ledger that the school administration regarded as defamatory about themselves and the teaching staff. His parents then enrolled him in St. Brendan's Catholic School, despite the family being Methodists. There Rushmore was even further ostracized, resulting in his quitting school. Thus began a pattern of behavior that would repeat itself to the end of Rushmore's life.|$|E
60|$|A mist {{seemed to}} roll away from before Davidson's eyes, {{disclosing}} <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not believe.|$|E
60|$|Harvey {{moved forward}} at once. Here was <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{do for the}} man who had saved his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he had {{a little}} grub to go on with, he might catch a trout in the {{shallows}} or snare <b>something</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> eat. Then he'd either follow us or join his friends and put them on our track. I prefer to have him under our eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|Randal {{drew back}} a step. Mrs. Presty's audacity was <b>something</b> more than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> understand. [...] "Is this woman mad?" [...] {{he said to}} himself.|$|R
5000|$|Former {{chairman}} of Joint Intelligence Committee K.N. Daruwala has said:"His contacts the world over, particularly in Asia—Afghanistan, Iran, China, you name it—were <b>something</b> else. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> move things {{with just one}} phone call. He was a team leader who rode out notorious inter-departmental and inter-service rivalries, which is commonplace in India." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll rescue her,' he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt {{he thought}} of <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to please her. He could take his medicine.|$|E
6000|$|Appleby {{said nothing}} for a few moments, for there was <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not {{understand}} in his comrade’s face Then he said softly, “How did it happen, Tony?” ...|$|E
60|$|The “Greatest Show on Earth” moved {{nearly every}} day. Its course was westward, {{something}} {{which did not}} suit the young gymnast, but which was also <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not help.|$|E
60|$|But, {{though he}} {{dismissed}} the suspicion thus readily, it left <b>something</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not quite define behind it. He had, after {{the manner of}} young men were women are concerned, thought that he understood Mildred thoroughly; now {{he came to the}} modest conclusion that he knew very little about her.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Bernstein, {{a lifelong}} friend, {{recalled}} DeCoursey's explanation for becoming a journalist after being a political insider: [...] "He said being a press secretary {{was all about}} not saying everything you know. And he wanted to switch to <b>something</b> where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tell everything <b>he</b> knew, rather than spinning it as a press secretary would." ...|$|R
60|$|That curious {{constraint}} {{which had}} fallen upon Jimmy {{in the road}} came to him again, now, as sobering as a blow. <b>Something</b> which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not define had changed the atmosphere. Suddenly in an instant, like a shallow stream that runs babbling over the stones into some broad, still pool, the note of their talk had deepened.|$|R
60|$|Mac {{did come}} again, glad to find <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> study {{in spite of}} his weak eyes, and learned much that was of more value than {{anything}} his school had ever taught him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dearest wife, what is {{the matter}} with you?' he cried, {{kneeling}} down beside her, and trying to take her hand; but she snatched it away, and pointing to her cheek murmured <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not catch.|$|E
6000|$|Tomlinson, {{who watched}} her with steady eyes, sat silent {{a moment as}} though ruminating over <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not quite understand. Then he said, [...] "The man has grit. Still, I haven't much use for his notion of going round {{trailing}} out trouble." ...|$|E
60|$|Rocke looked, as he felt, puzzled. He {{honestly}} {{wished to}} be of service to this man, but {{he was at a}} loss to know what further suggestion <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make. There was something impenetrable about his client, <b>something</b> which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not arrive at, behind the hard, grim face and measured words. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not even guess as to what the man's hopes or intentions were. Eventually, although with some reluctance, he took up his hat.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, Lyle, then 19 years old, {{seeing his}} sister Mabel using {{a mix of}} {{petroleum}} jelly and burnt cork to darken her eyelashes, had the idea to create a chemical product to enhance the eyes. His own attempt was not a success but then Lyle commissioned a drug manufacture, and the resulting product was <b>something</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> sell: the Lash-Brow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{would be}} good for <b>something</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be made to work. I long to give him a pickaxe, and set him on upon the roads. Then he would see the beauty of them! I hate to hear him maunder on about imagination, while he leaves his tenantry to take their chance. HE knows what eyes Percy and John see things with!' ...|$|R
