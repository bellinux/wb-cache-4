5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles.

5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> the high {{status of the}} Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, {{the time of the}} setting of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} is proposed to hierarchical <b>symbolic</b> analysis <b>of</b> large analog integrated circuits.

The novelty of the proposed approach is to use an annotated, directed and acyclic graph, called Determinant Decision Diagram (DDD), to represent <b>symbolic</b> determinants <b>of</b> subcircuit matrices and cofactors used in subcircuit suppression, as well as <b>symbolic</b> determinants <b>of</b> the top-level circuit matrix and cofactors required in applying Cramer's rule. DDD enables systematically exploiting the inherent sparsity of circuit matrices and the sharing <b>of</b> <b>symbolic</b> expressions. It is capable of representing a huge number <b>of</b> <b>symbolic</b> product terms in a canonical and highly compact manner. The proposed approach is illustrated using a Cauer parameter low [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms.

Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same.

5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was <b>symbolic</b> <b>of</b> the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E
