40|$|ABSTRACT: Impact {{problems}} {{have recently been}} the subject of intense research. <b>Impact</b> <b>tests</b> have found a great interest by several researchers, and dynamic testing apparatus were developed in different laboratories.

A general mixed finite element formulation (u – w – π) is presented in this paper. This formulation includes the inertia effects and the materials (solid grains and water) are considered compressible. The application of this formulation in solving impact problems of dry sand is made by restricting the boundary conditions concerning the pore fluid, and comparisons are made between laboratory tests conducted at the University of Baghdad in 1989 against elasto-plastic model named ALTERNAT are made herein.

40|$|As {{the use of}} {{advanced}} composite materials continues {{to grow in the}} aviation industry, damage detection techniques need to be developed and <b>tested.</b> <b>Impact</b> damage on aluminum aircraft structures can be detected from obvious surface indications. This is not the case in composite aircraft structure. Large interply delaminations and substructure disbonding may occur {{as a result of an}} impact, often leaving no visual indications of damage. This research investigates the use of conventional hand-deployed ultrasonic (UT) inspection techniques and more advanced UT pulse-echo and resonance scanning techniques to detect and characterize damage in full-scale carbon fiber fuselage structure. It also examines embedded and bonded methods of deploying an in-situ fiber optic (FO) Swept Wavelength Interferometry (SWI) strain sensing system for damage detection. The hypothesis is that the more advanced scanning nondestructive inspection (NDI) techniques used in the study will more effectively detect and characterize damage modes in the fuselage panels than hand-deployed UT techniques. It is further hypothesized that impact damage created by both simulated hail and steel spherical tip impacts will create a permanent, detectable strain change that can be detected by the FO strain measurement system. Two fuselage panels representative of structures seen on advanced composite transport category aircraft were fabricated. They each measured approximately 56 ” x 76 ”. The structural components consisted of a 16 ply skin, co-cured, hat-section stringers, fastened shear ties and frames. The material used to fabricate the panels was T 800 unidirectional, carbon pre-preg and was processed in an autoclave. <b>Simulated</b> hail <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> was conducted on the panels using a high velocity gas gun with 2. 4 ” diameter ice balls. The ice <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in collaboration with the University of California San Diego (UCSD). In addition to the <b>simulated</b> hail <b>impact</b> <b>testing,</b> 2 ” diameter spherical tip steel impacts were conducted to <b>simulate</b> <b>impact</b> damage introduced during heavy ground maintenance operations. The extent of 16 ply skin damage induced on the panels ranged from less than 1 in 2 to 55 in 2 of interply delamination. Substructure damage on the panels included shear tie cracking, delamination of the built-up pad sections behind the fastened shear ties, and stringer-to-flange disbonding. Substructure damage away from the site of high energy ice impacts was often not detected with hand-deployed UT, which can be attributed to failure to inspect far enough away from the impact site. This additional damage was detected using the more advanced scanning techniques. Data collection from the embedded FO was not possible due to light attenuation caused by micro-bending induced in the fiber. It was determined that increasing both the numerical aperture of the FO and the diameter, in combination with adjusting the layout orientation used, may make it possible to measure strain change using this technique. Detectable strain indications were obtained using the backside bonded FO in 15 of the 25 interrogated steel tip impacts. Increasing the robustness of this deployment method could provide a means for in-situ damage detection. Federal Aviation Administration - William J.

The evaluation of finite element modelling includes a comprehensive mesh convergence study using shell elements for representing target plates and the solid element-based representation of ogivalnosed projectiles. A user-friendly automatic contact detection algorithm is used for capturing interaction between the projectile and the target plate. It is shown that the proper choice of mesh density and strain rate-dependent material properties is crucial as these parameters significantly affect the computed residual velocity. The efficacy of correlation with experimental data is adjudged in terms of a 'correlation index' defined in the present study for which values close to unity are desirable.

Thus, {{instead of}} utilizing separate fluid and structural models, a coupled interacting fluid-structures analysis is needed.

Added features include partially non-reflecting inflow/outflow boundary conditions, and parallel algorithms that allow multiple blade rows to be modeled simultaneously on parallel computer architectures. TAM-ALE 3 D predictions of the rotor-generated upstream-traveling potential field within the inlet guide vane (IGV) row of the Purdue Transonic Compressor Facility compare well to experimental data. Fluid-structure interaction is first demonstrated by modeling both the isolated rotor flow field and rotor blade, with the aerodynamic damping on the blades quantified through a <b>simulated</b> <b>impact</b> hammer <b>test.</b> Fluid-structure interaction is further demonstrated in a multi-stage environment by simultaneous modeling of the IGV material and flow field, yielding the stresses within the IGV due to excitation from the downstream rotor potential field.

To assist {{in the understanding of}} this safety test, two-dimensional shock wave gauge techniques were used to measure the pressures of a few kilobars and times of reactions less than a millisecond. This work is in accord with a long-term goal to develop two-dimensional shock diagnostic techniques that are more than just time of arrival indicators. Experiments were performed where explosives were impacted at levels below shock initiation levels but caused low level reactions.

Numerical model has been created with the finite element commercial code ANSYS/LS-DYNA to <b>simulate</b> <b>impact</b> response of composite laminate. Also non-destructive ultrasonic B- and C- scan imagining with USPC  3010 system has been used to identify the deformation regions in the specimens and compare to simulation results. During the <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> all samples were perforated, showing brittle response followed by matrix cracking and delamination. Overall good agreement between experimental and simulation results was achieved, comparing impact characterizing parameters as load, energy and deflection. Discrepancy has been observed between ultrasonic scanning and simulation code ANSYS/LS-DYNA results of rupture and delamination. Simulation shows less uniform and larger deformation than it was experimentally observed. [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{finite element}} based design tool, CODAC, has been {{developed}} for efficiently <b>simulating</b> the <b>impact</b> behavior of sandwich structures consisting of two composite face sheets and a compliant core. To achieve a rapid and accurate stress analysis, three-layered finite shell elements are used. A number of macromechanical damage models are implemented to model damage onset and damage growth. The transient impact analysis is assessed via an experimental <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> program on honeycomb sandwich panels. Force–time histories and damage sizes are examined. The influence of distinct damage and degradation models on the impact response is analyzed. Results show that the presented time-efficient methodology is capable of accurately modeling core failure behavior and rapidly <b>simulating</b> low-velocity <b>impacts</b> which induce barely visible damage...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{currently}} under development to design ceramic turbine components with improved impact resistance are presented. Two different modes of impact damage are identified and characterized, i. e., structural damage and local damage. The entire computation is {{incorporated into the}} EPIC computer code. Model capability is demonstrated by <b>simulating</b> instrumented plate <b>impact</b> and particle <b>impact</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
