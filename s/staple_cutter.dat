40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{new device}} of <b>staple</b> <b>cutter</b> was {{developed}} to evaluate the clinical effect {{for the treatment of}} rectal stricture after the double stapling anastomosis. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The double stapling technique has become an established reconstruction method for patients with low anterior resection. The major complication of anastomotic stricture associated with circular stapling has been reported to be harmful and distressing. Because underlying mechanisms of stricture are not well understood, no prophylactic means have been developed and this results in postoperative dilation still being the only treatment available. Although various dilation methods are used for the treatment of stricture, none is fully satisfactory. METHODS: Low anterior resection was performed in 30 patients with rectal carcinoma using a double stapling technique. First, the incidence of the anastomotic stricture and the clinical factors that contribute to the stricture formation were studied. Second, the clinical effects and advantages of the treatment of coloproctostomic stricture using the newly developed device (<b>staple</b> <b>cutter)</b> were evaluated. RESULTS: Nine (30 %) of 30 patients had anastomotic stricture with the symptom of distressing frequent bowel movement. There was no significant relation between the clinical factors and the stricture when compared with that of nonstricture patients. Excellent dilation was performed in all of the nine strictures using the <b>staple</b> <b>cutter,</b> and the symptom of stricture disappeared dramatically in eight patients (89 %) within 1 week. The recurrence of stricture occurred in two patients; however, it has not been observed after one further use of this treatment. The <b>staple</b> <b>cutter</b> is safe and easy to use even at the bedside, and except for a conventional anoscope, no special equipment, including fluoroscope, was needed. CONCLUSIONS: From the significant effects and advantages, the procedure using <b>staple</b> <b>cutter</b> is recommended highly for the treatment of circular stapling anastomotic stricture of the rectum...|$|E
30|$|The use {{of linear}} <b>cutter</b> <b>stapling</b> device for {{securing}} uterine vascular pedicles {{has been suggested}} during the achievement of laparoscopic hysterectomy [10]. According to the retrospective analysis of their series of 1, 275 laparoscopic hysterectomies, the authors concluded {{that the risk of}} ureteral injury is not increased when compared to abdominal hysterectomy and to the use of bipolar diathermy.|$|R
30|$|Our {{series of}} LHs using the <b>cutter</b> <b>stapling</b> device {{to secure the}} uterine vessel pedicles reports only one {{ureteric}} injury {{as a result of}} this technique in the last 1, 000 cases. Our overall ureteric injury rate for the last 1, 000 cases was 0.20 % and that of Wattiez et al. of 0.21 % in their latter 952 cases compared favourably with the reported rates in AH of 0.24 % from western Sydney [28], 0.20 and 0.40 % from Finland [26, 29], and 0.39 % overall for all the AHs performed in the above reported trials [21 â€“ 25].|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic diverticulotomy (Dohlman's procedure) is a {{well-established}} and effective alternative to external diverticulectomy {{in the treatment}} of pharyngeal pouch. The division of the common septum between the pouch and the oesophagus is usually performed either with electrocautery or with a laser. We describe a new technique of endoscopic diverticulotomy using a linear <b>cutter</b> <b>stapling</b> gun. This technique has the advantages of being quick and bloodless, avoiding the need for a nasogastric tube, permitting oral intake as early as the first postoperative day and allowing early discharge from hospital. It also has the theoretical advantage over the electrocautery or the laser technique of reducing the risk of fistula formation, mediastinitis and thermal injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve...|$|R
30|$|We {{retrospectively}} analysed {{our first}} 1, 275 laparoscopic hysterectomies for ureteric injuries. All patients scheduled for hysterectomy in two private gynaecological practices in Sydney and Adelaide {{over the past}} decade were offered laparoscopic hysterectomy using a linear <b>cutter</b> <b>stapling</b> device for securing uterine vascular pedicles. The stapling of the uterine vascular pedicles resulted in the injury of four ureters in the first 275 cases (1.45 %), whereas in the subsequent 1, 000 cases there was only one such injury (0.1 %). In light of our data and the reviewed literature, we conclude regarding ureteric injury at laparoscopic hysterectomy that: in the early days it was probably more the result of surgical inexperience and technique development rather than instrument failure; in experienced hands and with a perfected technique the rate is probably no higher than for abdominal hysterectomy; in experienced hands the rate is probably similar whether stapling or bipolar diathermy is used to secure the uterine vascular pedicles.|$|R
30|$|The late 1980 s {{and early}} 1990 s saw the initial {{development}} in advanced gynaecological endoscopic surgery. Surgical techniques, instruments and expertise developed rapidly. The linear <b>cutter</b> <b>stapling</b> device was originally a popular method of securing vascular pedicles. Nezhat et al. [1] described {{the first case}} of laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) using the device to secure uterine vessels. But subsequently there were case reports of ureteric injuries when this device was used to perform the procedure [2, 3]. Bipolar coagulation came to be preferred as the method of choice for securing the uterine vascular pedicles endoscopically. Bipolar coagulators are generally reusable devices that gave them a cost advantage over disposable cutter-stapling devices. However, concern began to arise that collateral spread of thermal energy from bipolar diathermy could result in injury to the ureter. A recent review of ureteric injuries in pelvic laparoscopic surgery found that electrocautery was the most commonly reported technique {{to be associated with}} ureteric injuries, resulting in 50 % more reported injuries than with the use of staples [4]. Cook et al. reported on the evolution of the technique of laparovaginal hysterectomy over the last 13 years in their institution [5]. Their data indicated that their ureteric injury rate more than doubled from 0.3 to 0.7 % since abandoning staples in favour of bipolar diathermy to secure uterine vascular pedicles.|$|R
