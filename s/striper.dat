He spent his Sophomore year in Pavia, Italy, and lived in Mexico City for one year. His semi-autobiographical novel In Light’s Delay narrates several events of those years (1966–1968). In his youth, Terpening held a variety of jobs while attending school and first beginning to write fiction: he serviced vehicles in a dairy, worked in a berry growers cannery, on a cement gang in construction, as a <b>striper</b> of panels in a Georgia-Pacific veneer plant, a crew dispatcher for Southern Pacific Railroad, a housekeeping aide in Herrick Hospital (Berkeley, California), a mail handler for the U.S. Postal System in Oakland, and a teacher.|$|E

[...] Many of these guides troll secret lures attached by stainless-steel or nickel-alloy wire along the rocky reefs near the island where large female stripers reside from the spring through the autumn.

30|$|The {{detection}} {{accuracy of}} the light <b>stripe</b> centers {{is an important factor}} based on the structured light vision measurement, {{and the quality of the}} light <b>stripe</b> images is a prerequisite for accurately detecting the light <b>stripe</b> centers; this paper separately proposes image enhancement methods for linear and arc light <b>stripe</b> images. For linear light <b>stripes,</b> the image with better quality is captured and the gray-scale distribution of the normal section corresponding to the light <b>stripe</b> centers is used as a template for light <b>stripe</b> images with poor quality. The poor quality light <b>stripe</b> images are finally optimized by linear interpolation. For arc-shaped light <b>stripes,</b> this paper proposes a positioning method for light <b>stripe</b> centers on arc, and then the gray-scale distribution of the normal cross-section of corresponding center which is on a good quality light <b>stripe</b> image is used as templates to improve the poor quality light quality <b>stripe</b> images. In order to verify the effectiveness of the light <b>stripe</b> image enhancement algorithms, this paper respectively presents verification methods to linear light <b>stripe</b> and arc light <b>stripe.</b> Finally, the quality of the light <b>stripe</b> images could be improved by image enhancement algorithms through experiments.|$|R
