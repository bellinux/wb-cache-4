She used cloth {{patterns}} from his Pattern Sample book to dress her characters. Mrs Tiggywinkle's <b>shawl,</b> in The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, is based on pattern number 222714.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Wise, the {{congregation}} implemented many reforms in its services. In 1861 they adopted Wise's Minhag America prayer book. In that same decade they added an organ, {{did away with}} the prayer <b>shawl,</b> and started a religious school. In the 1870s {{the congregation}} removed yahrzeit candles from the sanctuary, and added family pews and a mixed choir (men and women together). In 1873 B'nai Yeshurun {{was one of the}} first thirteen founding members of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), now Union for Reform Judaism.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} hugely popular. Spinoff {{merchandise}} included a soft Jemima doll in bonnet and <b>shawl,</b> a Jemima painting book in 1925, and illustrated fabric placemats hand-fashioned by Potter and distributed to friends. Critically, {{the book is}} considered one of Potter's best. In 1971, the tale became a segment in the Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter, and, in 1992, it was telecast as an episode on the animated BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.|$|E
50|$|Kashmiri <b>shawls</b> were high-fashion {{garments}} in Western Europe in the early- to mid-19th century. Paisley <b>shawls,</b> imitation Kashmiri <b>shawls</b> woven in Paisley, Renfrewshire, are {{the origin}} of the name of the traditional paisley pattern. <b>Shawls</b> were also manufactured in the city of Norwich, Norfolk from the late 18th century (and some two decades before Paisley) until about the 1870s.|$|R

50|$|The Emperor Akbar {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} the <b>shawls</b> of Kashmir. It was he who began the fashion of wearing them in duplicate, sewn back to back, so that the under {{surfaces}} of the <b>shawls</b> were never seen. During that time the most desired <b>shawls</b> were those worked in gold and silver thread or <b>shawls</b> with border ornamented with fringes of gold, silver and silk thread.|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} book displays Potter's willingness {{to exploit the}} commercial possibilities of her characters and tales. The purchaser was alerted {{to the existence of}} other Potter books on the inside front cover and directed to a list of books on the back cover. Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for a soft toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief <b>shawl</b> and bonnet. A soft Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{begins in}} a {{farmyard}} which {{is home to}} a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and <b>shawl</b> to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs.|$|E
5|$|The two thieves {{thwart the}} dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, {{although}} he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, {{which is why he}} could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a <b>shawl.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kanihama, {{formerly}} known as Gund Kawarhama, is a village situated on the Srinagar-Gulmarg Road in the Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kani <b>Shawls</b> produced in the area were given a Geographical indication status by the Jammu and Kashmir government to keep <b>shawls</b> made elsewhere from being sold as Kani <b>shawls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{cultures}} incorporate <b>shawls</b> {{of various}} types into their national folk dress, mainly because the relatively unstructured <b>shawls</b> were much more commonly used in earlier times.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shawls</b> come in {{different}} sizes: most {{are long and}} narrow, and the designs vary, ranging from the simple to the elaborate. Some people believe designs have been passed down through families, as with weaving and embroidery work. Some designs appear to be intentionally left incomplete. Coptic Christian designs often have animal and human figures, whereas Muslim <b>shawls</b> rely on geometric designs. In some places, assuit <b>shawls</b> are incorrectly referred to as Coptic <b>shawls.</b> The geometric designs were popular with the Art Deco movement, beginning around 1925.|$|R
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a <b>shawl</b> or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a <b>shawl</b> for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E
5|$|Textiles dyed with royal purple, {{a symbol}} of social status, {{were found in the}} royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes {{different}} from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his <b>shawl</b> {{would have been in the}} shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was {{a symbol of}} prestige that glorified the strength of the king.|$|E
50|$|According to Coughlin, the <b>shawls</b> were fringed at {{the factory}} in Paisley, and could be {{returned}} to the factory for repair if the fringe became damaged. Owens, however, reports that the <b>shawls</b> were shipped unfringed from Paisley to the Galway Woollen Mills where the fringe was added. Because several factories produced the <b>shawls,</b> both cases could be true.|$|R

5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large <b>shawl</b> that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} Schönbrunn Palace {{to play the}} Turk. According to an {{eyewitness}} report, Mälzel took responsibility {{for the construction of}} the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a <b>shawl</b> around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|E

50|$|Silk <b>shawls</b> with fringes, made in China, were {{available}} by {{the first decade of}} the 19th century. Ones with embroidery and fringes {{were available}} in Europe and the Americas by 1820. These were called China crêpe <b>shawls</b> or China <b>shawls,</b> and in Spain mantones de Manila because they were shipped to Spain from China via the port of Manila. The importance of these <b>shawls</b> in fashionable women's wardrobes declined between 1865 and 1870 in Western culture. However, they became part of folk dress in a number of places including Germany, the Near East, various parts of Latin America, and Spain where they became a part of Romani (gitana) dress especially in Andalusia and Madrid. These embroidered items were revived in the 1920s under the name of Spanish <b>shawls.</b> Their use as part of the costume of the lead in the opera Carmen contributed to the association of the <b>shawls</b> with Spain rather than China.|$|R

When pashmina <b>shawls</b> rose into fashion prominence during the era, they were marketed dubiously. In the consuming markets, pashmina <b>shawls</b> have been redefined as a shawl/wrap with cashmere and cashmere/silk, notwithstanding the actual meaning of pashmina.

5000|$|In South Asia, {{cashmere}} {{is called}} [...] "pashmina" [...] (from Persian pashmina, [...] "fine wool").In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Kashmir (then called Cashmere by the British), had a thriving industry producing <b>shawls</b> from goat-hair imported from Tibet and Tartary through Ladakh. The <b>shawls</b> were introduced into Western Europe when the General in Chief of the French campaign in Egypt (1799-1802) sent one to Paris. Since these <b>shawls</b> were {{produced in the}} upper Kashmir and Ladakh region, the wool {{came to be known}} as [...] "cashmere".|$|R
40|$|Britain {{imported}} a {{vast number}} of cashmere <b>shawls</b> from the Indian subcontinent in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These were largely male garments in India at the time, which became popular dress accessories for British women. The demand for these <b>shawls</b> was opportune for textile manufacturers at home – particularly in Edinburgh, Norwich, and Paisley, who launched a thriving industry of <b>shawls,</b> ‘made in imitation of the Indian’. There has been considerable scholarship on cashmere <b>shawls</b> and their European copies in textile history. However, it has enjoyed no such prominence in literary studies. This PhD thesis examines Cashmere and ‘Paisley’ <b>shawls</b> in works of literature. Indian <b>shawls</b> are mentioned in a number of literary texts, including plays, poems, novels, opera, and satire. A wide variety of writers such as Richard Sheridan, Sir Walter Scott, Jane Austen, and Wilkie Collins (to name a few) depict these textiles in their works. For these writers, I argue, <b>shawls</b> provide a means to explore Britain’s changing social and imperial identity through the prism of material culture. The sheer incidence of ‘shawls’ in printed discourse furthermore suggests that they went beyond the realm of everyday fashion to constitute one of the important narratives of nineteenth-century Britain. In emphasising the significance of material culture and recovering new historical contexts, this investigation raises important questions relating to the links between industry and trade, and literary production. I rely on literary criticism, scholarship on India, and textile history to examine the phenomenon of cashmere <b>shawls.</b> In the wider context of postcolonialism, the research suggests that instead of the Saidian model which viewed the East as an abject ‘Other,’ colonies actually exerted a reverse and important influence on the imperial centre. A new emphasis on Indian things in literature, this work hopes, will contribute a fresh strand of thought to studies of imperialism...|$|R
