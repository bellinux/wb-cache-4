5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> from the window, while the twins were in travel cots {{in the middle of}} the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes {{there is something wrong with}} Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

25|$|Many Jews sway {{their body}} {{back and forth}} during prayer. This {{practice}} (referred to as shoklen in Yiddish) is not mandatory, {{and in fact the}} kabbalist Isaac Luria felt that it should not be done. In contrast, the German Medieval authority Maharil (Rabbi Jacob Molin) linked the practice to a statement in the Talmud that the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Akiva would sway so forcefully that he ended up at the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> when praying (Talmud tractate Berachot).|$|E
25|$|The Entrance Hall (also {{called the}} Grand Foyer) {{is the primary}} and formal {{entrance}} to the White House, the official residence of the President of the United States. The room is rectilinear in shape and measures approximately 31 by 44 feet. Located on the State Floor, the room is entered from outdoors through the North Portico, which faces the North Lawn and Pennsylvania Avenue. The south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> opens to the Cross Hall through a screen of paired Roman Doric columns. The east wall opens to the Grand Staircase.|$|E
25|$|Sala do Despacho (Hall of Order), {{another room}} with {{flattened}} vaulted ceiling, this space {{was used for}} state functions, and the King resolved official duties, typically on Thursdays. Its ceiling is painted with Aurora trazendo a Felicidade Pública, Abundância, Mentira and Justiça (by Cyrilio and Taborda), while the mouldings feature military motifs. On <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is an Italian black marble fireplace/stove, comprising two ionic columns, supporting a frieze ornamented by flowers and cornice, with fire-guard in metal. The parquet floor is formed into a geometric pattern and the space decorated with several gold-velvet chairs, large vases, lowboy furniture and red-velvet topped table.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{very large}} room and is {{supported}} by four columns. Also, there are windows on all four <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> so that <b>the</b> light can enter freely.|$|R

25|$|Until the 19th century, in an Ashkenazi synagogue, all seats {{most often}} faced the Torah Ark. In a Sephardi synagogue, seats were usually {{arranged}} {{around the perimeter}} of the sanctuary, but when the worshipers stood up to pray, everyone faced the Ark. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the Torah was read on a reader's table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the hazzan, stood at his own lectern or table, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table.|$|E
25|$|Home shrines can be {{as simple}} or as {{elaborate}} as the householder can afford. Large, ornate shrines can be purchased in India and countries with large Hindu minorities, like Malaysia and Singapore. They are usually made of wood and have tiled floors for statues to be placed upon. Pictures may be hung {{on the walls of the}} shrine. The top of the shrine may have a series of levels, like a gopuram tower on a temple. Each Hindu altar will have at least one oil lamp and may contain a tray with puja equipment as well. Hindus with large houses will set aside one room as their puja room, with the altar at one end of it. Some South Indians also place a shrine with pictures of their departed relatives on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and make offerings to them before making offerings to the gods.|$|E
25|$|In the Entrance Hall, McKim {{removed the}} Tiffany screen, Hoban's Ionic columns, and the {{ornamental}} painting. In its place {{he created a}} far simpler neoclassical interior. On the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is a screen of single and paired Roman Doric columns. Doric pillasters are used on the east, north and west wall. A robust entablature of triglyphs, garlanded bureaucrania, ornamental cuirass, and spread Roman eagles integrate the frieze and ceiling. A simple color palette of soft ochres, gray and white contrasted dramatically with the Victorian era interior. The presidential arms were cast in bronze and installed {{in the center of}} the room's floor. Bronze torchères, still in use, and a simple lantern with a cylindrical glass chimney lit the room. McKim's new finishes though robust in form were made of plaster and stucco over wood frames hastily added to Hoban's original surfaces. While the response to McKim's interiors were positive, the Entrance Hall has been criticized for being more appropriate to a public building than a home.|$|E
50|$|The {{walls and}} floor are black walnut. The art gallery is lighted {{naturally}} from an arched skylight in the ceiling. Cases on two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> contain art books in tooled leather bindings. Gilt-framed paintings are displayed.|$|R
60|$|The {{bedroom was}} very cold. It was a fair-sized {{room with a}} {{concrete}} floor and white walls, and window-door opening on a little balcony. There were two high white beds on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> wash-stand was a little tripod thing.|$|R
50|$|We {{can also}} find two oil {{paintings}} each <b>of</b> them representing <b>the</b> Doomsday and the Death, and a portrait <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal by Francisco Pacheco. On both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> there are glass cabinets which contain objects that belong to the Cardinal.|$|R

500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and my guys were lined up on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because {{at the end of the}} day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E
500|$|Taking {{advice from}} her mother not to let Peter {{suppress}} her identity, like her own husband did to her, Lois decides to hold a Passover Seder, which Peter tries to ruin so he can celebrate Easter. He shows up in an Easter bunny costume while drunk. Jesus appears and points out that Catholicism and Judaism are very similar. He then tells Peter that he should treat people of different faiths as fairly as {{he wants to be}} treated. Peter and Lois apologize to each other, but are at a loss for what religion they should follow. After being asked this by Peter, Jesus answers [...] "Six of one, they're all complete crap." [...] and then Brian (offscreen) chimes in from the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> responding [...] "Thank you!" ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{a strong}} {{contrast}} of emotional atmosphere between <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Keegan is extraordinarily stern: no game of backgammon could possibly make a man's face so grim. Aunt Judy is quietly busy. Nora it trying to ignore Doran and attend to her game.|$|R

500|$|The game {{is viewed}} by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the {{observation}} room, which contains a tank of hydrofluoric acid and a switch marked [...] "Live" [...] and [...] "Die". Pamela awakens in another cage on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm's death. The moment his voice is unscrambled, Hoffman attacks and kills everyone in the room, learning from Perez that [...] "everyone" [...] in the law enforcement may know of his implication in the games. [...] He plants fingerprints using Strahm's severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.|$|E
500|$|Home was {{investigated}} by Crookes in a self-built laboratory {{at the rear}} of his house at Mornington Road, North London in 1871. No plans of the laboratory have been found and there is no contemporary description of it. Crookes wrote the board and spring balance experiment was a success with Home and had proven [...] "beyond doubt" [...] the existence of a [...] "psychic force." [...] However, the experiment could be easily dismissed as the result of vibrations caused by the passage of Euston trains in the large railway cutting near his house in London. The experiment was not repeatable and sometimes failed to produce any phenomena. The experiment was rejected and ridiculed by the scientific community for lack of scientific controls. In the experiment Home refused for Crookes to be near him and would draw attention to something on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> or make conversation for diversionary signals.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul at the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> He looked so beautiful that I {{made up my mind}} I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We {{had a lot of fun}} together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
60|$|Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid were hustled into <b>the</b> {{single cell}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Payson jail.

2500|$|This {{differentiation}} {{is significant}} {{because the majority of}} assessment measures test only for neglect within the reaching, or peri-personal, range.

2500|$|The East Room {{was first}} {{assigned}} a purpose in 1807. Architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe {{had been brought}} to the capital by Thomas Jefferson, who made him commissioner of public buildings. Latrobe surveyed the White House in 1803, and architectural drawings of the building (produced in 1807) are the earliest extant plans now known. On his sketches, Latrobe comments [...] "Public Audience chamber entirely unfinished, the ceiling has given way." [...] Latrobe also proposed sealing the windows on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> based on an architectural theory about natural light. But this change was not made.|$|E
