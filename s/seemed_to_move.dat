5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E

25|$|As Snyder's {{involvement}} in {{environmental issues and}} his teaching grew, he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from poetry {{for much of the}} 1980s and early 1990s. However, in 1996 he published the complete Mountains and Rivers Without End, a mixture of the lyrical and epic modes celebrating the act of inhabitation on a specific place on the planet. This work was written over a 40-year period. It has been translated into Japanese and French. In 2004 Snyder published Danger on Peaks, his first collection of new poems in twenty years.|$|E

500|$|Before the Grace and Leo storyline was written, NBC {{worried that}} the show's {{characters}} never <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward or mature. They wanted the show {{to be more like}} Friends, which received higher ratings because of its romantic storyline cliffhangers. Greenstein commented that [...] "there was an interchangeability among the episodes from season to season. We wanted to create more continuing story arcs; we wanted to deepen the predicaments the characters are in, get the audience kind of rooting for something from week to week." [...] In November 2002, negotiations were made for Connick to play a series regular on Will & Grace; he originally signed on for only 13 episodes. Jeff Zucker, who at the time served as President of NBC Entertainment, commented that creating a triangle between Will, Grace, and Leo was a [...] "brilliant" [...] way to give the series a new spark. He was confident that it would be well received by the audience and the fans.|$|E

They were to produce the film with Scott Rudin for Columbia Pictures. In the fall of 2012, however, Chabon told Mother Jones that [...] "the Coen brothers wrote a draft of a script and then they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on", and that the film rights had [...] "lapsed back to me".|$|E
50|$|Kepler uses a daemon to {{describe}} the island of Levania in many scientific ways. The fixed stars {{are in the same}} position as the Earth's fixed stars. The planets appear larger from Levania than from Earth due to the distance Levania is from Earth. Levania also sees planetary motions in a different way. For instance, Levania does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> while the Earth is seen <b>to</b> <b>move</b> just as Earth does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> when on Earth but the Moon is seen <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> This is an example of Kepler defending Copernicus' diurnal rotation. The inhabitants at the divisor see the planets {{different from the rest of}} the Moon. Mercury and Venus specifically <b>seem</b> bigger <b>to</b> them.|$|R

2500|$|In 1755, about 4:15am on Tuesday, November 18, was {{the most}} {{destructive}} earthquake yet known in New England. The first pulsations of the ground were followed for about a minute of tremulous motion. Next came a quick vibration and several jerks much worse than the first. Houses rocked and cracked; furniture fell over. Dr. Edward A. Holyoke, of Salem, wrote in his diary that he [...] "thought of nothing less than being buried instantly {{in the ruins of}} the house." [...] The shaking continued for two to three minutes more, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from northwest to southeast. The ocean along the coast was affected; ships shook so much that sleeping sailors awoke, thinking they had run aground. In Boston, the earthquake threw dishes on the floor, stopped clocks, and bent vane-rods on churches and Faneuil Hall. Stone walls collapsed. New springs appeared, and old springs dried up. Subterranean streams changed their courses, emptying many wells. The worst damage was to chimneys. In Boston alone, about a hundred were leveled; about fifteen hundred were damaged, the streets in some places almost covered with fallen bricks. Falling chimneys broke some roofs. Many wooden buildings in Boston were thrown down, and some brick buildings suffered; the gable ends of twelve or fifteen were knocked down to the eaves. Despite the danger and many narrow escapes, no one was killed or seriously injured. Aftershocks continued for four days.|$|E

50|$|The phrase {{originated}} in classical antiquity, when astronomers and natural philosophers divided {{the lights in}} the sky into two groups. One group contained the fixed stars, which appear to rise and set but keep the same relative arrangement over time. The other group contained the naked eye planets, which they called wandering stars. (The Sun and Moon were sometimes called planets as well.) The planets <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and change their position over short periods of time (weeks or months). They always <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> within the band of stars called the zodiac by Westerners. The planets can also be distinguished from fixed stars because stars tend to twinkle, while planets appear to shine with a steady light.|$|R

50|$|The obvious {{properties}} we can {{see when}} we look at an isolated colour and let it act alone, on one side is the warmth or coldness of the colour tone, {{and on the other side}} is the clarity or obscurity of that tone. Warmth is a tendency towards yellow, and coldness a tendency towards blue; yellow and blue form the first great, dynamic contrast. Yellow has an eccentric movement and blue a concentric movement; a yellow surface <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> closer <b>to</b> us, while a blue surface <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away. Yellow is a typically terrestrial colour, whose violence can be painful and aggressive. Blue is a celestial colour, evoking a deep calm. The combination of blue and yellow yields total immobility and calm, which is green.|$|R
