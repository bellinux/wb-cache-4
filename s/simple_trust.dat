We show that it is possible to implement a Byzantine state machine replication algorithm with only 2 f + 1 replicas by extending the system with a <b>simple</b> <b>trusted</b> distributed component. Several performance metrics show that our algorithm, BFT-TO, fares well in comparison with others in the literature. Furthermore, BFT-TO is not vulnerable to some recently-presented performance attacks that affect alternative approaches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Deploying a {{corporate}} {{key management system}} faces fundamental challenges, such as fine-grained key usage control and secure system administration. None of the current commercial systems (either based on software or hardware security modules) or research proposals adequately address both challenges with small and <b>simple</b> <b>Trusted</b> Computing Base (TCB). This paper presents a new key management architecture, called KISS, to enable comprehensive, trustworthy, user-verifiable, and cost-effective key management. KISS protects the entire life cycle of cryptographic keys. In particular, KISS allows only authorized applications and/or users to use the keys. Using simple devices, administrators can remotely issue authenticated commands to KISS and verify system output. KISS leverages readily available commodity hardware and trusted computing primitives to design system bootstrap protocols and management mechanisms, which protects the system from malware attacks and insider attacks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Data {{sanitization}} {{has been}} studied {{in the context of}} architectures for high assurance systems, language-based information flow controls, and privacy-preserving data publication. A range of sanitization strategies has been developed to address the wide variety of data content and contexts that arise in practice. It is therefore tempting to separate the complex downgrading operations into untrusted data sanitizers while leaving the verification of security policy to <b>simpler</b> <b>trusted</b> guards that mediate information flow between different sensitivity levels. We argue that this can be a false economy and may result in more restrictive information flow than is necessary. We also observe that the guarantees provided by language-based declassification algorithms do not hold without exacting requirements for the runtime environment, and that the satisfaction of these requirements is the precise goal of MILS architectures, making the two disciplines well-matched complements.

60|$|But, {{truth to}} say, on this July day I {{reflected}} but {{little on the}} condition of the civilised world. Whatever sinister passions were heaving under its splendid and complex surface, I was too agitated by a simple and innocent desire of my own, to notice the signs or interpret them correctly. The most innocent of passions will take the edge off one's judgment. The desire which possessed me was simply the desire to travel. And that being so it would have taken something very plain in the way of symptoms to shake my <b>simple</b> <b>trust</b> in the stability of things on the Continent.

And the music carried with it the wording of old undying rhymes, and sang of the jolly, uncaring, uncared-for miller, of the farmer who went riding upon his grey mare, of the mouse who lived beneath the merry mill-pin, of the sweet music on yonder green hill and the dancers all in yellow--the songs and fancies of a lingering olden time, when men took life as children take a long summer day, and went to bed at last with a <b>simple</b> <b>trust</b> in something they could not have explained.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the idea of}} offline count-limited {{certificates}} (or clics for short), and show how these can be implemented using minimal trusted hardware functionality already widely available today. Offline count-limited certificates are digital certificates that: (1) specify usage conditions that depend on irreversible counters, and (2) are used in a protocol that guarantees that any attempt to use them in violation of these usage conditions will be detected even if the user of the certificate and the verifying party have no contact at all {{with the outside world}} {{at the time of the}} transaction. Such certificates enable many interesting applications not possible with traditional (unlimited use) certificates, including count-limited delegation and access, offline commerce and trading using cashlike migratable certificates, and others. We show how all these applications can be made possible by using only a <b>simple</b> <b>trusted</b> timestamping device (TTD), which can in turn be implemented usin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the fair}} {{exchange}} problem, mutually untrusting parties must securely exchange digital goods. A fair exchange protocol {{must ensure that}} no combination of cheating or failures will result in some goods being delivered but not others, and that all goods will be delivered {{in the absence of}} cheating and failures. This paper proposes two novel randomized protocols for solving fair exchange using <b>simple</b> <b>trusted</b> units. Both protocols have an optimal expected running time, completing in a constant (3) expected number of rounds. They also have optimal resilience. The first one tolerates any number of dishonest parties, as long as one is honest, while the second one, which assumes more aggressive cheating and failures assumptions, tolerates up to a minority of dishonest parties. The key insight is similar to the idea underlying the code-division multiple access (CDMA) communication protocol: outwitting an adversary is much easier if participants share a common, secret pseudo-random number generator. ...|$|R

Cornelia, who had been the passive instrument of her romance, did not suffer from it at all, having always objected to the thickness of the young man's hands, and to the early baldness which gave him the Shakespearian brow he had so little use for. She laughed his memory to scorn, and employed the episode as best she could in quelling her mother's <b>simple</b> <b>trust</b> of passing strangers. They worked along together, in the easy, unambitious village fashion, and kept themselves in the average comfort, while the time went by and Cornelia had grown from a long, lean child to a tall and stately young girl, who carried herself with so much native grace and pride that she had very little attention from the village youth. She had not even a girl friendship, and her chief social resource was in her intimacy at the Burtons. She borrowed books of them, and read a good deal; and when she was seventeen she rubbed up her old studies and got a teacher's certificate for six months, and taught a summer term in a district at Burnt Pastures.
