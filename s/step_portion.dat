The anisotropic boring tool with a <b>step</b> <b>portion</b> and notches on the cylinder periphery is designed, which has anisotropic dynamic characteristics. Since the direct and the cross transfer function components of the proposed tool are designed to cancel out each vibration, the nominal compliance of the boring tool in cutting process can be reduced significantly. Hammering tests of the developed tool clarified that appropriate anisotropic frequency response function is roughly attained by the proposed design. The developed tool was subsequently applied to turning experiments, and it was clarified that the stability limit in the radial depth of cut significantly increases by using the proposed boring tool {{as compared to the}} ordinary boring tool...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{reliable}} {{approach to the}} tolerance design of electronic circuits is presented. Firstly, the tolerances of parameters are maximized {{by means of an}} evolutionary algorithm according to the design constraints. This optimization step is based on vertex analysis: each candidate solution is considered as feasible if the design constraints are fulfilled in all of the vertices of the tolerance region corresponding to that solution. This approach ensures fast computation and good results provided that the region of acceptability is convex and simply connected. Otherwise, the actual feasibility of the designed tolerance region is verified. To this purpose, a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm based on interval arithmetic is used. It allows detecting possible infeasibility pockets included in the designed tolerance region and neglected during the optimization <b>step.</b> Any <b>portion</b> of the boundaries of the region of acceptability that is included in the tolerance region is identified and the analysis is refined across it. The technique proposed in the paper has been applied to the tolerance design of two different possible realizations of the feedback control network of a voltage-mode regulated DC-DC converter.

Moreover, a reliable and efficient validation of the designed tolerance region is performed even in presence of nonconvex and not simply connected region of acceptability...|$|R

Nitrate {{adsorption}} in subsoil affects nitrate leaching, {{which in}} tum can affect water quality. A model {{to describe the}} adsorption of nitrate in acidic variable charge subsoils in Georgia and other tropical and subtropical areas is proposed. In the first <b>step,</b> a <b>portion</b> of the effective charge that vanishes {{as a result of}} the overlapping of oppositely charged diffuse layers on different colloids, termed "the mutually neutralized charge", σ[subscript M]. is established. The "newly developed charge", σ [subscript N], is developed during the second step, in response to ionic strength increase in subsoil solution. The reestablishment of these two components of the effective charge causes "salt adsorption". The last step is "ionic exchange" with the corresponding effective charge component σ EX. The separation of ''temporarily effective" (σ[subscript M] + σ [subscript N]) from "permanently effective" (σ [subscript EX) portions of the effective charge is very crucial when displacement and transport of ions like N₃- are considered, in order to understand that these ions are only temporarily adsorbed and can be immediately leached out by rain.

40|$|The {{isolated}} Ca 2 + current from Paramecium caudatum {{was examined}} under voltage clamp with long conditioning depolarizations lasting {{for up to}} 5 min. The isolated transient Ca 2 + current inactivates with tens of milliseconds due to Ca 2 + -dependent Ca 2 + -channel inactivation (Brehm & Eckert, 1978). When this fast inactivation was blocked by internally delivered EGTA, a much slower inactivation of the Ca 2 + current was discovered. This slow inactivation had time constants of tens of seconds, depending on voltage. The development of this slow inactivation was further examined by following the Ca 2 + transient after 1 s interruptions of the long depolarization. This development is voltage dependent; the rate of inactivation is higher with a larger depolarization. After a long depolarization, the Ca 2 + current returns in two clearly separable <b>steps.</b> A <b>portion</b> of the current returns rapidly along an exponential time course with time constants of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. The remainder of the current returns slowly with time constants of tens of seconds. A longer conditioning depolarization generates a larger portion that recovers slowly. Internally delivered EGTA, sufficient to prevent most of the fast inactivation, did not change the time course or the extent of either the onset or {{the removal of the}} slow inactivation. The compound W- 7, which inhibits the Ca 2 + current itself, does not block the onset of this slow inactivation during depolarization. We conclude that the slow inactivation of the Ca 2 + channel is a mechanistically different phenomenon from the fast Ca 2 + -dependent Ca 2 + -channel inactivation. The possible physiological and behavioural roles of this slow inactivation are discussed...|$|R

This willingness varies widely across users and tasks and (monetary) incentives are often engaged to strengthen it or make up for its total absence. These incentives need to carefully account for the highly non-homogeneous response of users to external motivation. We propose a framework that explicitly accounts for the implicit uncertainty about the eventual participation and contributions of users. In the framework, the impact of incentives on the user choice to contribute or not is modeled probabilistically. First, we formulate a convex optimization problem for incentive allocation with the goal of achieving maximum expected quality while taking into account task budget limitations and constraints related to the physical locations of users and tasks. We then propose an iterative algorithm to alleviate the complexity of the original problem with two basic steps: an allocation step that applies incentive allocation to a set of available contributors; and a refinement <b>step</b> that revokes <b>portions</b> of the allocated incentives.

Adaptation was operationalized with two global measures of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, depressive symptoms) and a domain-specific measure, adaptation to vision loss. Hierarchical regression analyses tested the effects of sociodemographic, vision, health, and functional disability variables in the first step, family support quality in the second step, and friendship support quality in the third step.

All of the 2 -kb transcripts contained sequences homologous to the xenotropic virus-related env sequences in the Friend spleen focus-forming virus, representing the N-terminal portion of gp 70.

The current day {{networks}} are under deliberate, continuous and premeditated attacks such as Hacker attacks, DoS attacks, IP Address Spoofing, Phishing, Sniffer attacks etc. The Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) {{proved to be}} reliable in parrying most of the issues and challenges faced by the corporate network security systems. But, the NID systems fall short in providing a completely fool-proof network security environment. False negatives and false positives proved to be considerable bottle necks in securing the networks from the attacks. This paper deals {{with the introduction of}} a software approach for the packet pre-filtering to ease security threats and the introduction of Network Behavior Analysis to enhance the security of the network. The Network Behavior Analysis helps the system to ease the burdens to the network and security of the network by the false positives. The NIDS compares all the incoming packets with the pre-defined rules or signatures to find suspicious patterns. The pre-filtering approach used in this paper {{is a result of the}} observation that very rarely an incoming packet matches the signatures or the IDS rules. During the pre-filtering <b>step,</b> a small <b>portion</b> of the packet is compared against the predefined signatures for any suspicious patterns and the initial pre-filtering match is considered for a full match.

All the dart streamers that we observed had speeds between 106 and 107 m s- 1, in agreement with previous observations of recoil leaders (RLs). Also, during the development of the three cases whose electric field change data was available it was possible to identify a sequence of microsecond-scale pulses preceding the development of the Considering the similarities in the optical and electric field signatures of both phenomena, we propose that the type &# 946; 2 negative leaders are the visible manifestation of the development of RLs that were initiated inside the cloud and propagate below the cloud-base during the development of a bipolar, bidirectional leader that precedes a lightning flash to ground. The RLs are initiated in and propagate through channels that were previously ionized by the in-cloud positive portion of a bidirectional leader, eventually connecting to one of its active branches.

At this moment, after more than 30 years of intensive research, the concept of encapsulation permits to consider that any meristematic plant tissue (obtained in vivo or in vitro) can be enclosed in a protective and nutritive matrix as long as it maintains the ability to convert into a plantlet under in vitro or in vivo environmental conditions (synthetic seed) or to evolve in shoots in a laboratory of micropropagation (capsula), also after transport and/or storage.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an integrated semi-theoretical/numerical (CFD) method {{for the design}} of V-stepped planing hulls. Considerable resistance reductions with respect to conventional hull forms (in the order of 20 %) have been obtained by the authors following this design procedure on a number of cases. The proposed hull form design is suitable to be applied for retrofit of existing high speed crafts and it is suitable for fast yachts having a top speed in excess of 50 knots. The focus of the paper is on the combined theoretical/numerical method to effectively design optimum step configurations for high speed planing hulls, including dynamic stability. The method combines a systematic series of CFD calculations with the semi-theoretical formulations proposed by Clement based on the analogy with lifting surface theory with CFD to design the geometry of the <b>step</b> and wetted <b>portion</b> of the forward body. An application example of the combined method to the redesign of an existing high speed Deep-V planing hull in a transverse V-stepped hull is presented: a reduction of the resistance of 19 % is confirmed by CFD in this case. Details of flow solution are detailed in terms of pressure distribution, shape and position of the spray root line, free surface wave pattern and global parameters such as friction and pressure forces, dynamic trim angle and sinkage for the original and modified transverse-step version.

We consider several companies from the horticulture industry, for which we have to match supply and demand of different commodities a few days ahead. We have introduced the problem and considered the relevant literature for the current subject. The problem is formulated as an MIP-model, and we have shown it to be NP-complete. The performance measure was minimal costs, and we have shown our cooperative model to improve on the current, non-cooperative situation. The computation time is exponential {{with the size of}} the instance. We have solved given test cases to optimality and improved on the heuristic that was made for these cases. Next, we have constructed our own, more complicated test cases. The model runs fast enough for models of smaller size, but when the size increases some heuristics might be required. We have proposed two heuristics, one based on aborting the solver and obtaining a very good bound, the other based on an LP-relaxation. A sensitivity analysis was performed and it appeared that that the model is insensitive with respect to changes in demand. However, the model is not robust with respect to changes in demand, which is shown by a Monte-Carlo analysis. We have given a small introduction to robustness and we have made the model robust against changes in demand by implementing the Affinely Adjustable Robust Counterpart (AARC).

A large variety of toxic sequellae have resulted from untoward exposures by many different routes: oral, dermal, inhalation, and parenteral. Toxic change may result from the plastic itself, migration of unbound components and additives, chemical decomposition or toxic pyrolysis products. The type of damage may involve acute poisoning, chronic organ damage, reproductive disorders, and carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic episodes. Typical examples for all routes are cited along with the activities of Canadian regulatory agencies to reduce both the incidence and severity of plastic-induced disease. After the final manufacturing and processing <b>steps,</b> a considerable <b>portion</b> of the plastic industries' products are sold as consumer or household items. Other plastic articles may appear in public places (schools, theaters, stores, transport vehicles), or they could be widely dispersed throughout the work force and thus come into frequent contact with the population. Thus, man in his modern existence is inextricably linked and exposed to the many products of the polymer and rubber industries. One can cite toys, clothing, furniture, medical devices, food containers, paints, sporting equipment, recreational articles, pens, pencils, construction materials such as water pipes, insulation, electrical wiring; the list is endless, but all may incorporate modern plastics. The routes of exposure to polymers include oral ingestion, dermal adsorption, inhalation, and ccntact with skin and eye. We may have exposure to heavy metals, plasticizers, stabilizers, fillers, dyes, residual monomers, antioxidants, fire retardants, and in cases of fire, a large number of thermal decomposition products. Hazards include acute poisoning and chronic toxicity, sensitization and corrosive damage t...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Crawley went {{forth and}} made his way with rapid <b>steps</b> to a <b>portion</b> of his parish nearly two miles distant from his house, through which was carried a canal, affording water {{communication}} in some intricate way both to London and Bristol. And on the brink of this canal there had sprung up a colony of brickmakers, the nature of the earth in those parts combining with the canal to make brickmaking a suitable trade. The workmen there assembled were not, for the most part, native-born Hogglestockians, or folk descended from Hogglestockian parents. They had come thither from unknown regions, as labourers of that class do come when they are needed. Some young men from that and neighbouring parishes had joined themselves to the colony, allured by wages, and disregarding the menaces of the neighbouring farmers; but they were all in appearance and manners nearer akin to the race of navvies than to ordinary rural labourers. They had a bad name in the country; but it may be that their name was worse than their deserts. The farmers hated them, and consequently they hated the farmers. They had a beershop, and a grocer's shop, and a huxter's shop for their own accommodation, and were consequently vilified by the small old-established tradesmen around them. They got drunk occasionally, but I doubt whether they drank more than did the farmers themselves on market-day. They fought among themselves sometimes, but they forgave each other freely, and seemed to have no objection to black eyes. I fear that they were not always good to their wives, nor were their wives always good to them; but it should be remembered that among the poor, especially when they live in clusters, such misfortunes cannot be hidden as they may be amidst the decent belongings of more wealthy people. That they worked very hard was certain; and it was certain also that very few of their number ever came upon the poor rates. What became of the old brickmakers no one knew. Who ever sees a worn-out aged navvie? ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{techniques}} for computer classification of multispectral scanner data involve a 2 ̆ 2 single-stage 2 ̆ 2 approach {{in which every}} pixel in the data is classified in a single step, using a single set of training statistics and a single set of wave length bands. Hierarchical classifiers, on the other hand, involve a sequence of classification steps, each of which can involve a different wavelength band or combination of wavelength bands. In addition, at each step in the classification process only one spectral class or a specific group of spectral classes are separated from all other classes in the data. Since {{a relatively small number}} of wave length bands are involved at each step, and (after the initial <b>step)</b> only a <b>portion</b> of the data is being classified at each step, such hierarchical classifiers are computationally very efficient. However, as compared to single stage classifiers, the effectiveness of hierarchical classifiers in terms of classification accuracy is not clear, especially when dealing with multitemporal data sets. In this study, Landsat-I MSS data sets obtained in June 1971 and February 1974 over the Monroe Reservoir and Hoosier National Forest in central Indiana were used. After digitally registering the two data sets, four classification procedures were compared. The first consisted of a standard single stage maximum likelihood classification using an eight channel training statistics deck (four wavelength bands from each two dates). The second utilized the 4 best channels of the 8 available. The third involved the Layered hierarchical classifier and the same eight channel training statistics. The fourth approach utilized the Layered classifier again, but the data from the two dates were treated independently for the purpose of developing training statistics. The results indicate that the Layered classifier is a more effective and efficient approach for classification of multitemporal/multispectral scanner data. The classification accuracies were relatively high for all four classifications, but the Layered classifier required only one third of the CPU time used in the single stage classification...|$|R
40|$|There {{were many}} {{important}} tasks that Poland had to address after it regained independence in 1918. One was the ordering of the matters of higher education. This included taking over control over establishments of higher educations which had earlier functioned in partitioned Poland under a foreign rule, {{as well as}} establishing study rules and academic regulations. The legislative actions {{had to be taken}} step by <b>step,</b> as further <b>portions</b> of Polish territories had been regained, to ensure students who had commenced studies in partitioned Poland their continuation under new, Polish conditions, and to enable validation of examinations already taken, {{and in the case of}} graduates, nostrifi cation of their diplomas. Unlike as it was in the case of earning lower degrees (of a licencjat, physician, or magister) and higher degrees (of a doctor), a completion of habilitation did not result in earning an academic degree. The habilitation process consisted of three steps: (i) submission of a print-out of a habilitation thesis, (ii) discussion on the habilitation thesis, and (iii) presentation of a habilitation lecture to the faculty members or members of another statutory body of a state institution of higher education. Following positive opinions of the reviewers of the thesis, the Council of the Faculty (or another competent organ of the institution) would resolve to grant the habilitation candidate an exclusive right to lecture, so called veniam legendi, and a title of a docent. The acquisition of that right did not tie the candidate to the school conferring the right, or compel him to lecture, but resignation from the right to lecture resulted in the expiry of such right, which nevertheless was capable to be restored without the need to go through the habilitation process again. A high education institution could off er a docent employment as a paid docent, which required proper nomination and appointment by the School’s competent authority, or contract with the docent the veniam legendi as a private lecturer (docent). Habilitation was not recognised as an academic degree and consequently nostrifi cation of the veniam legendi was not possible. 4811321 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R
