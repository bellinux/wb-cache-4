25|$|Just {{after the}} station of Bolzano the track {{branched}} {{off from the}} Brennerbahn and ran along the Eisack river. The line crossed the Talfer river and after two small stations (Ponte Roma and Ponte Resia) the line became split: one track proceeded to Meran and further to the Vinschgerbahn and one track branched away leftwards toward the low mountain range plateau of Überetsch. After a long bridge over the Adige river, the line got steeper and after two short tunnels reached the Überetsch plateau. Here the trains only stopped in Eppan, Kaltern and Sankt Anton, near the Mendel Funicular station. The <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> was, that the track to the Sankt Anton station left the mainline before it arrived to the Kaltern station, so the trains had to run to Kaltern station, drive back to the switch, change driving direction again and then go further to the Sankt Anton station.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on {{the paucity}} of new material, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution {{suggested}} that the whole production would more accurately be named the Havin’ a Blast Tour. [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that [...] "The <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> ... is that the 'Working on a Dream' tour no longer seems to be about 'Working on a Dream'" [...] and suggested that the album was unpopular among many fans and as a result, [...] "Springsteen, always the savvy showman, has chosen not to shove it down anyone's throat." [...] Springsteen fans instantly discussed and analyzed setlists as shows happened on the Backstreets.com BTX website, associated with which Twitter and other sources were used to post, {{or in some cases}} crudely broadcast, shows as they happened. [...] E Street bassist Garry Tallent and guitarist Nils Lofgren found themselves amused that fans had complained on the previous Magic Tour of too much new material being played, and were now complaining of too little. [...] Guitarist Steve Van Zandt said that the Working on a Dream songs that were played were [...] "big" [...] songs, so that made up for their lack of number.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E

500|$|Barker wrote {{much of the}} show's material, roughly three-quarters, again {{under the}} name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily {{involved}} with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look." [...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune." [...] They took turns to play the parts which had the [...] "good lines". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: [...] "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers." ...|$|E

That would be a really good story." [...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a <b>strange</b> <b>thing</b> to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we were! We were kind of ignored for the day." ...|$|E

[...] "It's about the Roman Catholic Church, which I love dearly – even though I’m not a bigot and I’m not in denial of the human condition.

2500|$|And if this {{statement}} marks a certain tendency readers have noted in Palmer's work all along, or remains a touchstone of sorts, we sense {{that from the}} beginning Palmer has consistently confronted not only the problem of subjectivity and public address in poetry, but the specific agency of Poetry {{and the relationship between}} poetry and the political: [...] "The implicit...question has always concerned the human and social justification for this <b>strange</b> <b>thing,</b> poetry, when it is not directly driven by the political or by some other, equally other evident purpose [...] Whereas the significant artistic thrust has always been toward artistic independence within the world, not from it." ...|$|E

Some great critics say that our aboriginal music {{is the same as}} played by all primitive people world over. Chinese music itself is built on the same principle and I am planning out the composition called the evolution of music. I hope to show the growth of harmony. First, so many musicians will come out in Indian costume, play some primitive melody. Others will follow playing something more advanced, and so on until the whole band is on stage and we are rendering the best grand opera." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vinnie {{was raised}} Roman Catholic in {{southern}} Philadelphia. Although his family practiced Catholicism, Vinnie felt {{disconnected from the}} religion. In high school, {{a good friend of}} his was Muslim, and whose home he frequented often. His friend's father soon began teaching Paz about the Qur'an, which was his first foray into the new religion. As an adult, he gradually converted to Islam, and remains a Muslim to this day. In an interview with Jason Goss, Paz stated; [...] "Growing up yeah, I'm Italian and from Philly, so obviously my family is Roman Catholic. Religion and spirituality are a <b>strange</b> <b>thing,</b> ya know? Most people just grow up and accept the propaganda that their parents pushed on them. Christian families produce Christian kids, Jewish families produce Jewish kids, and so on. Not many people break that mold. I just never felt any connection with Catholicism, or Christianity in general. I {{spent a lot of time}} in high school at my homeboy Arif's crib, and he came from a Muslim family.

[...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was.... He told me all of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn't at all displeased.... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. [...] Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed. I told him about the Paris works and offered to put him in charge." ...|$|E
