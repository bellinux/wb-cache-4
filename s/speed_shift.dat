40|$|Large civil tiltrotors {{have been}} {{identified}} to replace regional airliners over medium ranges to alleviate next-generation air traffic. Variable rotor speed for these vehicles is required for efficient high-speed operation. Two-speed drive system research has been performed to support these advanced rotorcraft applications. Experimental tests were performed on two promising two-speed transmission configurations. The offset compound gear (OCG) transmission and the dual star/idler (DSI) planetary transmission were tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center variable-speed transmission test facility. Both configurations were inline devices with concentric {{input and output shafts}} and designed to provide 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 output speed reduction ratios. Both were designed for 200 hp and 15, 000 rpm input speed and had a dry shift clutch configuration. Shift tests were performed on the transmissions at input speeds of 5, 000, 8, 000, 10, 000, 12, 500, and 15, 000 rpm. Both the OCG and DSI configurations successfully perform <b>speed</b> <b>shifts</b> at full rated 15, 000 rpm input <b>speed.</b> The transient <b>shifting</b> behavior of the OCG and DSI configurations were very similar. The shift clutch had more of an effect on shifting dynamics than the reduction gearing configuration itself since the same shift clutch was used in both configurations. For both OCG and DSI configurations, low-to-high <b>speed</b> <b>shifts</b> were limited in applied torque levels in order to prevent overloads on the transmission due to transient torque spikes. It is believed that the relative lack of appreciable slippage of the dry shifting clutch at operating conditions and pressure profiles tested was a major cause of the transient torque spikes. For the low-to-high <b>speed</b> <b>shifts,</b> the output <b>speed</b> ramp-up time slightly decreased and the peak out torque slightly increased as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased. This was caused by slightly less clutch slippage as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} change in the speed of pushed and {{bistable}} fronts of the reaction diffusion equation {{in the presence of a}} small cut-off. We give explicit formulas for the shift in the speed for arbitrary reaction terms f(u). The dependence of the <b>speed</b> <b>shift</b> on the cut-off parameter is a function of the front speed and profile in the absence of the cut-off. In order to determine the <b>speed</b> <b>shift</b> we solve the leading order approximation to the front profile u(z) in the neighborhood of the leading edge and use a variational principle for the speed. We apply the general formula to the Nagumo equation and recover the results which have been obtained recently by geometric analysis. The formulas given are of general validity and we also apply them to a class of reaction terms which have not been considered elsewhere. Comment: 12 page...|$|E
50|$|For instance, a given car {{traveling}} {{on a road}} of a given slope presents a load which the engine must act against. Because air resistance increases with speed, the motor must put out more torque at a higher speed {{in order to maintain}} the <b>speed.</b> By <b>shifting</b> to a higher gear, one may be able to meet the requirement with a higher torque and a lower engine <b>speed,</b> whereas <b>shifting</b> to a lower gear has the opposite effect.

40|$|Abstract-We have {{developed}} and demonstrated high bandwidth Josephson circuits to interface {{the output of}} RsFQ circuits to room temperature electronics. Asynchronous dc powered voltage driver circuits {{have been designed to}} amplify RSFQ signal levels to voltage outputs in the 2 - 4 mV range, in a wide bandwidth. These driver circuits have been characterized and tested for data rates up to 8 Gb/s. The bit error rate for one of these drivers has been measured up to 7 Gbls for a (Z 3 l- 1) bit long pseudo-random bit sequence (PPRBS). In order to match the data rate of Josephson circuits to slower room temperature electronics, we {{have developed}} clock-controlled shift registers which allow shift-in and shift-out of data at different frequencies. Complete functionality of these circuits integrated with the drivers has been demonstrated at low <b>speed.</b> <b>Shift</b> registers integrated with the voltage driver circuits have been tested at high-speed for data rates up to 6 Gb/s.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of stress is a generic problem which constantly occurs in nondestructive evaluation applications. X-ray diffraction {{provides the most}} successful approach, but suffers from the limitation that only a very near surface layer is sensed. Ultrasonic measurements, based on the stress dependence of the wave speed, have the capability of sampling bulk material. However, they suffer from some practical problems, including degradations in accuracy due to competing sources of wave <b>speed</b> <b>shifts</b> and difficulties of making measurements in complex geometries. The former problem has, in principle, been overcome by an approach recently developed as discussed below...|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} between 50 Hz and 60 Hz standards {{is the way}} motion pictures (film sources as opposed to video camera sources) are transferred or presented. 35 mm film is typically shot at 24 frames per second (fps). For PAL 50 Hz this allows film sources to be easily transferred by accelerating the film by 4%. The resulting picture is therefore smooth, however, {{there is a small}} shift in the pitch of the audio. NTSC sets display both 24 fps and 25 fps material without any <b>speed</b> <b>shifting</b> by using a technique called 3:2 pulldown, but at the expense of introducing unsmooth playback in the form of telecine judder.|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{the four}} segment model {{is used to}} discuss {{aggregation}} patterns of 2 -methoxy, 2 -ethoxy and 2 -butoxyethanol as functions of mole fraction in mixtures in water. The excess molar volume, the excess isentropic compressibility and the ultrasonic <b>speed</b> <b>shift</b> are considered as differences or shifts with respect to ideal mixtures. In addition, photon correlation spectroscopy results for the pure liquids and solutions in cyclohexane and CCl_ 4, as well as results from ultrasonic relaxation are also presented and discussed. On the whole, these results point to a qualitatively different physico-chemical behaviour for 2 -butoxyethanol, which exhibits a typical surfactant behaviour, and for 2 -methoxy and 2 -ethoxyethanol. Then, this chapter deals with the stretching OH spectral region of 2 -methoxyethanol, by FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, by varying temperature and concentration in various solvents. These studies point to a high sensitivity of the OH oscillator to its environment, in particular, to both intra and intramolecular hydrogen bonding type of interactions. On formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, simple geometrical considerations lead to preferential arrangements (gauche and gauche') for the OC-CO and CC-OH dihedral angles. Finally, the skeletal bendings and torsions spectral region of 2 -methoxiethanol is considered, by INS and Raman spectroscopies. The Raman spectra were taken at various temperatures and concentrations in CHCL_ 3 and D_ 2 O. On the whole, the INS and Raman spectra show important relative intensity changes of some features, namely of the 435 cm"-" 1 band, suggesting variations in the aggregation pattern associated with a competition between intramolecular (in the monomer) and intramolecular hydrogen bondingAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Fluid {{power systems}} have been {{extensively}} used in off highway applications like skid steer loaders, wheel loaders, excavators since many years. Work {{has been done by}} both industry and academia to improve efficiency, reduce noise and leakages in these systems. With increasing competition in the market, importance is now also given to operator comfort and machine productivity in off highway applications. ^ Mobile, off – highway vehicles like Skid-steer loaders are widely used in labour saving applications like loading earth into a truck, dig and move material on construction sites to, clean roads, clear snow from roads etc. To carry out these jobs in limited spaces, skid steer loaders need tight turning radius. For this reason, these machines have a short wheelbase which prevents the use of suspensions in these vehicles. The absence of a suspension system exposes the vehicle to ground vibrations of high magnitude and low frequency. Vibrations reduce operator comfort, productivity and life of components. This thesis will discuss control strategies for vibration damping of skid steer loader using the hydraulic boom cylinder as the active suspension element, which is equivalent to a spring–damper. Along with vibrations, the machine productivity is also hampered by material spillage which is caused by the tilting of the bucket due to the extension of the boom. This dissertation will discuss the development of a robust path-planning control algorithm which adapts to the position of the boom to maintain a level load to achieve bucket self-leveling. Another reason for reduced productivity in skid steer loaders is slow in site travel speeds. This dissertation also concentrates on reducing the in-job cycle time by developing a control strategy to smooth <b>speed</b> <b>shift</b> the drive motors keeping the pump flow constant. ^ To synthesize these proposed control algorithms, high fidelity hydraulic and mechanical models of the skid steer loader are created. Ultimately, the control algorithms derived in this dissertation help in improving operator comfort and machine productivity. ...|$|E

40|$|Vehicle powertrains with a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) have a large freedom in controlling the engine speed and the torque at the wheels. Due to rotating inertias within the engine and transmission, {{the response of the}} vehicle during large engine <b>speed</b> <b>shifts</b> may appear reluctant or even counteractive. To overcome this behaviour, the CVT is augmented with a planetary gear set and compact steel fl ywheel. The new transmission seamlessly combines two contradictive features: the driveability in terms of the pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. This can be achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds which is possible by the large ratio-coverage of the CVT. The latently impassive pedal-to-wheel response that normally would emerge is now eliminated by the gear set and the flywheel. In this paper two control strategies for the engine throttle valve and the CVT ratio <b>shift</b> <b>speed</b> are presented and analysed. The control laws are able to realize high driveability and fuel economy at the same time. Results from simulations will be discussed...|$|R
