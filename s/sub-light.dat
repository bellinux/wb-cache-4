5|$|The Enterprise then learns of {{an unmarked}} vessel {{approaching}} Haven. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) recognizes it as Tarellian, {{a race that}} they had thought to be wiped out by a highly lethal and contagious virus. When they contact the ship, they find a handful of Tarellian refugees that have been travelling at <b>sub-light</b> speeds to Haven in hopes of finding an isolated location to live {{out the rest of}} their lives in peace. Picard insists they cannot go to the planet for fear of spreading the virus, and has the Tarellian vessel placed in a tractor beam. Wyatt recognizes one of the Tarellians, Ariana (Danitza Kingsley), from his dreams, and she too recognizes Wyatt. Wyatt tells Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) that he will transport some medical supplies to them, but transports himself along with the supplies. When the crew discovers this, Wyatt's parents demand Picard bring Wyatt back to the Enterprise, but Picard insists that he cannot return, as Wyatt would now carry the Tarellian virus. Wyatt promises his parents, Troi, and the rest of the crew that he knew that this would be destiny, and is happy to try to help cure the Tarellian virus. Wyatt convinces the Tarellians to leave Haven and search for help elsewhere. Picard orders the tractor beam to be dropped and allows the vessel to depart the system.|$|E
25|$|The books also {{speculate}} on the colonization of other planets and moons in the Solar System, and include descriptions of settlements or terraforming efforts on Callisto, Mercury, Titania, Miranda and Venus. Toward {{the end of the}} last novel, humans are taking <b>sub-light</b> colony ships to other stars, taking advantage of the longevity treatments to survive the trip to their destinations.|$|E
25|$|De Camp did, however, {{underestimate}} the staggering impediments to even <b>sub-light</b> interstellar travel, assuming it would both be achieved quickly and soon {{develop into a}} relatively routine and comfortable system of commerce and travel linking nearby star-systems, much as sailing ships linked the early modern nations of Earth. He also assumed the parallel and convergent evolution of life on other worlds into types of higher multicellular lifeforms {{similar to those of}} Earth, and the ubiquity of intelligent life; thus his alien planets have both animal and plant life, with at least one species of animal life usually having achieved intelligence, and these alien intelligent species are in the main recognizably mammalian or reptilian.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{observers}} with <b>sub-light</b> {{relative motion}} will disagree about which occurs first of any two {{events that are}} separated by a space-like interval. In other words, any travel that is faster-than-light {{will be seen as}} traveling backwards in time in some other, equally valid, frames of reference, or need to assume the speculative hypothesis of possible Lorentz violations at a presently unobserved scale (for instance the Planck scale). Therefore, any theory which permits [...] "true" [...] FTL also has to cope with time travel and all its associated paradoxes, or else to assume the Lorentz invariance to be a symmetry of thermodynamical statistical nature (hence a symmetry broken at some presently unobserved scale).|$|E
2500|$|The game's primary mode of play {{is flying}} around in space ships. Players can dock at stations, {{where they are}} safe and can use station {{services}} such as repairing, refitting, and the regional market. All space combat takes place in real time at <b>sub-light</b> speeds from around 100m/s to in excess of 8000m/s, depending on ship size and setup. While players can manually control their ships as in space combat simulators such as Wing Commander or [...] following {{the release of the}} Rhea expansion on December 9, 2014, most opt instead to give commands such as Orbit, Approach or Align to their flight computer, which does its best to comply. Weapon aiming, however, cannot be done manually; instead, the player locks on to an opponent and orders their weapons to fire, and the result is determined through calculations based on factors such as range, velocity, weapon tracking, and a degree of randomness.|$|E
2500|$|The huge glowing {{radiators}} {{mounted to}} the engines dissipate their heat, and the enormously long central truss, {{with its own}} protective coolers and reflectors, protects the cargo and crew modules from the engines' heat and radiation using the simple rule of r-squared attenuation rather than heavy shielding. (Yes, [...] really thinks {{about this kind of}} stuff and explains it very clearly in text and in person.) The ship has a pair of centrifugal-gravity-gen modules for the crew who remain awake for the duration, which has become a pretty typical feature of quasi-realistic ship designs in movies. But one unique feature it has which directly relates to the <b>sub-light</b> realistic travel is a cascade-style shield stack to protect the speeding craft from interstellar debris. Jim's [...] completely explains this technology, apparently based on current NASA research, and how it obliterates potentially catastrophic particles by letting them slam through a series of thin, light shield surfaces.|$|E
50|$|A {{generation}} ship, or generation starship, is {{a hypothetical}} type of interstellar ark starship that travels at <b>sub-light</b> speed.|$|E
50|$|Voyages {{to other}} galaxies at <b>sub-light</b> speeds would require voyage times {{anywhere}} {{from hundreds of}} thousands to many millions of years. To date only one design such as this has ever been made.|$|E
50|$|The Kess Rith are a reptillian alien {{race that}} {{can best be}} {{described}} as half-iguana, half-centaur, and all aggression. The Kessrith have a warrior society that is loosely allied with the Renegades. It is rumored that the Kessrith acquired FTL travel from the S'sora and used slow <b>sub-light</b> generation ships before their encounters with the S'sora.|$|E
5000|$|Features of the {{postulated}} future {{include an}} Earth {{governed by a}} World Federation in which Brazil has become the paramount great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias ("Interplanetary Tours" [...] in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is limited to <b>sub-light</b> speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as hyperdrives.|$|E
50|$|The books also {{speculate}} on the colonization of other planets and moons in the Solar System, and include descriptions of settlements or terraforming efforts on Callisto, Mercury, Titania, Miranda and Venus.

5000|$|Each planet {{may also}} be defended by local militias or a more {{structured}} Planetary Defence Force. In most cases, the latter fills its ranks with short-term and part-time soldiers, {{who do not have}} the professional training and equipment of the Imperial Guard. Planetary defense forces of the more important systems may be complemented by a [...] "System Fleet" [...] of <b>sub-light</b> speed spacecraft.|$|E
5000|$|StarCluster 4 - Dark Orbital was {{released}} on September 15, 2016. Dark Orbital is an ancient space station, once a <b>sub-light</b> colony ship from earth, and re-purposed into an orbital city. Now, it the Flats and Mirrors of the undercity, the old workers still live on, digging through and recycling the trash from the glittering society above into new things for themselves. Punk returns to cyberpunk! ...|$|E
5000|$|Photon engine has {{replaced}} the normal spaceship engines {{by the end of}} 20th and the beginning of 21st century. It utilizes energy of thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen-tritium plasma combined with s.c. absolute reflector, a material reflecting any (!) electromagnetic waves without loss, to create a propelling force capable of accelerating a spaceship up to relativistic <b>sub-light</b> speeds. See The Land of Crimson Clouds for more info.|$|E
50|$|The Puppeteers {{first moved}} their worlds into this {{formation}} when their home star {{turned into a}} red giant, using an inertialess, reactionless drive purchased at great price from the Outsiders. After the discovery that {{the core of the}} galaxy is exploding, the Puppeteers turned the fleet towards the Magellanic Clouds, gradually reaching a speed of 80% lightspeed. Although the Puppeteers have Faster-than-light technology they prefer to travel at safer, <b>sub-light</b> speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} role of sleeper ships in fiction is for {{interstellar}} or intergalactic travel, usually at <b>sub-light</b> speed. Travel times for such journeys could {{reach into the}} {{hundreds or thousands of}} years, making some form of life extension, such as suspended animation, necessary for the original crew to live to see their destination. Suspended animation is also required on ships that cannot be used as generation ships.|$|E
5000|$|The Fleet of Worlds is {{the five}} (at one point six, as {{detailed}} in Fleet of Worlds) planets that {{are home to}} the Puppeteers (see above), presently being moved in formation at <b>sub-light</b> speeds out of the galaxy to avoid destruction as the wave of radiation from an explosion of the galactic core sweeps towards the outer reaches of the galaxy. They orbit about {{each other in a}} Klemperer rosette.|$|E
5000|$|Thus the {{relational}} interpretation, by shedding {{the notion of}} an [...] "absolute state" [...] of the system, allows for an analysis of the EPR paradox which neither violates traditional locality constraints, nor implies superluminal information transfer, since we can assume that all observers are moving at comfortable <b>sub-light</b> velocities. And, most importantly, the results of every observer are in full accordance with those expected by conventional quantum mechanics.|$|E
50|$|Also {{referred}} to as conventional torpedoes, spatial torpedoes are 22nd century weapons used by Enterprise. Spatial torpedoes are the ship's most powerful and primary ship-to-ship weapon before the installation of phase cannons. Spatial torpedoes are themselves superseded by more powerful photonic torpedoes. Unlike photonic torpedoes {{or any of the}} warhead's successors, spatial torpedoes are launched at <b>sub-light</b> velocity and can be used much {{in the manner of a}} missile, having the warhead on a fly-by-wire.|$|E
50|$|In {{his true}} form, Living Lightning is just that, a sentient {{electrical}} force with no mass. In this form, he can fly, reaching <b>sub-light</b> speeds, withstanding the vacuum of space, and is impervious to most physical and energy attacks. He also possesses {{the ability to}} fire and manipulate bursts of electricity and electrical fields of varying intensities in his solid form, however, he must wear a special containment suit to retain a solid form.|$|E
50|$|Living Lightning gained superhuman powers when he absorbed {{energy from}} an {{experimental}} lightning weapon. Living Lightning {{has the ability}} to transform his body into electrical plasma, in which form he can fly at <b>sub-light</b> speed, generate electrical power as shocks or bolts, and surround himself with a protective electrical force field. He {{has the ability to}} control his body while composed of electrical plasma, at which time his mind exists only in astral form.|$|E
50|$|He {{is broken}} out {{and picked up}} by a <b>sub-light</b> ship, where he recuperates before {{traveling}} onward, employed by a mysterious agency. During the escape, he is implanted with an artificial intelligence who relays his instructions. The AI reveals that Ae is to kill an entire planet, but does not explain who has ordered the murder, nor their motive for doing so. All Ae is told is that the nature of his mission will be revealed upon its completion.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} save the planet from its {{impending}} doom, the United Nations resolved to pool their resources towards this all-important goal by pooling together the large amounts of technical advancements they {{made in the past}} two decades. A bold and incredible plan was quickly initiated by the U.N. Security Council called Operation: South Pole. The U.N. then sends remaining prototype <b>sub-light</b> spacecraft JX-2 Eagle was quickly modified and launched into space to obtain further data on Gorath.|$|E
5000|$|Taak, {{looking forward}} to a life of quiet scholarship, is {{astonished}} to be drafted into one of the Mercatoria's religio-military orders. It turns out that in a previous research expedition to the Dweller-inhabited gas-giant Nasqueron, Taak inadvertently uncovered a book containing information about the legendary [...] "Dweller List" [...] of coordinates for their own private systems of wormholes. (Since Dwellers are sufficiently long-lived to colonise the galaxy at <b>sub-light</b> speed, the very existence of such a network was considered doubtful).|$|E
50|$|A {{hyperspace}} cloud {{is created}} in the entry and exit points. These can be analyzed by those wishing to intercept and destroy the jumping ship, as a faster ship can reach the destination sooner. Sometimes, more often with engines {{that have not been}} maintained properly, mis-jumps occur, which leave the player in interstellar space, where the ship will be forever stranded if sufficient fuel to reach a star system is not available (<b>sub-light</b> drive cannot be used to reach nearby stars, even if this were physically feasible).|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main kinds of space ships in Compact's employ: surface-to-orbit shuttles, miners, and jump ships. The {{first and the}} second use only {{reaction}} engines for propulsion; shuttles can land on planets while miners and jump ships need space stations to dock. Only the jump ships can cross interstellar distances by using a jump drive. They are also the fastest in-system transports because they can move at <b>sub-light</b> speeds without entering a jump. Most of these are traders and freighters; some are heavily armed hunter-ships.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Reimagined series (2003)== In the 2003 {{remake of}} Battlestar Galactica, the Viper series of starfighters are the Colonial Defense Force's primary space superiority fighter/attack craft. Capable of {{atmospheric}} flight, the Viper is a single-seat <b>sub-light</b> speed craft mounting two kinetic energy weapons (3 {{on at least}} one later design), as well as having hardpoints beneath the wings for mounting missiles, munitions pods and other ordnance. There are at least seven versions of the Viper design at the point in history depicted by the reimagined miniseries.|$|E
5000|$|Surrounding the Depths is the Slow Zone. The Earth (called [...] "Old Earth") {{is located}} in this Zone, and {{humanity}} {{is said to have}} originated there, although Earth plays no significant role in the story. Biological intelligence is possible in [...] "the Slowness", but not true, sentient, artificial intelligence. Faster-than-light travel may not be initiated in the Slow Zone, i.e., one may [...] "jump" [...] into the Slow Zone, but not back out. All ships which find themselves in the Slow Zone are restricted to <b>sub-light</b> speeds. Faster-than-light communication is impossible into or out of the Slow Zone. As the boundaries of the Zones are unknown and subject to change, accidental entry to the Slow Zone is a major interstellar navigational hazard at the [...] "Bottom" [...] of the Beyond. Starships which operate near the Beyond/Slow Zone border often have an auxiliary Bussard ramjet drive, so that, if they accidentally stray into the Slow Zone (thus disabling any FTL drive), they will at least have a backup (<b>sub-light)</b> drive to push them back [...] "up" [...] to the Beyond. Such ships also tend to include [...] "coldsleep" [...] equipment, as it is likely that any such return will still take many subjective lifetimes for most species.|$|E
50|$|The {{available}} jump routes {{can significantly}} hinder {{the movement of}} a side's forces. Certain star systems act as bottle-necks, {{and can be used}} by each side as a defensive front. Two of the stars do not allow refueling, so tankers are required to leave these sites. Ships (excepting fighters and missile boats) are allowed to move at <b>sub-light</b> speeds across the hex map, and so can move directly from star to star without following the jump routes. However the movement rate of these ships is only one hex per turn.|$|E
50|$|Vessels {{equipped}} with K-F drives {{are known as}} jumpships and range in mass up to 500,000 tonnes, though warships, a subclass of jumpship hardened against attack and fitted with naval weapons, may mass up to 2.5 million tonnes. The size and delicacy of a jumpship's K-F drive and the danger of jumping while in a gravitational well limits such vessels to deep space and precludes planetary landings. Jumpships often use sail-like collectors to gather solar energy and fusion engines for <b>sub-light</b> maneuvers, and normally travel with a small retinue of dropships.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Inspector's Teeth" [...] {{is set on}} {{a future}} Earth governed by a World Federation in which Brazil has become the {{paramount}} great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias ("Interplanetary Tours" [...] in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is common between the Solar System and nearby stellar systems, though limited to <b>sub-light</b> speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as hyperdrives. Most reachable systems have life-bearing planets inhabited by alien races; an Interplanetary Council regulates relations between the various civilizations. Terrans and the reptilian natives of the planet Osiris are the main spacefaring peoples.|$|E
5000|$|In the Star Trek universe, the Bajoran {{wormhole}} is {{a unique}} spatial anomaly located within 160,000,000 km of the planet Bajor (per DS9 S1Ep2: [...] "Emissary (Part 2)"), {{which is a little}} more than the distance from Earth to the Sun. The Bajoran religion refers to the wormhole as the [...] "Celestial Temple". It is an aperture of swirling golden light surrounded by blue clouds, which appears when a vessel approaches and disappears when the vessel enters it; it also appears when discharging a vessel. The wormhole can only be traversed by ships traveling at impulse (<b>sub-light</b> speed) velocities.|$|E
50|$|In The Stars Are Ours! a {{group of}} four dozen {{scientists}} and engineers rebuilds an interplanetary spaceship for an interstellar journey to escape from a vile anti-intellectual dictatorship. Traveling at <b>sub-light</b> speed, with its crew and passengers in suspended animation, the ship coasts for centuries, finally reaching a star with an Earth-like planet, Astra, on which the ship lands. On that alien world the humans befriended sentient humanoids, the amphibious merpeople, who appear to have evolved from creatures similar to otters. The new colonists also discover the ruins of cities one occupied by Those Others, a different species of people that the merpeople fear.|$|E
50|$|Most {{races of}} the Alpha Octant {{discover}} warp drive {{around the same}} time (Y1 for Humans, Y11 for the Kzintis, etc.), {{with the exception of the}} Vulcans and some other future Federation members, who had been in space for some time, and the Jindarians, who have been in space longer than Humans have existed. Warp drives render a ship extremely vulnerable to weapons damage, so all combat is fought at <b>sub-light</b> speeds, with ships moving strategically at faster than light speeds. All races are just beginning to expand and colonize, so wars are uncommon—but not unknown. The Romulans in particular fight both the Gorn and Earth.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Colorful Character" [...] {{is set on}} {{a future}} Earth governed by a World Federation in which Brazil has become the {{paramount}} great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias ("Interplanetary Tours" [...] in Portuguese).

5000|$|Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual {{indicates}} that the impulse engines are nuclear fusion engines in which the plasma from the fusion reactor powers a massive magnetic coil to propel the ship. It {{is a form of}} magnetohydrodynamic or magnetoplasmadynamic thruster. This is used in conjunction with the ship's warp drive's alteration of the ship's relativistic mass, to achieve mid-to-high <b>sub-light</b> speeds. Thrusters, on the other hand, are closer to the designs of a high-efficiency reactant propellant (i.e. a sophisticated rocket engine) and are usually used for high-precision maneuvers. Ion propulsion drives are explicitly detailed to be used in Star Trek by Dominion and Iconian Starships and facilities.|$|E
