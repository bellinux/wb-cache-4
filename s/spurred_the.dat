5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} from New England and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid out so as to heavily favor the business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses. This plan and the philosophy behind it <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> growth of economic links between the communities and with {{other parts of the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|Just {{east of the}} {{district}} is the John F. Kennedy Expressway (MA 18), a limited-access highway {{which has become a}} barrier between {{the district}} and the neighboring waterfront, is still in use. Local preservationists have supported a plan to redesign the highway and restore access to the waterfront that <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> area's original development. The city received a $16.3 million grant to make this possible.|$|E
5|$|The club's strong {{record and}} {{regional}} visibility <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> growth of amateur and {{minor league baseball}} in the Youngstown area, and the community's minor league teams produced notable players throughout {{the first half of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, this tradition was rekindled, with the establishment of the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, a minor league team based in neighboring Niles, Ohio.|$|E

5|$|This element was {{the first}} one {{discovered}} by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity. Pitchblende, after removal of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium, was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined. This <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> Curies to search for additional radioactive elements. They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898, and five months later, also isolated radium.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan County brought ASL to Grundy {{in order}} to revitalize a town {{that had been in}} a steady {{economic}} decline since the town's Flood of 1977. ASL has brought a positive economic impact on its home town, including spurring construction of rental homes and the opening of additional businesses in the area. ASL has become a success story for the concept of higher education as an economic development tool. The school has brought in $12 million per year to the local economy. ASL's economic success <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> conception and implementation of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy (formerly University of Appalachia College of Pharmacy), which was founded in 2003 and opened its doors in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Defender was Williams Electronics' {{first attempt}} at {{developing}} a new video game; the company's earlier game was a Pong clone. The popularity of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games. The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record of Williams pinball games, to head development. Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis. At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded {{a large amount of}} creative freedom.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} announced the aviation deregulation policy, {{which makes it}} easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company. The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the country, as well as to serve and stimulate tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them Lion Air (est. 1999), Sriwijaya Air (est. 2003), Adam Air (operating from 2002 to 2008), and Batavia Air (operating from 2002 to 2013). The deregulation also <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> low-cost carrier service in Indonesia. Previously, air travel service was dominated by well-established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati.|$|E
5|$|In Leiden, the {{congregation}} gained {{the freedom to}} worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and the Separatists found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the Dutch language and customs, and some also entered the Dutch Army. The Puritans also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest William Brewster in 1618, after he published comments {{highly critical of the}} King of England and the Anglican Church. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> congregation to move farther from England.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{formation}} of a regional transit authority (RTA) <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> planning of a modern light rail system for Seattle. In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional light rail system to be built by 2010, including an at-grade or underground light rail line through the University District with a station near The Ave. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, with the University District as its northern terminus; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E

5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, later merging with a tropical wave on October15. The merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> formation of a broad area of low pressure. This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00UTC on October20; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. A mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path.|$|E
5|$|One {{week before}} the eruption, the Palace of Justice siege took place. The assailants (M-19 a Marxist, Terrorist Insurgency group) planned to hold a trial {{involving}} Colombian President Belisario Betancur. He refused to participate and sent the national army into the building. The attackers were holding several hundred hostages, including the 24 Supreme Court justices and 20 other judges. In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges). This disaster, coupled with the Armero tragedy, <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> Colombian government to predict and prepare for {{a broad range of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E

5|$|Reportedly, it was SK Ull's {{forays into}} the {{district}} around Holmenkollen for sporting purposes that <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> {{establishment of the}} new hill Holmenkollbakken in 1891. The knowledge of the area spurred Fritz R. Huitfeldt to pinpoint {{the location of the}} new hill, together with Hans Krag. This hill lay at a higher altitude than Kastellbakken, and thus had more favourable snow conditions. Holmenkollbakken quickly replaced Kastellbakken as the main hill in the district, and eventually became world-famous.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays {{argued against}} {{traditional}} Chinese beliefs in anatomy (such as his argument for two throat valves instead of three); this perhaps <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> {{interest in the}} performance of post-mortem autopsies in China during the 12th century. The physician and judge known as Song Ci (1186–1249) wrote a pioneering work of forensic science on the examination of corpses in order to determine cause of death (strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, suicide, or accidental death. Song Ci stressed the importance of proper coroner's conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the inquest of each autopsy by official clerks.|$|E

The coup was successful and overthrew the three-member regency: Prince Paul, Dr. Radenko Stanković and Dr. Ivo Perović, as well as the government of Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. Two days before the coup, the Cvetković government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact (Axis). The coup had been planned for several months, but the signing of the Tripartite Pact <b>spurred</b> <b>the</b> organisers to carry it out, encouraged by the British Special Operations Executive.|$|E
5|$|The GWR began {{experimenting with}} the {{electric}} lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated with Christmas lights that year.
