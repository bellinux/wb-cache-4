40|$|This thesis {{established}} a framework {{to assist in}} revealing {{the complexity of the}} integration role and as a consequence of this, foster a broader view of integration strategies than that provided by conventional functionalist approaches. The framework, termed <b>systemic</b> integration <b>analysis</b> (SIA), comprises four viewpoints: system, cybernetic, synergy and error. While being a synthesis of theoretical arguments from systems thinking, organisational theory and the reality of project management in construction, it was proposed that through their joint consideration a practitioners' perception and intervention in an organisational problem could be represented. This approach was shown to be reflected in the views of eighteen project managers which confirmed the framework as a valid proposition. The development of <b>systemic</b> integration <b>analysis</b> followed a three step process. Firstly, the determinants of the integration role, termed the integration environment, were identified as the characteristics of buildings, the nature of the construction industry, project organisation characteristics, and integration management approaches. Secondly, the integration environment was interpreted using organisational theory and systems thinking. Termed the integration context, integration was {{established a}}s a complex activity requiring an approach flexible as to the perception and ability to construct diverse integration strategies. Thirdly, recognising that the integration context is complex and exceeds the bounds of human rationality, <b>systemic</b> integration <b>analysis</b> was developed, proposed and examined as a framework for its interpretation. Propositions pertaining to the integration context and systemic integration were examined through eighteen semi-structured non-directional interviews with senior project managers in Melbourne, Australia. Employing a qualitative format, the features of systemic integration were indirectly examined, using findings from replicated data grounded in the interpretations and examples of the eighteen respondents' perceptions and experiences. Analysis showed that while a formal functionalist perception dominates integration literature, the investigations clearly and unanimously identified a scope and practice of integration management which incorporated multiple modes of perception i. e. a range of methodologies. This was complemented by the need to apply integration strategies that suited on methodological grounds the organisational problem. Seen as exhibiting a critical awareness in {{the development and implementation of}} integration strategies, these findings supported the systemic view of integration. Furthermore, the four features of <b>systemic</b> integration <b>analysis,</b> were shown to provide an extended and authentic interpretation of integration management. Sufficient evidence was established to warrant its further investigation and development as a framework for the support of integration management e. g. training, decision support, problem analysis, policy and strategy development.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE), Los Angeles, 17 - 21 th July. This paper is in closed access until 27 th June 2018. During the period 1996 - 2003 there were five fatal accidents on the UK railway network, three of which were Signals Passed at Danger (SPAD) events (Watford Junction, 1996; Southall, 1997; Ladbroke Grove, 1999). SPAD events vary in severity and whilst most are not fatal there is the potential to cause serious injuries to passengers and train staff and damage to railway infra-structure. This paper investigates how the current system accident analysis tool used within the railway, the Incident Factor Classification System (IFCS) identifies and analyses causal factors of SPAD events. To evaluate the effectiveness IFCS was used to analysis SPAD incident reports (n= 46) and the outputs were compared with two <b>systemic</b> accident <b>analysis</b> methods and relevant outputs (the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System – HFACS and Acci-Maps). The initial reporting process proved to hinder all <b>systemic</b> accident <b>analysis</b> methods in the extraction of causal factors. However, once extracted, all system accident analysis methods were successful in categorizing causal factors and demonstrated various outputs to illustrate the findings...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{orthodox}} Marxists, Berardi's autonomist theories draw on psychoanalysis, schizoanalysis {{and communication}} theory {{to show how}} subjectivity and desire are {{bound up with the}} functioning of the capitalism system, rather than portraying events such as the financial crisis of 2008 merely {{as an example of the}} inherently contradictory logic of capitalist accumulation. Thus, he argues against privileging labour in critique and says that [...] "the solution to the economic difficulty of the situation cannot be solved with economic means: the solution is not economic." [...] Human emotions and embodied communication becomes increasingly central to the production and consumption patterns that sustain capital flows in post-industrial society, and as such Berardi uses the concepts of [...] "cognitariat" [...] and [...] "info labour" [...] to analyze this psycho-social process. Among Berardi's other concerns are cultural representations and expectations about the future — from proto-Fascist Futurism to post-modern cyberpunk (1993). This represents a greater concern with ideas and cultural expectations than the determinist-materialist expression of a Marxism which is often confined to purely economic or <b>systemic</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Janowitz {{earned a}} bachelor's degree in {{economics}} from Washington Square College of New York University (New York University), where he studied under Sidney Hook, prominent pragmatist and former student of John Dewey. Hook exposed Janowitz to Dewey's philosophy of American pragmatism at an early age, {{though he did not}} fully explore pragmatism's philosophical foundations in sociology until after founding the Heritage of Sociology series at the University of Chicago(21). Sociology had been weakly tied to pragmatism at the Chicago School through George Herbert Mead and the theory of symbolic interaction, which emphasized a micro-social research agenda(25). Janowitz, however, an admirer of John Dewey, identified a broader meta-theoretical framework for sociological inquiry that rejected grand idealist theories about the ultimate truth of reality, focusing instead on [...] "social relations and contexts that were always overlapping and interpenetrating, leading empirically to a dynamic social organization which was never more than partially integrated or relatively autonomous. Society was characteristically an unsettled affair, creating problems of social control... Sociological inquiry, like all pragmatic inquiries, was thus part of a larger community of discourse" [...] (25). Janowitz also emphasized <b>systemic</b> <b>analysis,</b> attributed to Harold Laswell, which [...] "relies on overlapping hypotheses about differentiated, concrete objects of analysis embedded in a larger social setting"(26). Taken together, pragmatism effected Janowitz outlook {{in such a way that}} had the overall effect of linking data with theory and generating a research agenda focusing on experimental methods of empirical research(28).|$|E
