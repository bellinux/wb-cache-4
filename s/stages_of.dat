5|$|Although {{of little}} {{strategic}} value and undamaged {{during the early}} <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> World War II, in the final <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the war a number of V-1 flying bombs and V-2 ballistic missiles struck the area. The worst attack occurred in February 1945, when a V-2 struck Westbeech Road, killing 17 and injuring 68. The bombsites were redeveloped with housing in then-current styles, rather than to Plumbe and Earle's designs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> language development and <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E

This review highlights the use of EUS in the <b>staging</b> <b>of</b> gastrointestinal luminal malignancies and compares the performance of EUS with other imaging modalities (CT, MRI and PET-CT) in the <b>staging</b> <b>of</b> these malignancies.

50|$|Psychodrama {{has three}} {{important}} techniques: {{the technique of}} doubling, the technique of mirroring, and the technique of role reversal. Each technique represents different stages in Moreno's theory {{of the development of}} the infant: the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> identity (the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> doubling), the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the recognition of the self (the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> mirroring), and the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the recognition of the other (the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> role reversal). Role reversal requires that one has learned to differentiate in the areas of time, place and person, and is capable of moving out of his own position into another's position to be able to enact that other role.|$|R
5000|$|One {{should then}} {{take a look at}} the world of creation. It started out from the {{minerals}} and progressed, in an ingenious, gradual manner, to plants and animals. The last <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> minerals is connected with the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> plants, such as herbs and seedless plants. The last <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> plants, such as palms and vines, is connected with the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> animals, such as snails and shellfish which have only the power of touch. The word 'connection' with regard to these created things means that the last <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> each group is fully prepared to become the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the newest group.|$|R
5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> development. Each phase has associated risks. At the early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the periodization {{of the history}} of relations between the Soviet state and religious denominations. The author identified 11 stages in the development of these relations:: 1. 1917 - 1918 – a transitional stage that prepared the transition from old relations to new ones; 2. 1918 - 1929 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> development of new legislation on religious cults; 3. 1929 - 1934 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> completion of the development of legislation on cults; 4. 1934 - 1938 – the period of persecution, “The Great Terror”; 5. 1938 - 1943 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> easing of pressure and uncertainty; 6. 1943 - 1948 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> prosperity of relations {{between the state and the}} church; 7. 1948 - 1954 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> cooling relations between the state and religious cults; 8. 1954 - 1958 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> deterioration of relations between the state and cults; 9. 1958 - 1965 – a new <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> persecution; 10. 1966 - 1987 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> coexistence or stagnation; 11. 1988 - 1991 – the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> normalization of relations between the state and religions. The periodization is based on two principles: the first - the institution of power, responsible for the implementation of the religious policy of the state; the second - the legislative acts relating to the relations of the state and the church, adopted in the relevant era. This allows, on the one hand, to trace the logical chain of events in terms of the evolution of relations between the Soviet state and religious cults, and on the other hand, relieves of the need to consider these relations in a purely denominational aspect. ...|$|R
