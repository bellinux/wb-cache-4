40|$|International audienceGlobalization has {{provided}} opportunities for parasites/pathogens to cross geographic boundaries and expand to new hosts. <b>Nosema</b> <b>disease</b> {{is one of}} the most serious adult honey bee diseases and has high prevalence in honey bee colonies. For years, Nosema apis was thought to be the only microsporidian infecting domestic bee colonies. However, recently it was discovered that N. ceranae could cross the species barrier from Asian honey bees (Apis cerana) to European honey bees (Apis mellifera) that are widely used for crop pollination and honey production. Over the last few years, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of Nosema infections in honey bees. This review summarizes previous findings and recent progress in the understanding of Nosema infection of A. mellifera in the USA and Asia, with particular emphasis on the comparative epidemiological, morphological, pathological, and genomic organization of two Nosema species. The prospects of future research and remaining unresolved questions associated with the study of honey bee <b>Nosema</b> <b>diseases</b> are also discussed...|$|R

A total 5100 samples were used in this study. The microscopic examinations of the study suggested that there was existence of Nosema spores in Centrium, Mucur, Akpınar and Boztepe with 25 %, 23. 07 %, 12. 5 % and 60 %, respectively; whereas no spores were detected in Kaman province.

None ofthe tested substances showed an increased bee mortality or decreased bee preference, and were therefore considered suitable for further testing. In the second trial the effects of the natural compounds on nosema diseased honeybees were evaluated: bees were individually dosed with nosema spores and fed candies prepared with the screened substances. The results showed that bees fed with thymol and resveratrol candies had significantly lower infection rates, and bees supplied with resveratrol prepared candy also lived significantly longer.

40|$|A {{hypothesis}} {{is presented to}} explain the developments of epizootics of <b>nosema</b> <b>disease</b> of the honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus. It is assumed that most hives contain some lightly infected carrier bees in which the numbers of the parasite increase very slowly. But {{under the influence of}} certain conditions the parasites within these bees increase in numbers very quickly, and, if other conditions are favorable, an epizootic of the disease will develop. A hypothetical course of development of an epizootic is described. It is suggested that the numbers of the parasite increase when the metabolism of infected bees is changed so as to change the environment of the intracellular parasites. Changes in the metabolism of infected bees are considered to be stress reactions in the bees as a result of disruption of their behavior patterns when the hive is disturbed. Disturbances to the hive are considered to be due to management, weather, and other external factors...|$|R
40|$|A 2 -year {{survey of}} the {{incidence}} cf <b>nosema</b> <b>disease</b> of the honey bee in South Australia bas shown that a spring peak of infection may be expected each year. The level of infection is at a minimum in midsummer and winter but a rise may occur in the autumn. It was considered that the disease, either {{in the form of}} a few infected bees or of spores on the combs, was present in all hives throughout the survey. Significant differences in the level of infection between hives in the same apiary suggested that there may be factors, varying in some way from hive to hive, which determine the level of infection within each hive. In view of the appreciable variation between hives it is evident that the incidence of the disease in individual hives was estimated with unnecessarily high precision with samples of 100 bees, and that in future surveys samples of 20 to 25 bees would be adequate in most circumstances...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFumagillin (as the dicyclohexylammonium salt) {{has been}} found to be {{extremely}} unstable when solutions in 50 % ethanol are exposed to sunlight in small vials, undergoing a series of degradations with half-lives in the range of seconds to minutes. Similar results were obtained with photolyses of Fumidil B in either 50 % ethanol or sugar syrup. Decomposition also occurred in fluorescent room light. Exposure of fumagillin to sunlight for three days caused almost complete disappearance of UV absorption of fumagillin and all its immediate photoproducts. The reactions involved in the photolyses are apparently reversible Z:E rearrangements in the unsaturated ester portion of the molecule, and do not involve the pharmacologically active moiety. Samples of fumagillin in syrup, irradiated for 0, 0. 5, 5, 30, or 360 minutes were all effective in protecting caged bees from <b>nosema</b> <b>disease.</b> While long exposures to sunlight probably should be avoided, brief exposure causes no obvious loss of activity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activity in the midgut of nosema diseased honeybees. Nosema sp. spores were confirmed in 60 % of the coprologically examined individual honeybees. For laboratory testing 100 honeybees were collected randomly from three beehives. LAP enzyme activity in the midgut of the honeybees was assessed qualitatively, based on the intensity of staining in histological preparations. In bees in which the midgut coprological examination did not reveal Nosema sp. spores, the epithelial cells were red-purple stained, and all the layers of the walls of the midgut were visible. The intensity of honeybees naturally infected with microsporidia Nosema sp. increased while the intensity of the staining gradually decreased, showing progressively less pronounced LAP enzyme activity. Also there was an increasing number of damaged epithelial cells. Therefore, <b>nosema</b> <b>disease</b> can be considered as the disease of choice for studying LAP enzyme activity and determining the degree of microsporidium infection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} data {{following the}} periodic checking of fallen mites Varroa destructor {{to determine the}} mite fall, and the presence and number of Nosema ceranae spores in samples of bees, determined by counting prior to and after BeeCleanse treatments.

BeeCleanse is a natural preparation containing different herbal, vitamin, mineral and essential oil recipes. The aims of the study were to establish the dynamics of the fallen mites and determine Nosema spores before and after treating honeybee colonies in order to establish the effectiveness of BeeCleanse for the control of varroosis and <b>nosema</b> <b>disease</b> in colonies during the brood season in order to reduce parasite populations to tolerable levels.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relative}} {{effect of}} parasite levels, bee population size, and food reserves on winter mortality and post winter populations of honey bee colonies was estimated. More than 400 colonies were monitored throughout three seasons in Ontario, Canada. Most of the colonies were infested with varroa mites {{during the fall}} (75. 7 %), but only 27. 9 % and 6. 1 % tested positive to <b>nosema</b> <b>disease</b> and tracheal mites, respectively. Winter colony mortality was 27. 2 %, and when examined as a fraction of all morbidity factors, fall varroa mite infestations were {{the leading cause of}} colony mortality (associated to > 85 % of colony deaths), followed by fall bee populations and food reserves. Varroa-infested colonies, with weak populations and low food reserves in the fall, significantly decreased spring colony populations, whereas varroa infestations and Nosema infections in the spring, significantly decreased bee populations by early summer. Overall, results suggest that varroa mites could be the main culprit for the death and reduced populations of overwintered honey bee colonies in northern climates...|$|R
40|$|Microsporidiosis (<b>nosema</b> <b>disease)</b> of the European {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera L.) {{is present}} in bee colonies worldwide. Until recently, Nosema apis had been regarded as the causative agent of the disease, which may have many negative effects on the colony and cause heavy economic losses in apicultures. Another microsporidium species, Nosema ceranae, was reported to infest the Asian honeybee (Apis ceranae), but both honeybee species are susceptible to both microsporidia. In the European honeybee N. ceranae was first detected in Spain in the year 2006. As {{it is difficult to}} distinguish N. ceranae and N. apis morphologically, a rapid and accurate assay has been developed to differentiate N. apis and N. ceranae based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the partial large subunit ribosomal RNA. The assay was tested on 38 Nosema -infested bee samples, which were collected from geographically distant Hungarian bee colonies representing all regions of the country. Only one sample contained N. apis, and in the other 37 samples N. ceranae was detected, which indicates the dominance of N. ceranae in Hungarian apiaries. This is the first report on the presence of N. ceranae in Hungary...|$|R
40|$|Fumagillin is {{the only}} {{antibiotic}} approved for control of <b>nosema</b> <b>disease</b> in honey bees and has been extensively used in United States apiculture for more than 50 years for control of Nosema apis. It is toxic to mammals and must be applied seasonally and with caution to avoid residues in honey. Fumagillin degrades or is diluted in hives over the foraging season, exposing bees and the microsporidia to declining concentrations of the drug. We showed that spore production by Nosema ceranae, an emerging microsporidian pathogen in honey bees, increased in response to declining fumagillin concentrations, up to 100 % {{higher than that of}} infected bees that have not been exposed to fumagillin. N. apis spore production was also higher, although not significantly so. Fumagillin inhibits the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP 2) in eukaryotic cells and interferes with protein modifications necessary for normal cell function. We sequenced the MetAP 2 gene for apid Nosema species and determined that, although susceptibility to fumagillin differs among species, there are no apparent differences in fumagillin binding sites. Protein assays of uninfected bees showed that fumagillin altered structural and metabolic proteins in honey bee midgut tissues at concentrations that do not suppress microsporidia reproduction. The microsporidia, particularly N. ceranae, are apparently released from the suppressive effects of fumagillin at concentrations that continue to impact honey bee physiology. The current application protocol for fumagillin may exacerbate N. ceranae infection rather than suppress it...|$|R
40|$|Miniature inverted-repeat transposable {{elements}} (MITEs) are short, non-autonomous DNA transposons, {{which are}} widespread in most eukaryotic genomes. However, genome-wide identification, origin {{and evolution of}} MITEs remain largely obscure in microsporidia. In this study, we investigated structural features for de novo identification of MITEs in genomes of <b>silkworm</b> microsporidia <b>Nosema</b> bombycis and Nosema antheraeae, {{as well as a}} honeybee microsporidia Nosema ceranae. A total of 1490, 149 and 83 MITE-related sequences from 89, 17 and five families, respectively, were found in the genomes of the above-mentioned species. Species-specific MITEs are predominant in each genome of microsporidian Nosema, with the exception of three MITE families that were shared by N. bombycis and N. antheraeae. One or multiple rounds of amplification occurred for MITEs in N. bombycis after divergence between N. bombycis and the other two species, suggesting that the more abundant families in N. bombycis could be attributed to the recent amplification of new MITEs. Significantly, some MITEs that inserted into the homologous protein-coding region of N. bombycis were recruited as introns, indicating that gene expansion occurred during the evolution of microsporidia. NbS 31 and NbS 24 had polymorphisms in different geographical strains of N. bombycis, indicating that they could still be active. In addition, several small RNAs in the MITEs in N. bombycis are mainly produced from both ends of the MITEs sequence...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>Nosema</b> <b>disease,</b> tracheal mites and the “pseudo-parasitic” behaviour of Cape honeybee workers when placed amongst African honeybees – {{known as the}} Cape Bee Problem – were studied over a 18 month period. Three surveys, approximately 6 months apart were done. The aims {{of this study were}} to establish the distribution and severity of the diseases and compare the disease with the presence of the Cape Bee Problem. Before this survey commenced European Foul Brood <b>disease,</b> Sacbrood (virus), <b>Nosema,</b> Brood nosema, and Tracheal mite have sporadically been reported in the summer rainfall region of South Africa. In the first survey 1005 colonies in 61 apiaries were surveyed, 803 colonies in 57 apiaries in the second, and 458 colonies in 41 apiaries in the third. Samples for disease and parasite analysis were taken at 4 colonies per apiary. Ten colonies per apiary were inspected for Cape Problem Bees, and samples of workers were collected and dissected at each of these colonies. Even with the addition of apiaries to 'fill-up' lost colonies during the second survey, 63 % of all colonies were lost by the third survey. There was only a small difference in colony loss between sedentary and migratory beekeepers of 22 % compared to 27 %. Nosema was more prevalent amongst commercial beekeepers and increased in migratory operations during the survey period. The percentage of colonies infected increased during the survey period from 23 % to 32 % to 34 %. The placement of colonies in Eucalyptus plantations may boost infection. Trachea mites seem to have spread quite rapidly in South Africa since its discovery. This parasitic mite was present in all regions, although in low numbers in three most northern regions. Sedentary colonies had higher levels of infestation than migratory colonies. The number of colonies infested diminished over the survey period, which may be a result of general colony loss. The Cape Problem Bee was less of a problem than anticipated. Colonies succumbed to Cape Problem Bees in all regions. When beekeepers reported high levels of infestation in their bee stocks the colonies would be dead within six months. In apiaries with low infestation the die-out was slower...|$|R
40|$|Fumagillin (dicyclohexylammonium) is an {{antibiotic}} with well-known microsporicidal activity widely {{used to control}} <b>Nosema</b> <b>disease</b> caused by <b>Nosema</b> apis in honeybees. Its use is permitted by law in Argentine and USA, {{but not in the}} EU countries, apart from specific cases under veterinary authorization. So far, the optimal dosage of this active ingredient in controlling Nosema ceranae has not been determined. The aim of the present work was to assess the efficiency of different fumagillin dosages on Apis mellifera colonies affected by different N. ceranae intensity. For this purpose, during April and May of 2007, in an apiary located near the Mar del Plata city (Buenos Aires Province, Argentine), forty eight A. mellifera colonies reared in Langhstroth hives, each containing 8 to 10 adult bee combs, were used in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} different doses of fumagillin. The colonies were divided into those with mild or semi-severe disease intensity, based on the number of Nosema spores estimated in a sample of 60 returning bees (arb, spores abundance in returning bee). Then the colonies were randomly distributed forming 6 experimental groups (3 with mild intensity: one untreated left as control and the other two treated with 102 mg of fumagillin in two and three doses, respectively; 3 with semi-severe intensity: treated with 102 mg of fumagillin in two and three doses, and with 120 mg of fumagillin in four doses, respectively). Each dose was administered at intervals of 7 days. Before and during each administration, for a period of 35 days, the number of frames covered with adult bees was recorded in each hive and a sample of 100 workers per colony was collected from the hive entrance in order to determine the abundance (arb) and prevalence (prb) of spores. This alternative parameter (prb) was calculated by examining a sub-sample of 10 bees, crushing the propodeum of the bees in 0. 5 ml distilled water, taking a drop of suspension and observing 20 fields under a optic microscope (450 x) for spore absence (0) or presence (1); then the estimation of spores prevalence (prb) was recorded as percentage of spore presence in the 20 observed fields, and the average of two estimates were used. Moreover, spores from 5 randomly selected colonies were molecularly characterized to confirm the Nosema species. The sequencing results showed a 98 % of homology with N. ceranae. The results obtained allow to establish that the efficiency of fumagillin in controlling Nosemosis type C caused by N. ceranae is affected by the intensity of the disease rather than from dosage or way of application. The best result was obtained when colonies were affected by a mild intensity and the drug was administered in two weekly doses of 51 mg per hive...|$|R

Percent of <b>Nosema</b> infection (<b>disease</b> incidence) on the DBM larvae was much higher in CH (73. 1 %) than in SG (10 %). The disease was prevalence in the highland cabbage fields or in low temperature environment. Although the percent of infection on DBM pupae showed a similar trend as for larvae, the difference was much smaller (13. 3 % and 8 % in CH and SG respectively). This suggests that many infected DBM larvae in the CH had failed to develop and form DBM pupae. The infection intensity (number of spores per larva or pupa) {{and the range of}} infection intensity also showed similar trend as the percent of disease infection. More than 70 and 85 % of DBM eggs and larvae, respectively, of the laboratory culture were infected by N. bombycis.

They can be an advantageous strategy promoting high encounter rates with rare cues that may indicate prey items, mating partners or navigational landmarks. The robustness of this behavioural strategy to ubiquitous threats to animal performance, such as pathogens, remains poorly understood. Using honeybees radar-tracked during their orientation flights in a novel landscape, we assess for the first time how two emerging infectious <b>diseases</b> (<b>Nosema</b> sp. and the Varroa-associated Deformed wing virus (DWV)) affect bees' behavioural performance and search strategy. Nosema infection, unlike DWV, affected the spatial scale of orientation flights, causing significantly shorter and more compact flights. However, in stark contrast to disease-dependent temporal fractals, we find the same prevalence of optimal Lévy flight characteristics (μ[*]≈[*] 2) in both healthy and infected bees. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of these surprising insights, arguing that Lévy search patterns are an emergent property of fundamental characteristics of neuronal and sensory components of the decision-making process, making them robust against diverse physiological effects of pathogen infection and possibly other stressors.

40|$|Chalk brood is {{a disease}} of {{honeybee}} larvae caused by the fungus Ascosphdera apis, which causes the death and mummification of sealed honeybee brood, and with the consequent weakness of the colony. It is widespread amongst honeybees in Europe and North America. In Africa the only report of chalk brood has been from Tunisia (Heath, 1985). The disease is spread by robbing, drifting bees and by the normal practices of beekeeping (Warhurst, 1998). Ascosphaera apis produces sticky spores, which are commonly present on adult bees and all surfaces within occupied hives. The disease develops only if the brood is physiologically stressed in some way, for example chilling. In Ethiopia, the existence of two adult honeybee <b>diseases</b> <b>Nosema</b> apis and Melpighamoebae me/// 7 /'caand their distribution was studied and reported (Gezahegn & Amsalu, 1991; Desalegn & Amsalu, 1999). Until now {{there has been no}} record on the existence of any honeybee brood diseases in the country. Materials and methods The survey transects and beekeepers to be surveyed were selected randomly. A survey was carried out around the Holetta area on beekeeper's colonies, and at Gedo demonstration site about 150 km west of Holetta. Following the brood rearing season October 2000 to January 2001, 276 colonies at 13 survey sites were inspected externally and internally for signs of chalk brood disease. Colonies showing any symptoms of chalk brood: dead infected larvae left uncapped by nurse bees in the comb cells, and mummies at the hive entrances, on the hive floor and on the ground perpendicular to the hive opening, were examined. From 13 apiary sites, larval mummies were collected from eight apiaries that were found to display positive signs of the disease. Overall 240 black mummies of honeybee larvae from 48 bee colonies (five per colony) were collected. Each mummy was macerated separately in a sterile mortar with distilled water to prepare suspensions containing Ascosphaera apis from each site.
