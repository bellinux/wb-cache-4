5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and <b>sardines.</b> Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, stargazey pie {{and other}} variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or <b>sardines),</b> along with eggs and potatoes, {{covered with a}} pastry crust.

This allows the oils released during cooking to flow back into the pie.|$|E
5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and <b>sardines.</b> During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. In the 1950 s the Pacific <b>sardine</b> collapsed, and {{the fishery}} {{declined}} from a historical peak of over 600, 000 metric tons in 1936 {{to less than}} 100, 000 tons after 1951 and was virtually nonexistent for 25 years (1965 - 90). Despite this, the landings of <b>sardine</b> predators increased after the <b>sardine</b> collapse and fell as the <b>sardine</b> stock recovered. Using an error correction model it is nevertheless possible to identify individual species on which the <b>sardine</b> collapse has a discernible and expected effect. According to this, the landings of seven species (barracuda, bluefin tuna, giant sea bass, sheephead, skipjack tuna, white sea bass, and yellowtail) {{can be expected to}} decline with the <b>sardine</b> stock, but the effects are small. It is hypothesized that variations in the <b>sardine</b> stock mainly affects noncommercial predators such as marine mammals and especially sea birds. This poses severe challenges to an ecosystem-based management of the <b>sardine</b> fishery...|$|R
40|$|Further {{work in the}} {{development}} of OMP- 13 has continued with modifications to the documentation and code, mostly to allow for a generalisation towards one or two <b>sardine</b> stocks and one or two directed <b>sardine</b> TACs (de Moor and Butterworth 2013 a).

5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, <b>sardines</b> and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E

40|$|A {{question}} that has been raised is whether the rapid decline in the <b>sardine</b> abundance after 2002 can be attributed either in part or in full to the relatively large <b>sardine</b> catches {{in the early part}} of this decade.

5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: <b>sardines,</b> herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it {{took more}} than 24hours for word of the level of devastation to reach {{officials}} in Manila as communications across Leyte were largely destroyed. By November7, search and rescue operations were underway across Leyte and Negros Occidental. The first shipment of relief supplies, consisting of food rations, rice, <b>sardines,</b> and used clothing, was to be shipped from Cebu later that day. On November8, Philippine President Corazon Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area. A Philippine Navy vessel set out with heavy earth-moving machinery and the Philippine Air Force deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts. Relief efforts in Ormoc City were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel. Amateur radio reports stated that an AC-130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked. Relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region. By November11, approximately 8,300families had been rescued and another 7,521were evacuated from affected regions.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, <b>sardines,</b> herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E

On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon {{for up to three}} weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, <b>sardines,</b> and coffee to many affected houses.

25|$|Food {{problems}} {{may be the}} cause of an observed failure of the birds to even try to breed. The results of the research suggest this is related to a decline in <b>sardines</b> (Sardinops sagax), {{an important part of the}} boobies’ diet. Earlier work on Española Island saw successful breeding in blue-footed boobies that have access to <b>sardines,</b> in which case their diet consists essentially wholly of <b>sardines.</b> However, <b>sardines</b> have been largely absent from the Española area since 1997, as has been shown from Nazca boobies there, who also prefer <b>sardines</b> but can breed using other prey. In 2012–13, roughly only half of prey items in the boobies' diet were <b>sardines.</b> No evidence was seen of other possible causes for the decline, such as effects of humans, introduced predators, or disease.|$|E
40|$|The {{mortality}} rates of Pacific <b>sardine,</b> Sardinops sagax caerulea, larvae (< 20 d) increased during 1951 - 67, and this increase {{was positively correlated}} with the increase in biomass of northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax. Other potential correlates with larval <b>sardine</b> {{mortality rates}} were examined using multiple correlation. These included temperature and zooplankton volumes at stations positive for <b>sardine</b> larvae, water column stability, upwelling, transport, salinity anomalies, and Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus, abundance. None contributed signifi-cantly to the multiple regression with anchovy abundance. Thus, no evidence existed for either Lasker’s stable ocean hypothesis of larval mortality or Hjort‘s larval transport hypothesis. The logarithm of the ratio of <b>sardine</b> recruits at age 2 to the spawning biomass was used as an index of recruitment success. <b>Sardine</b> recruitment success at age 2 was not correlated with larval mortality rates. <b>Sardine</b> recruitment, however, was negatively correlated with both northern anchovy biomass and the combined biomass of Pacific <b>sardine,</b> Pacific mackerel, and northern anchovy. A plausible explanation for this result is that predation by pelagic fishes results in greater mortality rates of <b>sardine</b> larvae and juveniles which in turn decrease <b>sardine</b> recruitment.
