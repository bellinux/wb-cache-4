5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance {{brought him a}} number of large military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post.

Andrew, who had been widowed, married the 23-year-old Beatrice D'Este on 14 May 1234, even though his <b>sons</b> <b>were</b> sharply opposed to his third marriage. John, Bishop of Bosnia, put Hungary under a new interdict {{in the first half}} of 1234, because Andrew had not {{dismissed}} his non-Christian officials despite his oath of Bereg. Andrew and Archbishop Robert of Esztergom protested against the bishop's act at the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|Han society {{below the}} level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain {{privileges}} such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a marquess and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate (houguo 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' <b>sons</b> <b>were</b> grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, they were considered commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC so that all the kings' <b>sons</b> <b>were</b> made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor was the equivalent of a county Prefect.|$|E

5|$|In 616 or 617, Rædwald {{assembled}} an {{army and}} marched north, {{accompanied by his}} son Rægenhere, to confront Æthelfrith.

The battle was fierce and was long commemorated in the saying, ‘The river Idle was foul with the blood of Englishmen’. During the fighting, Æthelfrith and Rædwald's son Rægenhere were both slain.

5|$|In England, Earl Godwin died in 1053 and his <b>sons</b> <b>were</b> {{increasing}} in power: Harold succeeded to his father's earldom, and another son, Tostig, became Earl of Northumbria. Other <b>sons</b> <b>were</b> granted earldoms later: Gyrth as Earl of East Anglia in 1057 and Leofwine as Earl of Kent some time between 1055 and 1057. Some sources claim that Harold {{took part in}} William's Breton campaign of 1064 and that Harold swore to uphold William's claim to the English throne {{at the end of}} the campaign, but no English source reports this trip, and it is unclear if it actually occurred. It may have been Norman propaganda designed to discredit Harold, who had emerged as the main contender to succeed King Edward. Meanwhile, another contender for the throne had emerged– Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside and a grandson of Æthelred II, returned to England in 1057, and although he died shortly after his return, he brought with him his family, which included two daughters, Margaret and Christina, and a son, Edgar the Ætheling.|$|E
