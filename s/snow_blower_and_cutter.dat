500|$|To build a {{permanent}} airfield at Troll, the Norwegian Polar Institute bought a snow groomer and a tracked vehicle with a <b>snow</b> <b>blower,</b> flatbed <b>and</b> ice <b>cutter.</b> The works was organized with a land-based Global Positioning System laser system. In {{the course of}} the 2002 season, [...] of runway had been built. This included removing of surface rocks and filling any crevasses. The construction also included necessary ground facilities, such as a fire- and rescue service, communications, ground handling and overnight facilities at Troll for personnel who could be stranded because of bad weather. The construction involved the moving of [...] of ice and snow.|$|R

The tower is staffed by SERCO contract air traffic controllers.|$|R
50|$|The Holiday Blizzard II {{was another}} intense snow storm. This storm was arguably {{more intense than}} the first, but hit a much less {{populated}} region. The storm struck Colorado on December 28 and December 29. Coming so soon after the first blizzard and forecast to be another major storm, the approach of this storm prompted runs on grocery stores, hardware stores (for <b>snow</b> shovels, <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> <b>and</b> generators, among other items) as residents prepared to be snowed in for a second time. Due to the previous heavy snowfalls and lack of snow removal on many residential streets (still nearly impassable from the first storm) were unmanageable.|$|R
5000|$|Ariens Company is a Brillion, Wisconsin-based {{equipment}} {{company which}} {{has a long history}} manufacturing <b>snow</b> <b>blowers,</b> lawn tractors, <b>and</b> zero-turn lawn mowers for commercial and high-end consumer markets. Ariens touts itself as being the [...] "mower of the White House lawn," [...] "official <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> of Lambeau Field," [...] and the [...] "King of Snow".|$|R
50|$|When {{the airport}} was {{originally}} constructed {{there was no}} provision for dedicated maintenance vehicles {{and they had to}} be shared with the community. This meant that after a blizzard the bulldozer and grader had just enough time to clear the road and runway before they had to return to town. This left the runway with 6 ft high snow banks on either side, which caused the runway to fill in quickly with snow due to the almost constant winds that blow in the arctic. This then resulted in a high cost snow removal operation. The maintenance equipment would be run for almost 24 hours as a team of operators would push the snow back from the runway. After a few years a <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> <b>and</b> plow-truck were purchased and a garage built to house them.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{establishment}} of a new weather station and the base now rebuilt, Nord was reopened in August 1975 by the Danish Defense Command (DDC) as a military base for a trial period. The station was recognized as important as a gateway to otherwise- inaccessible parts of northern Greenland and was made permanent. [...] Today the operation of the station is under the responsibility of the Joint Arctic Command (Arktisk Kommando), but is manned on a daily basis with personnel from the three services and five volunteers are stationed there 26 months at a time with a 3-5 weeks leave period in the middle. [...] The landing strip is kept open for approximately 300 days a year and is maintained with two large <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> <b>and</b> two <b>snow</b> plows.|$|R
5000|$|In the munitions depots of the German Federal Navy (...) , narrow-gauge {{railways}} with a {{rail gauge}} of [...] {{were used to}} move ammunition and materiel. In the depot at Laboe type S 14 (...) rail profiles were laid and later changed to new S 20 (...) rails [...] One type DS 60 locomotive and 18 DIEMA DS 90 locomotives were used. The railway stock there also included a fire fighting train, a <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> <b>and</b> even a rotary snow plough. Three seated coaches were available for the transport of personnel. The line at Aurich depot was closed in 1982 and last operations in Laboe took place in 1993. Finally, in December 1996, the Laboe railway was closed. Its total track length was 25 km. A DS 90 locomotive, no. 9, {{is still in the}} depot at Laboe as a memorial.|$|R
50|$|In early 2010, a joint FBI and Federal Bureau of Prisons {{investigation}} found that Dimorio McDowell, an inmate at FCI Fort Dix, was operating a major identity theft ring from the prison. Eight co-conspirators, with whom McDowell communicated by telephone, were also arrested. The ring targeted credit cards issued by major chain {{stores such as}} Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Staples, Home Depot, Lowes and others. McDowell and his co-conspirators obtained the personal information of credit card holders through customer service departments and added themselves as authorized users. When McDowell's co-conspirators went to make purchases, they showed false identification or provided the last four digits of the cardholder's Social Security number and charged high-end items such as a John Deere tractor, big-screen televisions, <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> <b>and</b> stoves. The companies that issued the cards, including Citigroup Financial, HSBC and GE Capital, lost between $500,000 to $1 million.|$|R
5000|$|Self-propelled {{on-track}} {{steel and}} rubber tired [...] "Hy-Rail" [...] equipment {{can also be}} employed to remove snow from railroad tracks. The Pettibone Speed Swing loader and similar machines, both with and without hyrail wheels can be fitted with a large capacity snow bucket or a wedge plow to clear the tracks. Ballast regulators, machines designed to shape {{the profile of the}} crushed stone ballast that anchors the track in place, can be used without modification or refitted with purpose built <b>snow</b> blades, <b>blowers</b> <b>and</b> wings to clear snow from the right of way.|$|R
50|$|By analogy, {{the term}} {{may also be}} applied to a row of any other {{material}} such as snow, earth or materials for collection. Snow windrows are created by snow plows when clearing roads of snow; where this blocks driveways the windrow may require removal. Snow windrowed to {{the centre of the}} street can be removed by a <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> <b>and</b> truck. In preparing a pond or lake for ice cutting, the snow on top of the ice, which slows freezing, may be scraped off and windrowed.Earth windrows may be formed by graders when grading earthworks or dirt roadsLeaf windrows may be required for municipal collection.Fossil windrows, also 'gyres', are a grouping of fossils that have been deposited together as a result of turbulence or wave action in a marine or freshwater environment. Fossils of similar shape and size are commonly found grouped or sorted together as a result of separation based on weight and shape. Seaweed windrows form on sea or lake surfaces because of cylindrical Langmuir circulation just under the surface caused by wind action.Windrow composting is a large scale vermicomposting system where garden and other biodegradable waste is shredded, mixed and windrowed for composting.|$|R
40|$|Safe {{tips for}} snow removal using snow shovels, {{snowblowers}} and powered blades or sweepers {{are covered in}} this NebGuide. As the temperature drops and the grounds maintenance equipment is stored for the winter, position the snow removal equipment for quick access, and start thinking about snow removal safety. About half the accidents involving snow removal equipment happen to first-time users or those using the equipment {{for the first time}} each winter. Snow removal equipment falls in one of three groups: 1) the snow shovel, 2) the <b>snow</b> thrower or <b>blower,</b> <b>and</b> 3) the powered blade or sweeper...|$|R
50|$|The blue ice runway is groomed by {{the camp}} staff using {{commercial}} lightweight <b>snow</b> ploughs <b>and</b> <b>blowers</b> {{which could be}} shipped in by Dash 7 aircraft. When the wind is favourable, and the conditions good, a runway 1.2 km in length and 50 m wide is possible. However, operations are often hampered by much lighter winds causing knee high snow drifts which reduce contrast.The runway is marked by flags to improve contrast for approaching planes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>blowers</b> can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} two classes: single-stage and two-stage. On a single-stage <b>snow</b> <b>blower,</b> the auger (the paddle mechanism visible from the front) pulls snow into the machine and directs it out of a discharge chute. The auger contacts the ground, making single-stage <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> unsuitable for use on unpaved surfaces. On a two-stage <b>snow</b> <b>blower,</b> the auger pulls snow into the machine and feeds it into a high-speed impeller, which in turn directs it out of a discharge chute. Two-stage <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> can generally handle deeper snow depths than single-stage ones, and because their augers don't touch the ground, they can be used on unpaved surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Many {{occupational}} noise exposure {{studies have been}} conducted in various occupational sectors. However, in Malaysia, there are limited numbers of study on grass <b>cutter</b> workers <b>and</b> there is no study on leaf blower workers. Thus, this preliminary study was conducted to assess both {{occupational noise}} exposure among leaf <b>blower</b> <b>and</b> grass <b>cutter</b> workers by measuring occupational noise exposure, determining sound power level of the machines and conducting interview session. A total of 20 workers were selected from a public university as study subjects. Noise dosimeter and sound level meter were used to measure the occupational noise exposure and sound pressure level of all machines in determining their sound power levels respectively. Most of the workers were exposed to daily noise dose and time-weighted average (TWA) noise level which exceed the permissible limits. All machines recorded a high sound power level and several workers showed prevalence symptoms of hearing loss. This preliminary study revealed that most of the workers are exposed to excessive occupational noise exposure and at high risk of acquiring noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of June each year, the line could be reopened. <b>Snow</b> ploughs <b>and</b> <b>blowers</b> needed {{to be used for}} that purpose. On many occasions, the snow depths in the narrow alpine valleys were so great that the snow had to be removed by hand over many shifts, and with heavy {{construction}} equipment, until the FO's snow removal vehicles could be used. The construction equipment had to be transported on open rail wagons to the places where they were required. By these means, the line could be reopened two weeks earlier, but at a high price.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example is}} {{lubricating}} oil for four-stroke or four-cycle internal combustion engines {{such as those}} used in portable electricity generators and [...] "walk behind" [...] lawn mowers. Another example is two-stroke oil for lubrication of two-stroke or two-cycle internal combustion engines found in <b>snow</b> <b>blowers,</b> chain saws, model air planes, gasoline powered gardening equipment like hedge trimmers, leaf <b>blowers</b> <b>and</b> soil cultivators. Often, these motors are not exposed to as wide service temperature ranges as in vehicles, so these oils may be single viscosity oils.|$|R
500|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>blowers,</b> {{also known}} as {{rotating}} snowplows or snow cutters, {{can be used in}} place of snowplows on winter service vehicles. A <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> consists of a rapidly spinning auger which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached {{to the top of the}} <b>blower.</b> <b>Snow</b> <b>blowers</b> typically clear much faster than plows, with some clearing in excess of [...] of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplow can. In addition, <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> can remove <b>snow</b> from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road, making passage easier for other road users and preventing the windrow from blocking driveways.|$|R

50|$|Glass {{making in}} Tyrone dates {{back as far}} as 1771, when Benjamin Edwards founded a company in county Tyrone, Ireland. Tyrone Crystal was set up two hundred years later in 1971, by Father Austin Eustace to create {{employment}} in the Dungannon area of County Tyrone. There was not a lot of employment in the area at the time and nobody in the area knew anything about making crystal. An advertisement was placed in a national newspaper, seeking someone who could train people in the area. Two Austrians, a master <b>blower</b> <b>and</b> a master <b>cutter,</b> were hiking across England and read the advertisement; they came over to train the employees. Trainees began practising on glass jars and bottles until they became skilled enough to make crystal on their own, and they set up a glass blowing shop in Dungannon.|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission {{estimates}} that each year {{there are approximately}} 5,740 snowblower related injuries in the United States which require medical attention. One problem with {{the design of the}} <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> is that <b>snow</b> can build up in the auger, jamming it and stalling the motor. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} the auger could deform before applying enough resistance to the motor to turn it off. If the jam is cleared by hand, it is possible for the auger to return to its natural shape suddenly and with great force, possibly injuring the user; <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> are a leading cause of traumatic hand and finger amputations. The correct procedure is to turn off the engine, disengage the clutch and then clear the jam with a broom handle or other long object. In an effort to improve safety, many manufacturers now include a plastic tool to be used to clear jams, often mounted directly to the <b>snow</b> <b>blower.</b>|$|R
