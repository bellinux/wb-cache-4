5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase.</b> The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E

25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} included Holden 2-4-2T tank {{engines and}} Hill 0-6-2T tank engines {{built by the}} GER, and carriages were usually of the <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> type, up to 16 per train.|$|E
50|$|Flatland bikes {{typically}} have a <b>shorter</b> <b>wheelbase</b> than other freestyle bikes. This <b>shorter</b> <b>wheelbase</b> requires less {{effort to make}} the bike spin or to position the bike on one wheel. One of the primary reasons flatlanders often ride only flatland is the decreased stability of using their shorter bikes on ramps, dirt and street.|$|R

25|$|The {{fourteen}} engines {{purchased by}} the Southern Railway in 1946 remained in service well into the 1960s. Designed to be extremely strong but easy to maintain, these engines had a very <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> {{that allowed them to}} operate on dockyard railways.|$|E
25|$|With such <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase,</b> {{motorcycles}} {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel, and enough stopping force at the front wheel, to lift the opposite wheel off the road. These actions, if performed on purpose, are known as wheelies and stoppies (or endos) respectively.|$|E
25|$|The M4B's Grand Prix debut came at Monaco, {{where its}} <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> made it {{surprisingly}} competitive. McLaren ran {{as high as}} third before a pit stop to replace a flat battery dropped him back to fourth at the finish - the first points scored by a McLaren chassis that season.|$|E

50|$|The {{frame was}} lighter and more compact than the 2006 CBR600RR. The {{handling}} of the new bike was sharpened by its 22 mm <b>shorter</b> <b>wheelbase,</b> {{as well as by}} the designer's focus on strict mass centralization. Despite the <b>shorter</b> <b>wheelbase,</b> the 2007 model's swingarm was 5 mm longer than that of the 2006, made possible by the more compact dimensions of the new bike's engine.|$|R
25|$|The {{class was}} {{initially}} used intensively on London suburban services, but {{began to be}} replaced on these as early as 1897 {{by the introduction of}} the more powerful Drummond M7 and T1 classes. As a result, the O2s were cascaded to lighter services, and became distributed throughout the LSWR system, being of particular use on restricted branch lines due to their relatively low weight and <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Peugeot 104 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} European small cars of the 1970s but it was starting to show its age against more modern rivals by the turn of the 1980s. When Peugeot launched the stylish all-new 205 in 1983, the 104 was withdrawn from most European markets, including Britain. But it continued in France as a budget choice until production finally ceased in May 1988 after 16 years in which time 1,624,992 Peugeot 104s had been built. 345,849 of these were the <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> Coupé versions.|$|E
500|$|Maunsell’s {{original}} {{plan was to}} use large-wheeled 2-6-4 tank engines for this purpose, but the Sevenoaks railway accident made him have second thoughts. He therefore chose a relatively <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> 4-4-0 design although by this period 4-6-0 was more usual {{for this type of}} work. Authorities disagree as to whether Maunsell had in mind the restricted loading gauge of the Tonbridge to Hastings line when he designed the class, or whether this was an [...] "unexpected bonus" [...] when he was forced to substitute a [...] "King Arthur" [...] round-topped firebox to his planned Belpaire design to reduce the axle load on the driving wheels to acceptable limits. In either event the class was undoubtedly Maunsell’s most immediately successful design, and the locomotives did some of their best work on the Hastings route.|$|E

2500|$|The J class {{adopted an}} {{alternative}} approach to the problem by utilising a high-set boiler (with the boiler centre [...] above rail level, compared with [...] for the K class) setting the firebox above the frames and driving wheels, and retaining the K class' <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Two similar {{engineer}} {{bodies were}} standard on <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> chassis.

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the speedy overhaul of these locomotives in the confined spaces of Nine Elms, spare boilers were constructed. Coupled to a <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> and guiding bogies, the locomotive was relatively manoeuvrable on tight curves, a feature that was to ensure the survival {{of some of the}} class later on.|$|E

Both sides had sideboards with fold down troop seats and bows for a tarpaulin. Two spare tires were mounted inside the body, one along each side. Early models had all steel bodies, in 1942 they were replaced by largely wood types to conserve steel. All Corbitts (3,077) were prime movers, White also built 3,547.|$|E
2500|$|The basic cargo {{model was}} a prime mover used to tow the M114 155 mm {{howitzer}} and transport gun crews, equipment, and ammunition.

50|$|The ZIL-117 was a short-chassis sedan {{version with}} only five seats {{and a much}} <b>shorter</b> <b>wheelbase.</b> It was also {{available}} as an unusual four-door convertible (like the ZIL-111V).|$|R
50|$|The coupe {{version of}} the Nissan Altima (codename D32) was officially {{revealed}} at the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show, Nissan's first-ever two-door Altima.

2500|$|In September 1988, the new CN11S Fronte debuted.

Apart from the very cheapest variants, the Fronte got front disc brakes and 12inch radial tyres. The Fronte also received the 547cc 12-valve SOHC F5B engine from the Suzuki Cervo, developing [...] at a lively 7500rpm. There was no three-door version this time, but a 4WD variant (CP11) was available.|$|E
2500|$|Britain's Royal Mail {{commissioned}} {{and built}} the first Travelling Post Office cars in the late 1840s as well. [...] These cars resembled coaches in their <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase</b> and exterior design, but were equipped with nets {{on the sides of}} the cars to catch mail bags while the train was in motion. [...] American RPOs, first appearing in the 1860s, also featured equipment to catch mail bags at speed, but the American design more closely resembled a large hook that would catch the mailbag in its crook. [...] When not in use, the hook would swivel down against the side of the car to prevent it from catching obstacles.|$|E
2500|$|The FJ Cruiser {{features}} a <b>short</b> <b>wheelbase,</b> stocky frame, and grille-headlight arrangement {{much like the}} original FJ40. Other throwback design cues include a nearly vertical windshield with three windshield wipers for maximum surface area coverage. The FJ Cruiser also featured the name [...] "Toyota" [...] spelled out across the grille instead of the corporate emblem {{which has been in}} use since 1990, another reference to the FJ40 and other older Toyota trucks. The FJ's body features rear opening access doors that give a unique look to the SUV. Special high-strength steel was used to give the vehicle side impact protection without the need for a door pillar.|$|E
50|$|To reduce flange {{and rail}} wear, the bogies of both {{series of the}} Class 7E2 have a <b>shorter</b> <b>wheelbase</b> than the Class 7E, 4060 mm instead of 4400 mm.|$|R
