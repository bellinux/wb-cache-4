25|$|Among {{the victims}} were the suspect's mother, and {{relatives}} from his maternal side: grandmother, uncle, and two cousins, as well as Andrea and Corinne Myers, the neighbor wife and daughter of the deputy sheriff, Josh Myers. Only the four-month-old Ella Myers, who was wounded, survived McLendon's shooting of the people <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Myers' four-year-old son was in the house, but survived unharmed. His uncle and aunt had largely raised McLendon. His victims {{ranged in age from}} 18 months to 74 years old.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Williams {{was wounded}} in a drive-by {{shooting}} in Compton {{by members of the}} Bloods. While <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of his house one evening as he'd let his dog out for a walk, a carload of Bloods drove by the house and opened fire on Williams. Attempting to avoid getting hit, Williams dove from the porch and {{was wounded in}} both of his legs. Despite being told by doctors that he would never walk again, Williams began a nearly year-long process of physical rehabilitation and an intense workout regimen, ultimately regaining his ability to walk.|$|E
25|$|McLendon {{began his}} attacks about 3:30p.m. on March 10, 2009 at his mother's house {{where they lived}} in Kinston, a town of 540 residents. McLendon shot and killed his mother and their three dogs, and set the {{interior}} of the house on fire. He drove to his uncle's house in the small city of Samson, population about 2,000. There he shot his uncle, two cousins, a neighbor, and said neighbor's infant daughter, all of whom were <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of his uncle and aunt's house. His aunt escaped the shooting uninjured because she was inside the house, while the neighbor's four-month-old daughter survived her gunshot wounds. McLendon went next door and shot and killed his maternal grandmother.|$|E

25|$|The artwork was {{revealed}} on September 20, 2013 on Eminem's Twitter account. The cover features {{a picture of}} the house Eminem lived in during his teenage years, although now the house is in a dilapidated state. It is very similar in design to the cover of the artwork from The Marshall Mathers LP; which also features {{a picture of the}} house, but with Eminem <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> the windows uncovered and the door replaced by a screen door. On October 25, 2013, the artwork for the deluxe edition {{was revealed}}. The deluxe artwork is a variation of the standard artwork, in which the house is being looked at through a car window. On the internet, there are many other covers. For example, Eminem sitting at the doorstep of the house and on the door it is written, '19946'. In November 2013, the house went up in flames for unknown reasons, damaging the upper portion of the home. As of 2014, the house had been demolished and plans to rebuild are in progress. The deluxe edition comes with two discs, one being the standard album, and the other containing bonus tracks. The discs' artwork is designed after the Detroit city seal and flag, respectively. The album's artwork direction was handled by Mike Saputo, with photography by Kevin Mazur. In December 2013, the album cover was named the tenth best of 2013 by Complex.|$|E
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{released}} on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, and Eminem's newly founded label, Shady Records in the United States, and on September 11, 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP {{was released}} with two different album covers. The original features Eminem <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, [...] "I had mixed feelings because I {{had a lot of}} good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. [...] " [...] The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a [...] "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: [...] "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked." ...|$|E

50|$|The design {{attempts}} to balance community life and personal privacy. The community layout and homes were designed {{with the concept}} of a privacy gradient, where privacy increases as one goes {{toward the back of the}} house. For example, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> one's front porch is an invitation to socialize, while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch</b> does not. Kitchen windows are in the front of every house.|$|R

60|$|Bertha was in {{the yard}} when they rode up to the gate next morning. Dressed in a white sweater and a short skirt, and holding {{biscuits}} for a handsome collie to snatch from her hand, she made a charming picture of young and vigorous life.

60|$|Save for {{the rise}} and fall of her {{shoulders}} she seemed calm. The path wound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in front of the house.

When he saw the two, he rose expectantly, and went forward to meet them. Virginia stopped before him.|$|E

She was of mighty frame and stature; she was sixty years old, but her eye was undimmed and her {{strength}} unabated. She was a cheerful, hearty soul, and it was no more trouble for her to laugh than it is for a bird to sing. She was under fire now, as usual when the day was done. That is to say, she was being chaffed without mercy, and was enjoying it.

60|$|Nor {{was this}} the only aspect of the {{situation}} that pleased Nutty.

Bill and Elizabeth were getting on splendidly. They were together all the time--walking, golfing, attending to the numerous needs of the bees, or <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Nutty's imagination began to run away with him. He seemed to smell the scent of orange-blossoms, to hear the joyous pealing of church bells--in fact, with the difference that it was not his own wedding that he was anticipating, he had begun to take very much the same view of the future that was about to come to Dudley Pickering.|$|E

That is, everything that had happened from the time I first left Nebraska to when I crawled to the daylight out of the snow after they had chucked me off the mountain-top.

The shadows of the walnuts and hickories were growing long, and a rich country was giving up its scent to the evening air.
