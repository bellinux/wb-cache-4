Previous studies focused on the contribution of VA span to normal and pathological reading in monolingual and bilingual children from different European languages, without direct cross-language comparison. In the current paper, we explored modulations of VA span abilities in three languages –French, Spanish, and Arabic– that differ in transparency, reading direction and writing systems. The participants were skilled adult readers who were native speakers of French, Spanish or Arabic. They were administered tasks of global and partial letter report, single letter identification and text reading. Their VA span abilities were assessed using tasks that require the processing of briefly presented five consonant strings (e. g., R S H F T). All five consonants had to be reported in global report but a single cued letter in partial report. Results showed that VA span was reduced in Arabic readers as compared to French or Spanish readers who otherwise show a similar high performance in the two report tasks. The analysis of VA <b>span</b> <b>response</b> patterns in global report showed a left-right asymmetry in all three languages. A leftward letter advantage was found in French and Spanish but a rightward advantage in Arabic. The response patterns were symmetric in partial report, regardless of the language. Last, a significant relationship was found between VA span abilities and reading speed but only for French. The overall findings suggest that the size of VA span, the shape of VA <b>span</b> <b>response</b> patterns and the VA Span-reading relationship are modulated by language-specific features...|$|E
40|$|The term geometallurgy (or geometallurgical) first {{appeared}} in the literature some 40 years ago and has a wide range of definitions and perspectives which increases the barriers of communication between practitioners and across functional groups and management levels within organisations. However the consistent theme running through the diversity of definitions and perspectives is the requirement for close collaboration between the relevant disciplines. This concept of geometallurgy arguably goes back to the earliest days of the exploitation of mineral deposits, through the mid- 1500 s {{to the beginning of the}} 20 th century. This holistic and integrated view was diminished during the 20 th century due to a number of factors which included the commencement and continuing upward trend of large-scale mining and the expansion in production, the rise of scientific and classical management theories and methodologies, increase in specialisation and the development of traditional project planning. The re-emergence of geometallurgy in the late 20 th century required the relevant functional units and disciplines to collaborate as a team. This necessitates a common understanding that the geometallurgical program 2 ̆ 7 s goals must be obtained, which requires clear and consistent communication, particularly with the modern trend of virtual teams. A multi-dimensional construct is proposed to assist in providing a consistent approach in the communication of the context and purpose of both general and specific geometallurgical programs, thus simplifying communication. This geometallurgical construct consists of the dimensions of process <b>span,</b> <b>response</b> knowledge, variability knowledge, spatial knowledge, application and project phase in relation to extraction process(es) applied to geological materials from a mineral deposit. These dimensions are then linked to the phase of mineral project development in which the geometallurgical program is being applied, which ranges from advanced exploration through to operational execution. This paper outlines the multi-dimensional construct with examples of how the context, purpose and scope of geometallurgical programs can be clearly delineated and communicated...|$|E
40|$|One {{in every}} 150 {{children}} {{is estimated to}} fall within the autistic spectrum, regardless of socio-cultural and economic aspects, with a 4 : 1 prevalence of males over females (ADDM, 2007). Architecture, as a profession, is responsible for creating environments that accommodate {{the needs of all}} types of users. Special needs individuals should not be exempt from such accommodation. Despite this high incidence of autism, there are yet to be developed architectural design guidelines catering specifically to the scope of autistic needs. The primary goal of this research is to correct this exclusion by developing a preliminary framework of architectural design guidelines for autism. This will be done through a two phase study. The first phase will determine, through a questionnaire of first hand caregivers of autistic children, the impact of architectural design elements on autistic behaviour, to determine the most influential. The second phase, based on the findings of the first, will test the conclusive highest ranking architectural elements in an intervention study on autistic children in their school environment. Specific behavioural indicators, namely attention <b>span,</b> <b>response</b> time and behavioural temperament, will be tracked to determine each child’s progress pre and post intervention, for a control and study group. This study concludes in outlining the findings of both phases of the study, the first being the determination of the most influential architectural design elements on autistic behaviour, according to the sample surveyed. The second group of findings outlines design strategies for autism in three points. The first is the presentation of a "sensory design matrix" which matches architectural elements with autistic sensory issues and is used to generate suggested design guidelines. The second is the presentation of these hypothetical guidelines, two of which are tested in the presented study. These guidelines are presented as possible interventions for further testing. The third is a group of specific design guidelines resultant from the intervention study. It is hoped that these will provide a basis for the further development of autistic specific design standards, and take us one step further towards more conducive environments for autistic individuals...|$|E

Using a longitudinal prospective design, mother–child pairs from violent and nonviolent homes (N = 208) were interviewed about exposure to marital violence twice over a 7 – 9 year time <b>span.</b> <b>Responses</b> to questions about adolescent gender-typed beliefs, the acceptance of dating violence, and experiences with dating violence were collected during follow-up interviews. Results indicated that adolescents exposed to marital violence during childhood were more likely to justify the use of violence in dating relationships.

How adolescents thought about dating relationships was more important than whether they witnessed marital violence in childhood. Results have implications for social-cognitive and norm-based interventions. Adolescence is a period during which formative experi-ences in dating and sexuality might have long-lasting ef-fects.

In four conditions, participants performed neither (no-task), one (Digit <b>Span</b> or <b>Response</b> Time only), or both tasks (dual). Dependent variables were Digit <b>Span</b> accuracy, <b>response</b> time, and pupillary dilation to digits as an estimate of mental effort. Children’s behavioral and psychophysiological responses {{as a function of}} sequence length and stimulus position were generally similar to those of adults. Slopes of the functions relating pupillary dilation to memory load were linear and increasing in both groups; shallower in dual than in Digit Span only; and shallower in children than adults. Children’s behavioral results on the Digit Span task began to diverge from those of adults as task demands shifted from passive retention to active rehearsal, but the children did not appear to try harder to compensate for a lower level of behavioral performance.

In the process sixty-one distinct faults were identified among the versions. Less than 12 percent of the faults exhibited varying degrees of positive correlation. The common-cause (or similar) faults spanned as many as 14 components. However, a majority of these faults were trivial, and easily detected by proper unit and/or system testing. Only two of the seven similar faults were difficult faults, and both were caused by specification ambiguities.

40|$|This thesis brings {{together}} selected published {{works on the}} theme of spatial mobility and labour markets. The works selected adopt a range of methodological approaches, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. They are grouped into four inter-related subthemes: (1) labour migration and labour market adjustment; (2) mobilities, migration and commuting; (3) spatial (im) mobility, place and social networks; and (4) immigration, integration and labour market issues. These sub-themes <b>span</b> <b>responses</b> to changes in employment and non-employment, the continuum of labour market-related movements from daily and weekly commuting to employment-related migration, spatial mobility and immobility, and internal and international migration. Taken together, the works presented provide an original contribution to knowledge on spatial mobility and labour markets. They also inform key policy debates. Particular contributions include: (1) evidence on spatial and temporal variations in labour migration as an adjustment mechanism within the broader context of changing labour markets; (2) empirical and theoretical insights into the location and mobility strategies of dual career households and how some individuals might substitute commuting for migration for individual and household gains; (3) evidence on the importance of area perceptions and place-based social networks in constraining spatial mobility – particularly for some individuals in some places; and (4) policy-relevant evidence on the impact of international migration on regional and local labour markets and implications for local skills strategies and local action on integration of new arrivals. Together the works highlight the reality of the fuzziness of the binary measurement categories conventionally used in analyses of spatial mobility and indicate the need for greater flexibility. They also demonstrate the need for increased sensitivity to the diversity of individual, household and local labour market experiences in different times and places...|$|R

40|$|Negative priming {{refers to}} the {{situation}} in which an ignored item on an initial prime trial suffers slowed responding when it becomes the target item on a subsequent probe trial. In this experiment (and a replication), we demonstrate two ways in which stimulus consistency (matching) governs negative priming. First, negative priming for identical words occurred only when the prime distractor changed color when it became the probe target (i. e., constant cue to read the red word); negative priming disappeared when the prime distractor retained its color as the probe target (i. e., cue switches from read the red prime word to read the white probe word). Second, negative priming occurred for identical words, but not for semantically related words, whether related categorically or associatively. This pattern of results is consistent with a memory retrieval account, but not with an inhibition account of negative priming, and casts doubt on whether there is semantic negative priming for words. Research over approximately the last quarter century has made it increasingly clear that selecting one item or dimension for attention can have consequences for other, unselected items or dimensions (e. g., Neill, 1977; Tipper, 1985). It is now well established that ignoring a stimulus on one trial (the prime trial) often makes it more difficult to respond to that stimulus on the subsequent trial (the probe trial). This interference can last up to several seconds (Neill & Valdes, 1992; Tipper, Weaver, Cameron, Brehaut, & Bastedo, 1991) and <b>spans</b> <b>response</b> modalities (e. g., Tipper, MacQueen, & Brehaut, 1988) and even tasks (Chiappe & MacLeod, 1995).

Responses were much longer in the reading- and listening-span tasks than in the other span tasks, suggesting that participants in sentence-based span tasks take time to retrieve the semantic or linguistic structure as cues to recall of the sentence-final words.

Sensors incroporated with β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs), sodium tetrakis (4 -fluorophenyl) borate (NaTFPB) and 2 -fluorophenyl 2 -nitrophenyl ether (f-NPE), showed fast and stable potentiometric responses with mean Nernstian compliance of 59. 0 ± 1. 0 and 56. 8 ± 1. 4 mV·decade- 1 for Hx and BP, respectively in the concentration ranges 1 × 10 – 5 – 1 × 10 – 2 mol·L– 1 for Hx and 1 × 10 – 5 – 1 × 10 – 2 mol·L– 1 for BP. Incorporation of β-CD as molecular recognition element improved the electrode sensitivity and¨selectivity due to encapsulation of the drug molecule into β-CD cavity (host-guest interaction). The electrodes were fully characterized in terms of composition, usable pH range, life <b>span</b> and <b>response</b> time. The developed electrodes have been successfully applied for the potentiometric determination of the cited drugs in pharmaceutical formulations. Comparison of the obtained results with those provided by reference methods revealed adequate accuracy for control assay...|$|R
40|$|A novel plastic {{packaging}} of a piezoresistive pressure sensor using a patterned ultra-thick photoresist is experimentally and theoretically investigated. Two pressure sensor packages of the sacrifice-replacement and dam-ring type {{were used in}} this study. The characteristics of the packaged pressure sensors were investigated by using a finite-element (FE) model and experimental measurements. The {{results show that the}} thermal signal drift of the packaged pressure sensor with a small sensing-channel opening or with a thin silicon membrane for the dam-ring approach had a high packaging induced thermal stress, leading to a high temperature coefficient of <b>span</b> (TCO) <b>response</b> of - 0. 19 % span/°C. The results also show that the thermal signal drift of the packaged pressure sensors with a large sensing-channel opening for sacrifice-replacement approach significantly reduced packaging induced thermal stress, and hence a low TCO response of - 0. 065 % span/°C. However, the packaged pressure sensors of both the sacrifice-replacement and dam-ring type still met the specification - 0. 2 % span/°C of the unpackaged pressure sensor. In addition, the size of proposed packages was 4 × 4 × 1. 5 mm 3 which was about seven times less than the commercialized packages. With the same packaging requirement, the proposed packaging approaches may provide an adequate solution for use in other open-cavity sensors, such as gas sensors, image sensors, and humidity sensors...|$|R
