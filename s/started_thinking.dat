5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} his work, Kraft found it {{increasingly}} stressful, {{especially since he}} did not consider {{himself to be a}} strong theoretician. In 1956, he was diagnosed with an ulcer and <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about a change of career.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special {{theory of relativity}} in 1905, Einstein <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are {{now known as the}} Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they <b>started</b> <b>thinking,</b> they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E

25|$|The town of Yellow Grass first <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about {{sanitation}} in {{the early}} 1900s when cesspools were designated for controlled removal of sewage. In 1916 Yellow Grass purchased galvanized sanitary pails {{to be used in}} a sewage collection service. Sewer lines were installed in 1958, that system has remained largely unchanged since then. A new water treatment plant was installed in 2011, providing the town with much better water quality as before.|$|E
25|$|I didn't write any {{songs in}} Henderson, {{but it was}} there I {{realized}} that experiences I had had, things I had seen and heard could be set down {{in a kind of}} music characteristic of my race.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{sales of the}} VK-30 were dwindling down; it became a market failure. By the time they {{discontinued}} production {{in the middle of}} the decade they had sold and shipped out 40 kits, of which only 13 were finished and flown. Towards the end of 1991, the brothers began to question their goals and <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about their lifelong dream of getting into the world of certified aircraft. Alan began making sketches for the ST-50, a four-seat single-engine turboprop. Dale wanted something simpler and began fiddling with a concept that was to evolve into the SR20.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time Barks had <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about turning a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession: that of drawing. Since his early {{childhood}} he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find. He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite comic strip artists from the newspapers where he could find them. As he later said, he wanted to create his own facial expressions, figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists' use of the pen and their use of color and shading.|$|E
25|$|By this point, Scrooge {{had become}} {{familiar}} to readers in the United States and Europe. Other Disney {{writers and artists}} besides Barks began using Scrooge in their own stories, including Italian writer Romano Scarpa. Western Publishing, the then-publisher of the Disney crafty comics, <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character, and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self-titled comic. Uncle Scrooge #1, featuring the story Only a Poor Old Man, was published in March 1952. This story along with Back to the Klondike, first published a year later in March 1953, became the biggest influences in how Scrooge's character, past, and beliefs would become defined.|$|E
25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about {{breaking}} Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, {{he sent a}} text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E

25|$|At {{forty years}} of age and a very wealthy man, Marks <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> about marriage. He {{returned}} to Sheffield in England and married Bertha Guttmann, eighteen years his junior. This was an arranged marriage set up by Bertha's father who helped with Sammy's success during the years. Bertha was only 5 years old when Sammy set foot on the Cape's soil. From this union nine children were born, six boys and three girls. Only six children survived infancy. Having himself received a limited schooling, Marks set great store by education and saw to it that the children were taught at home by governesses – boys until the age of eight, girls until the age of twelve and then they were sent to private schools in England.|$|E
25|$|Sunnis {{believe that}} Abu Bakr is the {{rightful}} Caliph. The Twelver Shia and the Ismaili Shia believe that Ali {{should have been}} the first Caliph. Their main argument is based on their interpretation of Hadith of the pond of Khumm. However, later a minority, took this concept one step further and also <b>started</b> <b>thinking,</b> what if history took a different course and these ideas were later adopted by some Twelver Shia and institutionalised by the Safavids in the 1500s. For {{the first time in the}} history of Islam, the Safavids also established a hierarchical organization of the Shiite clergy and funded this hierarchy through the collection of waqf and Khums. Because of the relative insecurity of property ownership in Persia, many private landowners secured their lands by donating them to the clergy as so called vaqf. They would thus retain the official ownership and secure their land from being confiscated by royal commissioners or local governors, as long as a percentage of the revenues from the land went to the ulama the quasi-religious organizations run by dervishes (futuvva). Increasingly, members of the religious class, particularly the mujtahids and the seyyeds, gained full ownership of these lands, and, according to contemporary historian Iskandar Munshi, Persia started to witness the emergence of a new and significant group of landowners. From then on many seyyeds also further propagated the idea that Ali {{should have been the}} first caliph and that by becoming the first caliph, Abu Bakr had broken the link that proved that they should have more rights. Before that point Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who disapproved of his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph.|$|E

In American Film, he expressed his philosophy on writing comedy: [...] "You have to imagine yourself as not somebody very special but somebody very ordinary. If you imagine yourself as somebody really normal and if it makes you laugh, it's going to make everybody laugh. If you think of yourself as something very special, you'll end up a pedant and a bore.

Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram: Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman [...] "I <b>started</b> <b>thinking</b> that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself."
