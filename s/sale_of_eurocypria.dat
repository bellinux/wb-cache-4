50|$|On July 2010, {{the average}} age <b>of</b> <b>Eurocypria's</b> fleet was 6.1 years.|$|R
50|$|On 3 September 2010, Eurocypria pilots went {{on strike}} due to the government's {{proposal}} <b>of</b> reducing <b>Eurocypria's</b> fleet to 4 aircraft in 2011. Finally, all operations ceased on 4 November 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the {{government}} <b>of</b> Cyprus bought <b>Eurocypria</b> because Cyprus Airways started facing severe financial problems.|$|R
5000|$|Eurocypria was {{established}} on 25 March 1992 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyprus Airways, {{as the first}} Cyprus based charter airline. Operations began on 12 June 1992 with two new Airbus A320 aircraft. Two more were added later. Since 2001, the airline has operated scheduled services from Cyprus, and charter flights. [...] In 2003 Eurocypria replaced its Airbus fleet with four new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Three of its former Airbus A320s were transferred and operated by Cyprus Airways. Two additional units of the same type and configuration were added in 2006. On 28 June 2006, Cyprus Airways sold the share capital <b>of</b> <b>Eurocypria</b> to the Government of Cyprus for CY£13,425,000. The charter arm was sold mostly due to the poor financial situation at Cyprus Airways {{and because it was}} one of the few ventures of Cyprus Airways Group to make a profit.|$|R
5000|$|Yet the {{approval}} of the cash injection for Eurocypria was, as the 'Cyprus Mail' reported on 19 February 2010, [...] "unlikely to be the final word". Anastasios Antoniou LLC,http://www.antoniou.com.cy a Law Firm based in Limassol, filed an official complaint on 17 February 2010 with the European Commission regarding the proposed financing <b>of</b> <b>Eurocypria</b> on behalf <b>of</b> a client who wished to remain anonymous. As national daily 'Phileleftheros' reported on 19 February 2010 - based on its own sources - the complainant could be a competitor in the relevant market that has unsuccessfully attempted to enter the market. In a statement issued on 19 February 2010 in response to the media commentary, Anastasios Antoniou LLC explained that the capital injection {{on the part of the}} Republic of Cyprus is likely to be in violation of the applicable EU legislation regarding State Aid. The Firm pursued its complaint before the European Commission further in the following months, also filing a request for interim measures on behalf of the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.|$|R
50|$|In June 2010, it was {{unveiled}} that two reports, prepared in February 2010 before {{the capital injection}} had been approved, were opposed to the bailout. Made public by Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis on 10 June 2010, the two reports created a series of debates and rows with the island’s political parties, who felt they were misled into approving the money. The first report, {{carried out by the}} Accountant-general on February 3, proposed a strict implementation <b>of</b> <b>Eurocypria’s</b> business plan to reinforce its profit-making abilities. Meanwhile, it was proposed that a strategic investor be found. Failure to do so by mid-2010, it added, would lead to Eurocypria going bankrupt, in combination with some of its human and material resources being absorbed by national carrier Cyprus Airways. According to the Accountant-general, this would reduce the cost of bankruptcy from €84 million to €55 million. The second report - carried out by technocrats at the Finance Ministry and Planning Office - contradicted Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis’ claims that the reports {{had nothing to do with}} the €35 million injection, as its conclusions were centred on the specific fund.|$|R
