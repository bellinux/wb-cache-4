50|$|As {{described}} above, the Caps Lock behaviour in most QWERTY keyboard layouts {{differs from}} the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> behaviour in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the Commodore 64, had a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> but no Caps Lock; others, such as the BBC Micro, had both, only one {{of which could be}} enabled at a time.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was {{introduced}} so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and {{were meant to}} be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for {{more than two or three}} consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the feasibility of aluminum honeycomb mat to sustain S aircraft over austere airfield pavement, static loading test was applied in field experiment. Three test sections were constructed with different strength. The instrument results (displacement and strain) of testing were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of mats. The influences of mat thicknesses, soil foundation, <b>locks,</b> <b>interlocking</b> action and voids were analyzed. Experimental results indicate that it is feasible that aluminum honeycomb mat sustain S aircraft over austere airfield pavement which needs only a Middle-strength soil foundation. Modifications to the panels, locks and joints design are recommended to improve the performance of mats...|$|R
50|$|In some {{keyboard}} layouts, {{the status}} of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys (verbatim as per capital <b>shift</b> <b>lock),</b> not that of the number row, which then still requires the Shift key to be pressed to reach the alternative key definitions.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} Caps Lock that behaves like a {{traditional}} <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> does exist on certain layouts {{such as the}} French AZERTY. Some operating systems and window managers allow Caps Lock {{to be used for}} a similar function. This behavior of the Caps Lock survives, however, in German and Austrian QWERTZ keyboards.|$|R
50|$|A key {{providing}} one of {{the functions}} Capitals lock (usually called “Caps Lock”), Level 2 lock (i. e. “Shift lock”), or Generalized lock shall be present, occupying the position C00. (The function “Generalized lock” is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series). It is to {{be noted that the}} specific way the Caps <b>Lock</b> or <b>Shift</b> <b>Lock</b> works (i. e. swapping the lock state by hitting the key, as it is usually implemented) is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series. Thus, solutions avoiding the status dependency as well as the problem of inadvertent hitting (e.g., the lock key pressed together with <b>Shift</b> turns <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> on, together with AltGr turns Caps Lock on, pressed alone switches off any lock status but has no effect when no lock status is activated) would not prevent compliance to the standard.|$|R
50|$|While {{the typical}} locking {{behaviour}} on keyboards with Caps Lock key {{is that of}} a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> mode.|$|R
50|$|Caps Lock is {{a button}} on a {{computer}} keyboard that, when pressed, causes all letters to be generated in capitals until deactivated. It {{is located in the}} position of a similar <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key (and sometimes a Ctrl key) found in some other keyboard layouts. It is usually a toggle key: each press reverses its action.|$|R

Then the Meghalaya House <b>shifted</b> <b>lock,</b> stock and barrel to this growth region from their old premises at Russel Street, huge amounts of money began pouring into real-estate activities and this resulted in feverish construction activity all along the stretch of the Rash Behari Connector.|$|R
5000|$|For example, in most {{keyboard}} layouts the Shift {{key combination}} [...] {{will produce a}} capital letter [...] "A" [...] instead of the default lower-case letter [...] "a" [...] (unless in Caps <b>lock</b> or <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> mode). A combination of [...] in Microsoft Windows will close the program in the active window; in this instance, Alt is the modifier key. In contrast, pressing just [...] or [...] will probably do nothing unless assigned a specific function in a particular program (for example, activating input aids or the toolbar of the active window in Windows).|$|R

50|$|The Caps Lock key {{originated}} as a <b>Shift</b> <b>lock</b> key on mechanical typewriters. An early {{innovation in}} typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of the few}} C64 {{programs}} that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the CAPS LOCK key is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This {{has to do with}} the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the <b>SHIFT</b> <b>LOCK</b> key found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT key, the CAPS LOCK key on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS LOCK key in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|R

40|$|The flow of {{multiple}} concurrent jobs in an automated manufacturing system (AMS), all competing for a finite set of resources, {{often leads to}} a deadlock situation.

A systematic method for designing <b>locks</b> and <b>interlocks</b> for deadlock avoidance using the reachability graph of the Petri net model is presented.. ...|$|R
50|$|Braille (a {{writing system}} for the blind) uses either 6 or 8 tactile 'points' from which all letters and numbers are formed. When Louis Braille invented it, it was {{produced}} with a needle holing successively all needed points in a cardboard sheet. In 1892, Frank Haven Hall, superintendent of the Illinois Institute for the Education of the Blind, created the Hall Braille Writer, which was like a typewriter with 6 keys, one for each dot in a braille cell. The Perkins Brailler, first manufactured in 1951, uses a 6-key chord keyboard (plus a spacebar) to produce braille output, and has been very successful as a mass market affordable product. Braille, like Baudot, uses a number symbol and a shift symbol, which may be repeated for <b>shift</b> <b>lock,</b> to fit numbers and upper case into the 63 codes that 6 bits offer.|$|R

50|$|Like the Prevé, the Suprima S {{has also}} been {{developed}} to house a maximum of 6 SRS airbags, an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). However, unlike the Prevé, all Suprima units came standard {{with all of its}} engineered safety features at launch, whereas the MDM Prevé Premium trim was only offered with a maximum of 4 airbags with all electronic safety equipment, and the MDM Prevé Executive trim models were only fitted with 2 airbags without BA, TCS & ESC at launch. However, the MDM Prevé has since been updated for the 2014 model year and currently offers all of its engineered safety features as standard across all trim variants, without a hike in pricing. Additionally, the Suprima Premium variant offers front parking sensors, a reverse camera, Hill-Hold Assist, an Electronic Gear <b>Shift</b> <b>Lock</b> and brighter LED daytime running lights (DRL) which help contribute to an overall increase in safety standards.|$|R

500|$|The United Auto Workers (UAW) {{was founded}} in Detroit on August 26, 1935. The labor union {{struggled}} to gain members until the Flint Sit-Down Strike in 1937. The strike started on December 30, 1936, when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No.1 stopped loading tool dies on the night <b>shift,</b> <b>locking</b> themselves into the plant. The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW-organized plants in Flint. [...] On January 3, 1937, workers at the plant {{sat down on the}} job; Fisher Plant No.2 later joined in the sit-down strike. The heat was shut off at the plants, and on January 11, food deliveries were stopped, sparking a riot. Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4,000National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants. A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No.4 on February 1. The National Guard troops surrounded the 12striking plants in Flint, but the governor never ordered them into action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more, and an agreement was signed, recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country.|$|R
50|$|Along {{the course}} of the canal there are 16 locks with lifting heights of up to 25 m. The 16 locks are managed from four remote control centres (Neuses since 2007, Kriegenbrunn, Hilpoltstein, and Dietfurt from the {{beginning}} of 2007). These centres are manned with one worker on the night shift, and two on the day <b>shift.</b> The <b>locks</b> were modernized from 2001 to 2007, replacing the outdated relay technology with computers and a PLC. The cost was approximately $ 1.3 million per lock.|$|R
60|$|Frances Freeland, in the window, {{wasted no}} thoughts, but {{began to run}} over in her mind the exact {{operations}} necessary to defeat this illness of darling Derek's. Her fingers continually <b>locked</b> and <b>interlocked</b> themselves with fresh determinations; her eyes, fixed on imaginary foods, methods of washing, and ways of keeping him quiet, had an almost fanatical intensity. Like a good general she marshalled her means of attack and fixed them in perfect order. Now and then she gazed into her bag, making quite sure that she had everything, and nothing that was new-fangled or liable to go wrong. For into action she never brought any of those patent novelties that delighted her soul in times of peace. For example, when she herself had pneumonia and no doctor, for two months, it was well known that she had lain on her back, free from every kind of remedy, employing only courage, nature, and beef tea, or some such simple sustenance.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the shift key while Caps Lock is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already shifted), will also shift keys which are not being <b>shifted</b> by Caps <b>Lock</b> alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>shifts</b> all keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where Caps <b>Lock</b> only <b>shifts</b> alphabet keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if Caps Lock is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the Shift key {{is the most common}} variant on English keyboards.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore phase reset of 3 -dimensional current sources in Brodmann areas located in the human default mode network (DMN) using Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) of the human {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG). Methods: The EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations from 70 healthy normal subjects ranging in age from 13 to 20 years. A time point by time point computation of LORETA current sources were computed for 14 Brodmann areas comprising the DMN in the delta frequency band. The Hilbert transform of the LORETA time series was used to compute the instantaneous phase differences between all pairs of Brodmann areas. Phase <b>shift</b> and <b>lock</b> durations were calculated based on the 1 st and 2 nd derivatives of the time series of phase differences. Results: Phase shift duration exhibited three discrete modes at approximately: (1) 25 ms, (2) 50 ms, and (3) 65 ms. Phase lock duration present primarily at: (1) 300 – 350 ms and (2) 350 – 450 ms. Phase <b>shift</b> and <b>lock</b> durations were inversely related and exhibited an exponential change with distance between Brodmann areas. Conclusions: The results are explained by local neural packing density of network hubs and an exponential decrease in connections with distance from a hub. The results are consistent with a discrete temporal model of brain function where anatomical hubs behave like a “shutter ” that opens and closes at specific durations as nodes of a network giving rise to temporarily phase locked clusters of neurons for specific durations...|$|R
