50|$|About 3,900 Class A3 rail wagons (Schienenwagen or Plattformwagen) {{were built}} from 1913 to 1925. These were a <b>special</b> <b>type</b> of flat <b>wagon</b> {{based on their}} Prussian forebears, based on Sheet IId7. They were only built with brakeman's cabs and had a length over buffers of 15,800 mm, a loading length of 15,060 mm and a loading width of 2,750 mm. Their unladen weight was 17.4 tonnes, their maximum load 35 tonnes and their {{carrying}} capacity 36.75 tonnes.|$|R

In 1933, they launched their [...] "S" [...] <b>type</b> <b>wagons.</b> A fast, well thought out and reliable design, it was a valiant attempt to maintain the steam wagon market. Despite this, in 1938, production ceased, except for 100 wagons produced in the early 1950s for the Argentine government, and a solitary wagon produced for the home market.|$|R

40|$|Histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> {{of breast}} cancer have {{distinctive}} morphological features and account for up to 25 % of all invasive breast cancers. We sought to determine whether at the genomic level, histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> {{of breast cancer}} are distinct from grade- and estrogen receptor (ER) -matched invasive carcinomas of no <b>special</b> <b>type</b> (IC-NSTs), and to define genes whose expression correlates with gene copy number in histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> of breast cancer. We characterized 59 breast cancers of ten histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Hierarchical clustering revealed that the patterns of gene copy number aberrations segregated with ER-status and histological grade, and that samples {{from each of the}} breast cancer histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> preferentially clustered together. We confirmed the patterns of gene copy number aberrations previously reported for lobular, micropapillary, metaplastic, and mucinous carcinomas. On the other hand, metaplastic and medullary carcinomas were found to have genomic profiles similar to those of grade- and ER-matched IC-NSTs. The genomic aberrations observed in invasive carcinomas with osteoclast-like stromal giant cells support its classification as IC-NST variant. Integrative aCGH and gene expression analysis led to the identification of 145 transcripts that were significantly overexpressed when amplified in histological <b>special</b> <b>types</b> of breast cancer. Our results illustrate that together with histological grade and ER-status, histological type is also associated with the patterns and complexity of gene copy number aberrations in breast cancer, with adenoid cystic and mucinous carcinomas being examples of ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancers with distinctive repertoires of gene copy number aberration...|$|R
