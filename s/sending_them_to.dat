5|$|After {{the start}} of the war with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for {{internment}} of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E

At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|According to Swedish legend, Charles XI {{travelled}} {{around the}} country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he {{is referred to as}} the Greycoat (Swedish: Gråkappan). This was done to discover and identify corruption and oppression against the populace. There are many stories about him arriving in villages looking for corrupt church officials and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the gallows. However, Charles XI never travelled alone. He was always followed by a military cortège but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this era that travelled the most throughout the country. The stories of the Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E

5|$|Germanus was {{successful}} in winning the confidence of many soldiers, re-establishing discipline and defeating the mutineers at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in 537. With imperial control over the army restored, Solomon {{was sent back to}} Africa to replace Germanus in 539, again combining in his person the posts of magister militum and praetorian prefect (in the meantime, he had also been raised to the rank of patricius and named an honorary consul). Solomon further reinforced his control of the army by weeding out unreliable soldiers, <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Belisarius in Italy and to the East; by expelling all remaining Vandals from the province; and by initiating a massive programme of fortification across the region.|$|E
5|$|Grameen Bank is {{best known}} for its system of {{solidarity}} lending. The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions. At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the struggle {{of the new government}} to acquire centralized authority, further complicated by the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945. In 1947 Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored Marshall Plan, and to join the Soviet Union-dominated Comecon in 1949. The Soviet forces present engaged in plunder of the former eastern territories of Germany which were being transferred to Poland, stripping it of valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and factories and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union.|$|E

Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Nicholas Pocock {{to be used}} for Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|Claiming {{that not}} all prisoners had been released, Simeon once again invaded Byzantium {{in the summer of}} 896, heading {{directly}} to Constantinople. He was met in Thrace by a hastily assembled Byzantine army, but annihilated the Byzantine forces in the Battle of Bulgarophygon (at modern Babaeski, Turkey). Arming Arab captives and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fight with the Bulgarians as a desperate measure, Leo VI managed to repel the Bulgarians from Constantinople, which they had besieged. The war ended with a peace treaty which formally lasted until around Leo VI's death in 912 and under which Byzantium was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and Strandža to the Bulgarian Empire. Meanwhile, Simeon had also imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as their ruler.|$|E

5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> jail.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the revolt, Treblinka II {{continued}} to function and remained a top priority for the SS for another year. Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, {{there would have been}} little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era.

Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{generally}} had {{a long-standing}} policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States {{and some other}} countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN, which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period. The result was that when war came in 1939, the Army's equipment was of World War I vintage, and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms. Most equipment was obsolescent {{and had to be}} replaced, and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons, equipment and motor vehicles. Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division, but since a division's war establishment was around 3,000, this was only enough for training. In February 1940, the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for <b>sending</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the Middle East for wheat cargoes.|$|E
