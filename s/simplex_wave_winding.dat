40|$|Abstract: The {{wind blowing}} over sea surface generates tiny <b>wind</b> <b>waves.</b> They develop {{with time and}} space {{absorbing}} wind energy, and become huge <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> usually referred to ocean surface <b>waves.</b> The <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> cause not only serious sea disasters but also take important roles in the local and global climate changes by affecting the fluxes of momentum, heat and gases (e. g. CO 2) through the air-sea boundary. The present paper reviews the selected studies on <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> conducted by our group in the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics (RIAM), Kyushu University. The themes discussed are interactions between water <b>waves</b> and <b>winds,</b> the energy spectrum of <b>wind</b> <b>waves,</b> nonlinear properties of <b>wind</b> <b>waves,</b> {{and the effects of}} surfactant on some air-sea interaction phenomena...|$|R

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{scheme for}} the analysis of the acoustic wave transformation in materials with nonlin-earity hysteresis and end-point memory is developed. Both numerical and analytical predictions are obtained concerning mixing of a wave at fundamental frequency (!-wave) and a wave at doubled frequency (2 !-wave) in the materials with hysteretic quadratic nonlinearity. The observed wave spectrum broadening is found to be in qualitative agreement with the selection rules for the multi-phonon processes in this type of materials. The predicted transformation of an initially complex wave (with four extrema over a period) into a <b>simplex</b> <b>wave</b> (with two extrema over a period) in non-linear propagation is found {{to be one of the}} manifestations of the nonlinear hysteretic absorption. It is demonstrated that at short propagation distances the interaction of the!- and 2 !-waves is mainly through the mechanism of the nonlinear hysteretic absorption and is not strongly in uenced by the process of higher harmonics generation and their inverse in uence on the input waves. The regimes of the induced and self-induced transparency are predicted. The in uence of the transition from the <b>simplex</b> <b>wave</b> to complex wave emission (or vice versa) on the processes of the induce...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} short <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> {{under the influence}} of long waves are investigated based on wave data from a laboratory experiment carried out in the large Marseille-Luminy <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> tank. The <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> are generated with various fetches and speeds. The long wave is mechanically generated by a submerge paddle and propagates in the <b>wind</b> direction. Surface <b>wave</b> elevations are measured by an array of capacitance wave gauges aligned in the wind direction. The long wave effects are examined based on the statistical parameters derived from the probability distribution and zero-up-crossing wave height and <b>wave</b> period of <b>wind</b> <b>waves.</b> In the absence of long waves, the skewness of the probability distributions, an index of wave nonlinearity, shows a clear dependence to the increase of the significant slopes of <b>wind</b> <b>waves.</b> The presence of long waves significantly decreases the skewness and the dependence to the <b>wave</b> slopes. The <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> riding on the crest of long waves show a larger mean wave height and shorter mean wave period than those riding in the trough of long waves...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>wave</b> {{development}} {{in the presence of}} a long mechanically-generated wave was investigated in the large IRPHE <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> tank, for different wind speeds and long <b>wave</b> parameters. <b>Wind</b> and <b>wave</b> observations with and without long waves were made simultaneously at various fetches and compared. At short fetches, the <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> field observed in presence of mechanical waves exhibits a broadened dominant spectral peak shifted towards low frequencies. At large fetches, the main effect of long <b>waves</b> on <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> fields consists in a noticeable damping of the dominant waves. The damping factor increases rapidly with long wave steepness akL at small akL but no longer varies at large akL. Moreover, this factor is strongly wind dependent, increasing first up to 6 m/s, then decreasing significantly before reaching a saturation value at high wind speeds. Consistently, the wind-generated wave fields observed in presence of long waves are characterized by much lower equilibrium dominant wave steepness. Finally, the relevant mechanisms at the origin of these phenomena and their implications for ocean wave fields are discussed...|$|R

With the increase of the paddle wave steepness the stress level returns to the stress level characteristic of the pure <b>wind</b> <b>waves.</b> Further increase in the paddle wave steepness augments the stress further. The WOWC model explains this peculiarity of the stress distribution {{by the fact that}} the paddle waves significantly damp the <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> in the spectral peak. The stress supported by these dominant waves rapidly falls when the paddle wave is introduced, and this decrease is not compensated by the stress induced by the paddle wave. With further increase in the steepness of the paddle wave, the stress supported by dominant <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> stays at a low level, while the stress supported by the paddle waves continues to grow proportional to the square of the steepness, finally exceeding the stress level characteristic of the pure <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> field...|$|R
