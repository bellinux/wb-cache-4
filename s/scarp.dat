50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{remains as}} one of the best examples ever for evidence of creating spectacular fault <b>scarps</b> along the west side of the Tobin Range. It produced four <b>scarps,</b> with a total length of 59 km, and re-ruptured Holocene <b>scarps</b> located at the bottom of the base of the mountain blocks. Among the <b>scarps,</b> the average vertical displacement among the affected areas was 2 m, and the maximum displacement of 5.8 m occurred near the old Pierce School site on Buskee Creek Canyon.|$|R
5|$|The Bradford Coalfield is crossed by {{a number}} of fault lines, principally the Bradford Fault. The {{extraction}} of coal caused that fault to reactivate in the 1960s, resulting in a <b>scarp</b> that seriously damaged Crompton Hall, a residential complex built in the early 20th century. The building was subsequently demolished.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea grows {{only in the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Geraldton Sandplains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions, inland {{from the}} coast but never east of the Darling <b>Scarp.</b> It occurs from Hill River near Badgingarra in the north, to Serpentine in the south. Most populations occur north of Moore River or south of Cannington, there being only a few {{scattered}} populations in between.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long <b>scarp</b> may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E

30|$|There are {{small-scale}} grabens or fissures on {{the western}} side of the lobate <b>scarps</b> around Mons Chajorra (Fig.  14). We named the grabens, Graben Systems A, B and C from south (Fig.  14 a–c). French et al. (2015) interpreted the small-scale grabens near the lobate <b>scarps</b> and mare ridges as secondary structures associated with the formation of such map-scale contractional structures. We also interpreted Graben Systems A, B and C as grabens associated with the formations of the lobate <b>scarps.</b>|$|R
5|$|The more major of {{the current}} roads often started as turnpikes in the 16th century. These avoid the highest areas of the hills. To {{the north of the}} western part of the Mendips, the A368 {{separates}} the hills from the Chew Valley, while on the southern edge the A371 similarly runs along the bottom of the <b>scarp</b> slope between the hills and the Somerset Levels. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a {{designated}} national park. There are two large aquifers in the area, one consisting of chalk, {{to the south of}} the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At {{the western edge of the}} region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a <b>scarp</b> slope. The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs along the bottom of the chalk <b>scarp</b> slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995/96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure the health of a river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.|$|E
5|$|The species tolerates a {{range of}} soils, {{requiring}} only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in lateritic soils and gravels, although this species {{is also found in}} deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over limestone. It also occurs in {{a range of}} vegetation complexes, including coastal and kwongan heath, tall shrubland, woodland and open forest. It is a common understorey plant in drier areas of Jarrah forest, and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. Banksia sessilis sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in the Darling <b>Scarp.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{period of}} tectonic {{adjustment}} of the mercurian lithosphere lasted {{at least through}} the time of formation of smooth plains material; c4 craters that formed during this period are cut by <b>scarps</b> and are superposed on them. Some very smooth plains material, most of which postdates c4 craters, appears to postdate the <b>scarps</b> that it commonly embays. Superposition relations of <b>scarps</b> in other regions of Mercury indicate that tectonic activity may have continued into c5 time (Leake, 1982).|$|R
5000|$|Three {{years prior}} to the main story line, <b>Scarper</b> was in a {{burglary}} when he fell through a glass roof.

50|$|Fault <b>scarps</b> {{may be only}} a few centimeters or many meters high. Fault-line <b>scarps</b> are {{coincident}} with faults, but {{are most}} typically formed by the erosion of weaker rocks that have been brought alongside more resistant ones by the movement along the fault. In the case of old eroded fault <b>scarps,</b> active erosion may have moved the physical cliff {{back away from the}} actual fault location which may be buried beneath a talus, alluvial fan or the sediments of the valley fill.|$|R
5|$|Excluding Kingston upon Hull {{there are}} several areas of {{settlement}} in the East Riding, each giving rise to distinctive types of small to medium-sized towns and villages. Cottingham and Willerby are exceptional {{in that they are}} suburban villages which are almost contiguous with the Hull urban area. Bridlington is the most populous of the coastal settlements, which also include Flamborough, Hornsea, Withernsea and Aldbrough. Towns and villages on the flat agricultural area of Holderness are Hedon and Roos, and nestling in the Great Wold Valley is Rudston. Along the eastern foot of the Wolds lie Beverley, Bishop Burton, Driffield and Lockington. In the low-lying lands close to the Humber Estuary are Goole, Brough, North Ferriby, Hessle and Kirk Ella. Stamford Bridge, Pocklington, Market Weighton, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Howden and South Cave all lie to the north and west of the area, between the River Derwent and the <b>scarp</b> slope of the Wolds.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origin}} to Birdwood the river follows rolling, {{relatively}} level country before entering a hilly section {{that continues to}} Gumeracha. The river then follows sedimentary rock strata before entering a gorge after Cudlee Creek. It flows through the gorge to Athelstone, passing over the Eden Fault Zone of the Adelaide Hills face and associated escarpment. After the <b>scarp</b> it flows over sedimentary rocks of varying resistance to erosion, {{which has led to}} interspersed narrows and broad basins. From the base of the Adelaide Hills to Adelaide's central business district it runs in a shallow valley with a terraced floor, then down the slope of its own alluvial fan. The structure of this fan shows that the river formerly entered Gulf St Vincent via the Port River. Over time the Torrens deposited sediment, choking its own outflow; becoming locked behind coastal sand dunes and forming the swampy areas of the Cowandilla Plains and the reedbeds.|$|E
5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep <b>scarp</b> slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to thermoelastic stress {{calculations}} implying that if only the outer few hundreds of km of a moon with a cool interior were initially molten, the lunar highlands should not have young compressional tectonic features. Extrapolations from Apollo panoramic images showing young thrust faults in the highlands suggest that about 2000 thrust fault <b>scarps</b> exist on the highlands, generally occurring in series or complexes {{of four or five}} <b>scarps</b> that are on average 5 km long. The ages of the <b>scarps</b> range from 60 + or - 30 to 680 + or - 250 my, with a possible factor bias of + 2 to - 4. The <b>scarps</b> are the youngest endogenic features on the moon, and indicate that the moon was initially molten...|$|R
40|$|Lobate <b>scarps</b> on Mercury {{have been}} studied to {{determine}} {{the nature of the}} surface stress history and implications for the planet's early tectonic history. Morphologic and transection relations indicate that most Mercurian <b>scarps</b> are tectonic in nature and are due to compressive stresses in the surface layer. The azimuthal distribution of lobate-scarp trends is compatible with an early predominantly compressive global stress field due to thermal shrinkage of the planet. Superposition relations indicate that the contractive phase was largely a pre-Caloris process. The effects of stresses due to planetary despinning were either negligible, predate the <b>scarps,</b> or were largely obscured by cratering or volcanism. The tectonic history of Mercury as recorded in the lobate <b>scarps</b> is different from that which caused the system of lineaments on the moon...|$|R

5|$|The {{landscape}} {{consists of}} {{the valley of the}} River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east. The valley's boundary generally follows the top of <b>scarp</b> slopes except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade gently into the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake, which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a <b>scarp</b> cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a <b>scarp</b> slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the <b>scarp</b> slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

5|$|The Minčeta Tower {{was built}} by a local builder named Nicifor Ranjina and Italian {{engineers}} sent by Pope Pius II in 1463, {{at the height of}} the Turkish threat. Originally as a strong four-sided fort, it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the Menčetić family, who owned the ground upon which the tower was built. By its height and impressive volume, the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls. In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier quadrilateral fort, Michelozzo built a new round tower using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low <b>scarp</b> walls. The full six-meter (20feet) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico of Zadar continued the work on the Minčeta tower. He designed and built the high narrow round tower while the battlements are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.|$|E
5|$|The Quantock Hills {{are largely}} formed by rocks of the Devonian Period, which consist of sediments {{originally}} laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north western areas older Early Devonian rocks, known as Hangman Grits, predominate, {{and can be}} seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The <b>scarp</b> is to the west with a dip slope to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was created}} in the 1930s from an {{existing}} system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (modern-day Guildford Road), it was actually used for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour, with the road base made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway sealed by 1953, segments reconstructed and widened, dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections. Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the Darling <b>Scarp</b> has been identified. The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment. Though planning began in the 1970s, , construction of this route has not been scheduled, and it is not considered a priority.|$|E
