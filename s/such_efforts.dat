5|$|<b>Such</b> <b>efforts</b> were premature, {{and did not}} succeed; only 24,000 Jews {{were living}} in Palestine {{on the eve of}} the {{emergence}} of Zionism within the world's Jewish communities in the last two decades of the 19th century. With the geopolitical shakeup occasioned by the outbreak of World War I, the earlier calculations, which had lapsed for some time, led to a renewal of strategic assessments and political bargaining over the Middle and Far East.|$|E
5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred {{was one of a}} few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although <b>such</b> <b>efforts</b> did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to globalization. Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. <b>Such</b> <b>efforts,</b> Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E
50|$|Producing {{energy to}} sustain human needs is an {{essential}} social activity, {{and a great deal}} of effort goes into the activity. While most of <b>such</b> <b>effort</b> is limited towards increasing the production of electricity and oil, newer ways of producing usable energy resources from the available energy resources are being explored. One <b>such</b> <b>effort</b> is to explore means of producing hydrogen fuel from water. Though hydrogen use is environmentally friendly, its production requires energy and existing technologies to make it, are not very efficient. Research is underway to explore enzymatic decomposition of biomass.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that <b>such</b> <b>efforts</b> must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage.

Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the storm and associated flooding, the Department of Agriculture readied for the distribution of 3million bangus fry, 250,000tilapia fry, and 315bags of rice seeds to affected regions. Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200sacks of rice to Pangasinan. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10million (US$200,000) and 800bags of rice for <b>such</b> <b>efforts.</b> In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly ₱600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan. According to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, ₱15.7million (US$300,000) worth in relief operations was allocated.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit.

5|$|For {{the next}} two days, the Australians {{continued}} to provide protection to the US engineers before being replaced by an American infantry battalion. 1 RAR subsequently flew out on 26 February, returning to Bien Hoa airbase. Meanwhile, following the attack at Tan Binh the Viet Cong attempted to avoid further contact, choosing instead to harass the American work parties with occasional mortar and sniper fire. These tactics proved ineffective, and although the Americans lost a further three killed and 29 wounded, the road was completed by 2 March. The Americans then launched an extensive civic action program {{in an attempt to}} consolidate their gains, repairing damaged houses, distributing food and providing basic health care to the local population. Despite <b>such</b> <b>efforts</b> though, American commanders were pessimistic about the possibility of achieving any long term gains in Binh Duong Province unless the South Vietnamese Army was able to provide lasting protection for the local population. On 7 March, just five days after the completion of Operation Rolling Stone, the US 1st Brigade was redeployed with US 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1 RAR on Operation Silver City, sweeping the south-west sector of War Zone D.|$|E
