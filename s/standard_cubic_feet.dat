5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet),</b> while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet).</b>|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of crude}} natural gas through special {{semipermeable}} membranes and other barriers is another method {{to recover and}} purify helium. In 1996, the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{agreement between}} Home Oil and British Gas was a 15-year contract valued at £27million for {{the delivery of}} 75 million <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> per day (MMSCFD) (2.1 million m3/d) of gas with a maximum flow of 100 MMSCFD (2.8 million m3/d). By 1974 aquifer water ingress into the gas reservoir had significantly reduced gas production to about 1 MMSCFD (28,300 m3/d). The production and gas treatment facility was permanently shutdown in October 1974. Over three years it had produced 11.3 billion <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> of gas (320 million standard m3), only 4.5% of the estimated recoverable reserves.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{standard}}</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot,</b> {{in keeping}} with the ideal gas law, thus defines a standard unit of molecular quantity (not volume, as the name suggests). The conversion to quantity (scf to moles) is straightforward; one <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> represents 1.19804 moles (0.0026412 pound moles).|$|R
50|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> is a unit used {{mostly in}} the natural gas {{industry}} to represent an amount of natural gas.

25|$|Finally, another {{research}} project {{sponsored by the}} Department of Energy, is that of hydrates. Hydrates are compounds formed when natural gas is frozen {{in the presence of}} water.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, major works {{were carried out}} to enable the {{platform}} to meet UK Government gas export requirements and after this work had been completed, Piper Alpha was operating in what was known as phase 2 mode (operating with the Gas Conservation Module (GCM)) {{since the end of}} 1980 up until July 1988; phase 2 mode was its normal operating state. In the late 1980s, major construction, maintenance and upgrade works had been planned by Occidental and by July 1988, the rig was already well into major work activities, with six major projects identified including the change-out of the GCM unit which meant that the rig had been put back into its initial phase 1 mode (i.e. operating without a GCM unit). Despite the complex and demanding work schedule, Occidental made the decision to continue operating the platform in phase 1 mode throughout this period and not to shut it down, as had been originally planned. The planning and controls that were put in place were thought to be adequate. Therefore, Piper continued to export oil at just under 120,000 barrels per day and to export Tartan gas at some 33 MMSCFD (million <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> per day) during this demanding period.|$|E
2500|$|Quantities {{of natural}} gas are {{measured}} in normal cubic meters (corresponding to 0°C at 101.325 kPa) or in <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> (corresponding to [...] and 14.73 psia). The gross heat of combustion of 1m3 of commercial quality natural gas is around 39MJ (≈10.8kWh), but this can vary by several percent. [...] This comes to about 49MJ (≈13.5kWh) for 1kg {{of natural gas}} (assuming a density of 0.8kg m−3, an approximate value).|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{retail sales}} {{are often in}} units of therms (th); 1 therm = 100,000BTU. Gas meters measure the volume of gas used, and this is {{converted}} to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. Wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms (Dth), or in thousand decatherms (MDth), or in million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas. [...] Gas sales to domestic consumers may be in units of 100 <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> (scf).

2500|$|Actual <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> {{per minute}} (ACFM) is {{the volume of}} gas flowing {{anywhere}} in a system, independent of its temperature and pressure. If the system were moving a gas at exactly the [...] "standard" [...] condition, then ACFM would equal SCFM. Unfortunately, this usually {{is not the case}} as the most important change between these two definitions is the pressure. To move a gas, a positive pressure or a vacuum must be created. When positive pressure is applied to a <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> of gas, it is compressed. When a vacuum is applied to a <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> of gas, it expands.

25|$|Methane is {{important}} for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator.
