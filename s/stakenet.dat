Warships that participated in <b>Stakenet</b> 2012 included the U.S. guided-missile destroyers Sterrett and [...] and the coastal patrol vessels [...] and the British frigate and the Kuwati fast-attack craft Al Nokhetna and Maskan. Air units included U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters, U.S. Navy P-3 maritime patrol aircraft, and U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters.|$|E
40|$|Many {{software}} projects fail {{because they}} overlook stakeholders or involve the wrong representatives of significant groups. Unfortunately, existing methods in stakeholder analysis {{are likely to}} omit stakeholders, and consider all stakeholders as equally influential. To identify and prioritise stakeholders, we have developed <b>StakeNet,</b> which consists of three main steps: identify stakeholders {{and ask them to}} recommend other stakeholders and stakeholder roles, build a social network whose nodes are stakeholders and links are recommendations, and prioritise stakeholders using a variety of social network measures. To evaluate <b>StakeNet,</b> we conducted one of the first empirical studies of requirements stakeholders on a software project for a 30, 000 -user system. Using the data collected from surveying and interviewing 68 stakeholders, we show that <b>StakeNet</b> identifies stakeholders and their roles with high recall, and accurately prioritises them. <b>StakeNet</b> uncovers a critical stakeholder role overlooked in the project, whose omission significantly impacted project success...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the field}} of {{software}} engineering, requirements elicitation is the activity in which stakeholder needs are understood. In large-scale software projects, requirements elicitation tends to be beset by three problems: information overload, inadequate stakeholder input, and biased prioritisation of requirements. The work described in this thesis addresses these problems using social networks and collaborative filtering. The work has developed <b>StakeNet,</b> a novel method that uses social networks to identify and prioritise stakeholders. Using <b>StakeNet,</b> the requirements engineer asks an initial list of stakeholders to recommend other stakeholders and stakeholder roles, builds a social network with stakeholders as nodes and their recommendations as links, and prioritises the stakeholders {{using a variety of}} social network measures. The work has also developed StakeRare, a novel method that uses social networks and collaborative filtering to identify and prioritise requirements. Using StakeRare, the requirements engineer asks the stakeholders identified by <b>StakeNet</b> to rate an initial list of requirements and suggest other requirements, recommends other relevant requirements to the stakeholders using collaborative filtering, and prioritises the requirements using the ratings and the stakeholders&# 146; priority from <b>StakeNet.</b> Finally, to support the methods, this work has developed StakeSource, a novel software tool that automates the manual processes in <b>StakeNet.</b> StakeSource collects recommendations from stakeholders, builds the social network, and prioritises the stakeholders automatically. The methods and tool have been evaluated using real large-scale software projects. The empirical evaluation of both <b>StakeNet</b> and StakeRare using a real large-scale software project demonstrates that the methods identify a highly complete set of stakeholders and their requirements, and prioritise the stakeholders and their requirements accurately. These methods outperform the existing methods used in the project, and require significantly less time from the stakeholders and requirements engineers. StakeSource has been evaluated with real large-scale projects by practitioners. The tool is now used in major software projects, and organisations are adopting it. The methods, tool, and evaluation described in this thesis provide evidence that social networks and collaborative filtering can effectively support requirements elicitation in large-scale software projects...|$|E
40|$|Scylla serrata {{occurs in}} fairly good numbers at Tuticorin, {{throughout}} the year. In the nortbsrn part, {{it is usually}} caught from the shallow coastal waters by shore-seines and cast-nets, while in the backwaters and canals of the southern region by a simple trapping device. Apart from these, certain drag-nets, <b>stakenets,</b> baited hooks and hand-picking are also resorted to for the capture of this crab. The estimated yield of S. serrata during 1974 - 75 was 9, 460. 6 kg, of wthich 53. 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} mud crabs were studied in a replanted mangrove forest in Buswang, Aklan, Philippines. Two fishing gears, lift nets and bamboo traps, were used to monitor relative abundance of Scylla spp. populations from March 2002 to December 2003 inside the mangrove forest. A third gear, a <b>stakenet</b> set across a creek, was used to monitor crabs migrating out of the mangroves during the ebb tide. Scylla olivacea formed 99. 3 % and 70. 3 % of the catch in the mangrove and the <b>stakenet,</b> respectively. The percentage of Scylla tranquebarica increased from < 1 % in the mangrove catches to 29 % in the <b>stakenet.</b> Scylla serrata was present at very low levels in both catches. The lack of modal progression in the sizeâ€“frequency plots and the year-round catch rate of gravid females suggested that recruitment was constant throughout the year. Even though relative abundance decreased over the study period indicating that the stock is being over-exploited, mud crab production is more than equivalent to that of most natural mangroves.

40|$|<b>Stakenet</b> {{which is}} {{popularly known as}} 'dol' in Maharashtra is an {{important}} gear to fish, specially, Bombay duck and Acetes spp. Sasoon dock {{is one of the}} important fish landing centres in Maharashtra commonly used for landing mechanised catch of trawl and 'dol' units. Annual net profit of a 'dol' unit is calculated at Rs. 18, 623 during the study period. The net earning per kg of fish is calculated at Rs. 0. 36. Thus, 'dol’ operation during 1990 -' 91 was profitable at Sasoon dock...|$|E
30|$|More recent {{research}} focuses on identifying and prioritizing stakeholders. This is supported by StakeSource which is a lightweight web-based tool implementing the <b>StakeNet</b> method [19]. The work by Lim et al. is based on social network analysis as well as collaborative filtering and provides requirements engineers {{with a list of}} the key stakeholders. The method requires an initial set of already identified stakeholders who themselves identify and suggest new stakeholders (snowballing effect). In addition, StakeSource provides basic capabilities to identify, negotiate and prioritize requirements [19]. Although this approach is rather straightforward, stakeholders need to make themselves familiar with the forms that allow entering and rating requirements.|$|E
