Both whole bovine MFGM and its extracted lipid components were found to exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus infectivity in vitro. Antibacterial effects of MFGM have included decreased gastric colonization and inflammation after H. pylori infection in mice; inhibition of <b>shiga</b> <b>toxin</b> gene expression by E. coli O157:H7; and decreased colonization and translocation of L. monocytogenes.

40|$|Hemolytic-uremic syndrome, {{the main}} cause of acute renal failure in early childhood, is caused {{primarily}} by intestinal infections from some Escherichia coli strains that produce <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins.</b> The toxins released in the gut are targeted to renal endothelium after binding to polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The presence of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> in the feces and the circulating neutrophils of 20 children with hemolytic uremic syndrome was evaluated by the Vero cell cytotoxicity assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. The latter showed the presence of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> on the polymorphonuclear leukocytes of 13 patients, 5 of whom had no other microbiologic or serologic evidence of infection by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli. A positive relationship was observed between the amounts of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> released in the intestinal lumen and those released in the bloodstream. The toxins were detectable on the neutrophils for a median period of 5 days after they were no longer detectable in stools. This investigation confirms that the immunodetection of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> on neutrophils is a valuable tool for laboratory diagnosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection in hemolytic-uremic syndrome and provides clues for further studies on the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of this syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are {{a public}} health concern. Bacterial culture {{techniques}} commonly used to detect E. coli O 157 :H 7 will not detect other STEC serotypes. Feces from cattle and other animals {{are a source of}} O 157 :H 7 and other pathogenic serotypes of STEC. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the pen-level prevalence of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> and selected STEC serotypes in pre-slaughter feedlot cattle. Composite fecal samples were cultured and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect genes for <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> (stx 1 and stx 2) and genes for O 157 :H 7, O 111 :H 8, and O 26 :H 11 serotypes. Evidence of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> was found in 23 pens (92 %), O 157 :H 7 in 2 (8 %), O 111 :H 8 in 5 (20 %), and O 26 :H 11 in 20 (80 %) of the 25 pens investigated. Although pen-level prevalence estimates for <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> and non-O 157 serotypes seem high relative to O 157 :H 7, further effort is required to determine the human health significance of non-O 157 serotypes of STEC in feedlot cattle...|$|R
25|$|While it is {{relatively}} uncommon, the E. coli serotype O157:H7 can naturally {{be found in the}} intestinal contents of some cattle, goats, and even sheep. The digestive tract of cattle lack the <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxin</b> receptor globotriaosylceramide, and thus, these can be asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium. The prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in North American feedlot cattle herds ranges from 0 to 60%.|$|E
25|$|Strains of E. coli that express Shiga and Shiga-like toxins gained {{this ability}} due to {{infection}} with a prophage containing the structural coding for the toxin, and nonproducing strains may become infected and produce shiga-like toxins after incubation with <b>shiga</b> <b>toxin</b> positive strains.

25|$|The B {{subunits}} form a five-membered or pentameric ring, {{where one}} end of the A subunit goes into and is held. This B subunit ring is also capable of binding to a receptor {{on the surface of the}} host cell. Without the B subunits, the A subunit has no way of attaching to or entering the cell, and thus no way to exert its toxic effect. Cholera toxin, <b>shiga</b> <b>toxin,</b> and SubAB toxin all have B subunits that are made up of five identical protein components, meaning that their B subunits are homopentamers. Pertussis toxin is different where its pentameric ring is made up of four different protein components, where one of the components is repeated to form a heteropentamer.|$|E
40|$|<b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> {{consist of}} an A-moiety and five B-moieties able to bind the neutral glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb 3) {{on the cell}} surface. To intoxicate cells efficiently, the toxin A-moiety has to be cleaved by furin and transported retrogradely to the Golgi {{apparatus}} and to the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzymatically active part of the A-moiety is then translocated to the cytosol, where it inhibits protein synthesis and in some cell types induces apoptosis. Protection of cells can be provided either by inhibiting binding of the toxin to cells or by interfering {{with any of the}} subsequent steps required for its toxic effect. In this article we provide a brief overview of the interaction of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> with cells, describe some compounds and conditions found to protect cells against <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins,</b> and discuss whether they might also provide protection in animals and humans...|$|R
5000|$|Pk antigen is a {{receptor}} for <b>shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> and Escherichia coli-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). [...] It {{is also a}} receptor for Streptococcus suis (zoonotic bacterium {{which can}} cause bacterial meningitis).|$|R
25|$|STEC-HUS occurs after {{ingestion}} of {{a strain of}} bacteria expressing <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxin(s),</b> usually types of E. coli, that expresses verotoxin (also called Shiga-like toxin). E. coli can produce stx1 and/or stx2 <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins,</b> the latter being more dangerous and {{a combination of both}} toxins in certain ratios is usually associated with HUS. These <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> bind GB3 receptors, globotriaosylceramide, which are present in renal tissue more than any other tissue and are also found in central nervous system neurons and other tissue. Children have more GB3 receptors than adults which may be why children are more susceptible to HUS. Cattle, swine, deer, and other mammals do not have GB3 receptors, but can be asymptomatic carriers of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria. Some humans can also be asymptomatic carriers. Once the bacteria colonizes, diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, typically follows. HUS develops about 5–10 days after onset of diarrhea, with decreased urine output (oliguria), blood in the urine (hematuria), kidney failure, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) and destruction of red blood cells (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia). Hypertension is common. In some cases, there are prominent neurologic changes.|$|R
500|$|There is one strain, E. coli 0157:H7, that {{produces}} the <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxin</b> (classified as a bioterrorism agent).

2500|$|The main {{receptor}} for the <b>shiga</b> <b>toxin</b> is globotriaosylceramide or Gb3. <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxin</b> is {{also brought}} to the golgi apparatus before being directed to the endoplasmic reticulum for PDI to cleave the disulfide bond.

2500|$|Cholera toxin, {{pertussis}} toxin, and <b>shiga</b> <b>toxin</b> {{all have}} their {{targets in the}} cytosol of the cell.

5000|$|Shiga-like toxins 1 and 2 (SLT-1 and 2 or Stx-1 and 2) are the <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> {{produced}} by some E. coli strains. Stx-1 {{is identical to}} Stx or differs by only one amino acid. [...] Stx-2 shares 56% sequence identity with Stx-1.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> act {{to inhibit}} protein {{synthesis}} within target cells by a mechanism {{similar to that}} of ricin.

40|$|Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli is {{the major}} cause of acute renal failure in young children. The {{interaction}} of <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> 1 and 2 (Stx 1 and Stx 2) with endothelial cells {{is an important step}} in the renal coagulation and thrombosis observed in hemolytic uremic syndrome. Previous studies have shown that bacterial lipopolysaccharide and host cytokines slowly sensitize endothelial cells to <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins.</b> In the present study, bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) rapidly (1 h) sensitized human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) to the cytotoxic action of Stx 2. Exposure of endothelial cells to neutral SMase (0. 067 U/ml) caused a rapid increase of intracellular ceramide that persisted for hours. Closely following the change in ceramide level was an increase in the expression of globotriaosylceramide (Gb 3), the receptor for Stx 2. A rapid increase was also observed in the mRNA for ceramide:glucosyltransferase (CGT), the first of three glycosyltransferase enzymes of the Gb 3 biosynthetic pathway. The product of CGT (glucosylceramide) was also increased. In contrast, mRNA for the third enzyme of the pathway, Gb 3 synthase, was constitutively produced and was not influenced by SMase treatment of HDMEC. These results describe a rapid response mechanism by which extracellular neutral SMase derived from either bacteria or eukaryotic cells may signal endothelial cells to become sensitive to <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The A subunit of an AB5 toxin is {{the portion}} {{responsible}} for catalysis of specific targets.

Domain A2 (approximately 5kDa in cholera toxin or heat labile enterotoxin) provides a non-covalent linkage to the B subunit through the B subunit's central pore. The A1 chain for cholera toxin catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(NAD) to arginine or other guanidine compounds by utilizing ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). In the absence of arginine or simple guanidino compounds, the toxin mediated NAD+ nucleosidase (NADase) activity proceeds using water as a nucleophile.|$|E

40|$|Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an {{emerging}} food- and water-borne pathogen, causing approximately 73, 000 annual infections in the United States {{and an estimated}} 1. 5 million infections globally. E. coli O 157 :H 7, the most frequently associated EHEC strain, is primarily transmitted through consumption of contaminated ground beef and produce and leads to hemorrhagic colitis in humans. In 5 % to 15 % of infected patients, circulating <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> (Stx 1, Stx 2) cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized {{by the presence of}} thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and thrombotic microangiopathy, contributing to acute kidney injury (AKI). Current treatment is supportive and antibiotic therapy is contraindicative as it increases toxin production. Therapeutics for EHEC-induced HUS need to be identified to minimize kidney injury and uncontrolled coagulopathy. Well-characterized animal models of HUS and EHEC infection are available and provide avenues for potential therapeutic discovery. Baboons (Papio) challenged with endotoxin-free <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins</b> develop full spectrum HUS, and mice infected with Stx 2 -producing Citrobacter rodentium (Cr Stx 2 +), a genetically modified enteric mouse pathogen, develop severe Stx 2 -mediated kidney injury.

In these studies, we determined whether complement was activated in baboons challenged with <b>Shiga</b> <b>toxins,</b> and evaluated whether intraperitoneal injection of sTM would reduce disease severity from mice infected with Cr Stx 2 +.
