25|$|Event-driven SOA {{is a form}} of <b>service-oriented</b> <b>architecture</b> (SOA), {{combining}} the intelligence and proactiveness of event-driven architecture with the organizational capabilities found in service offerings. Before event-driven SOA, the typical SOA platform orchestrated services centrally, through pre-defined business processes, assuming that what should have already been triggered is defined in a business process. This older approach (sometimes called SOA 1.0) does not account for events that occur across, or outside of, specific business processes. Thus complex events, in which a pattern of activities—both non-scheduled and scheduled—should trigger a set of services is not accounted for in traditional SOA 1.0 architecture.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany {{information}} security approaches deal with <b>service-oriented</b> <b>architectures</b> {{by focusing on}} security policies, requirements and technical implementation during service design, specification and implementation phases. Nevertheless, <b>service-oriented</b> <b>architectures</b> are increasingly deployed in open, distributed and dynamic environments, which particularly require an end-to-end security at each phase of the service’s lifecycle. Moreover, the security should not only focus on services without considering the risks and threats that might be caused by elements from business activities or underlying hardware and software infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a model highlighting the dependency between elements at business, service and infrastructure levels, defining the design context. In addition, we develop a holistic approach to define a security conceptual model, including services, security risks and security policies and guides all phases in a typical design method for <b>service-oriented</b> <b>architectures...</b>|$|R

This contribution starts with a brief introduction {{of the state of}} the art in <b>service-oriented</b> <b>architectures.</b> The authors argue that semantically rich descriptions of services are essential to tap the full potential of <b>service-oriented</b> <b>architectures</b> in enterprise environments. This regards matchmaking and binding of services, integration of new services as well as the cost-efficient development of added value services by composing semantically described basic services. This paper introduces a semantic service platform that implements dynamic matchmaking, composition and binding of semantically described services. Finally its functionality and a possible application scenario are outlined...|$|R
