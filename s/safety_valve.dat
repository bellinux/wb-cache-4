5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} {{a plan to}} build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the <b>Safety</b> <b>Valve</b> and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running {{down the middle of the}} island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E
25|$|Condensate Pump A was {{switched}} on. Gas {{flowed into}} the pump, {{and because of}} the missing <b>safety</b> <b>valve,</b> produced an overpressure which the loosely fitted metal disc did not withstand.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Belpaire boiler {{was fitted}} with Ramsbottom <b>safety</b> <b>valves,</b> while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with Pop <b>safety</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|As rebuilt, the {{locomotive}} was still equipped with both Salter and Ramsbottom <b>safety</b> <b>valves.</b> Contemporary photographs {{show that the}} Salter <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> were later removed.|$|R
25|$|In Partners, Nil bids {{are easier}} to make because the Nil bidder's partner can {{overtake}} or trump the Nil bidder's high cards. In Cutthroat, this <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> is not available.|$|E
25|$|Central Bay is {{the largest}} part of the bay. It is {{separated}} from the Atlantic Ocean by the <b>Safety</b> <b>Valve.</b> It has been adversely affected primarily by bulkheading, urban runoff discharged by canals, {{and the loss of}} natural fresh water flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{permit for}} the {{overhaul}} was found, {{but not the}} other permit stating that the pump must not be started under any circumstances due to the missing <b>safety</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve was in a different location from the pump and therefore the permits were stored in different boxes, as they were sorted by location. None of those present were aware that {{a vital part of}} the machine had been removed. The manager assumed from the existing documents that it would be safe to start Pump A. The missing valve was not noticed by anyone, particularly as the metal disc replacing the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> was several metres above ground level and obscured by machinery.|$|E
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire {{saturated steam}} boilers were fitted with Ramsbottom <b>safety</b> <b>valves,</b> while the Watson Standard superheated steam boiler was fitted with Pop <b>safety</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|All the {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} with Salter <b>safety</b> <b>valves.</b> Photographs show {{that at some}} stage Ramsbottom <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> were installed {{in addition to the}} existing Salter valves.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{wide range}} of <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> having many {{different}} applications and performance criteria in different areas. In addition, national standards are set for many kinds of <b>safety</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were originally}} black, then repainted green, then repainted cherry red and finally painted black due to wartime regulations. The dome and <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> were polished brass. The green livery had the chimney black and lining in yellow or off white {{applied to the}} side tanks, cab sides, cab rear and wheel skirting.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme is {{also thought}} {{to act as}} a <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> for stress {{conditions}} in the photosynthetic apparatus. By providing an electron sink when the plastoquinone pool is over-reduced, the oxidase is thought to protect photosystem II from oxidative damage. Knockouts for Rubisco and photosystem II complexes, which would experience more photodamage than normal, exhibit an upregulation of plastid terminal oxidase. This effect is not universal because it requires plants to have additional PTOX regulation mechanisms. While many studies agree with the stress-protective role of the enzyme, one study showed that overexpression of PTOX increases the production of reactive oxygen species and causes more photodamage than normal. This finding suggests that an efficient antioxidant system is required for the oxidase to function as a <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> for stress conditions and that it is more important during chloroplast biogenesis than in the regular functioning of the chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|Stiltsville is a {{group of}} wood stilt houses located one mile south of Cape Florida on sand banks of the <b>Safety</b> <b>Valve</b> on the edge of Biscayne Bay in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The {{structures}} stand on wood or reinforced concrete pilings, generally ten feet above the shallow water which varies from one to three feet deep at low tide.|$|E
50|$|The Wakefield {{mechanical}} lubricator was mounted further {{back on the}} 502. These locomotives were also fitted with Ross pop <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> as built. The 1913 batch had lever <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> changed to Ross pop type after first major overhaul after 10 years.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one of the}} Class 5B locomotives, no. 725, was {{eventually}} reboilered with a Watson Standard no. 1 boiler and reclassified to Class 5BR. While the original boiler was fitted with Ramsbottom <b>safety</b> <b>valves,</b> the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with Pop <b>safety</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom <b>safety</b> <b>valves,</b> while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with Pop <b>safety</b> <b>valves.</b> Even though the boiler pressure {{setting of the}} reboilered engine was lowered from , the tractive effort increased from 24860 to 25750 lbf kN at 75% of boiler pressure.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{pressure}} in the boiler can be monitored by a gauge mounted in the cab and excessive steam pressure can be released manually by the driver or fireman. Alternatively, in conditions of high boiler pressure, a <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> may be triggered to reduce pressure and prevent the boiler bursting violently, which had previously resulted in injuries and fatalities to nearby individuals, as well as extensive damage to the locomotive and nearby structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{first batch}} of 300 {{locomotives}} built between 1929 and 1931 included a medium height chimney, a mid-boiler dome, <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> with cover, and an enclosed cab. The boiler included a top-feed (between the chimney and dome). They {{were similar in}} appearance to older 0-6-0 tank engines that had been rebuilt as pannier tanks, particularly the later rebuilds of the 2721 class. The 2721 class was itself a development of the 1854 class, which in turn {{was based on the}} 645 class.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} {{a plan to}} build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned a series of bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the <b>Safety</b> <b>Valve,</b> and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. When the Dade County Planning Board was unable to secure a right of way for the highway across the southern end of Key Biscayne, it dropped the plan.|$|E
50|$|A {{conservatively}} designed autoclave {{has multiple}} <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> which are each sized {{to be able}} to cope with the greatest available airflow into the vessel plus not less than 30%. The valves are mounted on a manifold that allows multiple pressure vessel outlets to feed multiple <b>safety</b> <b>valves,</b> each one of which can handle the entire air dump by itself, even if one pressure vessel outlet is accidentally blocked by debris from an internal failure. The added cost of the redundant <b>safety</b> <b>valves</b> is approximately one tenth of one percent of the machine price.|$|R

25|$|Murdoch's working {{model was}} a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle {{about a foot}} in height with the engine and boiler placed between the two larger back wheels with a spirit lamp underneath to heat the water and a tiller at the front turning the smaller front wheel. The mechanics of the model locomotive incorporated a number of innovations, such as a boiler <b>safety</b> <b>valve,</b> having the cylinder partly immersed in the boiler and using a new valve system on {{the lines of the}} D-slide valve.|$|E
25|$|The Cullen Inquiry {{was set up}} in November 1988 to {{establish}} the cause of the disaster. It was chaired by the Scottish judge William Cullen. After 180 days of proceedings, it released its report Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster (short: Cullen Report) in November 1990. It concluded that the initial condensate leak was the result of maintenance work being carried out simultaneously on a pump and related <b>safety</b> <b>valve.</b> The inquiry was critical of Piper Alpha's operator, Occidental, which was found guilty of having inadequate maintenance and safety procedures, but no criminal charges were ever brought against the company.|$|E
25|$|Two {{condensate}} pumps, designated A and B, displaced the platform's condensate {{for transport}} to the coast. On {{the morning of}} 6 July, Pump A's pressure <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> (PSV #504) was removed for routine maintenance. The pump's two-yearly overhaul was planned but had not started. The open condensate pipe was temporarily sealed with a disk cover (flat metal disc also called a blind flange or blank flange). Because the work could not be completed by 6:00p.m., the disc cover remained in place. It was hand-tightened only. The on-duty engineer filled in a permit which stated that Pump A was not ready and must not be switched on under any circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Unemployment was {{a chronic}} problem for Yugoslavia, the {{unemployment}} rates were amongst {{the highest in}} Europe during its existence {{and they did not}} reach critical levels before the 1980s only due to the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> provided by sending one million guest workers yearly to advanced industrialized countries in Western Europe. The departure of Yugoslavs seeking work began in the 1950s, when individuals began slipping across the border illegally. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly, especially to West Germany. By the early 1970s 20 percent of the country's labor force or 1,1 million workers were employed abroad. This was also a source of capital and foreign currency for Yugoslavia.|$|E
25|$|This valve allows fluids {{to pass up}} or be pumped {{down the}} {{production}} tubing. When closed the DHSV forms a barrier {{in the direction of}} hydrocarbon flow, but fluids can still be pumped down for well kill operations. It is placed as far below the surface as is deemed safe from any possible surface disturbance including cratering caused by the wipeout of the platform. Where hydrates are likely to form (most production is at risk of this), the depth of the SCSSV (surface-controlled, sub-surface <b>safety</b> <b>valve)</b> below the seabed may be as much as 1km: this will allow for the geothermal temperature to be high enough to prevent hydrates from blocking the valve.|$|E
25|$|At about 1:30 in the {{afternoon}} of October 25, the engineer reported that the water {{had been allowed to}} get too low in the boiler. On hearing this report, the captain ordered the engine stopped and the <b>safety</b> <b>valve</b> opened, the steamer being brought to anchor about {{a mile and a half}} from the Fox Islands, in Penobscot Bay. The fire in the furnace was extinguished, but in about a half hour, the steamer was found to be on fire under the deck over the boiler, near the animal cages. An effort was made to extinguish the flames by means of a hose attached to the pump, but it proved fruitless. The fire spread rapidly and soon consumed the firefighting equipment.|$|E
