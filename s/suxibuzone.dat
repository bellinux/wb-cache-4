50|$|Anti-inflammatories {{are always}} used when {{treating}} acute case of laminitis, and include Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), DMSO, pentoxpfylline, and cryotherapy. For analgesia, NSAIDs {{are often the}} first line of defense. Phenylbutazone is commonly used for its strong effect and relatively low cost. Flunixin (Banamine), ketofen, and others are also used. Nonspecific NSAIDs such as <b>suxibuzone,</b> or COX-2-specific drugs, such as firocoxib and diclofenac, may be somewhat safer than phenylbutazone in preventing NSAID toxicity such as right dorsal colitis, gastric ulcers, and kidney damage. However, firocoxib provides less pain relief than phenylbutazone or flunixin. Care must be taken that pain isn't totally eliminated, since this will encourage the horse to stand and move around, which increases mechanical separation of the laminae.|$|E
