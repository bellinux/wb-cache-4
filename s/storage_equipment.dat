25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to <b>storage</b> <b>equipment,</b> and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E

40|$|In {{the house}} that has a crawl space with the {{insulated}} foundation walls and non-insulated floor over the crawl space, if all the crawl space can be heated, then the entire floor will be heated, and as the result whole {{the space of the}} first floor will become the radiant heating environment. We call this heating system ‘Crawl-space heating’. In this papar, the crawl-space heating system combined with the thermal storage using an air source heat pump as a heat source is introduced. To verify the efficiency of this heating system, field test was carried out in an experimental house and following facts were revealed. In the period from 23 : 00 to 7 : 00, that is off-peak electrical load period in Japan, the heat pump generates about 80 MJ heat and supplies the heat to the thermal <b>storage</b> <b>equipments.</b> In the same period, about 40 % of the supplied heat was stored in the thermal <b>storage</b> <b>equipments</b> and the balance 60 % was used to heat the crawl space. In the period from 7 : 00 to 23 : 00, that is peak period, the stored heat in the thermal <b>storage</b> <b>equipments</b> was released to the air coming from the fans and was used to heat the crawl space. Under the condition of the crawl-space heating, the radiant heating environment was obtained in the room. In the environment, vertical temperature distribution was small and floor-surface temperature was higher than the space. Furthermore, the difference between the room temperature in the first floor can be minimized as far as the adequate circulation of the warm air in the crawl space is secured and also the thermal conductivity of the floor material is good enough to transmit the heat in the crawl space to the above room. 1...|$|R

50|$|<b>Storage</b> <b>equipment</b> is {{used for}} holding or {{buffering}} materials {{over a period of}} time. The design of each type of <b>storage</b> <b>equipment,</b> along with its use in warehouse design, represents a trade-off between minimizing handling costs, by making material easily accessible, and maximizing the utilization of space (or cube). If materials are stacked directly on the floor, then no <b>storage</b> <b>equipment</b> is required, but, on average, each different item in storage will have a stack only half full; to increase cube utilization, storage racks can be used to allow multiple stacks of different items to occupy the same floor space at different levels. The use of racks becomes preferable to floor storage as the number of units per item requiring storage decreases. Similarly, the depth at which units of an item are stored affects cube utilization in proportion to the number of units per item requiring storage.|$|E
