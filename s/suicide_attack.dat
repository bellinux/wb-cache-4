40|$|Many experts {{claim that}} the {{incidence}} of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> is driven by religious cleavages. To test this hypothesis, we investigate whether the total number of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> per violent conflict or the annual number of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> per country is associated with simmering religious conflicts. We distinguish between two kinds of religious cleavages: cleavages at the macro level between the stake holders in violent conflicts and cleavages at the micro or battle field level between the actual perpetrators and victims of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks.</b> Our results do not indicate that religious cleavages are an important precondition for the incidence of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> are {{a complex}} and vexing {{phenomena}} that are appearing with greater frequency in the international arena. Previous approaches to studying <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> tend to examine them at one-level of analysis. While helpful, the insights produced are isolated from other crucial factors. This dissertation examines <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> at three-levels of analysis as it investigates the organizational incentives, individual motivations and how the attacks achieve societal resonance. As such, the dissertation asks three primary research questions: why do organizations adopt <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks,</b> why are individuals motivated to become suicide attackers and how do the attacks attain resonance?The research questions are applied to four case studies selected along a conflict continuum where <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> were used. The cases are (a) the Japanese use of Kamikazes during World War II, (b) the LTTE's use of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> during its irregular war against Sri Lanka, (c) Hamas' use of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> as domestic terrorism against Israel, and (d) Al Qaeda's use of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> as transnational terrorism. The dissertation argues that organizations use <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> out of defensive necessity and for strategic purposes, individuals are motivated to become suicide attackers by a religo-nationalist liberation ideology that promises the attacker post-mortem incentives {{for his or her}} death, and that societal resonance is achieved when the organization draws on religious, cultural and nationalistic narratives that enable the population to accept the tactic...|$|R

5|$|Callaghan {{is perhaps}} best known for ordering, despite {{disagreement}} from some of his crew, that an honorable funeral be held for an enemy pilot who died during a <b>suicide</b> <b>attack</b> on the Missouri in 1945. Following World War II, he directed the US Navy's transportation service and filled senior command roles in eastern Asia, including leadership of the US Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force during the Korean War. He retired from the US Navy at the rank of vice admiral in 1957 and worked in civilian maritime transport before retiring to Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a <b>suicide</b> <b>attack</b> and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for recoverable flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E
5|$|Xigbar's {{telescopic}} sight was {{changed from a}} crosshair and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles. An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, {{which is used to}} shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun. The death of Organization XIII member Axel was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his <b>suicide</b> <b>attack,</b> while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.|$|E
40|$|<b>Suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> {{have clearly}} {{become the most}} {{effective}} modus operandi of modern insurgencies, in a sense, that, {{the very act of}} the attack is reliant upon the death of its executor. However the argument that <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> is solely a religiously inspired phenomenon is completely misleading. This paper thoroughly examines the misperceptions about and motivations behind <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks.</b> It uses the multidisciplinary approach to support the argument that <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> are essentially used to meet the secular and strategic goal of compelling the withdrawal of foreign military forces from illegally occupied lands...|$|R

5|$|The Camp Chapman {{attack was}} a <b>suicide</b> <b>attack</b> by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi against the Central Intelligence Agency {{facility}} inside Forward Operating Base Chapman on December 30, 2009. FOB Chapman is {{located near the}} eastern Afghanistan city of Khost, which is about 10 miles northwest of the border with Pakistan. One of the main tasks of the CIA personnel stationed at the base was to provide intelligence supporting drone attacks against targets in Pakistan. Seven American CIA officers and contractors, an officer of Jordan's intelligence service, and an Afghan working for the CIA were killed when al-Balawi detonated a bomb sewn into a vest he was wearing. Six other American CIA officers were wounded. The bombing was the most lethal attack against the CIA in more than 25 years.|$|E
5|$|When Khaldun {{fails to}} meet with Tom, the team worry that he had deceived them. However, that night, Khaldun sneaks into Tom's bedroom at the {{university}} campus, and warns him that Rachid is keeping explosives, and a <b>suicide</b> <b>attack</b> will take place the next day, but will not disclose where. Tom turns to Parkmount's imam Fazul Azzam (Roshan Seth), who opposes Rachid's radicalised views. After learning Fazzul's daughter Aminah (Praveen Sond) is involved, he forces her into revealing {{the location of the}} planned attack. Rachid is placed under arrest when explosives are found in his prayer room. Khaldun meanwhile, kills Rachid's men in an empty building, and attempts to disarm the bomber, young Abu Hassan (Taahir Husein), but he runs away into a playground. As Tom's team and local police surround the playground, Khaldun attempts to talk Abu out of the attack. However, when he fails, Khaldun throws himself as Abu detonates the bomb, in order to avoid further casualties. Later, CIA liaison Christine Dale voices disappointment towards Khaldun's death, but appears grateful that Tom is unharmed.|$|E
5|$|On 1July, TF38 sailed from Leyte {{to strike}} at the Japanese home islands. At this time the Task Force {{comprised}} nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts. Halsey sought to coordinate his fleet's attacks during {{the last months of}} the war with those of the USAAF's land-based aircraft, but the two forces often operated separately. On 10July TF38's aircraft conducted raids on airfields in the Tokyo region, destroying several aircraft on the ground. No Japanese fighters were encountered in the air, however, as they were being kept in reserve for a planned large-scale <b>suicide</b> <b>attack</b> on the Allied fleet. Following this raid TF38 steamed north, and began a major attack on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14July. These strikes continued the next day, and sank eight of the 12 railway car ferries which carried coal from Hokkaido to Honshu and damaged the remaining four. Many other ships were also destroyed in this area, including 70 out of the 272 small sailing ships which carried coal between the islands. Once again no Japanese aircraft opposed this attack, though 25 were destroyed on the ground. The loss of the railway car ferries reduced the amount of coal shipped from Hokkaido to Honshu by 80percent, which greatly hindered production in Honshu's factories. This operation has been described as the single most effective strategic air attack of the Pacific War. TF38's battleships and cruisers also began a series of bombardments of industrial targets on 14July which continued until almost the end of the war.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Who chooses <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks?</b> Using three {{data sources}} {{spanning}} a half-century, and comparing suicide attackers to civil war insurgents, {{we show that}} a) insurgents typically target poor, mountainous countries, while <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> do not; b) though insurgents often kill coreligionists, they seldom use <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> to do so; and c) though many groups rebel, <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> are favored by the radical religious. Putting theology aside, we explain (a) and (b) {{with the notion of}} a “hard ” target, predicting that <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> are chosen when targets are hard to destroy without high risk of capture. Data from Israel/Palestine confirm that prediction. We draw on the sociology of religion to explain (c), modeling the choice of tactics by rebels when targets are hard, and bearing in mind the human costs and tactical benefits of <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks.</b> We ask what a suicide attacker would have to believe to be deemed rational. We then embed that attacker and other operatives in a club model which emphasizes the function of radical religious organizations as providers of benign local public goods. The sacrifices which these groups demand reduce free-riding in cooperative production of these goods. Sacrificial demands make these clubs well suited for organizing <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks,</b> a tactic for which defection by operatives endangers the entire organization...|$|R
50|$|In the Philippines the Moro Muslims are {{reported}} to have engaged in <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> against enemies {{as early as the}} 16th century. Those who performed <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> were called mag-sabil, and the <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> were known as Parang-sabil. The Spanish called them juramentado. The idea of the juramentado was considered part of jihad in the Moros Islamic religion. During an attack, a Juramentado would throw himself at his targets and kill them with bladed weapons such as barongs and kris until he himself was killed. The Moros performed juramentado <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> against the Spanish in the Spanish-Moro conflict of the 16th to the 19th centuries, against the Americans in the Moro Rebellion (1899-1913), and against the Japanese in World War II. The Moro Juramentados aimed their attacks specifically against their enemies, and not against non-Muslims in general. They launched <b>suicide</b> <b>attacks</b> on the Japanese, Spanish, Americans and Filipinos, but did not attack the non-Muslim Chinese as the Chinese were not considered enemies of the Moro people.
