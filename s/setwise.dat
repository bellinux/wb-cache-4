40|$|One of {{the most}} useful tools for {{handling}} multivariate distributions with givenunivariatemarginals is the copula function. Using it, any multivariate distribution function can be represented {{in a way that}} emphasizes the separate roles of the marginals and of the dependence structure. Liet al. (1996) introduced an analogous tool, called linkage, which is useful for handling multivariate distributions with givenmultivariatemarginals. The goal of the present paper is to introduce a new kind of linkage, called thedynamic linkage, which can usefully handle multivariate life distributions (that is, distributions of non-negative random variables) by taking advantage of the time dynamics of the underlying lifetimes. Like the linkages of Liet al. (1996), the new dynamic linkage can be used for the study of multivariate distributions with given multivariate marginals by emphasizing the separate roles of the dependence structureamongthe given multivariate marginals and the dependence structurewithineach of the nonoverlapping marginals. Preservation of some <b>setwise</b> positive dependence properties, from the dynamic linkage functionLto the joint distributionFand vice versa, are studied. When two different distribution functions are associated with the same dynamic linkage (that is, have the same <b>setwise</b> dependence structure) we show that the cumulative hazard order among the corresponding multivariate marginal distributions implies an overall stochastic dominance between the two underlying distribution functions. copula given marginals dependence structure <b>setwise</b> positive dependence stochastic order total hazard construction cumulative hazard order reliability theory...|$|E
40|$|Current {{conversational}} recommender {{systems do}} not offer guarantees {{on the quality of}} their recommendations, either because they do not maintain a model of a user’s utility function, or do so in an ad hoc fashion. In this paper, we propose an approach to recommender systems that incorporates explicit utility models into the recommendation process in a decision-theoretically sound fashion. The system maintains explicit constraints on the user’s utility based on the semantics of the preferences revealed by the user’s actions. In particular, we propose and investigate a new decision criterion, <b>setwise</b> maximum regret, for constructing optimal recommendation sets. This new criterion extends the mathematical notion of maximum regret used in decision theory and preference elicitation to sets. We develop computational procedures for computing <b>setwise</b> max regret. We also show that the criterion suggests choice sets for queries that are myopically optimal: that is, it refines knowledge of a user’s utility function in a way that reduces max regret more quickly than any other choice set. Thus <b>setwise</b> max regret acts both as guarantee on the quality of our recommendations and as a driver for further utility elicitation. Our simulation results suggest that this utilitytheoretically sound approach to user modeling allows much more effective navigation of a product space than traditional approaches based on, for example, heuristic utility models and product similarity measures...|$|E
