25|$|At this time, the {{majority}} of lines in rural, and regional areas (particularly in Scotland and Wales) were still manually switched. This inhibited growth, and caused bottlenecks in the network, {{as well as being}} labour and cost-intensive. The Post Office began to introduce automatic switching, and replaced all of its 6,000 exchanges. <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was also added from 1958, which allowed subscribers to dial their own long-distance calls.|$|E

50|$|The {{phone service}} {{began with a}} manual {{exchange}} in the Post Office. A <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> system came circa 1981.|$|E
50|$|Telephone administrations {{in other}} {{countries}} implemented similar programs, {{such as in the}} United Kingdom, which led to <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD).|$|E
5000|$|... 9-1-11. By dialing an {{exchange}} local to the caller's phone (preferably a call box phone), dialing 9-1-10 {{then at the}} right moment tapping the phone rest to add an extra pulse, this could give irregular STD (<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing)</b> access.|$|R
50|$|As step offices became rarer, <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing</b> Codes {{no longer}} {{followed}} the original rules, and were significantly revised in the mid-1990s, with further changes as wider use of mobile phones and non-BT competition {{came into the}} UK market. There are now some 70000 local exchange codes in use in the UK. The largest trunk carrier, British Telecom, connects the local network through some 60 transit (tandem) switches.|$|R
25|$|Most of the United Kingdom had no {{lettered}} telephone dials {{until the}} introduction of <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing</b> (STD) in 1958. Until then, only the director areas (Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester) and the adjacent non-director areas had the lettered dials; the director exchanges used the three-letter, four-number format. With {{the introduction of}} <b>trunk</b> <b>dialing,</b> the need for all callers {{to be able to}} dial numbers with letters in them led to the much more widespread use of lettered dials. The need for dials with letters ceased with the conversion to all-digit numbering in 1968.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling,</b> most Group Switching Centres housed operators in an Auto Manual Centre (AMC) who were able to place any calls for subscribers in the local area that could not be directly dialled. Operators continued to be used after {{the introduction}} of <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> albeit on a reducing basis as direct dialled routings became increasingly available until universal direct dialling between U.K subscribers became available in 1979 via the Trunk Transit Network.|$|E

5000|$|Smaller schemes apply outside London. Uxbridge, for example, has the <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialing</b> (STD) code 01895. Uxbridge {{exchange}} is the parent for Denham, Harefield, Ruislip and West Drayton; anyone connected {{to any of}} those exchanges can call {{any of the others}} without having to prefix the number with 01895. This is achieved by giving subscriber lines on each exchange different prefix numbers, thus: all numbers are six-figure; Denham numbers start with 83, Harefield with 82, Ruislip with 6 and West Drayton with 4. Uxbridge numbers start with 2 or 81. All calls must have all six digits dialled - even if a subscriber is on Denham exchange and is calling another subscriber on Denham exchange, they must still dial 83xxxx.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as pulse dialing (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialing</b> equipment. Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|R
5000|$|After {{taking charge}} as Chairman, Space Commission and Secretary, Department of Space in 1985, Rao {{accelerated}} {{the development of}} rocket technology [...] resulting in the successful launch of ASLV rocket in 1992. He was also responsible {{for the development of}} the operational PSLV launch vehicle, which successfully launched an 850 kg. satellite into a polar orbit in 1995. Rao initiated the development of the geostationary launch vehicle GSLV and the development of cryogenic technology in 1991. He was responsible for successful launch of INSAT satellites during his stint at ISRO. The launch of INSAT satellites gave a thrust to communications in India, during the 1980s and 1990s. The successful launch of INSAT provided telecommunication links to remote corners of India. During these decades fixed telephone (called as landline) expanded throughout country due to availability of satellite links at different places in the ground. People could talk easily from anywhere by use of STD (<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialing)</b> instead of waiting for hours to get the connection. This development played a key role in future for India to develop as an Information Technology hub. He was the first Chairman of Antrix Corporation.he received Padma bhushana in 1976.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> {{is used in}} the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, India and South East Asia. The {{corresponding}} term in the North American Numbering Plan, e.g. in the United States and Canada, {{is direct}} distance dialing.|$|E
50|$|When the UK's {{original}} STD codes were allocated in {{the late}} 1950s, London was given the code 01. Relatively few <b>subscribers</b> could <b>dial</b> <b>trunk</b> calls, so the 01 code was not generally included {{as part of the}} published telephone number. In the early 1960s London telephones still had exchange names, the first three letters having to be dialled before the four-digit local number, e.g. ABBey 1234 (London Transport).|$|R
5000|$|It {{originally}} formed one of {{a network}} of 18 Zone Switching Centres within the United Kingdom (UK) telephone system that provided trunk switching facilities within its own charge group and to Group Switching Centres (GSC) within an area broadly comprising the West Midlands and central Wales. The exchange formed part of the trunk mechanisation plan commenced in 1939 to permit operators from originating GSCs to dial through to a distant UK subscriber without requiring further operator intervention. Later, it was additionally used to switch <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialled</b> <b>trunk</b> calls after its introduction at Bristol in 1958.|$|R

50|$|Before STD (<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling)</b> codes were {{introduced}} in Northern Ireland, during the 1960s and 1970s, an operator based system was in operation. Each subscriber had short (usually 3 or 4 digit) number within the local exchange. For example, the post office in Dromore was Dromore 201.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Dialling</b> (STD) was {{introduced}} in 1958 to allow a caller to call another telephone directly instead of via a manual telephone exchange operator. Uniform exchange codes, usually called STD codes, were allocated for every exchange in the country, progressively as STD was rolled out. This process was not completed until 1979.|$|E

50|$|<b>Subscriber</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>dialling</b> (STD, {{also known}} as {{subscriber}} toll dialling) is a telephone system allowing subscribers to dial trunk calls without operator assistance.

Once the final determination of where the call is supposed to go is completed, the call is then routed to the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>trunk</b> lines. In a call center or contact center environment, the call is then typically answered by a telephone system known as an automatic call distributor (ACD) or private branch exchange (PBX).|$|R
