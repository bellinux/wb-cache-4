The [...] "but" [...] combines the functions of hall, dining-room, saloon and bachelor's sleeping quarters. The [...] "ben" [...] contains a broad bed for the married, a <b>standing</b> <b>frame</b> of split bamboo with mats for mattresses; it is usually mounted on props to defend it from the Nchu'u or white ants, and each has its mosquito bar, an oblong square, large {{enough to cover the}} whole couch and to reach the ground; the material is either fine grass- cloth, from the Ashira country, a light stuff called [...] "Mbongo," [...] or calico and blue baft from which the stiffening has been washed out. It is far superior to the flimsy muslin affairs supplied in an Anglo-Indian outfit, or to the coarse matting used in Yoruba. Provided with this solid defence, which may be bought in any shop, one can indulge one's self by sleeping in the verandah without risk of ague or rheumatism. The [...] "ben" [...] always displays a pile of chests and boxes, which, though possibly empty, testify to the [...] "respectability" [...] of the household.

50|$|A person {{suffering}} from Friedreich's Ataxia may require some surgical interventions (mainly for the spine and heart). Often, titanium screws and rods are {{inserted in the}} spine to help prevent or slow the progression of scoliosis. As progression of ataxia occurs, assistive devices such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair are required for mobility and independence. Other assistive technology, such as a <b>standing</b> <b>frame,</b> can help reduce the secondary complications of prolonged use of a wheelchair. The goal of surgery {{is to keep the}} patient ambulatory as long as possible.|$|E

When the two pieces are turned perpendicular to each other it forms a cross.The ends of the metal pieces are bent down so that it makes a <b>standing</b> <b>frame.</b> Sometimes, in Greek Catholic usage, a small star will be suspended from the asterisk where the two strips of metal are joined. Among Orthodox, however, the asterisk itself is considered to be the star, so no addition to it is deemed necessary.|$|E

50|$|Assistive Technology is {{a generic}} term for devices and {{modifications}} (for {{a person or}} within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example {{of the use of}} a prosthesis dates to at least 1800 BC. The wheelchair dates from the 17th century. The curb cut is a related structural innovation. Other examples are <b>standing</b> <b>frames,</b> text telephones, accessible keyboards, large print, Braille, & speech recognition software. People with disabilities often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in Tourette's syndrome), or sign language in deaf communities.|$|R
50|$|Bone mineral {{loss and}} {{osteoporosis}} are common consequences after spinal cord injury. Therapeutic standing, a weight-bearing intervention {{that can be}} applied using a <b>standing</b> <b>frame,</b> has traditionally been incorporated into rehabilitation programs for those with chronic spinal cord injury in order to prevent osteoporosis. A systematic review of the literature conducted by Biering-Sorenson et al. (2009) shows that therapeutic standing in the chronic phase of injury, defined as one year after injury, has no effect on maintaining bone density. Results on the effectiveness of therapeutic standing {{during the first year of}} injury are conflicting and show that shorter, less aggressive intervention is less effective. If therapeutic standing is to be incorporated into treatment, it should be more aggressive and initiated in the early stages of injury if any beneficial impacts on bone mineral density are hoped to be achieved.|$|E
50|$|A {{standing}} wheelchair is {{one that}} supports the user in a nearly standing position. They {{can be used as}} both a wheelchair and a <b>standing</b> <b>frame,</b> allowing the user to sit or stand in the wheelchair as they wish. Some versions are entirely manual, others have powered stand on an otherwise manual chair, while others have full power, tilt, recline and variations of powered stand functions available. The benefits of such a device include, but are not limited to: aiding independence and productivity, raising self-esteem and psychological well-being, heightening social status, extending access, relief of pressure, reduction of pressure sores, improved functional reach, improved respiration, reduced occurrence of UTI, improved flexibility, help in maintaining bone mineral density, improved passive range motion, reduction in abnormal muscle tone and spasticity, and skeletal deformities. Other wheelchairs provide some of the same benefits by raising the entire seat to lift the user to standing height.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has clearly}} shown that {{exercise}} is beneficial for impaired muscles, {{even though it}} was previously believed that strength exercise would increase muscle tone and impair muscle performance further. Also, in previous decades there has been a strong focus on other interventions for impaired muscles, particularly stretching and splinting, but the evidence does not support these as effective. One of the challenges for health professionals working with UMNS movement disorders is that the degree of muscle weakness makes developing an exercise programme difficult. For muscles that lack any volitional control, such as after complete spinal cord injury, exercise may be assisted, and may require equipment, such as using a <b>standing</b> <b>frame</b> to sustain a standing position. Often, muscles require specific stimulation to achieve small amounts of activity, which is most often achieved by weight-bearing (e.g. positioning and supporting a limb such that it supports body weight) or by stimulation to the muscle belly (such as electrical stimulation or vibration).|$|E
50|$|Assistive {{devices are}} any {{machines}} or equipment used {{to level the}} playing field in a mixed-ability competition, or to allow someone the opportunity to participate that could not do so without its benefit. Good examples of assistive devices are swimming pool lifts that lower non-ambulatory swimmers into a pool, and <b>standing</b> <b>frames</b> that allow wheelchair users to stand up while playing ball. Many municipal governments in the U.S. use adaptive recreation as a way to meet the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), specifically its section dealing with public services. Governments are required by ADA law to provide reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities in order to allow them participation in sports and recreation programs.|$|R

Even such was Sir Charles when, twenty years before, he had, {{by virtue of his}} spirit and audacity, in one short season taken a place in London from which Brummell himself had afterwards vainly struggled to depose him. The youth faced the angry features of his uncle with an air of debonair amusement, and he held towards him, upon his outstretched palms, the broken fragments of an amber cane.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an incurable, unpredictable {{but typically}} progressive neurological condition. It {{is the most}} common cause of neurological disability in young adults. Within 15  years of diagnosis, approximately 50  % of affected people are unable to walk unaided, and over time an estimated 25  % depend on a wheelchair. Typically, people with such limited mobility are excluded from clinical trials. Severely impaired people with MS spend much of their day sitting, often with limited ability to change position. In response, secondary complications can occur including: muscle wasting, pain, reduced skin integrity, spasms, limb stiffness, constipation, and associated psychosocial problems such as depression and lowered self-esteem. Effective self-management strategies, which can be implemented relatively easily and cheaply within people's homes, are needed to improve or maintain mobility and reduce sedentary behaviour. However this is challenging, particularly in the latter stages of disease. Regular supported <b>standing</b> using <b>standing</b> <b>frames</b> is one potential option...|$|R
5000|$|Muscles {{with severe}} {{spasticity}} {{are likely to}} be more limited in their ability to exercise, and may require help to do this. They may require additional interventions, to manage the greater neurological impairment and also the greater secondary complications. These secondary complications involve the development of contractures, deformity and postural asymmetries. Interventions may include icing, serial casting, sustained stretching, inhibitory pressure and medical interventions. Treatment should be done with firm and constant manual contact positioned over nonspastic areas to avoid stimulating the spastic muscle(s). Alternatively, rehabilitation robotics can be used to provide high volumes of passive or assisted movement, depending on the individual's requirements; this form of therapy can be useful if therapists are at a premium, and has been found effective at reducing spasticity in patients suffering from stroke.

40|$|Background and purpose: Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the effect that <b>standing</b> <b>frame</b> programs have on lower extremity joint range of motion. We measured bilateral hip extension, hip abduction, knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion. Methods: Six {{children between the ages of}} 8 and 17 years, who were residents of a long-term care facility, served as subjects. All subjects were non-ambulatory, had multiple medical conditions, and participated in a passive standing program for at least one hour per week. A baseline recording of each subject 2 ̆ 7 s joint range of motion was taken. Following discontinuation of their <b>standing</b> <b>frame</b> programs, re-measurements of the above joints were made on a weekly basis, using a clear plastic goniometer. Results: Left hip extension and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion showed a statistically significant increase in range of motion. The other five joint motions showed no significant change.
