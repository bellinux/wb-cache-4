40|$|Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) {{are facing}} an ever {{increasing}} pressure to think carefully and strategically {{of ways to}} compete and grow in {{what can only be}} described as a turbulent business environment. This more so for those SME's that have built their growth strategy on the development of new product where the competition is shifting from a company orientation to a supply chain based rivalry. Accordingly achieving qualities such as agility are becoming critical to the success of supply chains. Such dramatic changes make the traditional approaches to business strategy, i. e business growth strategy, which has been based on the company providing a match between its business environment and its internal capability questionable. While, the value of supply chain in determining organization's growth strategy has received some attention a practical perspectives and solution yet to be provided. This research has focused on studying and exploring the position of supply chain in the growth strategy formulation process in SME's to identify the main factors contributing to the above concept and the relationship among the <b>strategic</b> <b>influencing</b> factors from a market, dynamic capability, and supply chain points of view. The research was conducted through: an extensive literature review; three in-depth case studies to identify how practitioners think and act with respect to the position of supply chain issues in growth strategy formulation and why it is important to involve the supply chain issues earlier in growth strategy formulation. A mini-survey and semi-structured interview followed the findings of case studies to extract more evidence at a broader scope. From the above study, a conceptual framework is proposed from which a practical approach emerged to assist SME's that develop new product to think about the supply chain proactively thus future proofing their product and securing their growth strategy.

40|$|This Women’s Enterprise Task Force (WETF) report, Greater Return On Women’s Enterprise (GROWE), {{sets out}} the {{economic}} case for women’s enterprise and advises partners and stakeholders {{how to achieve}} a greater economic return from investment in women’s enterprise. The Task Force has framed its recommendations to maximise existing investment and resources. We are mindful of the Government’s Business Support Simplification Programme and the effect the recession {{will continue to have}} on public spending, and so suggest that relevant Government departments and private sector organisations work together to streamline support and make best use of existing investment. In providing thought leadership to increase the quantity, scalability and success of women’s enterprise in the UK, the WETF has informed the national agenda on women’s enterprise for the last three years, concentrating its efforts on five specific Pillars: 1. gender-disaggregated business data 2. female-friendly business support 3. access to finance and technology 4. supplier diversity and procurement 5. <b>strategic</b> <b>influencing</b> and awareness raising. WETF highlights of the past three years include paving the way for a Business Link national data disaggregation methodology whilst influencing and shaping the establishment, direction and implementation of Aspire, a £ 12. 5 m women’s co-investment fund to support high-growth women-owned businesses. Alongside this, the WETF has {{played an important role in}} raising awareness of the economic case for women’s enterprise and the potential of female entrepreneurs in aiding the UK’s economic recovery. Perhaps most importantly, the WETF met with the Prime Minister and saw important policy developments taken forward in the Government’s Enterprise Strategy of March 2008. In 2009 the WETF contributed to the enterprise knowledge bank by producing two research reports into women’s enterprise: Impact of the Recession on Women’s Enterprise and Myths and Realities of Women’s Access to Finance. The Task Force welcomes progress made by the Ethnic Minority Business Task Force (EMBTF) in the advocacy of complementary areas which include the need for access to finance, disaggregated data and supplier diversity. Much of the groundwork for the WETF’s work was laid out in the Government’s 2003 publication, A Strategic Framework for Women’s Enterprise. In 2003, it was estimated that women constituted around 27 % of self-employed people in the UK, and that only 12 - 14 % of businesses were majority-owned by women (compared to 28 % in the USA). From the Strategic Framework for Women’s Enterprise, to the establishment of the WETF and the Enterprise Strategy, Government has shown the importance that it attaches to women in enterprise and its recognition of the increased economic benefits women can contribute to UK plc. This must be even more important in emerging from recession. Recently, Government has a produced a policy statement, Building Britain’s Future: New Industry, New Jobs (NINJ), which sets out Government’s vision for economic recovery and growth by targeted intervention aimed at hightech, high-growth firms. The WETF has several recommendations for how enterprising women can take advantage of these interventions. Enterprise has a significant role to help women remain economically active and increase the productivity and international competitiveness of the UK. Recent figures from 2009 show that women, who make up 46 % of the workforce, now constitute nearly 29 % of the self-employed in the UK (up 2 percentage points). 15 % of the 4. 8 million enterprises in the UK are now majority-led by women. The longer-term quantitative targets outlined in the Framework included women accounting for 40 % of customers using Government sponsored business support services; and women-owned businesses accounting for 18 - 20 % of the UK total. Government has gone some way towards achieving these targets. Today, women-owned businesses account for around one third of Business Link customers, a major increase on the 22. 3 % or nearly 150, 000 women customers in Q 1 of 2005 / 6. However, overall progress has been very slow and neither of the Framework targets set for completion by 2006 has yet been met. More work needs to be done to address this and the other issues facing women’s enterprise today. This report examines how to further increase the current £ 70 billion Gross Value Added (GVA) and £ 130 billion turnover annual contribution made by women’s enterprise to the UK economy. Recent figures suggest that 900, 000 more businesses would be created if the UK achieved the same levels of female entrepreneurship as in the US, resulting in an additional £ 23 billion GVA to the UK economy, thus largely closing the productivity gap with the US. 1 In Britain alone, 150, 000 extra businesses would be created per annum if women started businesses at the same rate as men. 2 This is especially pertinent in this time of recession. With effective, targeted support, increasing the number of women entrepreneurs will be an important factor in driving economic recovery...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – A {{place in}} the {{boardroom}} is often considered a necessary if not sufficient condition for HR directors to exercise <b>strategic</b> <b>influence</b> on business decision‐making. The purpose of the paper is to explore the perceived importance of HR boardroom representation, both in a formal and symbolic sense, {{and to what extent}} HR directors can exercise <b>strategic</b> <b>influence</b> without it? Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is explored from a survey of 1, 188 UK HR practitioners, including 255 board members, and a series of follow‐up interviews with 16 HR directors. Findings – Analysis of the survey findings suggests that boardroom versus non‐boardroom representation of HR appears to matter in four key areas: board members believe they have greater involvement and influence in business planning processes; they have more positive perceptions of the overall performance of HR; they give higher ratings of CEO perceptions of the HR function; and they believe they achieve greater integration of HR strategy with business strategy. Research limitations/implications – While there are increasingly other formal mechanisms and forums (e. g. executive committees, personal networks) outside the boardroom for HR directors to exercise their influence, it appears that the “symbolic capital” of boardroom recognition and esteem still retains enormous significance and rhetorical appeal for the HR profession. Originality/value – The paper seeks to reframe the debates on the relative importance of HR boardroom versus executive committee representation as forums of <b>strategic</b> <b>influence,</b> by focusing on the continued symbolic significance of boardroom representation. It is concluded that a reworking of Bourdieu's concept of “symbolic capital” (i. e. professional esteem, recognition, status, or respect) as board capital may be useful in reframing future research on HR boardroom representation...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is a set}} {{of three}} independent papers exploring both conceptually and empirically the processes by which middle managers influence organizational strategy. Specifically, I examine the hows and whys of middle management <b>strategic</b> <b>influence.</b> By what mechanisms do middle managers change the course of organizational strategy and why do some middle managers, but not others, change the organization’s strategic direction? I do so from a perspective of methodological reductionism (that is, I look to the actions of the individual for explanations of organizational level phenomena, such as strategic change). In particular, all three papers explore how an individual middle manager’s structural position within the firm interacts with personal characteristics (broadly defined) to explain <b>strategic</b> <b>influence</b> or its absence. As such, I contribute to three different strategy literatures: research examining strategic change (Naranjo‐Gil, Hartmann 2 ̆ 6 Maas, 2008); the middle management perspective on strategy process (Wooldridge, Schmid 2 ̆ 6 Floyd, 2008); and the microfoundations of strategy process (Schmid, Floyd 2 ̆ 6 Wooldridge, 2010). Although my three papers are tightly tied to my central research question, each paper differs in its focus. My conceptual paper (The Strength of Moderate Identities: The Microfoundations of Middle Manager Divergent <b>Strategic</b> <b>Influence)</b> develops a person-situation model of middle management lead strategic change. I suggest that middle managers situated in particular structural positions are more likely than others to be able to change organizational level strategy, but the relevant structural position differs with different strategic types. Even then, properly situated managers’ ability to see new strategic opportunities depends upon individual level characteristics. Because of my interest in the microfoundations of strategy process, my second paper (Thar She Blows! Middle Managers and the Microfoundations of the Attention Based View of the Firm) is qualitative, using the perceptions of individual middle managers to elucidate process (the “how” question) and to generate more fine-grained theory. I report qualitatively on three attempts (two successful and one unsuccessful) by middle managers to <b>influence</b> organizational <b>strategic</b> change by directing the attention of top managers to strategic opportunities. I use this research to build theory about the microfoundations of the attention based view (ABV) of the firm; specifically the role of individual middle managers in alerting the firm to environmental change. In particular, I examine the question of how individual structural position and cognition is enlisted to supplement top manager attention. I contribute to the strategy process literature (and specifically to both the ABV and middle management perspective) by using the tools of microfoundations research to work towards an attention based view of middle management, thus allowing for a richer and more textured understanding of the cogs and wheels of strategic change. Because I theorize that middle manager <b>strategic</b> <b>influence</b> can be traced back, in part, to structural factors, my third paper is a social network study (The Microfoundations of Middle Manager <b>Strategic</b> <b>Influence</b> In A High Tech Firm) focusing on structure and its interaction with personal characteristics. If large firms are information moving and reasoning machines (Ocasio, 1997; Simon, 1947), then an understanding of the processes and routines that lead to strategic change (Teece, 2007) must incorporate an understanding of how information moves through the firm and whether “reasoning” takes place in particular people, as an artifact of organizational routines or both. Tracing these mechanisms to their foundation is part of the microfoundational turn in strategy process research (Schmid, Floyd and Wooldridge, 2010; Teece, 2007; Felin and Foss, 2005). In my third paper I add to this literature (and speculatively to the theory of the firm) by trying to find a link between <b>strategic</b> <b>influence,</b> access to information and behavior in the ego-networks of middle managers in a high tech firm. In particular, in my sample synthesizing behavior has significantly more weight in contributing to perceived influence {{than any of the other}} three Wooldridge and Floyd (1992) types of middle management <b>strategic</b> <b>influence.</b> Although the generalizability of this work is limited, it does point towards some interesting areas of future research into how middle managers influence strategy and, more broadly, into the internal processes that lead to strategic change...|$|R
