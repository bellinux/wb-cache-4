40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} banks disclosure {{on the evolution of}} their CDS spreads during the European sovereign crisis. The disclosure of information helps investors in building expectations; disclosure may participate into the reduction of the information risk premium and may lead to a decrease of CDS spreads. We analyze the CDS spreads changes following the announcement of sovereign credit rating downgrades. We consider 16 dates in the period 2011 - 2013 and, for each one, we assess the cumulative abnormal CDS spread change (CASC). We build two disclosure indexes: one general and one specifically dedicated to <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposure.</b> We show that the bank exposure to sovereign risk has a positive impact on the CASC. Disclosure about <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposure</b> has a negative impact on CASC showing that information reduce risk premiums.

40|$|This lecture {{discusses}} the 2010 {{crisis of the}} European Monetary Union and draws some lessons for reform. Crisis resolution has been difficult because the sovereign debt crisis of countries like Greece and Portugal has come together with real-estate and banking crises in countries like Ireland and Spain and bank vulnerability in countries like Germany and France. Failure to disentangle and resolve the different crises prevents a satisfactory approach to the long-term reform of governance of sovereign borrowing and banking. Any such reform must find {{a substitute for the}} discipline that exchange rate mechanisms impose on sovereign borrowers and their lenders when the currency is national. Any mechanism for imposing discipline on sovereign borrowers and their lenders must be designed so that enforcement is credible even in a crisis. Recommendations for reform include (i) an inclusion of <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposure</b> from too-big-to-fail concerns in banking in monitoring of fiscal stance, (ii) independence of bank supervisors from their respective political authorities, and (iii) a strengthening of the powers of the European Supervisory Authorities over the national supervisors.

40|$|The Bank of England, the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) {{have responded}} to the crisis with {{exceptional}} initiatives resulting in a major increase in their balance sheets. After the ECB’s end- 2011 launch of three-year bank refinancing (LTRO), there has been speculation that all three have de facto embarked on ‘quantitative easing’.

40|$|In the dissertation, we {{analyzed}} {{the potential impact}} of selected regulatory responses to the GFC in two geographical regions. First, we estimated the effect of changes in capital adequacy regulations on the Hungarian banking sector. Specifically, we aimed to show whether the pre-GFC introduction of a countercyclical capital buffer as per the Basel III rules could have helped decelerate FX lending growth in Hungary. Since the relationship between regulatory capital and lending growth is ambiguous, we estimated two VAR models. The unconstrained version aimed to provide the upper bound for the effect of macroprudential tightening on the real economy, as it does not require the increase in capital requirement to be a supply shock. At the same time, the SVAR model serves as the lower bound since sign restrictions on lending and alternative funding growth ensure that the increase in capital requirement is considered a supply shock. Based on our analysis, we made the following conclusions: Thesis 1. Keeping the capital adequacy ratio requirement at its 2005 Q 1 level, would have resulted in a moderate decline in cumulative real lending growth. Both our Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) estimations suggest that an increase of 13 basis points in aggregate capital adequacy ratio, i. e. keeping the ratio at its 2005 Q 1 level, is associated with a decline of 0 - 14 percentage points in cumulative real lending growth compared to actual growth after 10 quarters. Given that actual cumulative growth was 100 per cent between 2004 Q 1 and 2007 Q 3, our estimation results thus indicate only a modest slowdown to 86 per cent. Thesis 2. The modest impact of a change in capital requirement on lending suggests that regulatory authorities could not have avoided the upswing in FX lending by requiring countercyclical capital buffers even if such a tool had been available and they had reacted quickly to accelerating credit growth. Our estimation results suggest that authorities could only have slowed the increase in lending temporarily, it would have regained its momentum after 4 quarters. The results support the postcrisis conventional wisdom about the inadequacy of pre-crisis regulatory frameworks. Therefore, it points toward providing the authorities responsible for financial stability with more power and flexibility so that they can identify systemic risks and respond to them quickly and more efficiently. Thesis 3. A more pronounced tightening might have eliminated FX lending, but at the expense of real GDP growth. Macroeconomic fundamentals were fragile when FX lending started, with the significant fiscal vulnerabilities requiring the central bank to keep the policy rate at elevated levels. Due to the high differential between HUF and FX interest rates and households’ low risk awareness regarding exchange-rate volatility, FX lending became very popular and contributed significantly to real GDP growth in the pre-crisis period. The bottom line is that an unsustainable fiscal policy led to a trade-off between economic growth and the build-up of new vulnerabilities in the form of FX lending. Thesis 4. Both introducing positive risk weights and limits on sovereign exposures could reduce the impact of a potential crisis due to higher ability of banks for loss absorption, more diversified portfolio, better risk transparency and reduced systemic risk. In our dissertation, {{we analyzed}} the two widely discussed basic options to address this regulatory gap: applying non-zero risk weights to sovereign exposures, and putting limits on exposures to sovereigns, akin to those in place for other exposures. Although this paper analyses each option in isolation, the two complement one another as they target different facets of risk. Positive risk weights address counterparty credit risk, whereas large exposure limits address concentration risk. Both policy options would, according to our analysis, lead to improved bank risk management and render banks more resilient. They would equip them to better absorb losses: positive risk weights would require higher capital buffers and exposure limits would lead to greater diversification. Positive risk weights would also improve risk transparency and correct distorted incentives for investing in sovereign bonds. At the systemic level, leverage would decrease and losses in the event of default would be more spread out. On the downside, both regulatory proposals would lower bank profitability in the short run. In the longer run, positive risk-weights could permanently reduce bank profits by increasing their funding costs, while exposure limits would lead to a more diversified portfolio and lower funding costs. Moreover, they could also lower the potential for twin crises – sovereign and banking – due to weaker ties between the balance sheets of these two sectors. At the same time, they could aggravate future economic crises by limiting the funding options for sovereigns. Thesis 5. Since banks’ ability to accommodate temporary large swings in financing needs of the sovereigns would be constrained by either of the two policy options, this could call for an improved fiscal framework at the European level. A credible backstop should be in place to signal to investors that sovereigns have access to sufficient funds in case of need and ward off any short-term market fluctuations. The effect of the new regulations on sovereigns depends on the modality and timing of the introduction. A gradual increase in the risk weights and a relatively long phasing-in period could alleviate the pressure on sovereign debt markets and help avoid strained fiscal adjustments, thereby lowering the macroeconomic costs of the new regulations. Nevertheless, based on recent experience with banks’ adjustments in response to regulatory changes, the possibility of the new regulation being frontloaded is high. The extent of frontloading would depend on the price elasticity of sovereign debt and the share of <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposure</b> that the banks are able to value at book value. Thesis 6. As banks would lower their demand for sovereign debt, sovereigns would need to find new investors that could prove difficult for some countries. The benefits in terms of increased resilience in the banking sector would come at a cost for some sovereigns. Sovereign bond holdings would become more costly in terms of capital if positive risk weights were applied or the exposures were capped by a hard limit. In both cases, banks would try to deal with excess sovereign bonds on their balance sheets by injecting fresh capital or reducing their portfolio of sovereign bonds. An increased supply of sovereign paper, or a lack of demand for new issues, would raise funding costs for the sovereign and consequently for the whole economy. Furthermore, both policy options would lower liquidity in the sovereign debt markets, as they add to the cost and hinder the ability of banks to provide market-making services. Exposure limits in particular would have significant repercussions on markets in the short run, as banks traditionally have large exposures to domestic sovereigns {{that they would have to}} shed. Other market participants would need to absorb this additional supply. Sovereigns would need to re-arrange their financing sources, which could prove challenging. As the demand of local investors for sovereign debt tends to be more reliable and stable, sovereigns would have to adjust to the new market, potentially having to deal with more volatility, currency risk or new requirements regarding sustainability...|$|E

First, it highlights the key role that <b>sovereign</b> debt <b>exposures</b> of banks have played in the feedback loop between bank and fiscal distress, and inquires how the regulation of banks' <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures</b> in the euro area should be changed to mitigate this feedback loop in the future. Second, it explores the relationship between the forbearance of non-performing loans by European banks and the tendency of EU regulators to rescue rather than resolving distressed banks, and asks to what extent the new regulatory framework of the euro-area "banking union" can be expected to mitigate excessive forbearance and facilitate resolution of insolvent banks. Finally, the paper highlights that capital requirements based on the ratio of Tier- 1 capital to banks' risk-weighted assets were massively gamed by large banks, which engaged in various forms of regulatory arbitrage to minimize their capital charges while expanding leverage. This argues in favor of relying on a set of simpler and more robust indicators to determine banks' capital shortfall, such as book and market leverage ratios...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four independent chapters on bank capital regulation {{and the issue of}} unsolicited ratings. The first chapter is introductory and reviews the motivation for regulating banks and credit rating agencies while providing a detailed overview of the thesis. The second chapter uses a simultaneous equations model to analyze how banks from six G 10 countries adjusted their capital to assets ratios and risk-weighted assets to assets ratio between 1988 and 1995, i. e. just after passage of the 1988 Basel Accord. The results suggest that regulatory pressure brought about by the 1988 capital standards had little effect on both ratios for weakly capitalized banks, except in the US. In addition, the relation between the capital to assets ratios and the risk-weighted assets to assets ratio appears to depend not only on the level of capitalization of banks, but also on the countries or groups of countries considered. The third chapter provides Monte Carlo estimates of the amount of regulatory capital that EMU banks must hold for their corporate, bank, and <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures</b> both under Basel I and the standardized approach to credit risk in Basel II. In the latter case, Monte Carlo estimates are presented for different combinations of external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) that banks may choose to risk weight their exposures. Three main results emerge from the analysis. First, although the use of different ECAIs leads to significant differences in minimum capital requirements, these differences never exceed, on average, 10 % of EMU banks’ capital requirements for corporate, bank, and <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures.</b> Second, the standardized approach to credit risk provides a small regulatory capital incentive for banks to use several ECAIs to risk weight their exposures. Third, the minimum capital requirements for the corporate, bank, and <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures</b> of EMU banks will be higher in Basel II than in Basel I. I also show that the incentive for banks to engage in regulatory arbitrage in the standardized approach to credit risk is limited. The fourth and final chapter analyses the effect of soliciting a rating on the rating outcome of banks. Using a sample of Asian banks rated by Fitch Ratings, I find evidence that unsolicited ratings tend to be lower than solicited ones, after accounting for differences in observed bank characteristics. This downward bias {{does not seem to be}} explained by the fact that better-quality banks self-select into the solicited group. Rather, unsolicited ratings appear to be lower because they are based on public information. As a result, they tend to be more conservative than solicited ratings, which incorporate both public and non-public information.

Furthermore, we highlight considerable implementation issues.

Since this period covers various stages of the banking and sovereign crisis, it offers a fertile ground to analyze bank/sovereign risk spillovers. We define contagion as excess correlation, i. e. correlation between banks and sovereigns over and above what is explained by common factors, using CDS spreads at the bank and at the sovereign level. Moreover, we investigate the determinants of contagion by analyzing bank-specific as well as country-specific variables and their interaction. We provide empirical evidence that various contagion channels are at work, including a strong home bias in bank bond portfolios, using the EBA's disclosure of <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures</b> of banks. We find that banks with a weak capital and/or funding position are particularly vulnerable to risk spillovers.

40|$|The authors {{conduct a}} {{counterfactual}} simulation {{of the proposed}} rules under the new Basel Capital Accord (Basel II), including the revised treatment of expected and unexpected credit losses proposed by the Basel Committee in October 2003.

The impact on the volatility of required bank capital is less clear. It will depend importantly on the credit quality distribution of banks' loan portfolios and on the precise way in which they calculate expected and unexpected losses. Sensitivity analysis, including that based on a range of hypothetical distributions for banks' loan portfolios, shows the potential for a substantial increase in implied volatility. Moreover, if historical relationships are a good indicator of the future, changes in required capital and provisions for commercial and industrial, interbank, and <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures</b> will likely be countercyclical under Basel II (i. e., capital requirements will increase during recessions).

40|$|Since 2008, euro-area {{sovereign}} yields have diverged sharply, and so {{have the}} corresponding CDS premia. At the same time, banks’ sovereign debt portfolios featured an increasing home bias. We investigate {{the relationship between these}} two facts, and its rationale. First, we inquire to what extent the dynamics of sovereign yield differentials relative to the swap rate and CDS premia reflect changes in perceived sovereign solvency risk or rather different responses to systemic risk due to the possible collapse of the euro. We do so by decomposing yield differentials and CDS spreads in a country-specific and a common risk component via a dynamic factor model. We then investigate how the home bias of banks’ sovereign portfolios responds to yield differentials and to their two components, by estimating a vector error-correction model on 2008 - 12 monthly data. We find that in most countries of the euro area, and especially in its periphery, banks’ <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures</b> respond positively to increases in yields. When bank exposures are related to the country-risk and common-risk components of yields, it turns out that (i) in the periphery, banks increase their domestic exposure in response to increases in country risk, while in core countries they do not; (ii) in most euro area banks respond to an increase in the common risk factor by raising their domestic exposures. Finding (i) hints at distorted incentives in periphery banks’ response to changes in their own sovereign’s risk. Finding (ii) indicates that, when systemic risk increases, all banks tend to increase the home bias of their portfolios, making the euro-area sovereign market more segmented...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis of 2008 European authorities have set out to strengthen financial governance {{in order to create}} a more stable and resilient financial system. As discussed in this paper, the new and updated EU legislation addressed at a wide array of financial markets and institutions also significantly broadened the scope of the existing preferential regulatory treatment of sovereign bonds and introduced new funding privileges for governments. The many regulatory incentives for investors to buy and hold (domestic) government debt facilitate public debt management, at the cost of crowding out private sector funding and raising financial stability concerns every time the government faces distress. Moreover, a privileged access to capital markets reduces market discipline and may lead to moral hazard on the part of sovereigns. The growing scope of these government funding privileges in EU financial law may be interpreted in three (complementary) ways: as a revival of financial repression in a modern prudential guise to reduce the burden of high public debt, as a return to the traditional close relationship between the government and the financial sector so as to align mutual interests in fiscal and financial stability, or as a way to increase explicit and implicit taxes on finance and recoup public revenues lost during the financial crisis. The preferential treatment of <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures</b> and governments’ market access is found in a growing body of EU financial law.

40|$|Completing {{the banking}} union is an urgent project facing the EU, given the eurozone’s {{continued}} vulnerability to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks to national banking systems. The proposed {{changes to the}} European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) under consideration by the European Commission could open {{the way to a}} satisfactory compromise between the twin needs to reduce legacy risks in banks’ balance sheets and to provide greater risk-sharing and a fiscal backstop for both the Resolution and the EDIS Funds – while continuing to exclude any sharing of past losses. With such a compromise, financial fragmentation would likely recede rapidly, leading to a larger role by private capital in cushioning real and financial idiosyncratic shocks. EDIS could move forward immediately by providing in its early phase that the European Stability Mechanism would provide a liquidity line to national deposit guarantee schemes that had exhausted their funds, with no sharing of losses. Meanwhile, risk-reduction would accelerate through the stronger policies already established by the Single Supervisory Mechanism for the reduction of non-performing loans and a fresh approach to the reduction of banks’ <b>sovereign</b> <b>exposures,</b> based on {{a modified version of the}} large exposure prudential policy.

In this paper we study the performance, country exposure, and replicating characteristics of a sample of 31 European index ETFs with <b>exposure</b> to eurozone <b>sovereign</b> debt. The obtained results are presented {{in the context of}} underlying index selection rules, types of replication, and movements in sovereign debt interest rates and sovereign CDS spreads. It is demonstrated that the ETFs focused on accurately track corresponding bond indices. This is consistent with earlier findings for equity index ETFs. Our results may be of interest for institutional investors, regulators, and everyone interested in sovereign debt investments...|$|R
40|$|On May 9, 2010 euro zone {{countries}} {{announced the}} creation of the European Financial Stability Facility {{as a response to the}} sovereign debt crisis. This paper investigates the impact of this announcement on bank share prices, bank CDS spreads and sovereign CDS spreads. The main private beneficiaries were bank creditors, especially of banks heavily exposed to southern Europe and Ireland and located in countries characterized by weak public finances. Furthermore, countries with weak public finances and banking systems heavily exposed to southern Europe and Ireland benefited, as evidenced by lower sovereign CDS spreads. The combined gains of bank debt holders and shareholders exceed the increase in the value of their <b>sovereign</b> debt <b>exposures,</b> suggesting that banks saw their contingent claim on the financial safety net increase in value. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to measure, analyze, and manage sovereign risk based on the theory and practice of modern contingent claims analysis (CCA). The paper provides a new framework for adapting the CCA model to the sovereign balance sheet in a way that can help forecast credit spreads and evaluate the impact of market risks and risks transferred from other sectors. This new framework is useful for assessing vulnerability, policy analysis, sovereign credit risk analysis, and design of sovereign risk mitigation and control strategies. Applications for investors in three areas are discussed. First, CCA provides a new framework for valuing, investing, and trading sovereign securities, including sovereign capital structure arbitrage. Second, it provides a new framework for analysis and management of sovereign wealth funds being created by many emerging market and resource rich countries. Third, the framework provides quantitative measures of <b>sovereign</b> risk <b>exposures</b> which facilitates the design of new instruments and contracts to control or transfer sovereign risk. ...|$|R
