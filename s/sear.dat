25|$|The Single Action Army {{action is}} a {{refinement}} of the earlier Colt percussion revolvers and the Colt 1871 cartridge revolver. The cylinder is mounted on a central axis and operated by a hand with a double finger whose more extended action allowed the cylinder-ratchet to be cut in a larger circle, giving more torsional force to the cylinder. Three notches {{on the face of}} the hammer engage the <b>sear</b> portion of the trigger, affording four basic hammer positions. The hammer when fully lowered rests within the frame. Drawn slightly to the rear, the hammer engages the safety notch of the <b>sear</b> and holds the firing pin out of direct contact with a chambered cartridge. Like the earlier percussion revolvers, the Single Action Army was designed to allow loading of all of the chambers. The safety notch replaced pins on the rear of the percussion revolver cylinders, which served the same purpose as the safety position, by preventing hammer contact with the primer/percussion cap. However, many users adopted the practice of leaving one empty chamber under the hammer, because a sharp blow could damage the mechanism and allow a fully loaded revolver to fire. This practice is now universally recommended. Drawn back about half way, the hammer engages the second notch. This cams the cylinder bolt out of engagement and allows the cylinder to rotate for loading. Fully cocked, the revolver is ready to fire. Cartridge ejection is via the spring-loaded rod housed in a tube on the right side of the barrel.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the <b>sear,</b> and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E
25|$|Raw {{foie gras}} can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (poêlé) or (with care and attention), grilled. As foie gras has high fat content, contact with heat {{needs to be}} brief and {{therefore}} at high temperature, lest it burn or melt. Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the foie gras to be cut to a thickness between 15 and 25mm (½ – 1inch), resulting in a rare, uncooked center. Some chefs prefer not to devein the foie gras, as the veins can help preserve {{the integrity of the}} fatty liver. It is increasingly common to <b>sear</b> the foie gras on one side only, leaving the other side uncooked. Practitioners of molecular gastronomy such as Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck restaurant first flash-freeze foie gras in liquid nitrogen as part of the preparation process.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, <b>Sears</b> {{terminated}} {{its famous}} general merchandise catalog because of sinking sales and profits. <b>Sears</b> Holdings continues to produce specialty catalogs and reintroduced a smaller {{version of the}} Holiday Wish Book in 2007.

The new corporation announced that it would continue to operate stores under both the <b>Sears</b> and Kmart brands. In 2005, the company began renovating some Kmart stores and converting them to the <b>Sears</b> Essentials format, only to change them later to <b>Sears</b> Grands. <b>Sears</b> spent much of 2014 and 2015 selling off portions of its balance sheet; namely Lands' End and its stake in <b>Sears</b> Canada. <b>Sears</b> Canada {{is one of the biggest}} e-commerce players in Canada, with CAN$505 million in sales in 2015—more than Walmart and others who have begun pushing aggressively into online sales, such as Canadian Tire. <b>Sears</b> states that the company is looking to focus on becoming a more tech-driven retailer. Sears' CEO and top shareholder said the sell-off of key assets in the last year has given the retailer the money it needs to speed up its transformation. <b>Sears</b> Holdings has lost a total of US$7 billion in the last four years. In part, the retailer is trying to curb losses by using a loyalty program called Shop Your Way. <b>Sears</b> believes the membership scheme will be a long-term play for the company, and it will enhance repeat business and customer loyalty.|$|R
