50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve gear eccentric crank and the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> weight. The <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|E

50|$|On a steam locomotive, {{a driving}} wheel is a powered wheel which {{is driven by}} the locomotive's pistons (or turbine, {{in the case of a}} steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled {{together}} with <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2006 another {{range was}} introduced. More {{characters}} were modelled than previously, and some had moving <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b> Additional models from the range were released in Japan.|$|R
50|$|A {{coupling}} rod or <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> connects the driving wheels of a locomotive. Steam locomotives in particular usually have them, but some diesel and electric locomotives, especially older ones and shunters, also have them. The {{coupling rod}}s transfer {{the power to}} all driving wheels.|$|E
50|$|The L5 {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the DD1 as the <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> electric locomotive concept proved to be unsuited {{to the demands of}} long distance electrification. Even in the existing short haul service the L5's long rigid wheelbase and poor weight distribution caused it to be withdrawn significantly before the older DD1s.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> that spans multiple axles with a scotch yoke used at each intermediate axle. This approach was quite common when side rods were used to link a jackshaft to 2 or more driving wheels on electric locomotives and some early internal combustion locomotives. The Swiss Ce 6/8II Crocodile locomotive is a prominent example, but there were others.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> and {{valve gear}} of {{conventional}} steam locomotives create horizontal forces that cannot be fully balanced without substantially increasing the vertical {{forces on the}} track, known as hammer blow.|$|R

50|$|On {{locomotives}} with <b>side</b> <b>rods,</b> {{including most}} steam and jackshaft locomotives, the driving wheels have weights {{to balance the}} weight of the coupling and connecting rods. The crescent-shaped balance weight is clearly visible in the picture on the right.|$|R
50|$|Although by the 1860s the 2-2-2 {{configuration}} {{was beginning}} to be superseded by the 2-4-0 type with better adhesion, the invention of steam sanding gave 2-2-2 singles a new lease of life, and they continued to be built until the 1890s. Notable late examples include William Stroudley's singles of 1874-1880, William Dean's 157 class of 1878-79, and his 3001 class (1891-92), both for the Great Western Railway. James Holden of the Great Eastern Railway created some 2-2-2 singles in 1889 by removing the <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> from a 2-4-0.|$|E
50|$|Delta Valley and Southern 50 is a {{standard}} gauge diesel-electric locomotive built by General Electric in May, 1954, GE #32129 for the Delta Valley and Southern Railway. It replaced a small steam locomotive. It is of the type designated as a 45-ton, although the actual weight may be different from that. It is powered by two Cummins HBI-600 six-cylinder diesel prime movers, each of which drives a generator which, in turn, drives a single electric traction motor, one on each truck. The second axle on each truck is driven by a <b>side</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
50|$|No. 463 {{was sold}} to cowboy actor and singer Gene Autry in May 1955. Autry never used the engine and donated it {{to the town of}} Antonito, Colorado. It was {{restored}} by and entered into service on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad in 1994. It was taken out of service with a broken <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> in 2002. In 2009, it was moved to the railroad's shop at Chama, New Mexico where a major rebuild was taken until completion in Spring 2013. On May 20, 2013, the restored locomotive made its inaugural run on the C&TS.|$|E
5000|$|Some early {{locomotives}} used small diameter DC {{traction motors}} mounted on individual axles, but the majority, especially for AC powered locomotives, {{had only one}} or two large diameter motors. These large diameter motors were larger than most driving wheels and so were mounted well above the level of the driving axles. [...] The motor or motors drove the jackshaft or jackshafts through gears or <b>side</b> <b>rods,</b> and then the jackshaft turned the wheels through <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b> In Europe, Oerlikon and Brown, Boveri pioneered a variety of jackshaft designs, while in the United States, Westinghouse was dominant. [...] The early surveys of electric locomotive designs cited here all use the term jackshaft or jack-shaft.|$|R
50|$|Most early {{electric}} locomotives shared commonalities with the steam engines of their time. These features included <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> and frame mounted driving axles with leading and trailing axles. The long rigid wheelbase and the leading and trailing axles reduced cornering stability and increased weight.|$|R
50|$|The two end-most <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> were {{shorter than}} the two {{attached}} to the slider. This permitted the end rods to be set to any angle up to 180°. The slider could move along the main rod and {{was used as an}} index for reading the engraved scales.|$|R
50|$|Around 1860, when Beugniot was {{the chief}} {{engineer}} at the firm of Köchlin, he developed a system whereby wheelsets are housed in pairs in the locomotive frame, with side-play, and connected by a lever. These levers are fixed to the frame in the centre and thus enable the sideways movement of the connected axles in opposite directions. In this way, instead of being fixed in the frame, the axles are able to move sideways rather like a bogie, but clearly nowhere near as much. On locomotives with a <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> drive, the axle side-play is balanced using longer coupling pins (Kuppelzapfen) on which the coupling rods are also able to move sideways.|$|E
50|$|Two K-27s survive today. D&RGW #463 {{was sold}} to cowboy actor and singer Gene Autry in May 1955. Autry never used the Mudhen and donated it to the City of Antonito, Colorado. It was {{restored}} by and entered into service on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad in 1994. It {{was taken out of}} service with a broken <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> in 2002. In 2009, it was moved to the railroad's shop at Chama, New Mexico where a major rebuild was performed. The engine made its inaugural run after the rebuild on the C&TS on May 20, 2013. 463 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as Engine No. 463.|$|E
50|$|In general, all {{railroad}} vehicles have spring suspension; without springs, {{irregularities in}} the track could lift wheels off {{the rail and}} cause impact damage to both rails and vehicles. Driving wheels are typically mounted so that they have around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vertical motion. When there are only 2 coupled axles, this range of motion places only slight stress on the crank pins. With more axles, however, provision {{must be made to}} allow each axle to move vertically independently of the others without bending the rods. This may be done by hinging the <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> at each intermediate crank pin, either using the pin itself as a hinge pin, or adding a hinge joint adjacent to the pin, as shown in the illustration.|$|E
50|$|The term {{scotch yoke}} {{continues}} to be used when the slot in the yoke is shorter than {{the diameter of the}} circle made by the crank pin. For example, the <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> of a locomotive may have scotch yokes to permit vertical motion of intermediate driving axles.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the end of}} 1962, defects became apparent. Coupling rods were {{snapping}} {{when the}} locomotives were travelling at speed. Commencing in February 1963, the problem was rectified by fitting heavier duty <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b> The original <b>side</b> cab-windows were replaced from January 1963. The exhaust stacks were modified from January 1967.|$|R
50|$|The Power gas {{locomotive}} {{was built}} by Gotaverken. It had a vertical, five cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine with opposed pistons. There was a single crankshaft connected to both upper and lower pistons. The exhaust from the diesel engine powered the gas turbine which drove the wheels through reduction gearing, jack shaft and <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
5000|$|DB {{had over}} 700 new Köf II engines newly built and further {{developed}} after the war. In the GDR, 32 Kö II were (re-)built in Dessau maintenance works for DR (among them the last ever built of 1968). More than 360 very similar vehicles were produced exclusively for industrial railways, series N3 with chain link drive and , {{referred to as}} N3 by the manufacturers, and series N4 with <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> drive and [...] The first proper development of small shunting locomotives in the GDR was the V 10 B, which was further developed into class V 15. A plan - {{similar to the one}} of DB - to build a series of more powerful Köf III was subsequently discarded and replaced by the DR class V 60 project.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was equipped}} with two [...] Cummins diesel engines, each driving a generator which, in turn, drove {{one of the two}} traction motors, one per truck.

50|$|The engine (with {{electric}} starter) {{is connected}} to the hydraulic transmission by a torsionally flexible clutch and a short articulated drive shaft. The reversing gear is directly connected to the hydraulic transmission and drives the jack shaft. The torque is transmitted by <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> to the wheels. A belt drive from the engine drives the radiator fan, the air compressor and the alternator.|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{have been}} {{conducted}} to simultaneously consider both liquid films and droplets of the annular flow on a 3 × 3 simulating BWR fuel rod-bundle test-section with spacers. The optical system of a high speed camera and a tele-microscope was used to record the backlight images at the gap between a corner rod and a <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> of the bundle at high time and space resolutions. The data obtained from the liquid film showed that the mean film thickness, wave height, power spectral density, and wave velocity at the corner rod are larger than those at the <b>side</b> <b>rod,</b> and that the influences of the spacer are different {{in the cases of}} low and high gas superficial velocities. Simultaneously, the data containing size and spatial distributions as well as the axial velocity distribution of liquid droplets were obtained. In the case of lower gas flow rates, the spacer generates not only a large number of small droplets but also big droplets whose size exceeds the maximum droplet diameter at upstream. At further downstream, the spatial distribution of the droplets indicates an asymmetry characteristic, which emphasizes the contribution of the droplet impingement mechanism to the entrainment phenomena. Moreover, a close-up observation at right up- and downstreams of the spacer was conducted to describe the interactions between the two-phase flow and this structure. By using these new experimental arrangements, the interaction mechanisms among the wavy liquid film, droplets and spacer were discussed...|$|E
50|$|Between 1942 and 1947, {{thirteen}} {{members of}} class Ce 6/8 II were upgraded with more powerful motors, {{to allow a}} higher top speed, and these became class Be 6/8 II. This required raising the jackshaft above {{the plane of the}} axles, necessitating a more complex system of <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b> In 1956, all eighteen members of class Ce 6/8 III were upgraded and became class Be 6/8 III.|$|R
50|$|Under the UIC {{classification}} used in Europe and, in {{more recent}} years, in simplified form in the United States, an 0-4-0 is classified as B (German and Italian) if the axles are connected by <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> or gearing and 020 (French), independent of axle motoring. The UIC's Bo classification for electric and diesel-electric locomotives indicates that the axles are independently motored, which would be 0-2-2-0 under the Whyte notation.|$|R
5000|$|By 1914, {{the tunnel}} company was {{operating}} two gasoline powered locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works {{on the surface}} trackage in Grant Park. [...] These engines weighed 7 ST and were 12 ft long, 56 in wide and 7 ft high. The 4-cylinder engines were coupled to the driving wheels through a jackshaft and <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b> [...] These machines had a two-speed transmission with {{a top speed of}} 10 mph.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} shape - they {{are similar in}} form to the SBB-CFF-FFS Crocodiles of the Gotthard Railway - the Ge 6/6 I {{locomotives}} have also collectively been nicknamed the Rhaetian Crocodiles by rail fans. Their internal working RhB designation is C-C. As with its standard-gauge counterpart, the Ge 6/6 is articulated, with a gear-driven Jackshaft between the two end axles of each unit, connected to the drive wheels by <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R

These shafts had universal joints and square sliding prismatic joints to accommodate the swiveling trucks. Each axle was driven by a separate bevel gear, with no <b>side</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
