5000|$|The first {{delivery}} {{to a commercial}} operator, an A320neo to Lufthansa, occurred on January 20, 2016. This was instead of Qatar Airways due to rotor bow, or thermal bowing, due to asymmetrical cooling after shut-down on the previous flight. Differences in temperature across the shaft section supporting the rotor lead to different thermal deformation of the <b>shaft</b> <b>material,</b> causing the rotor axis to bend; this results in an offset between {{the center of gravity}} of the bowed rotor and the bearing axis, causing a slight imbalance and potentially reducing the tight clearance between the rotor blade tips and the compressor wall. All production standard engines now feature a damper on the third and fourth shaft bearings to help stiffen the shaft and data from engines in service and under accelerated testing is expected to gradually reduce engine start times.

40|$|The {{fracture}} of a turbine shaft {{in the case}} of overloading can exhibit brittle or plastic failure, depending on the material properties, the turbine-shaft geometry and the form of loading. Usually, when the toughness increases, the stiffness of the <b>shaft</b> <b>material</b> is reduced, which can lead to the plastic twist of the shaft. If the fatigue crack appears in the critical region of the shaft then the low impact-toughness value may induce a brittle fracture. During the retrofit of a hydro-power plant a new turbine shaft was produced by quenching-and-tempering technology. Charpy impact-toughness tests showed lower values for the <b>shaft</b> <b>material</b> than those prescribed by the project documentation. Since the turbine shaft for a hydro-power plant is a massive and expensive component, it is necessary to determine a sufficient impact toughness for the material in terms of the geometry and the manner of loading for the turbine shaft. Since only the yield strength and the impact toughness of the material were prescribed, the level 0 of the SINTAP should be applied. The minimum impact toughness values that ensure the ductile {{fracture of}} the shaft, cracked circumferentially was also estimated. We also analyzed the variation of the shaft’s carrying capacity resulting from a reduction of the non-cracked ligament in the transversal direction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Steel {{conveying}} rollers used in {{hot rolling}} mills must be exchanged very frequently at great cost because hot conveyed strips induce wear {{on the surface}} of roller in short periods. In this study, new roller structure is considered which has a ceramics sleeve connected with two short steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide longer life and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, sometimes the steel shaft has to be pulled out for exchange. Simply, heating outside surface and cooling inside surface of the shaft are necessary for separation. However, attention should be paid to the maximum thermal stress of the ceramics sleeve in the process of separation. In this paper, finite element method analysis is applied to the structure and thermal stress has been calculated with the varying dimensions of the structure. Also several effects on thermal stress have been investigated, such as the effect of shrink fitting ratio, outside diameter, the fitted length, thickness of <b>shaft,</b> <b>materials</b> an so on. Finally the most appropriate thermal conditions to reduce maximum stress and make separation easy have been discussed, which is very useful for designing of new rollers...|$|R

The shaft and hub are modelled with equal lengths, unequal lengths, a shoulder on the shaft, and a grooved hub. Axisymmetric models of the shaft and hub are used to determine variable interference pressure along the interface line in the axial direction. The hub material is considered as steel and grey cast iron, and the <b>shaft</b> <b>material</b> is taken to be steel. All models used in the analysis are also solved using the finite element method with the ANSYS program. The results are compared with each other...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for the elastoplastic deformation of rotating graded hollow shafts are presented. The modulus of elasticity of the <b>shaft</b> <b>material</b> is assumed to vary nonlinearly in the radial direction. The plastic model is based on Tresca’s yield criterion, its associated flow rule, and ideal plastic material behavior. Elastic, partially plastic, fully plastic, and residual stress states are investigated. It is observed that the elastoplastic responses of the rotating functionally graded hollow shafts are affected notably by the material nonhomogeneity. It is also observed that the fully plastic limit rotation speed of the shaft is almost independent {{of the variation in}} the modulus of elasticity of the material. The nonhomogeneous solution derived here reduces to that of a homogeneous one as the variation in the modulus of elasticity is slowed down...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir {{burnishing}} (FSB) is a surface-enhancement {{method used}} after machining, {{without the need}} for an additional device. The FSB process is applied on a machine that uses rotation tools (e. g., machining center or multi-tasking machine). Therefore, the FSB process can be applied immediately after the cutting process using the same machine tool. Here, we apply the FSB to the <b>shaft</b> <b>materials</b> of 0. 45 % C steel using a multi-tasking machine. In the FSB process, the burnishing tool rotates at a high-revolution speed. The thin surface layer is rubbed and stirred as the temperature is increased and decreased. With the FSB process, high hardness or compressive residual stress can be obtained on the surface layer. However, when we applied the FSB process using a 3 mm diameter sphere tip shape tool, the surface roughness increased substantially (Ra = 20 µm). We therefore used four types of tip shape tools to examine the effect of burnishing tool tip radius on surface roughness, hardness, residual stress in the FSB process. Results indicated that the surface roughness was lowest (Ra = 10 µm) when the tip radius tool diameter was large (30 mm) ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a novel {{approach}} to the low-speed marine diesel propulsion shafting design is proposed and examined. The proposed approach {{is based on the}} shafting least inertia principle, in which the design task is formulated and solved as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. The core of the approach is a cost function, which is defined as a weighted sum of the shafting, turning wheel, and tuning wheel inertias, because it is a suitable proxy of the propulsion <b>shafting</b> <b>material</b> and production costs. The constraint set is composed of the three mandatory constraints, where the crankshaft, intermediate shaft, and propeller shaft torsional vibration stresses should be lower than the corresponding stress limits, as well as a few additional constraints that help ensure that the plant behavior complies with applicable regulatory and operational requirements. For optimization purposes, a Recursive Quadratic Programming method is utilized, while the shafting torsional vibration response is determined using a standard vibration analysis program with slight modifications. Numerical experiments have shown that fast convergence can be achieved. Compared to the classically obtained solution, the proposed approach provided more than 8 % reduction in cost function as well as significantly reduced design time.

Analysis of these and 13 recently published mtDNA genomes demonstrates the existence of two apparently sympatric mtDNA clades that exhibit high interclade divergence. The analytical power afforded by {{the analysis of the}} complete mtDNA genomes reveals a surprisingly ancient coalescence age of the two clades, ≈ 1 – 2 million years, depending on the calibration technique. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the temporal distribution of the 14 C ages of these and previously identified members of the two mammoth clades suggests that clade II went extinct before clade I. Modeling of protein structures failed to indicate any important functional difference between genomes belonging to the two clades, suggesting that the loss of clade II more likely is due to genetic drift than a selective sweep...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{concentrations}} at {{the ends}} of a flat contact including frictional sliding are analyzed in this article by using the finite element (FE) method. The numerical studies are conducted with a shaft coupled to the hub by conical rings. The applied mesh refinement at the contact ends assures the reliability of the FE results, which show significantly higher stress peaks than those obtained from the conventional analytical solution recommended in the design guidelines of the frictional conical joints. These notch stresses result in low cycle fatigue (LCF) failures of the shaft-hub connection in service, since the yield point of the <b>shaft</b> <b>material</b> can be locally exceeded. The effect of clearances among the joint components and magnitudes of the friction coefficient on variations of the maximum stress in the contact are considered as well.
