5|$|In 916 Emperor Taizu (Abaoji) officially {{designated}} {{his eldest}} son, Yelü Bei, as his successor. <b>Succession</b> by primogeniture was a long-held standard in Chinese culture {{but was not}} accepted among the Khitans, creating a friction between Taizu's desires and the beliefs of the Khitan elites, including Taizu's wife, Empress Shulü Ping. Taizu, sensing {{the possibility that the}} <b>succession</b> process would run into difficulty, forced the Khitan leadership to swear allegiance to Yelü Bei after he was installed as heir apparent. To the Khitans, this was considered a radical move. This friction between primogeniture and <b>succession</b> by the strongest candidate would lead to repeated <b>succession</b> crises, the first of which occurred after Taizu's sudden and unexpected death in 926.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing <b>succession</b> to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. <b>Succession</b> is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707. The rules of <b>succession</b> may only be changed by an Act of Parliament; {{it is not possible}} for an individual to renounce his or her right of <b>succession.</b> The Act of Settlement restricts the <b>succession</b> to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the <b>succession</b> to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of <b>succession.</b> The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the <b>succession</b> but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This report {{reviews and}} {{incorporates}} new elemental and isotope chemostratigraphic data for correlation of Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated <b>successions</b> in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). These thick mixed carbonate/siliciclastic <b>successions</b> were largely deposited in epicontinental basins or accumulated on passive margins {{on the edges}} of cratons (e. g. São Francisco, Amazonia, Rio Apa Block, Pampia and Río de la Plata paleocontinents) during extensional events related to the rifting of the Rodinia Supercontinent. From the stratigraphic point of view, these <b>successions</b> occur as three mega-sequences: glaciogenic, marine carbonate platform (above glaciomarine diamictites or rift <b>successions),</b> and dominantly continental to transitional siliciclastics. In the orogenic belts surrounding cratons, carbonate-dominated <b>successions</b> with important volcanoclastic/siliciclastic contribution have been, in most cases, strongly deformed. The precise ages of these <b>successions</b> remain a matter of debate, but recently new paleontological and geochronological data have considerably constrained depositional intervals. Here, we report high-resolution C, O, Sr, and S isotope trends measured in well-preserved sample sets and mainly use Sr and C isotopes in concert with lithostratigraphic/biostratigraphic observations to provide detailed correlations of these <b>successions.</b> The establishing of a high-level and definite chemostratigraphic correlation between Neoproterozoic basins in South America is the main goal of this work...|$|R

The new direction in the biogeography has been justified, the conception of the <b>successions</b> has been introduced in the geographic investigations; the approaches to the phytoindication of the ecosystems have been developed, and the comparative geographic analysis of the <b>successions</b> has been given. The typology of the <b>successions</b> has been performed, and its zonal peculiarities have been revealed.

5|$|Anne was crowned on St George's Day, 23 April 1702. Afflicted with gout, she {{was carried}} to Westminster Abbey {{in an open}} sedan chair, with a low back to permit her train to flow out behind her. On 4 May, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish <b>Succession,</b> in which England, Austria and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain.

5|$|Before 28 October 2011, the <b>succession</b> {{order in}} the American Commonwealth realms, {{as well as those}} American territories under the British crown, adhered to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, by which <b>succession</b> passed first to an individual's sons, in order of birth, and {{subsequently}} to daughters, again in order of birth. However, {{with the possible exception of}} Canada, following the legislative changes giving effect to the Perth Agreement, <b>succession</b> is by absolute primogeniture for those born after 28 October 2011, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of gender. As these states share the person of their monarch with other countries, all with legislative independence, the change was implemented only once the necessary legal processes were completed in each realm. Those possessions under the Danish and Dutch crowns already adhere to absolute primogeniture.|$|E
40|$|Studies of Triassic magnetostratigraphy {{began in}} the 1960 s, with focus on poorly fossilferous nonmarine red-beds. Construction of the Triassic {{geomagnetic}} polarity timescale was not consolidated until the 1990 s, when access to magnetometers of sufficient sensitivity became widely available to measure specimens from marine <b>successions.</b> The biostratigraphically-calibrated magnetostratigraphy for the Lower Triassic is currently largely based on ammonoid zonations from Boreal <b>successions.</b> Exceptions are the Permian–Triassic and Olenekian–Anisian boundaries, which have more extensive magnetostratigraphic studies calibrated by conodont zonations. Extensive magnetostratigraphic studies of nonmarine Lower Triassic <b>successions</b> allow a validation and cross-calibration of the marine-based ages into some nonmarine <b>successions.</b> The Middle Triassic magnetostratigraphic timescale is strongly age-constrained by conodont and ammonoid zonations from multiple Tethyan carbonate <b>successions,</b> the conclusions of which are supported by detailed work on several nonmarine Anisian <b>successions.</b> The mid Carnian is the only extensive interval in the Triassic in which biostratigraphic-based age calibration of the magnetostratigraphy is not well resolved. Problems remain with the Norian and early Rhaetian in properly constraining the magnetostratigraphic correlation between the well-validated nonmarine <b>successions,</b> such as the Newark Supergroup, and the marine-section-based polarity timescale. The highest time-resolution available from magnetozone correlations should be about 20 – 30 ka, with an average magnetozone duration of c. 240 ka, for the Lower and Middle Triassic, and about twice this for the Upper Triassic...|$|R
