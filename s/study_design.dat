5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern <b>study</b> <b>design</b> prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to highlight similarities and differences across various case <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> and to analyze their respective contributions to theory. Although different designs reveal some common underlying characteristics, a comparison of such case <b>study</b> research <b>designs</b> demonstrates that case study research incorporates different scientific goals and collection and analysis of data. This paper relates this comparison to a more general debate of how different research designs contribute to a theory continuum. The fine-grained analysis demonstrates that case <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> fit differently to the pathway of the theory continuum. The resulting contribution is a portfolio of case <b>study</b> research <b>designs.</b> This portfolio demonstrates the heterogeneous contributions of case <b>study</b> <b>designs.</b> Based on this portfolio, theoretical contributions of case <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> can be better evaluated in terms of understanding, theory-building, theory development, and theory testing.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{scientific}} research is {{to arrive at a}} reasonable estimate of the truth with respect to some underlying question of importance. In clinical medical research, multiple types of <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> help point investigators toward the truth, including cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses. Methodologists and proponents of evi-dence-based medicine have argued that there exists a pyramidal hierarchy of <b>study</b> <b>designs,</b> suggesting that certain <b>study</b> <b>designs</b> more closely approximate the truth than others [1].

25|$|Epidemiology is {{the study}} and {{analysis}} of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations.

Epidemiologists help with <b>study</b> <b>design,</b> collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review).

The human studies carried out in Holmesburg failed to follow Dow's original protocol and lacked proper informed consent by the participants. As a result of poor <b>study</b> <b>design</b> and subsequent destruction of records, the tests were virtually worthless even though ten inmates were exposed to 7,500μg of TCDD.|$|E

An article by Robert Costanza, David Stern, Lining He, and Chunbo Ma responded to a call by Mick Common to determine the foundational literature of ecological economics by using citation analysis to examine which books and articles have had the most influence on the development of the field. However, citations analysis has itself proven controversial and similar work has been criticized by Clive Spash for attempting to pre-determine what is regarded as influential in ecological economics through <b>study</b> <b>design</b> and data manipulation. In addition, the journal Ecological Economics has itself been criticized for swamping the field with mainstream economics.|$|E
