60|$|Speaking now as {{a purely}} civil seaman (or, perhaps, I ought to say civilian, because politeness is not what I have in my mind) I may say that I have never {{expected}} the Merchant Service to do otherwise than well during the war. There were people who obviously did not feel the same confidence, nay, who even confidently expected to see the collapse of merchant seamen's courage. I must admit that such pronouncements did arrest my attention. In my time I {{have never been able}} to detect any faint hearts in the ships' companies with whom I have served in various capacities. But I reflected that I had left the sea in '94, twenty years before the outbreak of the war that was to apply its severe test to the quality of modern seamen. Perhaps they had deteriorated, I <b>said</b> <b>unwillingly</b> to myself. I remembered also the alarmist articles I had read about the great number of foreigners in the British Merchant Service, and I didn't know how far these lamentations were justified.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{nothing else}} to be done," [...] <b>said</b> Armine, <b>unwillingly.</b> [...] "You'll have a terrible time to wait, unless I meet some one first. I'll be as quick as I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tea {{went off}} happily in the garden, with much {{laughing}} and talking. [...] "Pity to leave such good company!" [...] <b>said</b> the doctor, <b>unwillingly</b> rising at last--"but I {{must go to}} the Union--I promised Ward to meet him there." ...|$|R
50|$|Cyndi and Lukas are {{a couple}} of {{teenagers}} who met one summer at the beach. Their new-found friendship is immediately put to the test after Lucasâ€™ mother dies from a mysterious accident, which resulted in his father's decision to live abroad. And just like that, Cyndi and Lukas, albeit <b>unwillingly,</b> <b>said</b> their goodbyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, this,' <b>said</b> Knight, {{somewhat}} <b>unwillingly.</b> 'That experience teaches, {{and your}} sweetheart, {{no less than}} your tailor, is necessarily very imperfect in her duties, if you are her first patron: and conversely, the sweetheart who is graceful under the initial kiss must be supposed to have had some practice in the trade.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] <b>said</b> James Wait, <b>unwillingly.</b> There was a silence. He {{turned his}} head just the least bit, and stole a {{cautious}} glance. The cook's lips moved without a sound; his face was rapt, his eyes turned up. He seemed to be mentally imploring deck beams, the brass hook of the lamp, two cockroaches.|$|R
60|$|When {{the clock}} struck three, Elizabeth {{felt that she}} must go, and very <b>unwillingly</b> <b>said</b> so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little {{pressing}} to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{protectorate}} {{of missions}} {{was open to}} some criticism both in theory and in practice. The following are the most plausible objections which have influenced even friends of the apostolate {{to the extent of}} making them sometimes doubtful of the usefulness of the institution, even for the missions. The protectorate, it is <b>said,</b> was <b>unwillingly</b> tolerated by the authorities of infidel countries; it embittered the antipathy and hatred excited by the Christians in those countries, and caused the missionaries relying on its support to be insufficiently mindful of the sensibilities of the natives and on their guard against excessive zeal. The modicum of truth contained in these objections showed that the exercise of the protectorate requires great wisdom and discretion. Naturally, the infidel powers chafe somewhat under it as a yoke and an uncomfortable and even humiliating servitude, but so long as they did not assure to the missionaries and their works the security and guarantees of justice which are found in Christian countries (and experience has shown how little this is the case in the Turkish and Chinese empires), the protectorate was the best means of providing them. But to obviate as much as possible the odium attached to the meddling of one foreign power in the affairs of another, this intervention is reduced to what is absolutely necessary. The solution of the delicate problem lay in the cordial union and prudent collaboration of the agents of the protectorate and the heads of the mission, which is possible to realize in practice. When it is learned that the superior of the mission of south-east Chi-li during the difficult period from 1862 to 1884 had recourse to the French legation only three times and arranged all other difficulties directly with the local Chinese authorities (Em. Becker, [...] "Le R. P. Joseph Gonnet", Ho-kien-fou, 1907, p. 275), it will be understood that the French Protectorate was not necessarily a heavy burden, either for those who exercise it or for those bound by it. The abuses which may arise were due to the men, not to the system; after all, the missionaries, though not faultless, are most anxious that it should not be abused. Perhaps the abuse most to be feared was that the protectors should seek payment for their services by trammelling the spiritual direction of the mission or by demanding political services in exchange: a complete history of the protectorate could show such abuses and others to be insignificant when compared with the benefits conferred by this institution on religion and civilization.|$|R
