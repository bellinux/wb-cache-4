25|$|In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell {{demonstrated}} that a nonuniform <b>solid</b> <b>ring,</b> solid ringlets or a continuous fluid ring would also not be stable, {{indicating that the}} ring must be composed of numerous small particles, all independently orbiting Saturn. Later, Sofia Kovalevskaya also found that Saturn's rings cannot be liquid ring-shaped bodies. Spectroscopic studies of the rings carried out in 1895 by James Keeler of Allegheny Observatory and Aristarkh Belopolsky of Pulkovo Observatory showed Maxwell's analysis was correct.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} hours of October23, a clear northward turn took place {{followed}} by acceleration northeast. A <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> of [...] cloud tops surrounded the hurricane's [...] wide eye and signaled its intensification into a Category5 hurricane. In a 24-hour time span, Patricia's maximum sustained winds increased by 120mph (195km/h), the fastest such intensification in any hurricane observed by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The hurricane achieved its peak around 12:00UTC on October23, with estimated winds around 215mph (345km/h) and a barometric pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg); these values are based upon continued intensification after a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm six hours prior. In the NHC's report on Patricia, it is noted that the hurricane may have surpassed Typhoon Tip as the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed, but lack of direct observations {{at the time of its}} peak prevent analysis of such.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} pattern of linking the rings {{together}} is the 4-to-1 pattern, where each ring is linked with four others. Historically, the rings composing {{a piece of}} mail would be riveted closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to an attack. In the beginning, European mail was made of alternating rows of round riveted <b>rings</b> and <b>solid</b> <b>rings.</b> By the 14th century, European mail makers stopped using <b>solid</b> <b>rings</b> and mail was made from wedge riveted rings only with no <b>solid</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R

500|$|He {{focused his}} {{attention}} on a problem that had eluded scientists for two hundred years: the nature of Saturn's rings. It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn. The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because St John's College, Cambridge had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 Adams Prize. Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, Maxwell concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called [...] "brick-bats", each independently orbiting Saturn. Maxwell was awarded the £130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay [...] "On {{the stability of the}} motion of Saturn's rings"; he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry. His work was so detailed and convincing that when George Biddell Airy read it he commented [...] "It {{is one of the most}} remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen." [...] It was considered the final word on the issue until direct observations by the Voyager flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction.|$|E
500|$|On September18, Hurricane Gordon began {{accelerating}} to {{the northeast}} around a strengthening ridge, and later toward the east as guided by a trough. Wind shear decreased, which allowed for convection to redevelop near the eye. Unexpectedly, the hurricane began restrengthening, despite moving over slightly cooler waters; instability from cooler upper-level temperatures allowed for the reintensification. Despite continued forecasts of a weakening trend, Gordon's resiliency presented a rare threat [...] the first since Hurricane Charley in 1992 [...] to the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. At about 0600UTC on September19, the hurricane attained its secondary peak intensity of [...] about 485mi (775km) west-southwest of the Azores. By that time, the cyclone consisted of a <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> of convection around a contracting eye. Shortly thereafter, Gordon began steadily weakening due to the combination of increasing wind shear and even cooler water temperatures. Its motion became just south of due east, causing the strongest winds to remain south of the islands. At around 0900UTC on September20, Gordon passed through the Azores between the islands of Santa Maria and São Miguel, producing hurricane-force wind gusts on the former island. At the time, its sustained winds were estimated around , which remained south of any landmasses. The cloud pattern had become less organized and more ragged.|$|E
2500|$|In 1655, Huygens {{proposed}} that Saturn {{was surrounded by}} a <b>solid</b> <b>ring,</b> [...] "a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic." [...] Using a 50 power refracting telescope that he designed himself, Huygens also discovered the first of Saturn's moons, Titan. In the same year he observed and sketched the Orion Nebula. His drawing, the first such known of the Orion nebula, was published in Systema Saturnium in 1659. Using his modern telescope he succeeded in subdividing the nebula into different stars. The brighter interior now bears the name of the Huygenian region in his honour. He also discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars.|$|E

60|$|Another {{strange thing}} was that when they jumped up to look around them the nearest trees began sliding away, in a circle, leaving the little girl and boy in a clear space. And the trees {{continued}} moving back and back, farther and farther, until all their trunks were jammed tight together, and not even a mouse could have crept between them. They made a <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> around Twinkle and Chubbins, who stood looking at this transformation with wondering eyes.|$|E
60|$|He did not, however, {{think it}} {{necessary}} to give the same warning of defiance to two enemies as he would unquestionably have afforded to one. His hand was upon his mace, and perhaps the unwary Saracen would have been paid for his Persian poetry by having his brains dashed out on the spot, without any reason assigned for it; but the Scottish Knight was spared from committing {{what would have been}} a sore blot in his shield of arms. The apparition, on which his eyes had been fixed for some time, had at first appeared to dog their path by concealing itself behind rocks and shrubs, using those advantages of the ground with great address, and surmounting its irregularities with surprising agility. At length, just as the Saracen paused in his song, the figure, which was that of a tall man clothed in goat-skins, sprung into the midst of the path, and seized a rein of the Saracen's bridle in either hand, confronting thus and bearing back the noble horse, which, unable to endure the manner in which this sudden assailant pressed the long-armed bit, and the severe curb, which, according to the Eastern fashion, was a <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> of iron, reared upright, and finally fell backwards on his master, who, however, avoided the peril of the fall by lightly throwing himself to one side.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, in Europe, {{from the}} pre-Roman period on, the rings {{composing}} {{a piece of}} mail would be riveted closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to a thrusting attack or a hit by an arrow. Up until the 14th century European mail was made of alternating rows of round riveted <b>rings</b> and <b>solid</b> <b>rings.</b> Sometime during the 14th century European mail makers started to transition from round rivets to wedge shaped rivets but continued using alternating rows of <b>solid</b> <b>rings.</b> Eventually European mail makers stopped using <b>solid</b> <b>rings</b> and almost all European mail was made from wedge riveted rings only with no <b>solid</b> <b>rings.</b> Both were commonly made of wrought iron, but some later pieces were made of heat-treated steel. Wire for the riveted rings was formed by either of two methods. One was to hammer out wrought iron into plates and cut or slit the plates. These thin pieces were then pulled through a draw plate repeatedly until the desired diameter was achieved. Waterwheel powered drawing mills are pictured in several period manuscripts. Another method was to simply forge down an iron billet into a rod and then proceed to draw it out into wire. The solid links would {{have been made by}} punching from a sheet. Guild marks were often stamped on the rings to show their origin and craftsmanship. Forge welding was also used to create solid links, but there are few possible examples known; the only well documented example from Europe is that of the camail (mail neck-defence) of the 7th century Coppergate helmet. Outside of Europe this practice was more common such as [...] "theta" [...] links from India. Very few examples of historic butted mail have been found and it is generally accepted that butted mail was never in wide use historically except in Japan where mail (kusari) was commonly made from butted links.|$|R
5000|$|Now we know roughly how {{the hazard}} is occurring, for {{a clearer picture}} and the {{solution}} on how to solve this problem, we would look to the Karnaugh map.The two gates are shown by <b>solid</b> <b>rings,</b> and the hazard can be seen under the dashed ring. A theorem proved by Huffman tells us that by adding a redundant loop 'X2X3' this will eliminate the hazard.|$|R
50|$|Slip rings can be {{used for}} the same purpose, but are subject to friction, wear, {{intermittent}} contact, and limitations on the rotational speed that can be accommodated without damage. Wear can be eliminated by using a pool of liquid mercury instead of a <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> contact, but the toxicity and slow corrosion of mercury are problematic, and very high rotational speeds are again difficult to achieve. A rotary transformer has none of these limitations.|$|E

50|$|Practice mutes, {{also known}} as Whispa, whisper, or hotel mutes, are similar to {{straight}} mutes in appearance, but have a <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> of cork that prevents air from escaping from the bell like a Harmon mute. There are sound baffles inside the mute, and tiny holes in {{the sides of the}} mute that allow air to escape silently. These mutes are extremely quiet and are rarely used in performance. They are usually used for privacy and to avoid disturbing bystanders during practice sessions.|$|E
5000|$|Linked rings: Two or more <b>solid</b> <b>rings</b> already linked together. They {{cannot be}} {{separate}}d. The ability {{to show that}} the rings are all separate and solid is usually done using a false count. The illusion of the joining and separation of the rings is achieved by sleight of hand and optical illusion. Performers strive to make the penetration of one ring by another appear smooth, plain, and clear.|$|R

5000|$|The Wah-wah mute (also {{known by}} the brand name Harmon) is a hollow, bulbous mute in two parts. Unlike the more common {{straight}} or cup mutes, the Harmon mute has a <b>solid</b> <b>ring</b> of cork that completely blocks the air leaving the bell, forcing all of it into the mute. At {{the front of the}} mute, there is a cup on a tube (sometimes called the [...] "stem") that can be slid in or out, or removed completely, depending on the composer's direction or the player's preference. This mute produces a tinny, shallow sound which can be varied by adjusting the mute and via manipulation with the fingers at the cup end. Harmon mutes are commonly used only on trumpets and trombones.|$|E
