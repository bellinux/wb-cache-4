5000|$|The <b>stremma</b> ( [...] stremmata; στρέμμα, <b>strémma)</b> is a Greek unit of {{land area}} now equal to {{precisely}} 1,000 square meters. It {{is also known}} as the royal <b>stremma</b> to distinguish it from earlier forms of the unit.|$|E
50|$|One <b>stremma</b> {{was equal}} to 1000 m2. The hectare varied from 900 - 2500 m2 {{depending}} on region.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>stremma</b> or Greek acre ≈ 10,000 square Greek feet, but now set {{at exactly}} 1,000 square metres (a similar unit was the zeugarion) ...|$|E
50|$|The main occupations in Deskati are agriculture, mainly {{wheat and}} tobacco, and animal husbandry. Deskati has 61,790 <b>stremmas</b> of arable land, 24.363 {{sheep and goats}} and around 1,000 cattle. There are also small {{industries}} occupied in ironwork, marble processing, woodworking and building materials.|$|R
5000|$|In Greece, the old dönüm {{is called}} a [...] "Turkish stremma", while today, a <b>stremma</b> or [...] "royal stremma" [...] is exactly one decare, like the metric dönüm.|$|E
5000|$|A dunam (دونم; dönüm), {{also known}} as a donum or dunum and as the old, Turkish, or Ottoman <b>stremma,</b> was the Ottoman unit of area {{equivalent}} to the Greek <b>stremma</b> or English acre, representing the amount of land that could be ploughed by a team of oxen in a day. The legal definition was [...] "forty standard paces in length and breadth", but its actual area varied considerably from place to place, from a little more than 900 m2 in Ottoman Palestine to around 2500 m2 in Iraq.|$|E
50|$|The Dictionary of Modern Greek {{defines the}} old Ottoman <b>stremma</b> as {{approximately}} 1,270 m2, but Costas Lapavitsas used {{the value of}} 1,600 m2 for the region of Naoussa in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The unit {{is still}} in use in many areas {{previously}} ruled by the Ottomans, although the new or metric dunam has been redefined as exactly one decare (1000 m2), like the modern Greek royal <b>stremma.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The name dönüm, {{from the}} Ottoman Turkish dönmek ( [...] , [...] "to turn") {{appears to be}} a calque of the Byzantine Greek <b>stremma</b> and had the same size. It was likely adopted by the Ottomans from the Byzantines in Mysia-Bithynia.|$|E
50|$|The Byzantine Greek <b>stremma</b> was the {{probable}} {{source of the}} Turkish unit. The zeugarion (Turkish çift) was a similar unit derived from the area plowed {{by a team of}} oxen in a day. The English acre was originally similar to both units in principle, although it developed separately.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946, {{after the}} Second World War, {{they settled in}} Athens. George Kaldis died in 1953, a man of rare {{integrity}} among Greek politicians of whom {{it was said that}} he had finished as poor as he had started: [...] "Not one house, not one <b>stremma</b> (of land)" [...] ("Ούτε ένα σπίτι, ούτε ένα στρέμμα") ...|$|E
50|$|In Cyprus, a donum is 14400 {{square feet}} (1337,8 m2). In the Republic of Cyprus older Greek-Cypriots also still {{refer to the}} donum, {{although}} this is gradually being replaced by another local Greek Cypriot dialect word, σκάλες 'skales, rather than the mainland Greek word <b>stremma</b> (equivalent to a decare). However, officially Cyprus uses the square metre and the hectare.|$|E
5000|$|In 1945, {{the village}} had a {{population}} of 460 Muslims, while the total land area was 10,008 dunams (equivalent to the Greek <b>stremma</b> or English/American acre), according to an official land and population survey. [...] Of this, 45 dunams were plantations or irrigated, 7,909 for cereals, [...] while 72 dunams were classified as built-up public areas.|$|E
5000|$|The old, Turkish, or Ottoman <b>stremma</b> is the Greek (and {{occasionally}} English) {{name for}} the [...] "dunam", which probably derived from the Byzantine unit. Again, this varied by region: The Dictionary of Modern Greek gives a value of 1,270 m2, but Costas Lapavitsas used the value of 1,600 m² for the region of Naoussa in the early 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|The Byzantine or Morean <b>stremma</b> {{continued}} to {{vary depending on}} the period {{and the quality of the}} land, but usually enclosed an area between 900 - 1900 m2. It was originally also known as the [...] "plethron" [...] but this was eventually replaced by [...] "stremma", derived from the verb for [...] "turning" [...] the ground with the simple Byzantine plow.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, Eleni Vournazos, {{widow of}} Leonidas, sells 1,250 <b>stremma</b> of the Kouponia/Goudi area to Ioannis Zografos (d. 1927), a Member of Parliament for the Nationalist Party and {{university}} professor. Dividing it into plots, he sold them for installments of 112 drachma per month. The first houses were erected in 1919. Within ten years, 100 had been built. At this time, {{the foundations of}} the Church of St. Theraponta were erected.|$|E
50|$|Wrestling was {{the first}} {{competition}} {{to be added to}} the Olympic Games that was not a footrace. It was added in 708 B.C. (Miller, 46). The competitions were held in elimination-tournament style until one wrestler was crowned the victor. The wrestling area was one square plethron or <b>stremma.</b> This event was also part of the pentathlon. Wrestling was regarded as the best expression of strength out of all of the competitions and was represented in Greek mythology by Heracles.|$|E
5000|$|The burnt {{areas of}} forest {{appear to be}} {{unmonitored}} by forest patrols. There are only 49 forest guards in Attica, which means that each guard must patrol an area of 83,000 stremmata. A modern <b>stremma</b> is approximately 1,000 square metres and thus [...]1 hectares or [...]247 acres. The total forested extent of Attica is 3,500,000 stremmata. In some areas, olive trees have been planted within the burnt forest areas. This {{is one of the}} first illegal steps in transforming unmonitored forested areas into cultivated land.|$|E
50|$|With the {{application}} of the Kapodistria law it constitutes henceforth the Municipal District of Katafygio, (Katafigio), in the Municipality of Apodotia in Aetolia-Acarnania, Greece and it occupies 23.429 stremmata (measure of area, 1 <b>stremma</b> = 1000 sq meters, 4 stremmata = approx 1 acre), while the census of 2011 recorded 322 individuals {{making it one of the}} more vibrant villages of the mountainous Nafpaktia area. Historically the residents lived by livestock farming, maintaining a significant number of animals, an activity which the remaining residents still carry on today.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea of a}} {{training}} center, which would belong to the club existed for many years. Under the presidency of Zagorakis the dream became a reality. In June 2008 {{it was decided to}} construct PAOK’s new sports centre at Nea Mesimvria, a suburb of the city of Thessaloniki. The centre covers an area of 70 <b>Stremma</b> (17,3 acres). There are seven pitches, one of them with artificial turf. Six of them have floodlights. Initially, the training center was incomplete, mainly on medical and technical issues of player rehabilitation. Today is a modern and integrated training center, which includes: ...|$|E
50|$|Mr Nikos Chlikas, a {{forester}} and environmentalist, has emphasised {{that about}} 90,000 to 100,000 stremmata in north-east Attica have been burnt {{for a second}} or third time, out of the total of 210,000 stremmata, which was burnt in August 2009. In these areas, it is essential that there is intervention by the authorities to help forest regeneration because the pine trees are very young and do not have the capacity to create cones. This forest cannot regenerate by itself. In addition, the number of small trees which are, at the moment, in the nursery at Amigdales will have difficulty covering 3,000-4,000 stremmata, for this reason money needs to be allocated for new trees, so that planting can take place over the next few years. According to Nikos Chlikas, the cost of reforestation is around 500 euro for each <b>stremma,</b> including the cost of caring for the trees for at least two years. However, in 2008 less than 10,000 stremmata were reforested in the whole of Greece.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{historian}}s such as British historian Edward Gibbon and the Greek historian Dimitri Kitzikis {{have argued}} that {{after the fall of}} Constantinople, the Ottoman state took over the machinery of the Roman state, and that in essence the Ottoman Empire was a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire under a thin Turkish Islamic guise. Kitzikis called the Ottoman state [...] "a Greek-Turkish condominium". The American historian Speros Vryonis wrote that the Ottoman state was centered on [...] "a Byzantine-Balkan base with a veneer of the Turkish language and the Islamic religion". Other historians have followed the lead of the Austrian historian Paul Wittek who emphasized the Islamic character of the Ottoman state, seeing the Ottoman state as a [...] "Jihad state" [...] dedicated to expanding the world of Islam. Another group of historians led by the Turkish historian M. Fuat Koprulu championed the [...] "gazi thesis" [...] that saw the Ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic Turkic tribes who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale, and argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia. More recently, the American historian Heath Lowry called the Ottoman state a [...] "predatory confederacy" [...] led in equal parts by Turks and Greeks converted to Islam. [...] The British historian Norman Stone suggested many continuities between the Eastern Roman and Ottoman empires such as the zeugarion tax of Byzantium becoming the Ottoman Resm-i çift tax, the pronoia land-holding system that linked the amount of land one owned with one's ability to raise cavalry becoming the Ottoman timar system, and the Ottoman measurement for land the donum was the same as the Byzantine <b>stremma.</b> Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the Eastern Orthodox Church was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the timar system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the timar system became inheritable, land ownings in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged Timariots from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the timariots to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} decades, the {{population}} of the world has been increased to a greater number that is why different problems relating to food quality and food scarcity are the subject of discussion in the modern era. The main problem is to feed such a large population with a good quality food but many factors cause hindrance in achieving this task. There are many factors that lower the food quality and damage its nutritional potential. Among these factors mite pests are of immense importance which inhibat various environment including stored grains, stored products, cultivated mushroom, house dust, pollens, mosses, litter and nest of different animals. Mites (Acarina: Arachnida) are microscopic and widely distributed throughout the world. Mites' infestation decreases grains quality by changing the proportion of nutrients. Stored grain mites are also recognized as a source of allergens by inhalation in certain occupational environments and in the domestic environment. In order to check the species distribution from Punjab, identification is the key components to acquire better management. For this purpose various localities in different ecological zones including irrigated low land, semi-arid, sub humid eastern unirrigated and sub-mountain west were surveyed. For spot collection sieve method was used while the remaining samples had been processed through Berlese's funnel, the hypopi thus collected were mounted permanently on glass slides by using Hoyer's medium. In this present research work 24 species were collected. Among these 16 species are new to science and 8 species were already described of the genus Acotyledon Berlese viz. Acotyledon falki, tariqi, bellulus, <b>stremma,</b> haripuriensis, wazirabadensis, kamokiensis and peshawariensis. Among the new species 8 are belonging to Acotyledon Berlese, viz., cicero, multaniensis, Sarwari, haroonabadensis, augokiensis, veginus, tritici and chackwalensis; 4 species were belonging to the genus Caloglyphus Oudemans viz. pejowaliensis, sativum, jaranwalaensis and aurangensis; 1 species was belonging to genus Forcellinia Berlese viz. Chounawalaensis, 3 species was belonging to genus Histiostoma Kramer viz. mungus, balkasarensis and arshadi. Description, host range and distribution records of all these species are given in the following pages of this manuscript. Dendrograms of all the species from Pakistan in each genus are also prepared by using multivariate cluster analysis. The phenatic relationship of all known species from Pakistan has been worked out by cluster analysis using average linkage method and Euclidean distance by applying computer program Minitab...|$|E
