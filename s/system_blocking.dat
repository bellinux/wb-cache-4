5000|$|Danny {{informs the}} two that the moleman had {{been around for years}} and had tried to attack him back when the {{building}} had been run by the brothers' mother. The only reason that the moleman had not waged such a wide attack on the building had been due to the building's heating system running and blocking off the moleman's route into the building (as he was using several underground prohibition-era bootlegging tunnels), but since the power had been shut off the moleman was able to freely access the building. Having had enough, they decide to take on the moleman and inform the building's occupants of everything that has happened. They go into the basement and succeed in killing the moleman, but discover that there wasn't one moleman but many. They barely manage to escape and light a fire in the heating <b>system,</b> <b>blocking</b> the mole men from pursuing them. The film then cuts forward to an undetermined point in time, where the two brothers have begun taking their jobs as landlords more seriously. They inform some new tenants that they must pay for all utilities except heat, as they run the heater year round due to the building being [...] "drafty" [...] (they do not inform them that it is actually done to keep mole men out of the building). The film ends with the two brothers going downstairs to respond to a warning by an alarm system that goes off whenever a moleman tries to come in through the heating system.|$|E
30|$|Under a DC link {{short-circuit}} fault condition, if the RB- MMC-BESS keeps running {{according to}} the above rules before <b>system</b> <b>blocking,</b> U DC will reduce to zero immediately. Then the inserted RBSMs’ capacitors CSM and battery banks BSM will be continuously discharged, and potentially over-discharged if the fault is not cleared quickly. Therefore some reasonable means for improving the DC fault ride-through capability of RB-MMC-BESSs should be found.|$|E
