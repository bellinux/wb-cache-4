40|$|Macro and meiobenthic {{communities}} of two fishing areas (Vilamoura and Lagos) {{in the western}} part of <b>south</b> <b>Portugal</b> (<b>Algarve</b> coast) were analysed. Both locations had been under severe dredge-fishing impact until four years previously. Vilamoura has since continued to be dredged, while fishing activity in Lagos was stopped in 1995 as a response to overfishing. For each location, three replicate areas were analysed at depths of 7 – 9 m. In each of these areas, 18 quadrats for macrofauna and 12 cores for meiofauna were randomly sampled by SCUBA divers during September 1999. The Shannon–Weiner diversity index was higher for meiofauna in the fished area, whereas macrofauna diversity was higher in the recently non-fished area. Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between the two areas was 87 · 82 %. Major differences were found between Ampeliscidea, Amphiura mediterranea, Spisula solida, Haustoriidae, Nemertinea and Diogenes pugilator populations at the two sites. There was higher abundance but lower biomass of potential macrofaunal scavengers in the fished area, and carnivore biomass was also higher in this area. Deposit-feeders dominated meiofauna abundance in both study areas. The community structure of the continuously fished area was dominated by small, opportunistic, short-lived species while the community structure of the recently non-fished area was dominated by more fragile and long-living sessile organisms...|$|E

There are 95 of these inscriptions, the longest having 82 readable signs. Around one-third of them were found in Early Iron Age necropolises or other Iron Age burial sites associated with rich complex burials. It is usual to date them to the 7th century BC and consider the southwestern script {{to be the most}} ancient Paleohispanic script, with characters most closely resembling specific Phoenician letter forms found in inscriptions dated to c. 825 BC. Five of the inscriptions occur on stelae with what has been interpreted as Late Bronze Age carved warrior gear from the Urnfield culture.|$|R

Sampling occurred between 2006 and 2007. No anaesthetics were used and the fish were returned to their original rockpools. Size, algal cover, elevation and the fauna inhabiting the rock pools were some of the characteristics taken in account. The structure and composition of the communities were similar with others already studied along the Portuguese coasts and confirmed some the factors that influence some of the resident species, as Lipophrys pholis and Coryphoblennius galerita, such as the rockpools’s bottom, structural complexity and the presence of sea urchins.

5000|$|Most {{researchers}} use {{the term}} Tartessian {{to refer to the}} language as attested on the stelae written in the Southwestern script, but some researchers would prefer to reserve the term Tartessian for the language of the core Tartessian zone, attested for these researchers with some archaeological graffiti - like the Huelva graffito - and maybe with some stelae: for example, Villamanrique de la Condesa (J.52.1). These researchers consider that the language of the inscriptions found outside the core Tartessian zone would be either a different language or maybe a Tartessian dialect, and so they would prefer to identify the language of the stelae with a different title, namely [...] "southwestern" [...] or [...] "south-Lusitanian". There is general agreement that the core area of Tartessos is around Huelva, extending to the valley of the Guadalquivir, while the area under Tartessian influence is much wider (see maps). Three of the 95 stelae, plus some graffiti, belong to the core area: Alcala del Rio (Untermann J.53.1), Villamanrique de la Condesa (J.52.1) and Puente Genil (J.51.1). Four have also been found in the Middle Guadiana (in Extremadura), and the rest have been found in the <b>south</b> of <b>Portugal</b> (<b>Algarve</b> and Lower Alentejo), where the Greek and Roman sources locate the pre-Roman Cempsi and Sefes, Cynetes, and Celtici peoples.|$|R

As with most coastal destinations, sun and beach represents the main tourist product. Previous research suggests that cultural products can add value to the core product of a destination, enhancing its competitiveness. However, few empirical studies have examined this premise in coastal destinations. Based on the responses obtained from a questionnaire applied to tourists visiting the Algarve in the Summer of 2007, this study shows that when tourists experience high levels of satisfaction regarding the cultural offer available at the destination they sense that the tourist experience expanded their knowledge and intellectual horizons. Then, the study shows that this feeling of ‘‘cultural enrichment’’ is a contributing factor to the willingness to revisit the destination.

40|$|The {{influence}} of submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) on {{the dynamics of}} coastal ecosystems is receiving increasing scientific attention, although our knowledge of this issue still remains insufficient. Understanding the ecological response of coastal ecosystems to SGD dynamics is important in order to evaluate and predict changes in coastal communities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterize the effect of groundwater discharge on subtidal soft-bottom macrofaunal assemblages in the <b>south</b> coast of <b>Portugal</b> (<b>Algarve)</b> at different times of the year and under different discharge regimes. Sediment macrofauna was sampled twice per season in spring and summer 2011 in two locations: one under {{influence of}} SGD (Olhos de Agua) and one not under that influence (Arrifes). The results showed that differences in community structure between locations occurred mainly during spring, when the magnitude of groundwater discharge was higher. Several individual taxa were strongly associated with the SGD, particularly during spring: the polychaete families Magelonidae and Oweniidae; the isopod Cyathura carinata; and the bivalves Tellimya ferruginosa and Tellina fabula. Some of these taxa are already considered indicators of SGD, whereas others merit further investigation. The average similarity among samples was consistently larger in the location with SGD and the average similarity between the two locations was generally higher during spring, indicating that SGD promote stability in macrobenthic communities across time and space. SGD were also associated with higher values of Chlorophyll a (Chl a), fine sediments and total abundance of organisms (particularly suspension feeders). This suggests that differences between locations are associated with SGD and mediated by nutrient fluxes and sediment transport, or their interaction...|$|R

40|$|Six {{populations of}} Nephrops norvegicus were {{compared}} using canonical variate analysis on morphometric characters. The {{areas where the}} samples were obtained were the <b>south</b> coast of <b>Portugal</b> (<b>Algarve)</b> in the Atlantic and five areas in the Mediterranean: the Catalan Sea, the Ligurian Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Gulf of Euboikos. Each sample consisted of 50 males with sizes chosen to belong {{as much as possible}} to the carapace length range of 30 - 35 mm. Two systems of variables were used: body measurements (74 variables) and counts of spine rows on the carapace (23 variables). Several criteria were used to select experimental units and variables to include in the statistical analysis: a) homogeneous groups for all areas (using as indicators the mean and the variance of the carapace length), b) normal distribution of the original variables within each group, c) homogeneity of variance between groups, d) variables with few missing values. The conjunction of all these criteria led to a reduction of individuals and variables {{to be included in the}} analysis. In the end, 27 variables representing body measurements and groups of 22 to 43 individuals for each area were kept. The first two canonical correlation coefficients were highly significant (p < 0. 0001) with the corresponding variates explaining 81 % of the variation. There were no single pairs of populations showing complete separation, although the degree of overlap was different when different pairs were compared. The 3 populations in the West and Central Mediterranean, Catalan Sea, Ligurian Sea and Tyrrhenian Sea showed the highest levels of similarity. The population from the Atlantic showed greatest distances overall, followed by the population from the Euboikos Gulf, representing the Eastern extreme of the geographical range...|$|R

40|$|The Mediterranean {{region is}} a climate hot spot, {{sensitive}} {{not only to}} global warming but also to water availability. In this work we document major temperature and precipitation changes in the Iberian Peninsula and margin during the last 2000  years and propose an interplay of the North Atlantic internal variability with the three atmospheric circulation modes (ACMs), (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), east atlantic (EA) and Scandinavia (SCAND)) to explain the detected climate variability. We present reconstructions of sea surface temperature (SST derived from alkenones) and on-land precipitation (estimated from higher plant n -alkanes and pollen data) in sedimentary sequences recovered along the Iberian Margin between the <b>south</b> of <b>Portugal</b> (<b>Algarve)</b> and the northwest of Spain (Galiza) (36 to 42 ° N). A clear long-term cooling trend, from 0  CE {{to the beginning of}} the 20 th century, emerges in all SST records and is considered to be a reflection of the decrease in the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation that began after the Holocene optimum. Multi-decadal/centennial SST variability follows other records from Spain, Europe and the Northern Hemisphere. Warm SSTs throughout the first 1300  years encompass the Roman period (RP), the Dark Ages (DA) and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). A cooling initiated at 1300  CE leads to 4  centuries of colder SSTs contemporary with the Little Ice Age (LIA), while a climate warming at 1800  CE marks the beginning of the modern/Industrial Era. Novel results include two distinct phases in the MCA: an early period (900 – 1100  years) characterized by intense precipitation/flooding and warm winters but a cooler spring–fall season attributed to the interplay of internal oceanic variability with a positive phase in the three modes of atmospheric circulation (NAO, EA and SCAND). The late MCA is marked by cooler and relatively drier winters and a warmer spring–fall season consistent with a shift to a negative mode of the SCAND. The Industrial Era reveals a clear difference between the NW Iberia and the Algarve records. While off NW Iberia variability is low, the Algarve shows large-amplitude decadal variability with an inverse relationship between SST and river input. Such conditions suggest a shift in the EA mode, from negative between 1900 and 1970  CE to positive after 1970, while NAO and SCAND remain in a positive phase. The particularly noticeable rise in SST at the Algarve site by the mid- 20 th century (± 1970), provides evidence for a regional response to the ongoing climate warming. The reported findings have implications for decadal-scale predictions of future climate change in the Iberian Peninsula...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{first case}} of {{pandemic}} (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection was diagnosed {{in the central}} region of Portugal on June 16, 2009, in a woman infected in Canada. METHODS: The aim of our study was, first to characterize the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of all the patients with clinical manifestations included {{in the definition of}} case for investigation with samples submitted to diagnosis of the pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection, in the central region of Portugal; second to assess the precision of the case definition of case for investigation considered in the study according to the presence or the absence of fever at the moment of clinical observation. We reviewed the medical records of all the patients presenting with Influenza like-illness classified as case for investigation and the first cases of patients infected with the new pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus, diagnosed in the central region of Portugal during the pandemic period between June and August, 2009, were analyzed. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was used to confirm the pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection. Data collection was performed on a standardized paper format in agreement with the General Health Directorate. Results and discussion: Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection was confirmed in 255 patients. Overall, median age was 23 years and 42. 7 % were included in the category of 20 to 29 years. Confirmed infection in patients with less than 2 years or greater than 50 years was a rare event. The first cases were imported from Europe, namely France, Spain and England. On a second phase, pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection was acquired in the <b>south</b> of <b>Portugal</b> (<b>Algarve),</b> before de diagnosis of the first domestic case. The incidence rate for pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection was 10. 7 per 100, 000 persons and was different according to the district. It was higher in the district of Coimbra and Guarda were the main roads connecting to Europe are. The median calculated incubation period for the for pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection was 2 days. The length of the clinical manifestations until the patients look for medical observation had a median time of 2 days. All the cases were of mild to moderate severity. No deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The early days of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection was mild in our region. Most affected patients were young adults, with the extreme categories ages of life being spared. Early detection and diagnosis, combined with stringent isolation and treatment procedures could have slowed the spread of the infection in our region...|$|R
