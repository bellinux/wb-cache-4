50|$|The Transurban used {{separate}} {{suspension and}} propulsion systems. The suspension used attractive magnetic levitation, lifted on two upside-down T-shaped beams. Each held magnets for both lifting and switching, {{on the inside}} and outside of the T, respectively. Normally the cars ran with the T misaligned slightly inside of a similar structure attached to the track above it, which made the system self-centering. Switching was accomplished by pulling the vehicle sideways with the second set of magnets, before moving onto the new track. <b>Skid</b> <b>pads</b> on the track stopped the vehicle {{in the case of a}} power failure.|$|R

2500|$|The {{historical}} name Grand Sport {{returned to}} the Corvette lineup in 2010 as an entirely new model series that replaced the Z51 option. The new model was basically an LS3 equipped Z06 with a steel frame instead of aluminum. It retained many {{of the features of}} the Z06 including a wide body with 18x9.5 and 19x12 inch wheels, dry sump oiling (manual transmission coupes only), 6-piston 14" [...] front brakes and 4-piston rear, and improved suspension. Manual power train equipped G/S coupe models receive a tweaked LS3 with a forged crank, are built in Z06 fashion by hand, and utilize a dry-sump oil system. The first three gears were also made shorter for better throttle response and faster acceleration. A new launch control system was introduced for all models that allows for sub-4-second 0–60. EPA is estimated 26 MPG highway, 1.0 G on <b>skid</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E

50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have axlebox guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the truck frame. The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the bolster and suspension springs. The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the truck frame). The truck frame rests on the axleboxes via the axlebox suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per axlebox (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the truck frame bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The truck frame is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension swing links. On early trains, the central suspension incorporated elliptical leaf springs, but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the axlebox suspension has 2 friction shock absorbers per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on <b>skid</b> <b>pads</b> on the cast side flanges of the bolster; these <b>skid</b> <b>pads</b> are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies. The car body is also connected {{to the center of the}} bolster by means of the central pivot—a vertical steel rod mounted in the center of the bolster, which transmits the traction and braking forces from the truck to the car body, and also receives part of the car body's weight.|$|R
50|$|On {{the trailer}} cars, the trucks {{are similar to}} those of {{ordinary}} passenger cars, but have shorter frames. They lack axlebox guides (the longitudinal movements of the axles relative to the truck frame are limited solely by the suspension springs themselves), the springs are softer, the central pivot is made of 3 segments (which gives it a degree of flexibility), and the axlebox suspension friction shock absorbers are mounted inside the springs (on the power car trucks, they are mounted outside). The leading truck of the driving trailer has brackets for mounting the cab signal receiver coils. The early ER2 trailer cars had KVZ-5/E type trucks (identical to those on the ER1); later examples had the KVZ-TsNII/E type. The latter had the following design changes: the springs were softer; the bolster was attached to the frame by means of 2 swing links with rubber/metallic elements; the weight of the car body was borne by the bolster only via the <b>skid</b> <b>pads</b> (on the earlier type, part of the weight was also borne by the central pivot).|$|R

Thunderhill also offers a large <b>skid</b> <b>pad</b> area as well for drifting and car control events.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} {{study was to investigate}} whether there is a statistical relationship between accident-related factors including use of drugs or alcohol, speeding, driver distractions, gender, driver drowsiness, practice of dysfunctional driving maneuvers, and use of occupant protection devices, and fatal vehicle crashes among young teen drivers. Secondary archival data from 84 North Carolina crashes occurring between 2009 and 2013 and involving young teen drivers between the ages of 15 and 18 years were obtained from North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles Form 349 crash reports. These data were analyzed using chi-square tests for goodness-of-fit, chi-square tests for independence, and z-tests for proportions. The study found statistically significant associations between gender (p 3 ̆c. 019), speeding (p 3 ̆c. 001), practice of dysfunctional driving maneuvers (p 3 ̆c. 001), and non-use of occupant protection devices (p 3 ̆c. 001) and teen crash fatalities. The implications of this study for positive social change include recommendations to the State of North Carolina to enact legislative action related to driver education for new drivers, with the anticipated result of reducing traffic fatalities when a teenage driver is involved in an accident. In order to counteract deadly dysfunctional driving maneuvers on the part of young teen drivers, it was recommended that State driver education curricula be expanded to include exposure to more real world, on-the-road supervised driving experience conducted under more varied conditions and that high school driver education facilities be upgraded to include <b>skid</b> <b>pads</b> for student driving practice. Further research relating to the supervised implementation and verification of the requirement of the 50 hours of adult-supervised driving experience for Graduated Driver Licensure was also recommended...|$|R

40|$|This poster {{presentation}} will describe preliminary work {{done at the}} Carnegie Mellon Driver Training and Safety Institute (CM-DTSI) to test the validity of truck driver simulator training for backing maneuvers, and the digitalization of a <b>skid</b> <b>pad.</b> Preliminary results supported the validity of simulator training for straight-line and reverse-lane-change backing skills. Results for the <b>skid</b> <b>pad</b> work indicated that stopping distances during hard braking on the virtual <b>skid</b> <b>pad</b> were somewhat shorter than on the physical <b>skid</b> <b>pad</b> at the same initial speed. The shorter stopping distance in the simulator {{was the result of}} the functional limit of 0. 2 surface coefficient of friction in the simulation dynamic model. A virtual <b>skid</b> <b>pad</b> with a slope of 9 % was created to test the effect of slope on braking distance.
