40|$|Oxotitanium {{phthalocyanine}} (OTiPc) {{thin films}} have been sublimed at various thicknesses on SnO 2 and glass substrates. The morphology, crystallinity, and photoelectrochemical {{activity of the}} films have been studied. It {{was found that the}} physical and photoelectrochemical properties of the films are greatly influenced by the temperature reached by the substrate during the sublimation. Below 80 -degrees-C, amorphous films are obtained while the films are partially crystalline when the substrate is allowed to reach about 140 -degrees-C. Amorphous films are made of tightly packed aggregates of circular section while partially crystalline films consists of platelets. All films are porous and permeable to the I 3 -/I- redox system. The dominant polymorph in partially crystalline films is not the same for all film thicknesses. It is phase IV OTiPc (as deduced by electron diffraction) for films thinner than about 2000 angstrom. On the other hand, for films thicker than about 8000 angstrom, phase I OTiPc becomes the dominant polymorph (as deduced by X-ray diffraction). It is replaced by phase II for 20 000 -angstrom-thick films of OTiPc. Partially crystalline films are the only ones to absorb in the near-infrared (NIR) region. This typical absorption is going along with an improvement of the photoactivity of the films. In partially crystalline films, energy is transferred from the amorphous to the crystalline regions where most of the charges are generated. Quantum yields for electron collection per incident photon may reach over 25 % in <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> conditions, at 850 nm, the Q-band absorption maximum for 8000 -angstrom-thick films.

40|$|Purpose: This paper studies dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in the pulsed current {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> conditions in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to characterize different types of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurring in GMAW-P system. The behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> under the influence of different pulsing conditions is also investigated. Findings: It will be shown in the paper that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P occurs in different forms which can be categorized depending upon time of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and phase (peak or base time) of the pulse. Further investigation involves study of the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> with variation of different pulsing parameters. Research limitations/implications: The results show that by varying the pulse parameters, behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P is changed. The pulse parameters can be adjusted to avoid occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P. Future work should concentrate on development of practical indices in terms of pulse welding parameters for quantitative estimation of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence and avoidance.
