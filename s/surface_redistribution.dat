Capping of surface antigens was obtained {{with a single}} layer of antibodies in E. histolytica and E. invadens. This surface segregation progressed to a large accumulation of folded plasma membrane that extruded as a defined vesicular cap. A spontaneous release of the cap {{at the end of}} the capping process took place. These released caps contained most of the antibodies that originally bound to the whole cell surface. Two- thirds of radiolabeled antibodies bound to the surface of E. histolytica were released into the medium in 2 h. Successive capping induced by repeated exposure of E. invadens to antibodies produced conglomerates of folded surface membrane, visualized as stacked caps, in proportion to the number of antibody exposures. These results indicate the remarkable ability of Entamoeba to rapidly regenerate substantial amounts of plasma membbrane.

40|$|International audienceSoil water {{movement}} was studied within fields {{on two different}} soil types, a red clay soil and a duplex soil of sand over clay, at the Romwe Catchment in southern Zimbabwe. Each study site comprised two fields and formed a surface water sub-catchment (1. 0 - 2. 4 ha) from which runoff was gauged. Soil moisture was measured in-situ at up to 20 locations within each sub-catchment over an entire cropping season and the following dry season. Maize was cultivated at both sites according to the farmers' normal cropping practice and crop yields were recorded. <b>Surface</b> <b>redistribution</b> of rainfall through localised runon and runoff was shown {{to be an important}} process in both sub-catchments with rainfall concentration factors between 0. 2 and 2. 7 for major rainfall events.

Similarly, the organization of vegetation in these systems controls runoff generation and erosion, and strongly influences the spatial redistribution of water and soil resources. Landform-water-vegetation feedbacks may have, therefore, a key role determining the stability and restoration potential of arid and semiarid ecosystems. We present a synthesis of field, remotely-sensed and modelling studies on landform-soil-vegetation patterns in semiarid rangelands of Australia and reclaimed coal-mining slopes of Mediterranean-dry Spain. Our {{results indicate that the}} organization and stability of vegetation patterns strongly depends on feedbacks with coevolving landforms. Exploration of banded woodlands in central Australia reveals that disturbances (e. g. grazing, wildfires) can impact landform-water-vegetation feedbacks, altering the way water is spatially redistributed and used by vegetation, which results in non-linear reductions of ecosystem function. Successful experiences on the restoration of these systems suggest that the spatial management of runoff and sediments is decisive to rehabilitate vegetation patchiness and landscape function. The study of vegetation-water-landform feedbacks in Mediterranean-dry reclaimed mining slopes of Spain offers additional indications on the restoration of drylands, particularly on the effects of rill and gully erosion on the stability of restored vegetation. The development of rill and gully networks provides very efficient drainage networks for the routing of runoff and sediments that drastically reduce the availability of water and soil resources for plant production, ultimately causing degradation of vegetation and restoration failure.

Polyclonal anti-AMA- 1 {{was much more}} inhibitory than monoclonal antibody (MAb) 4 G 2 dc 1 in an invasion assay. Although both polyclonal and monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) inhibited secondary processing of the 66 -kDa form of AMA- 1, only polyclonal IgG caused its anomalous processing, inhibited its redistribution, and cross-linked soluble forms of AMA- 1 on merozoites. Moreover, Fab fragments of polyclonal IgG that fail to cross-link did not show the enhancement of inhibitory effect over intact IgG, as observed {{in the case of}} Fab fragments of MAb 4 G 2 dc 1. We propose that although blocking of biologically important sites is a common direct mode of action of anti-AMA- 1 antibodies, blocking of AMA- 1 secondary processing and redistribution are additional indirect inhibitory mechanisms by which polyclonal IgG inhibits invasion. We also report a processing inhibition assay that uses a C-terminal AMA- 1 -specific MAb, 28 G 2 dc 1, to detect merozoite-bound remnants of processing (∼ 20 kDa from normal processing to 48 and 44 kDa and ∼ 10 kDa from anomalous processing to a 52 -kDa soluble form of AMA- 1).
