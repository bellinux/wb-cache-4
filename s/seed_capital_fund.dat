40|$|The European <b>Seed</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Fund</b> Pilot Scheme (1988 - 95) was a European Commission {{response}} to two primary concerns that: (1) {{private venture capital}} firms in Europe were increasingly retreating from the financing and support of start-up, early-stage and, particularly, technology based enterprises; and (2) existing spatial concentrations in the supply of venture capital prejudiced the formation of new, innovative businesses in less economically developed regions of the Union. This paper presents the updated results of a study of this Scheme in 1992. The comparative internal dynamics of the Seed Funds are explored. The Scheme realized its goal of encouraging private investment into innovative, technology-based young firms.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to assess the {{potential}} of using scientometric and patentometric indicators as a way of instrumentalizing the selection process of projects for seed capital funding. There is an increasing interest in technology based enterprises for their capacity to contribute to economic and social development, but there is also some difficulty in assessing non-financial criteria associated with technology for the purposes of financial funding. Thus, this research selected the case of the first enterprise invested in by the largest <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> <b>fund</b> in Brazil, in order to create scientific and technological indicators and to assess the extent to which these indicators may contribute to understanding the market potential of the technology once it is assessed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the role of {{universities}} and other institutions in successful entrepreneurship. Insights are obtained following a literature review approach. Case studies from the United States (New York startup), Spain (Mondragon), and Germany provide strong evidence that universities are very instrumental in the creation, design and implementation of entrepreneurial initiatives by providing new and ongoing entrepreneurs with human capital training, fundamentals, and theoretical and empirical models to contribute to lasting businesses. Results from university research on gender and risk-issues lead to believe that women are more risk averse than men to work and invest in star-up businesses. Other institutions, such as governments, are critical to provide with the necessary incentives to launch start-up businesses, including tax cuts, <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> <b>funding,</b> investment in human capital, etc. While the evidence supporting the links between education and entrepreneurial outcomes is promisi g it is not yet definitive. In addition to providing a review of existing research, this paper suggests an integrative framework for future research. ...|$|R
5000|$|B. <b>Seed</b> <b>capital</b> <b>funds</b> This phase {{finances}} {{early stage}} companies. The startup is still shaping its concept and production and service {{are not yet}} developed fully. Investment money can use be used {{at this time to}} construct a working prototype. Additionally, the funds can be used to further market research and legal issues such as patents. [...] Investment firms only expect 20% of companies to succeed, moving to second round of financing. In this stage, the company can often be moved to another round of funding or even a series of funds that take over the management of the investment. Investing firms expect a high percentage of the business and often provide funding in stages that is dependent on the startup company reaching set milestones. For example, a venture capital may agree to $5 million during this phase, but may pay out the funding in 1/3 installments based on the startup meeting set milestones. Finally, CVCs often look to promote or insist on specific executives to manage the startup at this time.|$|R

30|$|This {{marked the}} {{evolution}} of “Cambridge Phenomenon 2 ”, (Segal et al., 2011) which in 1997 – 8 looked at various issues such as land use, transport systems and telephony. The aim was to seek to accommodate growth through new Science Park development to link the university and industry. The university saw need for seedcorn finance and participated in <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> <b>funds,</b> including the Quantum Fund, and Cambridge Research and Innovation Ltd. Entrepreneurs also became venture capitalists: Amadeus Capital (Hermann Hauser); Merlin Ventures, a biotechnology fund (Chris Evans founded Chiroscience) and the Gateway Fund founded by local financier Nigel Brown. Thus the “champions” were able to envision how future growth rests on continued acquisition of research funding, understood as the key knowledge core of – especially – ICT and biotechnology innovation excellence. A future key is the identification of flexible research funding that furthers and fosters “knowledge at interfaces” (“crossover”) types of interdisciplinary research profile to evolve along multiple inter-dependent research pathways. Departure by the UK from the European Union presages major uncertainty about Science and Technology “framework funding” as represented by the EU’s Horizon 2020 research programming. This has meant a novel financing development bolstering research at Cambridge University has occurred as follows.|$|R

30|$|Our {{research}} has identified different target groups, distinguished according to ethnicity, education, age or gender. In countries oriented towards target-group policies, {{the primary reason}} of dealing with labour market problems is to cope with[*]−[*]higher levels of unemployment or inadequate labour market integration. Sometimes, such target-group policies are more directed at creating future urban economic growth. Business ownership offers an option for self-sufficiency, socio-economic empowerment, and new jobs. The range of services offered by several governments includes counselling and mentoring, the provision of micro-credits and <b>seed</b> <b>capital</b> <b>funds,</b> award programmes, business networks, promotion of entrepreneurship as a promising option for young people, and tailored information (e.g., {{in the language of}} the minority group). It may be interesting to explore effective policy strategies in future research. Interesting and promising initiatives for stimulating new entrepreneurship can be found, for example, in the US. The US offers a wealth of ‘full-service’ initiatives for less privileged entrepreneurial groups. (For instance, enterprise centres for women, native Indians, and ethnic minority segments). These are complemented with special support systems, such as micro-loan funds, entrepreneurship award programmes, networking and mentoring programmes, innovation incentives, and so forth. Indeed, a broadly developed business culture forms the seedbed for migrant entrepreneurship, especially in the SME sector. Europe has a wide variety of business support initiatives, but does not yet have a uniform incentive program for migrant entrepreneurship, despite its significance in large urban agglomerations. Migrant entrepreneurship will certainly be a major source of urban dynamics in the year to come, also in Europe.|$|R
