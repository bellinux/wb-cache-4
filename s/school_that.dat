40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review {{successful}} models for school reform with a focus on the efficacy of the High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work model in vocational-technical high schools in Massachusetts. This study compared and analyzed the results of learner outcomes in Massachusetts vocational-technical high schools by using the results in the Failing category from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, which is a high-stakes test based on increased standards (The Massachusetts Frameworks). The study compared an equal number of Massachusetts vocational-technical high <b>schools</b> <b>that</b> are members of the High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work network with an equal number of those that are nonmembers. The study compared the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System Failing category results in English Language Arts and Mathematics from 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 between High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical high schools in Massachusetts and non-High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical high schools in Massachusetts. Students not in the Failing category for English Language Arts and Mathematics would be eligible to receive a high school diploma, while those students in the Failing categories would not be eligible to receive diplomas. The study also compared dropout rates between 1999, 2000, and 2001 to learn if increased standards and highstakes testing have led to a significant increase in the dropout rate in High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical high schools in Massachusetts when compared to dropout rates in non-High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical high schools in Massachusetts. ^ Based on the comparative results of the dropout rates, this study has concluded that implementing the High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work model in vocational-technical high schools in Massachusetts has done no harm in terms of significant increases in the dropout rates. ^ Based on these results, this study has concluded that implementing the High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work model in Massachusetts vocational-technical high schools has done some significant good in effectively increasing learner outcomes on high-standards, high-stakes testing.
