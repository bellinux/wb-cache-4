50|$|The {{ability of}} the Bachman's sparrow to detect and colonize areas before {{they are no longer}} {{suitable}} may depend on the size and isolation of the habitat. In south-central Missouri, only glades ≥ 29 acres (11.7 ha) were occupied by Bachman's sparrows. The probability of Bachman's sparrow occupying pine-grassland restoration stands in Mississippi increased as <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> with long burning rotations, short-harvest rotations, and no removal of hardwoods decreased (p=0.05) and as the perimeter to area ratio of these areas increased (p=0.02). In South Carolina, distance from source populations significantly (p≤ 0.05) influenced the ability of Bachman's sparrows to colonize recent clearcuts in both years on one study area and in 1 of 2 years in another study area. The authors suggest that the presence of corridors in the latter study area may have resulted in distance being less influential.|$|E

5000|$|Early zoning {{practices}} were subtle and often debated. Some claim the practices {{started in the}} 1920s while others suggest the birth of zoning occurred in New York in 1916. Both of these examples {{for the start of}} zoning, however, were urban cases. Zoning becomes an increasing legal force as it continues to expand in its geographical range through its introduction in other urban centres and use in larger political and geographical boundaries. Regional zoning was the next step in increased geographical <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> under zoning laws. A major difference between urban zoning and regional zoning was that [...] "regional areas consequently seldom bear direct relationship to arbitrary political boundaries". This form of zoning also included rural areas which was counter-intuitive to the theory that zoning was a result of population density. Finally, zoning also expanded again but back to a political boundary again with state zoning.|$|E

Since there could be a number of location-specific factors involved into estimation of these probabilities we do not provide formulas for micro and picocells.|$|E

Growth rates of the defenders, however, did not differ among the treatments, perhaps because the benefits of monopolizing food were balanced by the costs of defending a larger area.

There are multiple surface and subsurface indicators of distress and defects which are observed using traditional, geotechnical engineering methods.

While first-time-exposed students are required to learn first how to apply the different analysis methods, the remaining students are required to calculate the total number of possible set of equations that solve the circuit. To serve both student groups, we developed an application that helps understanding the way arbitrary choices affect the set of equations generated for solving a customizable circuit. ...|$|E

Relationships between size and shape are analysed using geometric morphometric techniques. Sexual dimorphism is negligible, allometry explains the main changes in shape during growth, and males and females manifest similar allometric trajectories. Anatomical regions affected by size-related shape variation are similar in different species, but allometric trajectories are divergent. The largest modifications of the mandible and ventral cranium occur in regions {{directly involved in the}} mechanics of mastication. Relative to other anatomical regions, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> of muscle insertion increases, while the size of sense organs, nerves and teeth generally decreases.
