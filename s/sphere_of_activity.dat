As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), has put it, this was an architecture of democracy, not radical avant-gardism.

Imperial portrait sculptures may model the head as mature, even craggy, atop a nude or seminude body that is smooth and youthful with perfect musculature; a portrait head might even be added to a body created for another purpose.

One character proposes that cyberspace is everting; becoming an integral and indistinguishable element {{of the physical world}} rather than a domain to be visited. During the book tour for the novel, Gibson elaborated on this theme, proposing that the ubiquity of connectivity meant that what had been called [...] "cyberspace" [...] is no longer a discrete <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> separate from and secondary to normal human activity, but that those increasingly less common parts of normal life free from connectivity were the exception.

2500|$|Barnett Levy founded {{an early}} theatre in Australia. [...] He was refused a license by then {{governor}} Darling in 1828, {{though in the}} following year he was permitted to hold approved performances in his Sydney Hotel. A record of the event is found in an entry in [...] "Sydney in 1848", a work published in that year: [...] "In the late twenties His Excellency Sir R. Bourke granted Barnett Levy a license for dramatic performances, with a restriction that he should confine himself to the representation of such pieces only as had been licensed in England by the Lord Chamberlain." [...] Levy was at that time the owner of the original Royal Hotel in George Street; and he fitted up the saloon of that establishment as a theatre, where the first representations of the legitimate drama in the colony were given. The encouragement that this undertaking received induced the enterprising proprietor to enlarge his <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> He built a theatre called the Theatre Royal, which was opened in 1833, at a cost which almost bankrupted him.|$|E

2500|$|More {{recently}} post-modern anthropologists {{are increasingly}} engaging {{with the concept}} of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of scientism, and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour, these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to [...] "animate" [...] the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our [...] "professional subcultures," [...] which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are [...] "approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists." [...] These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.|$|E
2500|$|In 1796, with Napoleon's {{arrival in}} Italy, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria {{left the city}} which from 1800 came {{into the hands of}} the French. French {{domination}} did not deter Milan's cultural activities. The rapidly growing population included some of the greatest Italian intellectuals from Melchiorre Gioia to Vincenzo Monti, and Alessandro Volta to Ugo Foscolo and Silvio Pellico. The Lombard Institute of Science and Letters was founded and several newspapers were established in the city. For the capital of the Kingdom of Italy as it now became, numerous urban projects were prepared with a view to giving Milan the look of one of Europe's main capitals although they were never completed. For some time the inhabitants had drawn up petitions for dismantling the Sforza Castle and by his decree of 23 June 1800, Napoleon ordered its demolition. This was indeed begun in 1801 but was never completed. The same year the architect Giovanni Antonio Antolini was charged with designing a [...] "Foro Bonaparte" [...] (Bonapart Forum) but instead he suggested remodeling the castle in the Neoclassical style. As a result of its high costs, the project was however shelved. By decree in 1807, Milan and Venice were endowed with a [...] "Commissione di Ornato" [...] (Embellishment Committee) with vast powers and a wide <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> It was made up of the most prominent figures in Milan. The first item to be discussed was a master plan which was drafted the same year.

Captain Schiller, from of old {{a lover of}} rural occupations, and skilful in gardening and nursery affairs, had, at Ludwigsburg, laid-out for himself a little Nursery. It was managed on the same principles which he afterwards made public in his Book, Die Baumzucht im Grossen (Neustrelitz, 1795, and second edition, Giessen, 1806); and was prospering beautifully. The Duke, who had noticed this, signified satisfaction in the thing; and he appointed him, in 1770, to shift to his beautiful Forest-Castle, Die Solitüde, near Stuttgart, as overseer of all his Forest operations there. Hereby to the active man {{was one of his}} dearest wishes fulfilled; and a <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> opened, corresponding to his acquirements and his inclination.

60|$|Recognising {{thus the}} true {{position}} of aesthetics, and holding {{that while the}} cultivation of them should form a part of education from its commencement, such cultivation should be subsidiary; we have now to inquire what knowledge is of most use to this end--what knowledge best fits for this remaining <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity?</b> To this question the answer {{is still the same}} as heretofore. Unexpected though the assertion may be, it is nevertheless true, that the highest Art of every kind is based on Science--that without Science there can be neither perfect production nor full appreciation. Science, in that limited acceptation current in society, may not have been possessed by various artists of high repute; but acute observers as such artists have been, they have always possessed a stock of those empirical generalisations which constitute science in its lowest phase; and they have habitually fallen far below perfection, partly because their generalisations were comparatively few and inaccurate. That science necessarily underlies the fine arts, becomes manifest, à priori, when we remember that art-products are all more or less representative of objective or subjective phenomena; that they can be good only in proportion as they conform to the laws of these phenomena; and that before they can thus conform, the artist must know what these laws are. That this à priori conclusion tallies with experience, we shall soon see.|$|E
