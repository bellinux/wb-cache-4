25|$|The Spitfire Mk 26 is an '80% or 90% scale' (but {{see note}} of scale {{inaccuracies}} in the Variants section below) replica {{based on the}} original Supermarine Spitfire design. Despite its smaller size provision is made for a passenger to be seated in tandem behind the pilot. The stressed <b>skin</b> <b>structure</b> consists of 2024 aluminium alloy skins, formers and longerons with some fibre-glass mouldings for parts such as fairings and air scoops.

25|$|Its {{design was}} based on the {{previous}} Rs.III, differing primarily in having a narrower hull fitted with sponsons and stressed <b>skin</b> <b>structure,</b> with some minor tidying of the design. It was a braced parasol monoplane with the fuselage mounted on the wing above both engine nacelles and hull. The four engines were mounted in push-pull pairs in nacelles large enough to allow in flight access — a requirement of the original Riesenflugzeug giant aircraft type specification by IdFlieg in 1915 — between the hull and the wing, and staggered to allow propeller disks to overlap slightly so as to reduce adverse yaw when an engine was not running.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding. Even {{if one of the}} steel tubes were damaged, the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield. Damage to a stressed <b>skin</b> <b>structure,</b> as used by the Spitfire, required more specialised equipment to repair. The old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of Hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions. Crated Hurricanes were assembled at Takoradi in West Africa and flown across the Sahara to the Middle East theatre and, to save space, some Royal Navy aircraft carriers carried their reserve Sea Hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies, which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed.|$|E
25|$|Feathers and {{scales are}} made up of two {{distinct}} forms of keratin, and it was long thought that each type of keratin was exclusive to each <b>skin</b> <b>structure</b> (feathers and scales). However, a study published in 2006 confirmed the presence of feather keratin {{in the early stages of}} development of American alligator scales. This type of keratin, previously thought to be specific to feathers, is suppressed during embryological development of the alligator and so is not present in the scales of mature alligators. The presence of this homologous keratin in both birds and crocodilians indicates that it was inherited from a common ancestor. This may suggest that crocodilian scales, bird and dinosaur feathers, and pterosaur pycnofibres are all developmental expressions of the same primitive archosaur skin structures; suggesting that feathers and pycnofibers could be homologous.|$|E
25|$|Only limited artefactual {{evidence}} survives of {{the users}} of Acheulean tools {{other than the}} stone tools themselves.

25|$|Ordered as a {{follow-on}} to the NA-57 as a two-seat advanced trainer, the NA-64 P-2/NAA-64 P-2 {{represented a}} major structural improvement, with a longer all-metal fuselage replacing the fabric covered fuselage of the NA-57. As well as metal skin replacing the fabric on the fuselage, the fin was changed {{from having a}} corrugated skin to being a smooth stressed <b>skin</b> <b>structure</b> and was moved slightly aft, lengthening the rear fuselage while the engine was moved forward to maintain the center of gravity. The rudder was also changed from the rounded shape used previously to one with a roughly triangular shape with the broadest part being at the bottom to improve handling at high angles of attack. In one respect however, it was a step backwards from its immediate predecessor, the BT-14, with which it is often confused, in that the earlier straight wings were used {{with the result that}} in RCAF service, when compared to the later and more powerful Harvard II it was flown alongside, it had different handling characteristics and lower performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pinnipeds have a thick blubber {{layer and}} may have {{difficulty}} maintaining their body temperature during hot weather when on land. The skin is the main thermoregulatory conduit which emits excessive body heat. Methods Thorough evaluation of the skin histology in three pinniped species; the California sea lion- Zalophus californianus, the Pacific harbor seal- Phoca vitulina richardsi, and the Northern elephant seal- Mirounga angustirostris, was conducted to identify the presence, location and distribution of <b>skin</b> <b>structures</b> which contribute to thermoregulation. These structures included hair, adipose tissue, sweat glands, vasculature, and arteriovenous anastomoses (AVA). Thermal imaging was performed on live animals {{of the same species}} to correlate histological findings with thermal emission of the skin. Results The presence and distribution of <b>skin</b> <b>structures</b> directly relates to emissivity of the skin in all three species. Emissivity of skin in phocids (Pacific harbor and Northern elephant seal s) follows a different pattern than skin in otariids (California sea lions). The flipper skin in phocids tends to be the most emissive region during hot weather and least emissive during cold weather. On the contrary in otariids, skin of the entire body has a tendency to be emissive during both hot and cold weather. Conclusion Heat dissipation of the skin directly relates to the presence and distribution of <b>skin</b> <b>structures</b> in all three species. Different skin thermal dissipation patterns were observed in phocid versus otariid seals. Observed thermal patterns can be used for proper understanding of optimum thermal needs of seals housed in research facilities, rescue centers and zoo exhibits. </p...|$|R

The laser processing was performed by scanning the laser beam {{across the surface of}} initially polished flat sample material.

Analyses of the surface using optical as well as scanning electron microscopy revealed morphologies providing the optimum similarity to the natural skin of lizards. For mimicking <b>skin</b> <b>structures</b> of moisture-harvesting lizards towards an optimization of the surface wetting behavior, additionally a two-step laser processing strategy was established for realizing hierarchical microstructures.
