50|$|Quillaia is the milled {{inner bark}} or small stems and {{branches}} of the <b>soapbark</b> (Quillaja saponaria, Molina). Other names include Murillo bark extract, Panama bark extract, Quillai extract, Quillaia extract, Quillay bark extract, and <b>Soapbark</b> extract. It contains {{a high concentration of}} saponins which is increased by processing; highly purified quillaia is used to enhance vaccines. Other compounds in the extract include tannins and other polyphenols, and calcium oxalate. It is listed as an ingredient in root beer and cream soda.|$|E
50|$|Matorral is a shrubland plant community, {{composed}} of sclerophyll ("hard-leaved") shrubs and small trees, cactus, and bromeliads. Typical species include Litre (Lithraea venenosa), Quillay or <b>Soapbark</b> Tree (Quillaja saponaria), cactus (Echinopsis chiloensis), and bromeliads of genus Puya, with a diverse understory of herbs, vines, and geophytes. The matorral {{is similar to}} the chaparral of California and the maquis of the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
50|$|Quillaja saponaria, {{the soap}} bark tree or <b>soapbark,</b> is an {{evergreen}} {{tree in the}} family Quillajaceae, native to warm temperate central Chile. In Chile it occurs from 32 to 40° South Latitude approximately. Populations are found even 2000 m (6500 ft) above sea level. It can grow to 15-20 m (50-65 ft) in height. The tree has thick, dark bark, smooth, leathery, shiny, oval evergreen leaves 3-5 cm long, white flowers 15 mm diameter borne in dense corymbs, and a dry fruit with five follicles each containing 10-20 seeds.|$|E
50|$|Saponins have {{historically}} been understood to be plant-derived, but they have also been isolated from marine organisms such as sea cucumber. Saponins are indeed found in many plants, and derive their name from the soapwort plant (genus Saponaria, family Caryophyllaceae), the root of which was used historically as a soap. Saponins are {{also found in the}} botanical family Sapindaceae, with its defining genus Sapindus (soapberry or soapnut), and in the closely related families Aceraceae (maples) and Hippocastanaceae (horse chestnuts; ref. needed). It is also found heavily in Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Gynostemma, Cucurbitaceae) in a form called gypenosides, and ginseng or red ginseng (Panax, Araliaceae) in a form called ginsenosides. Within these families, this class of chemical compounds is found {{in various parts of the}} plant: leaves, stems, roots, bulbs, blossom and fruit. Commercial formulations of plant-derived saponins, e.g., from the soap bark (or <b>soapbark)</b> tree, Quillaja saponaria, and those from other sources are available via controlled manufacturing processes, which make them of use as chemical and biomedical reagents.|$|E
40|$|Yucca (Yucca schidigera) and <b>Soapbark</b> (Quillaja saponaria), both native desert plants, {{are major}} {{commercial}} sources of saponin extracts. Yucca schidigera {{is native to}} the southwestern United States and to the arid Mexican desert, and Quillaja saponaria is found in arid areas of Chile. Saponins have detergent or surfactant properties with both water-soluble and fat-soluble components. The use of natural saponins from yucca and <b>soapbark</b> as an additive in the diet, has improved production in aquatic organisms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of inclusion of Nutrafito plus (NTF+), which is a mixture of Yucca and <b>Soapbark</b> extracts, on growth, survival, and development of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and the effect on growth, survival, development, and digestive enzyme activities for juvenile Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. The extracts were included at different levels in the diets of tilapia and shrimp in four experiments. In experiment 1, at the end of 6 weeks there was no significant difference (p > 0. 05) between growth rates of tilapia fed 6 different diets, with no mortality nor abnormal behavior in any of the treatments. Water quality parameters were determined weekly and remained within recommended limits for Nile tilapia culture. In the second trial, at the end of 40 days, there was no significant difference (p > 0. 05) between growth rates of fish fed 7 different diets with various levels of Nutrafito. There were no mortalities during the experiment. In the third trial, 20 tanks (140 L each) were stocked with 10 shrimp each. Tanks were divided into 5 treatments with 4 replicates each. There was significant difference (p 0. 05) was found between treatments...|$|E
40|$|Saponaria vaccaria (Caryophyllaceae), a soapwort, {{known in}} western Canada as cowcockle, {{contains}} bioactive oleanane-type saponins {{similar to those}} found in <b>soapbark</b> tree (Quillaja saponaria; Rosaceae). To improve our understanding of the biosynthesis of these saponins, a combined polymerase chain reaction and expressed sequence tag approach was taken to identify the genes involved. A cDNA encoding a β-amyrin synthase (SvBS) was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and characterized by expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The SvBS gene is predominantly expressed in leaves. A S. vaccaria developing seed expressed sequence tag collection was developed and used for the isolation of a full-length cDNA bearing sequence similarity to ester-forming glycosyltransferases. The gene product of the cDNA, classified as UGT 74 M 1, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and identified as a triterpene carboxylic acid glucosyltransferase. UGT 74 M 1 is expressed in roots and leaves and appears to be involved in monodesmoside biosynthesis in S. vaccaria...|$|E
40|$|Over {{three million}} tonnes (t) of tilapia, mostly Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, L.), are {{produced}} annually {{making it the}} second most abundantly produced freshwater fish (FAO, 2010). Tilapia are mouthbreeders that often produce stunted populations under pond conditions; one means of prevention is to produce all-male fish with the additional advantage that males usually grow faster than females. All-male populations {{can be achieved by}} supplementing feed with androgens such as 17 -α-Methyltestosterone (MT) during days 10 – 25 post-hatch (Pandian and Sheela, 1995). However, MT is considered to be carcinogenic (Velazquez and Alter, 2004), and Hulak et al. (2008) also showed that effluents of systems in which carp were fed diets containing MT caused masculinization of female fish. Furthermore, in aquaculture the application of hormones to fish destined for human consumption is prohibited in the European Union under directive 96 / 22 /EC, article 5, which also prohibits import of animal products produced with hormones. Kwon et al. (2000) showed that Fadrozole, a non-steroidal compound, caused masculinization in tilapia by inhibiting aromatase, which is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of endogenous androgens to estrogens. Steinbronn et al. (2004) were able to show that a dose of 2000 ppm Quillaja saponins (Sigma S- 2149) inhibited reproduction of tilapia after dietary application for 32 days to first-feeding fry, suggesting saponins as a possible alternative to MT. These secondary plant compounds consist of either a steroid or triterpenoid basic structure (aglycone or sapogenin) plus one or more sugar side chains (Francis et al., 2002 a). In a previous experiment a saponin fraction from the <b>soapbark</b> tree (Quillaja saponaria M.) inhibited aromatase in vitro (Golan et al., 2008). The fenugreek plant (Trigonella foenum-graecum L), widely cultivated in the Middle East and Asia, also has a high saponin content. The experiment was therefore conducted to test whether saponin fractions from Q. saponaria and from T. foenum-graecum were able to influence the sex ratio and gonad histology of Nile tilapia...|$|E
40|$|Organic apple {{production}} in Europe depends {{to a great}} extent on the use of copper fungicides for scab control (Venturia inaequalis). The objective of this 6 -year study (2003 - 2008) conducted in Belgium was to determine measures for reducing the use of copper fungicides in organic apple production. The effectiveness of a 'during-infection' spray strategy using wettable sulphur (with or without copper), lime sulphur, potassium bicarbonate, silicon and five natural plant extracts (orange peel, <b>soapbark,</b> tea seed, quinoa seed and grapefruit seed) for controlling primary scab was investigated in a split-plot field experiment. Four apple cultivars that express a gradient of partial scab resistance were included: a high scab-susceptible cultivar (cv. 'Pinova'), a medium scab-susceptible cultivar (cv. 'Pirouette') and two old cultivars expressing low to very low scab susceptibility (cvs. 'Reinette Hernaut' and 'Reinette des Capucins'). Apart from these cultivars, four monogenic Vf scab-resistant cultivars (cvs. 'Initial', 'Topaz', 'Zvatava' and 'JN 20 / 33 / 58 ') were also included in the experimental orchard. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} fungicide required, two strategies were used: a specific spray timing involving spraying during the infection processes, before fungal penetration, determined by the RIMpro software warning system, and a tunnel sprayer machine for optimal treatment applications. Depending on the year, a total of 8 - 12 applications were made annually. Under field conditions that were highly conducive disease, low rates of elemental sulphur (≤ 40 kg. ha- 1 per year) combined with low rates of copper (≤ 2. 1 kg. ha- 1 per year) provided the best scab control and reduced scab severity on the leaves and fruits by 85 - 100 %, depending on the year and cultivar, compared with the untreated control. In most cases, the lime sulphur spray treatment, which used more elemental sulphur but did not use copper, provided a similar level of scab control to the combined wettable sulphur and copper spray treatment. Sulphur, potassium bicarbonate and all plant extracts significantly reduced scab severity on leaves and fruits. In general, the treatments increased the yield of the high and medium scab-susceptible cultivars as well as that of the low and very low scab-susceptible cultivars. Under these experimental conditions, none of the treatments caused phytotoxicity, increased fruit russet or led to undesirable soil and fruit residues at harvest. The potential and limitations of "during-infection" spraying as a protection strategy against apple scab in organic farming are discussed...|$|E
40|$|OPTIMIZING FORESTRY, FARMING AND LIVESTOCK USE OF WASTE MUD THROUGH THE STUDY OF ENZYMATIC SYSTEMS PRODUCED OR INDUCED BY SAPROBIC AND ARBUSCULAR FUNGI Waste from {{sewage water}} {{treatment}} plants, known as mud or biosolids, {{are a good}} source of organic matter with positive effects on physical and chemical conditions of the soil and nutritional conditions of vegetation. Their growing accumulation, however, suggests an appropriate environmental management. In many cases there is a risk of an excess of nutritional elements (nitrogen and phosphorous) and some potentially toxic elements (heavy metals), which in many cases will depend on the origin and content of treated sewage water. This project has researched on potential effects that using these biosolids could have on the development of different vegetable species and on some beneficial microorganisms in the soil. Thus, it was proposed to establish basic guidelines for optimization and reutilization of waste mud for later using them in forestry, farming and livestock systems (recovery of downgraded soils), through the study of enzymatic systems originated or induced by saprobic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizae. Vegetable species used in the various biotests were: Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato), Medicago sativa (Alfalfa), Eucalyptus globulus (Blue Gum) and Quillaja saponaria (<b>Soapbark).</b> The following saprobic fungi were used: Trametes versicolor, Phanerochaete crysosporium, Coriolopsisis rigida, Penicillium chiysogenum and Trichoderma harzianum. In general, waste mud generated restrictive effects to the development of these fungi, mainly due to the high content of nutrients, the low amount of mycelium and the mud’s pH over 13. This led to the conclusion that mycelium amounts must be very high in order to guarantee a significant effect of fungi on the mud, and pH must be maintained fewer than 7. 8 in order {{to be used as a}} growth vector. The production of activity by T. versicolor was clearly stimulated through the addition of some doses of mud, mainly with 4 g of mud extract. The activity of manganesum-dependant peroxidase (MnP) was detected in cultivations of all saprobic fungi. However, such enzymatic activity was negatively affected by the different doses of mud. An exception was observed in C. rigida and P. chrysogenum species, whose MnP production was not affected by the addition of mud and, moreover, a small stimulant effect in the activity was observed when increasing mud doses. Even so, and in spite of the complexity of relevant information, C. rigida and T. harzianum were selected as the fungi that had a better response in optimizing the effects of waste mud (4 g mud) and promoting growth of the tested vegetable species. On the other hand, 6 species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were isolated and phenotypically classified: Glomus intraradices, Glomus constrictum, Glomus viscosum, Glomus deserticola, Glomus claroideum (classification confirmed at a molecular level) and Gigaspora roseae. A significant increase in biomass production, chlorophyll content, enzymatic Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) activities and 13 -glucosidase was observed in most biotests, up to 4 grams of mud applied in any of its fractions. This is benefited in view that the mud extract is incubated with the saprobic fungi species C. rigida and T. harzianum, although more information on the mechanisms through which these fungi favour this mud detoxification needs to be obtained. A relevant aspect is that the plant’s absorption of nitrogen and phosphorous was higher when mud fractions were applied, significantly higher in plants inoculated with G. viscosum. Another aspect that is worth highlighting is that a significant increase in all morphological and biochemical variables evaluated was detected in biotests conducted on <b>soapbark</b> plants inoculated with G. deserticola and G. claroideum. This was confirmed by biotests for application of the mud extracts, where Plant - Symbiont - Waste compatibility was favoured in over 300 %. In conclusion, application of waste mud from sewage water treatment plants, incubated with certain saprobic fungi in tested doses, promotes growth of vegetable species. This increase is greater when such plants are colonized by certain arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. This research baseline allows obtaining the initial knowledge required for a future development of a biological fertilizer from the Plant – Symbiont – Saprobic Fungi – Waste Mud combination, as a basis and optimized biotechnological tool. Forest soils and agricultural soils play a key role in carbon sequestration. For that reason, applying management systems that maximize inputs and minimize outputs of carbon of the system is indispensable. Thus, forestation and reduced till will increase carbon inputs to the soil and will form organic matter (SOM) of different recalcitrance depending on the stability of the components it is made up of. The presence of a glycoprotein in soils has recently been proven. This glycoprotein, called glomalin (GRSP), is originated in fungi of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AMs) and has a high stability due to its resistance to microbial degradation, and has been related to structural stability of soils. Given that this is a protein of fungal origin, any management applied to the soil affecting AMs will affect the amount of glomalin. Although some attempts to identify carbon accumulation in some ecosystems have been conducted in Chile, such studies have not included AMs or glomalin as components of such accumulation. That is why the objective of this project was to study the contents and nature of glomalin produced by AMs, and to determine its effects on carbon accumulation and on the stability of soil aggregates under native forest and in soils with different agricultural managements, especially with No-Till. Results in soils from 4 forest ecosystems show that carbon accumulation in soils under native forest is similar to that obtained in soils under exotic forest, in this case Oregon Pine or Monterey Pine. However, the secondary Nothofagus forest produced an increase in carbon accumulation in soils, especially in the form of glomalin, which proved to be highly stable to degradation through mineralization studies (microbial degradation). Likewise, mass spectromy studies allowed establishing that carbon accumulation (and nitrogen accumulation) in the subsoil is produced through AMs and glomalin production. Water stability of aggregates was higher in soils under native forest than in soils under exotic forest. This is highly significant for erodibility of such soils, although no correlation with glomalin levels was observed. In general, no clear correlation between mycorrhizal parameters (AMs) and the globalin content or stability of soils aggregates was observed. In the wide array of soils from various agroecosystems it was possible to observe that in all of them, carbon accumulation had the following order: C-humins > C-glomalin > C-humic > C-fulvic > C-carbohydrates. Furthermore, it was proved that No-Till improves physical (WHC, hydrophobicity, stability and size of aggregates), chemical (pH) and biological (microbial biomass, AMs seed dispersal, enzymatic activity, glomalin, etc.) parameters in comparison to conventional till with soil breakage, but it seems to be an accumulative effect up to a certain period after which a regression period begins, maybe due to an excessive compacting that makes AMs activities difficult, among other. To sum up, in the wide array of studied soils (both forest and agriculturally suitable) carbon (and nitrogen) accumulation under stable forms such as glomalin is variable; with a higher accumulation in soils with a high content of organic matter and in soils were common till is used. However, as a result of observations conducted it seems to be highly necessary to research on interferences produced in analytically determining glomalin, especially in soils with high SOM content.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to provide {{objective}} and reliable in formation about Chile’s forestry sector and its current and future role in the international forest products industry. The contents should provide a well-rounded view of forestry and associated issues in Chile and would be well suited to someone looking to gain insight on this topic, update their knowledge of the subject, compare Chile to other countries of interest, or begin to understand investment opportunities in Chile. While the document does provide investment information, someone seriously considering investing in Chile would most likely want to undertake a more thorough investigation of issues specifically related to their strategic plan and some appropriate resources for this have been cited. Chile’s favorable soil and climatic conditions allow for a rapid growth rate and production of marketable wood. They have an increasing plantation resource base (mostly radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and Eucalyptus species) and potential to expand their forestland further. Decree Law 701, now refocused from plantations and large landowner support to subsidizing planting and trimming costs for small landowners, has been the major and often criticized piece of forest management legislation since its induction in 1974. Not yet enacted, the “Recovery of the Native Forests and Their Promotion in Forestry” seeks to subsidize native forest management as well. Property rights are more respected for plantations, there is virtually no land tenure for native forest and what ownership does exist is hard to track. Chile’s forest industry has contributed about 3 % of the total GDP over the last 15 years and made up 10 % of all exports in Chile and 2 % of the world trade in forest products. Their primary products consist mainly of roundwood, lumber, fiberboard, particleboard, wood chips, pulp, and newsprint. As the trend moves more toward secondary products such as sawnwood, molding and millwork, and furniture, they strive to strike a balance between the two. Non-timber forest products, such as sweetbriar rose (Rosa eglanteria), <b>soapbark</b> tree (Quillaja saponaria), and boldo (Peumus boldo), while hard to estimate due to the fragmented market, also significantly contribute to exports and may offer alternatives for more sustainable management. Wood pulp producers have made major investments in modern, low-pollution industrial plants and processing technologies to meet European market demand. Chile’s exports focus makes them a reliable trading partner. Chile’s ability to standardize and harmonize with market demand, share market information, adapt to the Argentinean crisis, and obtain more forest products marketing training; Chile’s geographical location in relation to export markets, wood quality, use of natural resource-based exports as major momentum for economic growth, and technology restrictions; and forest-certification coupled with NGO pressure or boycotts are all potential challenges to the industry and important considerations for investors. The major competitive threats regarding Chile are its likelihood of becoming more competitive in international markets as exports increase, increasing production and exports, and low production costs and labor costs relative to competing nations. Opportunities for countries interested in working with Chile include its positioning to resume higher growth, market-oriented economy, well-diversified international trade, well established State institutions, democratic government, and relatively qualified and ethical labor force. The Chilean government provides active encouragement to private sector forest activity and is seeking to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) to capitalize on developing value-added products. The greatest opportunities include investment in sawmills, pulp plants, wood composite panels, and wood preservation. However, there are potential challenges or serious considerations for prospective investors. There is extreme consolidation of the industry. Empresas Compañía Manufacturera de Papeles y Cartones S. A. (CMPC) of Matte Holding and Angelini forestry own 80 % of productive forestland and wield serious political power. There is a relatively small presence of foreign capital compared to the 1980 ’s. Chile’s production base structuring allowed for better positioning of local groups, so foreign investors associated with local groups, but withdrew when profits decreased. Environmental pressures/restrictions and plantation criticism make it increasingly attractive to divert investments to neighboring countries with fewer restrictions. Chile has gained preferred market access to certain countries by participating in free trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, and tentatively with the European Union (EU). It has bilateral trade agreements with the Andean Pact countries, the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) countries, and Central America. It has also received invitations to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Latin American Integration Association (LAIA), and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Chile actively participates in negotiation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), but negotiations between Chile and the United States have been held up mainly due to the U. S. ’s hesitation to address sensitive agricultural issues...|$|E
