There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects and approaches the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, and stronger light causes no increase in the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma swivels towards a movement up to 75cm away and approaches targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in time to catch it.|$|E

The river crested at 54.35feet (16.6m) on April 21 and the river level would not fall below 49feet (14.9m) until April 26. The flood reached higher levels than the prior most severe flood in 1826.

5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E

25|$|Once in {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium {{are much}} simpler {{and easier to}} understand than are systems which are not in equilibrium.

Dermatophytes digest the hair cuticle rapidly, unlike A.fulvescens, which breaks the cuticle down <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> that the scales are still visible for weeks after the hair has been infected.|$|E

25|$|When rocks melt, they do <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> and {{gradually}} because most rocks {{are made of}} several minerals, which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex.

Under pressure within the earth, {{as little as a}} fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source.|$|E

25|$|Except for {{a system}} {{undergoing}} a first-order phase change such as the melting of ice, as a closed system receives heat, without change in its volume and without change in external force fields acting on it, its temperature rises. For a system undergoing such a phase change <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> that {{departure from thermodynamic equilibrium}} can be neglected, its temperature remains constant as the system is supplied with latent heat. Conversely, a loss of heat from a closed system, without phase change, without change of volume, and without change in external force fields acting on it, decreases its temperature.|$|E

Nevertheless, the system's horse-drawn trams were in use until 1895, and the last steam-powered cars ran until 1904, when a diesel electric station, on the so-called Dachnaya (Dachna) to Puschya-Vodytsia line was built. This station had lasted until the 1930s.

25|$|The Indian {{team was}} led by off spinner Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan and {{included}} leading batsmen Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Vishwanath, and Farokh Engineer as well as Venkataraghavan's teammate from the Indian spin quartet, Bishen Singh Bedi. The team was relatively inexperienced at one-day cricket, having played their first ODI only a year earlier during their disastrous tour of England. India's first match, the first match of the Cup, was against England at Lord's in London. This match became notorious for Gavaskar's controversial knock. Chasing a mammoth 335 for victory, Gavaskar carried his bat for the entire 60 overs to score only 36 runs off 174 balls with just a solitary boundary. As a result, India could only score 132/3 in 60 overs, losing the match by 202 runs, which severely affected their chances of making the semifinals. The match was a national disgrace for India with Gavaskar, in particular, castigated from all sides for his disgraceful innings. Even today, it is not fully clear {{as to why he}} played <b>so</b> <b>slowly</b> in that match, although Gavaskar claimed that he was out of form at the time.|$|E
25|$|The British {{printing}} of 500 copies sold fewer than 300 {{within the first}} four months.

Harper's first printing was 2,915 copies, including the standard 125 review copies. The selling price was $1.50, {{about a fifth of}} the price of the British three-volume edition. About 1,500 copies were sold within 11 days, and then sales slowed down to less than 300 the next year.
