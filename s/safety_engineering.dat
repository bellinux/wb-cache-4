25|$|Computer control {{eliminates}} errors {{from human}} drivers, so PRT designs {{in a controlled}} environment should be much safer than private motoring on roads. Most designs enclose the running gear in the guideway to prevent derailments. Grade-separated guideways would prevent conflict with pedestrians or manually controlled vehicles. Other public transit <b>safety</b> <b>engineering</b> approaches, such as redundancy and self-diagnosis of critical systems, are also included in designs.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{measures}} on the roadmap is to implement higher safety standards like early leak detection with hydrogen sensors. The Canadian Hydrogen Safety Program concluded that hydrogen fueling is as safe as, or safer than, compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling. The European Commission has funded the first higher educational program {{in the world in}} hydrogen <b>safety</b> <b>engineering</b> at the University of Ulster. It is expected that the general public {{will be able to use}} hydrogen technologies in everyday life with at least the same level of safety and comfort as with today's fossil fuels.|$|E

25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure {{it is just as}} much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering. Reliability {{engineering is}} always a critical component of <b>safety</b> <b>engineering,</b> as in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and hazard fault tree analysis, and of security engineering.|$|E
25|$|In human spaceflight, {{the life}} support system {{is a group of}} devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space. NASA often uses the phrase Environmental Control and Life Support System or the acronym ECLSS when {{describing}} these systems for its human spaceflight missions. The {{life support system}} may supply: air, water and food. It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life support system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using <b>safety</b> <b>engineering</b> techniques.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of methods}} that allow early {{detection}} of possible failures, in <b>safety</b> <b>engineering,</b> are integrated into the design process. At the same time, decisions made {{at the beginning of}} a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived. However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering. Examples include soft systems methodology, Jay Wright Forrester's System dynamics method, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)—all currently being explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, Ford's Environmental and <b>Safety</b> <b>Engineering</b> {{division}} {{developed a}} cost-benefit analysis entitled Fatalities Associated with Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires for submission to the NHTSA {{in support of}} Ford's objection to proposed stronger fuel system regulation. The document {{became known as the}} [...] "Pinto Memo". [...] Cost-benefit analysis was one tool used in the evaluation of safety design decisions accepted by the industry and the NHTSA. The analysis compared the cost of repairs to the societal costs for injuries and deaths related to fires in cases of vehicle rollovers for all cars sold in the US by all manufacturers. [...] The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972. [...] In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million. [...] The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a cost to society of $49.5 million.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Asif Usmani, Professor of Structural Engineering at University of Edinburgh, {{published}} a paper with two colleagues. They provisionally concluded the fires alone, without any {{damage from the}} airplanes, could {{have been enough to}} bring down the buildings. In their view, the towers were uniquely vulnerable to the effects of large fires on several floors at the same time. When the NIST report was published, Barbara Lane, with the UK engineering firm Arup, criticized its conclusion that the loss of fire proofing was a necessary factor in causing the collapses; [...] "We have carried out computer simulations which show that the towers would have collapsed after a major fire on three floors at once, even with fireproofing in place and without any damage from plane impact."
