Such an assumption results in a linear stochastic equation for the <b>subfilter</b> scales, which can be numerically solved by a decomposition of the <b>subfilter</b> scales into localized wave packets. The wave packets are randomly produced by the smallest of the resolved scales. They are further transported by the resolved-scale velocity and they have wavenumbers and amplitudes which evolve according to the resolved strain. Performance of our model is compared with direct numerical simulations of decaying and forced turbulence. For the same resolution, numerical simulations using our model allow for a significant reduction of the computational time (of the order of 100 in the case we consider), and allow to achieve of significantly larger Reynolds number than the direct method.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of nonpremixed turbulent combustion using large eddy simulation(LES) requires detailed modeling of the mixing between fuel and oxidizer at scales finer than the LES filter resolution. In conserved scalar combustion models, the small scale mixing process is quantified by two parameters, the <b>subfilter</b> scalar variance and the <b>subfilter</b> scalar dissipation rate. The {{most commonly used}} models for these quantities assume a local equilibrium exists between production and dissipation of variance. Such an assumption has limited validity in realistic, technically relevant flow configurations. However, nonequilibrium models for variance and dissipation rate typically contain a model coefficient whose optimal value is unknown a priori for a given simulation. Furthermore, conventional dynamic procedures are not useful for estimating {{the value of this}} coefficient. In this work, an alternative dynamic procedure based on the transport equation for <b>subfilter</b> scalar variance is presented, along with a robust conditional averaging approach for evaluation of themodel coefficient. This dynamic nonequilibrium modeling approach is used for simulation of a turbulent lifted ethylene flame, previously studied using DNS by Yoo et al. (Proc. Comb. Inst., 2011). The predictions of the new model are compared to those of a static nonequilibrium modeling approach using an assumed model coefficient, {{as well as those of}} the equilibrium modeling appoach. The equilibrium models are found to systematically underpredict both <b>subfilter</b> scalar variance and dissipation rate. Use of the dynamic procedure is shown to increase the accuracy of the nonequilibrium modeling approach. However, numerical errors that arise as a consequence of grid-based implicit filtering appear to degrade the accuracy of all three modeling options. Thus, while these results confirm the usefulness of the new dynamic model, they also show that the quality of <b>subfilter</b> model predictions depends on several factors extrinsic to the formulation of the <b>subfilter</b> model itself...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the outline of a Large Eddy Simulation subgrid model for liquid/gas phase {{interface}} dynamics. A key feature of the proposed model is to take the subgrid phase interface dynamics fully into account by employing a dual-scale approach. Instead of modeling the LES subgrid phase interface geometry, we fully resolve it on an auxillary grid using the Refined Level Set Grid approach (Herrmann 2008). We then propose to model the LES subgrid velocity on the auxillary grid needed to move the fully resolved phase interface, by solving a dedicated PDE for its evolution near the phase interface. This PDE contains three different contributions. First, the <b>subfilter</b> turbulent eddies are taken into account by modeling the <b>subfilter</b> acceleration in lines of Oboukhovs log-normality conjecture on the stochastic field of ε.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{investigated}} whether the Flame Surface Density (FSD) model, developed for turbulent premixed combustion, is also applicable to stratified flames. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent stratified Bunsen flames {{have been carried}} out, using the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) reduction method for reaction kinetics. Before examining the suitability of the FSD model, flame surfaces are characterized in terms of thickness, curvature and stratification. All flames are in the Thin Reaction Zones regime, and the maximum equivalence ratio range covers 0. 11. 3. For all flames, local flame thicknesses correspond very well to those observed in stretchless, steady premixed flamelets. Extracted curvature radii and mixing length scales are significantly larger than the flame thickness, implying that the stratified flames all burn in a premixed mode. The remaining challenge is accounting for the large variation in (<b>subfilter)</b> mass burning rate. In this contribution, the FSD model is proven to be applicable for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of stratified flames for the equivalence ratio range 0. 11. 3. <b>Subfilter</b> mass burning rate variations {{are taken into account}} by a <b>subfilter</b> Probability Density Function (PDF) for the mixture fraction, on which the mass burning rate directly depends. A priori analysis point out that for small stratifications (0. 41. 0), the replacement of the <b>subfilter</b> PDF (obtained from DNS data) by the corresponding Dirac function is appropriate. Integration of the Dirac function with the mass burning rate m=m(), can then adequately model the filtered mass burning rate obtained from filtered DNS data. For a larger stratification (0. 11. 3), and filter widths up to ten flame thicknesses, a ß-function for the <b>subfilter</b> PDF yields substantially better predictions than a Dirac function. Finally, inclusion of a simple algebraic model for the FSD resulted only in small additional deviations from DNS data, thereby rendering this approach promising for application in LES...|$|E
