40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{front light}} system (AFS) is {{put forward by}} the Society of Automotive Engineers and Economic Commission for Europe {{as a means of}} enhancing vehicular lighting. Traditionally, AFS can be divided into three parts: (1) a leveling subsystem to make lighting parallel to the road surface; (2) a swiveling subsystem to change light distribution along with the angle of the steering wheel; (3) a dimming subsystem to reduce or intensify the lighting. In this paper, a new hybrid multi-sensor fusion framework combining Kalman Filter with neural network is proposed to adjust two stepper motors controlling the vehicles headlights pitch and yaw. Kalman Filter as the frontend is used to deal with redundant sensor signals that are collected from sensors in the different places. Fuzzy Neutral Network as the backend is used to generate adjustment of leveling and <b>swiveling</b> <b>angle</b> through the integration of different type signals. An adaptive parameter adjustment is accomplished by the proposed fusion framework with the varying filter coefficients. The simulation and experiment of leveling angle are conducted using the predefined experimental data. The evaluation results of leveling angle prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively filter out high-frequency perturbations and provide reliable outputs for stepper motor. The same results can be obtained for a swiveling subsystem. Consequently, the hybrid fusion framework is a feasible approach for AFS design to accomplish data processing and nonlinear mapping.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{mathematical}} model is developed in order to describe {{the dynamics of the}} variable geometric volume swash plate axial piston pumps with the conical cylinder blocks and the integrated control unit. Using the validated model, an analytical study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the port plate configuration on pump performance. Simulation of the change in the cylinder pressure and pump flow rate, in a systematic sequential procedure, led to an improved geometry for the suction and delivery silencing grooves on the valve plate. Cavitaion in the cylinder and pump noise were also reduced with the improved geometry. Force and vibration analysis of the pumping mechanism were carried out. This analysis presents some design recommendations regarding the moments acting on the swash plate, dynamic loads acting on the drive shaft bearings and the advantages and the limitations of using the conical arrangement of the pistons. Pump performance is simulated using a conventional PD controller with double negative feedback loop to control the swash plate <b>swiveling</b> <b>angle,</b> as currently used in practical applications. An introductory study of implementing other control schemes is conducted. A fuzzy controller is proposed to replace the PD controller in a double feedback control loop in order to improve the robustness of the control action. A single feedback control loop is proposed to replace the double control loop in order to suppress the steady state vibration of the swash plate. The control schemes were prototyped using specially developed real-time control techniques on a personal computer. The experimental setup is also used to verify the analytical findings of the pump performance with the newly proposed control schemes...|$|E
50|$|Eyesight is a {{particular}} characteristic of the owl that aids in nocturnal prey capture. Owls {{are part of a}} small group of birds that live nocturnally, but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight in low-light situations. Owls are known for their disproportionally large eyes in comparison to their skulls. An apparent consequence of the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape. This shape is found in other so-called nocturnal eyes, such as the eyes of strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes. Since the eyes are fixed into these sclerotic tubes, they are unable to move the eyes in any direction. Instead of moving their eyes, owls swivel their heads to view their surroundings. Owls' heads are capable of <b>swiveling</b> through an <b>angle</b> of roughly 270Â°, easily enabling them to see behind them without relocating the torso. This ability keeps bodily movement at a minimum, thus reduces the amount of sound the owl makes as it waits for its prey. Owls are regarded as having the most frontally placed eyes among all avian groups, which gives them some of the largest binocular fields of vision. However, owls are farsighted and cannot focus on objects within a few centimeters of their eyes. While owls are commonly believed to have great nocturnal vision due to their large (thus very light-gathering) eyes and pupils and/or extremely sensitive rod receptors, the true cause for their ability to see in the night is due to neural mechanisms which mediate the extraction of spatial information gathered from the retinal image throughout the nocturnal luminance range. These mechanisms are only able to function due to the large-sized retinal image. Thus, the primary nocturnal function in the vision of the owl is due to its large posterior nodal distance; retinal image brightness is only maximized to the owl within secondary neural functions. These attributes of the owl cause its nocturnal eyesight to be far superior to that of its average prey..|$|R
