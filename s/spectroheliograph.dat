50|$|The Kenwood Astrophysical Observatory was the {{personal}} observatory of George Ellery Hale, constructed by his father, William E. Hale, in 1890 {{at the family}} home in the Kenwood section of Chicago. It was here that the <b>spectroheliograph,</b> which Hale had invented while attending MIT, was first put to practical use; and {{it was here that}} Hale established the Astrophysical Journal. Kenwood's principal instrument was a twelve-inch refractor, which was used in conjunction with a Rowland grating as part of the <b>spectroheliograph.</b> Hale hired Ferdinand Ellerman as an assistant; years later, the two would work together again at the Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5000|$|Hale {{was educated}} at MIT, at the Harvard College Observatory, (1889-90), and at Berlin (1893-94). As an {{undergraduate}} at MIT, {{he is known}} for inventing the <b>spectroheliograph,</b> with which he made his discovery of solar vortices. In 1908, he used the Zeeman effect with a modified <b>spectroheliograph</b> to establish that sunspots were magnetic. [...] Subsequent work demonstrated a strong tendency for east-west alignment of magnetic polarities in sunspots, with mirror symmetry across the solar equator; and that the polarity in each hemisphere switched orientation from one sunspot cycle to the next. This systematic property of sunspot magnetic fields is now {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Hale-Nicholson law," [...] or in many cases simply [...] "Hale's law." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>spectroheliograph</b> is an {{instrument}} used in astronomy which captures a photographic {{image of the}} Sun at a single wavelength of light, a monochromatic image.

50|$|In 1932, Robert {{extended}} the functionality of the <b>spectroheliograph</b> {{so that it}} could record motion pictures of the sun. This machine is known as a spectroheliokinematograph; with it, he took astonishing moving pictures of solar storms, showing features on the sun's surface that lasted from seconds to days.|$|E
5000|$|American {{astronomer}} George Ellery Hale, as an MIT undergraduate, {{invented the}} <b>spectroheliograph,</b> {{with which he}} made the discovery of solar vortices. In 1908, Hale used a modified <b>spectroheliograph</b> {{to show that the}} spectra of hydrogen exhibited the Zeeman effect whenever the area of view passed over a sunspot on the solar disc. This was the first indication that sunspots were basically magnetic phenomena, which appeared in opposite polarity pairs. Hale's subsequent work demonstrated a strong tendency for east-west alignment of magnetic polarities in sunspots, with mirror symmetry across the solar equator; and that the magnetic polarity for sunspots in each hemisphere switched orientation from one solar cycle to the next. This systematic property of sunspot magnetic fields is now commonly referred to as the [...] "Hale-Nicholson law", or in many cases simply [...] "Hale's laws".|$|E

50|$|At Stanford Professor Bracewell {{constructed}} a microwave <b>spectroheliograph</b> (1961), {{a large and}} complex radio telescope which produced daily temperature maps of the sun reliably for eleven years, the duration of a solar cycle. The first radio telescope to give output automatically in printed form, and therefore capable of worldwide dissemination by teleprinter, its daily solar weather maps received acknowledgement from NASA for support of the first manned landing on the moon.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{fundamental}} {{papers on}} restoration (1954-1962), interferometry (1958-1974) and reconstruction (1956-1961) appeared along with instrumental and observational papers. By 1961 the radio-interferometer calibration techniques {{developed for the}} <b>spectroheliograph</b> first allowed an antenna system, with 52" [...] fan beam, to equal the angular resolution of the human eye in one observation. With this beam the components of Cygnus A, spaced 100", were put directly in evidence {{without the need for}} repeated observations with variable spacing aperture synthesis interferometry.|$|E
50|$|Twin spectroheliographs giving 6 cm {{diameter}} full disc {{photographs of}} the sun in K-alpha and H-alpha spectral lines are in regular use. A 46 cm diameter Foucault siderostat feeds light to a 30 cm aperture f/22, Cooke triplet lens. The two prism K-alpha spectroheliographs were acquired in 1904 and the H-alpha diffraction grating <b>spectroheliograph</b> was operational in 1911. Since 1912, prominent pictures over the full limb are being obtained in K by blocking the solar disc. These observations and the white light pictures are obtained around 200 days a year.|$|E
50|$|In 1868, Pierre Janssen's solar {{observations}} {{had led him}} {{to report}} to the Académie des Sciences that It is no longer geometry and mechanics which dominate astronomy but physics and chemistry. Such advice was sternly rejected by director of the Paris Observatory Urbain Le Verrier and the French government awarded Janssen a grant to establish an astrophysical observatory at Meudon on the outskirts of Paris with Janssen as the sole astronomer. In 1889, Le Verrier was succeeded by Amédée Mouchez who set to work to bring astrophysics into the mainstream by hiring Deslandres. Deslandres developed the <b>spectroheliograph</b> simultaneously with George Hale.|$|E
50|$|Arthur Bertram Cuthbert Walker Jr. (August 24, 1936 - April 29, 2001) was a solar {{physicist}} and {{a pioneer of}} EUV/XUV optics. He is most noted for having developed normal incidence multilayer XUV telescopes to photograph the solar corona. Two of his sounding rocket payloads, the Stanford/MSFC Rocket <b>Spectroheliograph</b> Experiment and the Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array, recorded the first full-disk, high-resolution images of the Sun in XUV with conventional geometries of normal incidence optics; this technology is now used in solar telescopes such as SOHO/EIT and TRACE, and in the fabrication of microchips via ultraviolet photolithography.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{spectral}} images contain {{only a few}} image {{planes of}} a spectral data cube, while others are better thought of as full spectra at every location in the image. For example, solar physicists use the <b>spectroheliograph</b> to make images of the Sun built up by scanning the slit of a spectrograph, to study the behavior of surface features on the Sun; such a spectroheliogram may have a spectral resolution of over 100,000 (...) and be used to measure local motion (via the Doppler shift) and even the magnetic field (via the Zeeman splitting or Hanle effect) at each location in the image plane. The multispectral images collected by the Opportunity rover, in contrast, have only four wavelength bands and hence are {{only a little more}} than 3-color images.|$|E
50|$|Dr. George Ellery Hale and Dr. Henri Deslandres both {{developed}} the spectroheliograph—independently—to study the Sun in different wavelengths of light related to specific atoms. Dr. Robert R. McMath of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory used a <b>spectroheliograph</b> to make time-lapse {{films of the}} prominences on the Sun. Using pictures from the Mount Wilson Observatory, and others, scientists have learned about sunspots first described by Galileo. Sunspots often appear in pairs and are about 7,000 degrees rather than the normal 10,000 degrees. The spots increase and decrease in a cycle of about 11.2 years. Studying sunspots has shown the equator rotates faster than the poles at around 25 and 1/3 days per rotation. Halfway between the equator and the poles takes about 27 and 1/2 days per rotation though nobody understands why.|$|E
5000|$|Evershed {{was born}} in Gomshall, Surrey to John and Sophia (née Price) Evershed. [...] He made the {{discovery}} which bears his name while at Kodaikanal Observatory in 1909. After retirement in 1923 {{he set up a}} private observatory at Ewhurst, Surrey and built a large <b>spectroheliograph</b> of special design and another with high-dispersion liquid prism. He continued to study the wave-lengths of H and K lines in prominences, giving values of the solar rotation at high levels in different latitudes and at different phases of the solar cycle. Work continued until 1950 when the observatory closed and he presented some of his instruments to the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux. He was a founder member of the British Astronomical Association. He directed its Solar Spectroscopy Section (1893-1899) and Spectroscopic Section (1924-1926).|$|E
50|$|MSSTA and {{its sister}} rocket, NIXT, were prototypes for normal {{incidence}} EUV imaging telescopes {{that are in}} use today, such as the EIT instrument aboard the SOHO spacecraft, and the TRACE spacecraft. MSSTA flew three times: once in 1991 (NASA Sounding Rocket flight 36.049), once in 1994 (flight 36.091), and once in 2002 (flight 36.194). While Dr. Walker's 1991 telescope {{was the first in}} the series to carry the MSSTA moniker, the precursor to the MSSTA, the Stanford/MSFC Rocket <b>Spectroheliograph</b> (NASA Sounding Rocket flight 27.092), which carried two EUV telescopes in 1987, was the first mission to successfully obtain high-resolution, full-disk solar images utilizing normal incidence EUV optics. The MSSTA I flown in 1991 carried 14 telescopes; the MSSTA II flown in 1994 carried 19 telescopes; and the MSSTA III flown in 2002 carried 11 telescopes.|$|E
40|$|Ken M. Harrison's {{latest book}} is a {{complete}} guide for amateur astronomers who want to obtain detailed narrowband images of the Sun using a digital <b>spectroheliograph</b> (SHG). The SHG allows the safe imaging of the Sun without the expense of commercial ‘etalon’ solar filters. As the supporting software continues to be refined, {{the use of the}} digital <b>spectroheliograph</b> will become more and more mainstream and has the potential to replace the expensive solar filters currently in use.  The early chapters briefly explain the concept of the SHG and how it can produce an image from the solar spectrum. A comparison of the currently available narrow band solar filters is followed by a detailed analysis of the critical design, construction and assembly features of the SHG. The design and optimum layout of the instrument is discussed to allow evaluation of performance. This information explains how to assemble a fully functional SHG using readily available components. The software required to process the images is explained and step by step examples provided, with various digital instruments around the world highlighted based on input from many experienced amateurs who have shared their experience in building and using their spectroheliographs.  The final chapters provide a historical overview of the traditional <b>spectroheliograph</b> and the later spectrohelioscope, from the initial G. E. Hale and Deslandres concepts of the 1890 ’s through to the later work by Veio and others. The construction and performance of various instruments is covered in detail, and provides a unique opportunity to record and appreciate the groundbreaking researches carried out by amateurs in the 20 th century.  This is an absolutely up to date book which fully addresses the watershed, game changing influence of the digital imaging revolution on the traditional <b>spectroheliograph...</b>|$|E
40|$|A <b>spectroheliograph</b> {{dedicated}} to the observation of the solar disk in the extreme-ultraviolet OV spectral line at 62. 97 nm is described. As demonstrated in the Skylab SO- 82 A <b>spectroheliograph</b> [Appl. Opt. 16, 870 (1977) ], this line is uniquely suited to characterize solar plasma in the important 250, 000 K temperature regime. No multilayer coating or suitable filter is yet available to select this wavelength, so an optical design based on a double spectrograph with a spatial filter to remove the unwanted radiation has been developed. Analysis of the optical design shows that this instrument can obtain a 1 arcsec spatial resolution (two pixels) with a relatively high image-acquisition cadence. A preliminary tolerance analysis has been performed. A simple method of instrument alignment in visible light is also described. © 2005 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
