40|$|AbstractInformation {{is one of}} the key {{sources of}} {{organizational}} value. As information carriers, documents, in some form, store the majority of business information. With the widespread introduction of social software in companies, much information is now created in social applications; leading social content to become one of the fastest growing content types. As with other content types, social content must be managed in order to realize its value and to minimize information risks. However, there is a lack of understanding about what <b>social</b> <b>documents</b> really are, what distinguishes them, and how they should be differentiated from other social content. Therefore this study examines <b>social</b> business <b>documents</b> by differentiating between social content and <b>social</b> <b>documents</b> and analyzes the characteristics of <b>social</b> <b>documents.</b> From this a working definition of <b>social</b> business <b>documents</b> is developed and challenges for their management are outlined...|$|R

Peary Chand Mitra wrote about him, “There are few persons in whom the milk of {{kindness}} flows so abundantly. He was never wanting in appreciation of what was right, and in his sympathy with the advanced principles.” Sivanath Sastri’s Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Bangasamaj, published in 1903, was not only his biography but also an overview of Bengali society of the era, “a remarkable <b>social</b> <b>document</b> on {{the period of the}} Bengal Renaissance.” [...] It is still widely read and used as reference material for the period. An English version , edited by Sir Roper Lethbridge, was published in London in 1907.|$|E

It is regarded not merely as a remarkable <b>social</b> <b>document</b> of significance, but as a creation which, while of the most modern realism, is yet classic in its pronounced art and exalted philosophy. The play shows the types of the strongest men as victims of comical events and of weaker men. It will be produced in America, where, on account of its realistic treatment of the subject of labor union, it {{is sure to be}} a sensation."--Special cable dispatch to N.Y. Times.|$|E

Whatever [...] "abuses, corruptions [...] and enormities" [...] may have been rife in the city of Dublin in Swift's [...] time, the pamphlet which follows certainly throws no light on them. [...] It is in no sense a <b>social</b> <b>document.</b> But it is a very amusing and [...] excellent piece of jeering at the fancied apprehensions that were [...] rife about the Pretender, the [...] "disaffected" [...] people, and the [...] Jacobites.

At the same [...] time, these cries had their effects, and created a great deal of [...] mischief. The Roman Catholics, in particular, were cruelly treated [...] because of the anxiety for the Protestant succession, and among the [...] lower tradesmen, for whom such cries would be of serious meaning, a [...] petty persecution against their Roman Catholic fellow-tradesmen [...] continually prevailed.

40|$|<b>Social</b> {{business}} <b>documents</b> {{are currently}} {{one of the}} fastest growing content types within organizations. As carriers of important business information they require systematic management to ensure their content is available, accurate and protected over the long-term. To achieve this requires a deep understanding of their structure, nature and use. In this paper we present the findings of a preliminary study of <b>social</b> business <b>documents.</b> The aim of the study is to understand how <b>social</b> business <b>documents</b> are structured and to identify the issues and challenges that surround their management. Through an analysis of <b>social</b> business <b>documents</b> in four different systems we identify and compare their structural components from a user perspective. From this cross document/cross system analysis we develop a conceptual model for <b>social</b> business <b>documents</b> and identify issues for their long-term management. Our findings also identify the need for more in-depth modeling for which we propose methods to assist in understanding the syntactic and semantic structure of <b>social</b> business <b>documents</b> and how these change over the life of a <b>social</b> business <b>document...</b>|$|R

The main exceptions to this was the economic migration to the USA in the early 1900s and the relative prosperity of the 1960's and 1970's. The regular occurrence of war mainly destroyed whatever <b>social</b> <b>documents</b> existed between wars. What documentation has been found so far typically provides small snippets of tangential information and includes Austro-Hungarian army history and records (18th to 20th century), 19th century and early 20th century ecclesiastical and population surveys and Ellis island related information (1900 to 1920).

This essay regards people who need help with care or people who need help with an addiction. This essay is a qualitative text analysis, which aims to see whether, and if so how, help-seekers are constructed in 40 <b>social</b> service <b>documents</b> within a municipality in central Sweden. We have endeavored to illustrate the power that the written word possesses and which categories of people are constructed depending on the language and content of the <b>social</b> <b>documents.</b> With our theoretical starting point, which was marginalization and social constructivism we want to illustrate the administrators’ choice of content and language in the <b>social</b> service <b>documents.</b> The main result is that help-seekers in the addiction unit have to give more information about themselves. Addiction is a deviate behavior and therefore more information is needed in order for them to be accepted as opposed to help-seekers in the care unit, where information regarding the help-seeker is in relation to the means of the help-seekers needs...|$|R
