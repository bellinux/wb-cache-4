5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Providence {{was one of}} the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest {{industrial}} manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, <b>screws,</b> <b>and</b> textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of the Loom textile company.|$|E

5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E

However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head <b>screws,</b> <b>and</b> the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|E
5|$|Chris Candido was an American {{professional}} wrestler who wrestled for TNA {{starting in}} 2005. At TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April24, 2005, Candido teamed with Lance Hoyt to face Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match. During the encounter, Candido suffered an injury which was later diagnosed as a dislocated ankle, broken tibia, {{and a broken}} fibula which required surgery. Candido had an operation on April25 to have a plate, <b>screws,</b> <b>and</b> pins placed in his ankle {{to fix the problem}} with him being sidelined from competing for two to three months in order to heal. However, Candido hoped to be fully recovered in six to eight weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed, where he died a short time later. The cause of death was released by Candido's brother Johnny as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium <b>screws,</b> <b>and</b> the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

5|$|Besides Chris Candido {{suffering}} a leg injury during his tag team match, Abyss also suffered a dislocated shoulder during {{the main event}} against A.J. Styles. Abyss' injury was taken care of backstage after the event, but Candido {{was diagnosed with a}} dislocated ankle, broken tibia, and a broken fibula that required surgery. Candido had an operation on April 25 to have a plate, <b>screws,</b> <b>and</b> pins placed in his ankle to fix the problem. Candido was reported to be sidelined for 2 to 3 months. According to reports, Candido suffered the injury from taking a dropkick by Sonny Siaki and landing on his leg improperly. After the surgery, he hoped to be recovered in 6 to 8 weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed where he died a short time later. Cause of death was released by his brother Johnny afterwards as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior. TNA released a public statement on April29 regarding the subject. TNA paid tribute to Candido on the April29 episode of Impact! as well as at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event. The April29 episode of Impact! opened and ended with a memorial to Candido. At Hard Justice, a ten-bell salute was held while a photo of Candido, a pair of boots, and one-half of the NWA World Tag Team Championship positioned on a steel chair sat in the center of the ring. In TNA's 50 Greatest Moments DVD, Candido's aiding The Naturals to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship was listed as number 10. A portion of the Lockdown DVD sale profits were donated by TNA to the Chris Candido Memorial Fund. TNA originally planned to remove Candido's match from the DVD, but were given the blessing of his family to include it on the publication. A tribute to Candido was included on the DVD by TNA.|$|E
