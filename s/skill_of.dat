He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League.

Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France.

The findings of the study suggest that:  There is {{a relationship between the}} perception of the pupils and the perception of the teachers on the cooperative <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> the pupils;  There is no relationship between the perception of the pupils on their cooperative skills and their actual cooperative skills;  There is no relationship between the perception of the teachers and the actual cooperative <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> the pupil;  Teachers believe especially communicative skills are necessary for effective cooperative learning. The findings indicate that there is a mismatch between the perception of pupils and teachers and the actual cooperative skills. Therefore it is desirable in research and in education to draw more attention to the perception on cooperative skills.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Bachelor's {{thesis is}} to analyse the speech-language <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> a hearing-impaired boy. The thesis {{includes}} several language-based tasks. On {{the basis of the}} collected results, I compared the speech-language <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> the hearing-impaired boy with the speech-language <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> his peers with normal hearing. The language segment includes four tasks which cover the fields of articulation, semantics, morphology and syntax. The articulation task was based on the articulation of sounds (consonants) of the Slovene literary language alphabet. The field of semantics was checked with tasks requiring formation of nouns, words from the same word group, synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms. The morphology tasks were based on determining prepositions, forming adjectives and verbs and finding odd words. The obtained results have proved that the speech-language <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> the hearing-impaired boy did not differ in a statistically significant manner from the speech-language <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> his peers with normal hearing. While the articulation <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> the hearing-impaired boy differed in a statistically significant manner from the articulation <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> his peers with normal hearing, the differences in the fields of semantics, morphology and syntax were not statistically significant. On the contrary – the hearing-impaired boy achieved better than average results in these three fields in comparison with his peers with normal hearing. This confirms that the speech-language development of the hearing-impaired boy does not deviate from the speech-language development of his peers with normal hearing. ...|$|R
5|$|In his five-volume {{analysis}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, Ramsay Weston Phipps speculated on why Moreau gained renown by the supposed <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> his retreat. Phipps suggested {{that it was not}} skillful for Moreau to allow the inferior columns of Latour, Nauendorf and Fröhlich to herd him back to France. Even during his advance Moreau was irresolute. Jean-de-Dieu Soult, who participated in the campaign as an infantry brigadier, noted that Jourdan made many errors but the French government's errors were worse. The French were unable to pay for supplies because their currency was worthless, so the soldiers stole everything. This ruined discipline and turned the local populations against the French. Jourdan seemed to have an unwarranted faith in Moreau's promise to follow Charles. His decision to give battle at Würzburg was partly done so as not to leave Moreau in the lurch.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs {{need to be able}} to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E
