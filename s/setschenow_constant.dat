40|$|The {{effect of}} various hydrotropes such as sodium benzoate, sodium {{salicylate}} and nicotinamide on the solubility and mass transfer coefficient of p -nitrobenzoic acid was investigated. The solubility studies {{were carried out}} under a wide range of hydrotrope concentrations 0 to 3. 0 kmol m - 3 and different system temperatures (303 - 333 K). It has been observed that the solubility and mass transfer coefficient of p -nitrobenzoic acid increases with increase in hydrotorpe concentration and also with system temperature. The maximum enhancement factor, which is the ratio of the value in the presence and absence of a hydrotrope, has been determined for all sets of experimentations. The effectiveness of hydrotropes was measured in terms of <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constant</b> K s and reported for all hydrotropes used in this study...|$|E
40|$|The aqueous {{solubilities}} of m/p-aminoacetophenone {{in different}} concentrations (0 - 3. 0 mol/L) of hydrotropes such as diethyl nicotinamide, sodium pseudocumene sulfonate and sodium thiocyanate solutions at different system temperatures (303 K to 333 K) were studied. The percentage extraction (%E) of m- aminoacetophenone from m/p-aminoacetophenone mixture increases with increase in hydrotrope concentration. A Minimum Hydrotrope Concentration (MHC) in the aqueous phase {{was required to}} initiate {{the significance of the}} %E of m-aminoacetophenone. Percentage extraction (%E) is the ratio of moles of m-aminoacetophenone extracted in presence and absence of a hydrotrope. The sensitivity and feasibility of the proposed process are examined by carrying out solubilization and equilibrium precipitation experiments with the mixtures of various compositions. The effectiveness of hydrotropes was measured in terms of <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constant</b> Ks. The extraction data are also fitted in a polynomial equation as the function of hydrotrope concentration. The solubilized material can be recovered by dilution with water...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{importance}} of sediment resuspension on the sediment bed-to-water column transport of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in the lower Hudson Estuary, the following areas of research were pursued: 1) a passive, in situ sampler, a polyethylene device (PED), for measuring HOCs in the aquatic environment was developed; 2) the desorption rate of pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), from native Hudson River sediments was measured, and 3) pyrene and 2, 2 ', 5, 5 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB # 52), a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), concentrations were measured in the lower Hudson Estuary so that the input of these chemicals {{as a result of}} sediment resuspension could be compared to modeling expectations and the contribution of sediment resuspension to these chemicals' cycling could be quantified. The use of a new passive, in situ sampler, a polyethylene device (PED), for measuring hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in the aquatic environment was demonstrated. Like semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME), PEDs passively measure the concentration of chemical present in the dissolved phase. PEDs provide for in situ, time-averaged measurements with fast equilibration times (on the order of days) and simple laboratory extraction. Polyethylene-water equilibrium partitioning constants (KpEws) and polyethylene diffusivity coefficients (DPEs) were measured in the laboratory so that dissolved concentrations could be calculated subsequent to PED extraction. (cont.) KPEWs for eleven PAHs and PCBs were found to correlate closely with octanol-water equilibrium partitioning constants (Kows; log KPEW = 1. 1 log Kow- 0. 45, R 2 = 0. 85). Temperature and salinity dependence of KPEW for the chemical of interest can be predicted with that chemical's excess enthalpy of solution and <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constant,</b> respectively. DpEs for several HOCs were measured in the laboratory so that the time for equilibrium uptake in the field could be predicted. PEDs allowed for quick, in situ, time-averaged measurements of phenanthrene and pyrene at pM concentrations and PCB # 52 at fM concentrations in Boston Harbor seawater. Observations of disequilibrium between sorbed HOCs (e. g., PAHs & PCBs) and the surrounding environmental waters indicate that the times for desorption are important for understanding the fate of HOCs. Settling and resuspended particles can {{play a significant role in}} the cycling of HOCs. For PAHs, like pyrene, these chemicals' strong affinity for black carbon in the environment makes the rate of desorption less certain. The desorption rate for pyrene from native Hudson River sediment was measured in the laboratory and a diffusion rate constant (effective diffusivity/particle radius 2) ranging from 1. OE- 7 to 5. 6 E- 7 s- 1 was measured. The results were in good agreement with a physically- and chemically-based model for estimating effective diffusivity and the rate of desorption. by Rachel G.

40|$|With {{increasing}} ionic strength, the aqueous solubility {{and activity}} of organic chemicals are altered. This so-called salting-out effect causes the hydrophobicity {{of the chemicals}} to be increased and sorption in the marine environment to be more pronounced than in freshwater systems. The process can be described with empirical salting-out or <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constants,</b> which traditionally are determined by comparing aqueous solubilities in freshwater and saline water. Aqueous solubilities of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) however are difficult to determine, which might partly explain the limited size of the existing data base on <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constants</b> for these chemicals. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for determining the constants, {{which is based on}} the use of solid phase micro extraction (SPME) fibers. Partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to SPME fibers increased about 1. 7 times when going from de-ionized water to seawater. From the log-linear relationship between SPME fiber-water partition coefficients and ionic strength, <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constants</b> were derived, which measured on average 0. 35 L mol(- 1). These values agreed with literature values existing for some of the investigated PAHs and were independent of solute hydrophobicity or molar volume. Based on the present data, SPME seems to be a convenient and suitable alternative technique to determine <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constants</b> for HOCs...|$|R

40|$|Within this thesis, {{work has}} been done on three topics: - The {{partition}} coefficients of phenol between carbon dioxide and water or aqueous solutions of tetramethylammonia bromide were measured at 313 K. At the highest pressure of 30 MPa and the maximum salt concentration of 2 mol/l, the partition coefficient decreased from 0. 47 to 0. 2. This observed salting-in effect was described by the Setschenow equation. The investigated salting-out effect of sodium chloride on phenol between water and CO_ 2 was compared with salting-out between water and organic solvents. For that purpose, the <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constants</b> of sodium chloride on phenol in the system of water and cyclohexane were measured between 293 and 333 K and calculated by a surface tension model. The <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constants</b> at high pressures in CO_ 2 were comparable to those at atmospheric pressures. Analogous to binary solid fluid phase equilibria, an enhancement factor was introduced to describe high pressure partitioning equilibria. Differences in the distribution behaviour of single solutes are discussed in terms of the enthalpy of hydration. indicate novel types of solid fluid phase equilibria. The increasing degree of fluorination of these four substances led to an increase of the solubility in carbon dioxide. The solubility of tris(p-trifluoromethylphenyl) phosphine was higher than the solubility of the triphenylphosphine derivatives that are fluorinated at the aromatic ring. By a comparison of the enhancement factors, it was shown that this finding can be explained by increasing interactions between the substrate and the solvent molecules. (orig.)

40|$|Carbon capture, utilization, {{and storage}} (CCUS), {{including}} enhanced oil recovery (EOR), {{is one of}} the most promising mitigation strategies for climate change. CCUS involves the capture of CO 2 from point sources and the subsequent injection of that CO 2 into geologic storage formations. Depleted oil reservoirs will be the first targets of CCUS due to the economic benefits associated with EOR. EOR operations are expected to produce large volumes of wastewater brines with the crude oil. Brines, which can have high concentrations of salts and dissolved organic compounds; and CO 2, which can have dissolved organic compounds, have potential to leak into shallower aquifers. Therefore, fundamental research is needed on the levels of organic compounds in both the reservoir brines and CO 2 in case of leakage. This thesis was divided into two parts. Part I was concerned with the aqueous solubility of organic compounds in brines. The presence of dissolved salts typically results in a decrease in organic compound aqueous solubility, this is called the salting-out effect, and it is typically modeled by the Setschenow Equation. Setschenow constants, which are empirical salting-out parameters, are assumed to be additive, meaning that they are applicable in mixed electrolyte solutions. However, this has not been verified by extensive experimental work. For accurate risk assessment modeling, Setschenow constants are needed for NaCl and CaCl 2 for hundreds of organic compounds relevant to oil and gas reservoirs. However, there are only ~ 190 reported NaCl Setschenow constants and ~ 19 reported CaCl 2 Setschenow constants. For the majority of these compounds, the validity of the Setschenow Equation has only been proven up to 0. 5 – 1 M NaCl/CaCl 2; and has not been extended up to salt concentrations relevant to oil and gas reservoir brines. The first objective of this study was to determine the validity of the Setschenow Equation for selected hydrophobic compounds in the range of 2 – 5 M NaCl, 1. 5 – 2 M CaCl 2, and in mixed electrolyte brines. The salting-out effect was measured in NaCl, CaCl 2, and mixed Na-Ca brines for naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, thiophene, benzothiophene, and dibenzothiophene. In this study, the Setschenow Equation was proven to be valid up to 2 – 5 M NaCl and 1. 5 – 2 M CaCl 2 for the organic compounds studied here. Setschenow constants were additive for fluorene and thiophene from moderate to high ionic strengths. Results demonstrated that previously determined Setschenow constants measured at low salt concentrations do not need to be re-measured at high salt concentrations. Objective 2 was to determine the validity of the Setschenow Equation for selected hydrophilic compounds up to 5 M NaCl, 2 M CaCl 2, and in mixed electrolyte brines. The Setschenow Equation was proven to be valid in predicting the salting-out effect up to those high salt concentrations for three phenol, p-cresol, hydroquinone, 9 -hydroxyfluorene, pyrrole, and hexanoic acid. Setschenow constants were additive for p-cresol and 9 -hydroxyfluorene up to high ionic strengths. In addition to demonstrating the validity of the Setschenow Equation for these selected organic compounds, both Objective 1 and 2 added to a sparse database of NaCl and CaCl 2 Setschenow constants. In Objective 3 models were evaluated, updated, and developed for prediction of Setschenow constants. Two models, a poly-parameter linear free energy relationship (pp-LFER) and a single parameter (sp) LFER, for prediction of NaCl Setschenow constants were evaluated and updated with new NaCl <b>Setschenow</b> <b>constant</b> data from both this study and the literature. The pp-LFER uses the Abraham solvation parameters of the organic compound of interest as inputs and the sp-LFER uses the octanol-water partitioning coefficient of the organic compound to predict NaCl Setschenow constants. Both models produced predictions of Setschenow constants that had good agreement with the experimental NaCl Setschenow constants in this study. The update of these models increased the breadth of organic compounds, and therefore confidence, in these models. In addition, four new models were developed to predict Setschenow constants of four other salts, which include CaCl 2, KCl, LiCl, and NaBr. Extensions of this study include determining whether the Setschenow Equation is valid in predicting the salting-out effect for additional organic organics, different salts, and in additional mixed electrolyte systems. Finally, Part II of this study explored the data gaps related to the partitioning of organic compounds from water to sc-CO 2. Objective four was to develop new linear partitioning models based on experimental water-sc-CO 2 data of selected nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen containing organic compounds and literature data. There are only ~ 37 organic compounds that have reported water-sc-CO 2 partitioning coefficients; however thousands of partitioning coefficients are needed over a range of temperature and pressure conditions. Therefore, models are needed to accurately predict these partitioning coefficients. Partitioning coefficients over a range of temperatures and pressures were measured for thiophene, pyrrole, and anisole. Those measured partitioning coefficients followed trends based on vapor pressure and aqueous solubility. These partitioning coefficients, along with literature values were used to update a pp-LFER. Five new models based on inputs of vapor pressure, aqueous solubility, and CO 2 density were developed to predict water-sc-CO 2 partitioning coefficients. Those models were developed using data from this study and literature data. Four of those models are specific to organic compound classes, which include monopolar substituted benzenes, polar substituted benzenes, chlorinated phenols, and nitrogen containing compounds, and the other model is available to any organic compound that has vapor pressure, aqueous solubility, and CO 2 density inputs that fall within the specified training range. Possible extensions of this study include further research testing of different groups of organic compounds in water-sc-CO 2 systems, co-solvency effects, determining the effects of the salting-out effect in water-sc-CO 2 partitioning, and using sc-CO 2 for water treatment...|$|E
