5000|$|The <b>spoons</b> {{position}} or <b>spooning</b> is a sexual position and a cuddling technique. The name {{derives from the}} way that 2 <b>spoons</b> may be positioned side by side, with bowls aligned.

50|$|They {{are still}} used for {{stirring}} {{many different kinds}} of food and beverages, especially soups and casseroles during preparation, although they tend to absorb strong smells such as onion and garlic. Wooden <b>spoons</b> are generally preferred for cooking because of their versatility. Some cooks prefer to use wooden <b>spoons</b> when preparing risotto because they do not transfer heat as much as metal <b>spoons.</b> Unlike metal <b>spoons,</b> they can also be safely used without scratching non-stick pans. This is useful when making dishes such as scrambled eggs.|$|R

5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the ala is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden <b>spoon,</b> with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. One story has it that a man kept such an ala in his barn; she drank thirty liters of milk every day. Another warns that ale {{in the form of}} twelve ravens used to take the crops from vineyards.|$|E
5|$|After the band's split, the Pope {{brothers}} {{took over}} management of Black Lodge Studios, {{the recording studio}} that the band formed with the recording of Guilt Show, alongside longtime producing partner Ed Rose. The brothers joined Koufax for a short stint, before splitting for different projects.

500|$|The large {{collection}} of <b>spoons</b> includes 51 cochlearia, which are small <b>spoons</b> with shallow bowls and long, tapering handles with a pointed end {{which was used}} to pierce eggs and spear small pieces of food—as the Romans did not use forks at the table. There are 23 cigni, which are much rarer, having large rather shallow <b>spoons</b> with shorter, bird-headed handles; and about 20 deep round <b>spoons</b> or small ladles and strainer-spoons. Many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures. Many of the <b>spoons</b> are decorated with a Christian monogram cross or Chi-Rho symbol, and sometimes, also with the Greek letters alpha and omega (an appellation for Jesus, who is described as the alpha and omega in the Book of Revelation). Three sets of ten <b>spoons,</b> and several other <b>spoons,</b> are decorated with such Christian symbols. As {{is often the case}} with Roman silver <b>spoons,</b> many also have a Latin inscription on them, either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life. In total, eight different people are named; seven on the <b>spoons,</b> and one on the single beaker in the hoard: Aurelius Ursicinus, Datianus, Euherius, Faustinus, Peregrinus, Quintus, Sanctus, and Silvicola. The most common name is [...] "Aurelius Ursicinus", which occurs on a set of five cochlearia and five ladles. It is unknown whether any of the people named in these inscriptions would have been involved in hiding the hoard or were even alive {{at the time it was}} buried.|$|R
50|$|Today, wooden <b>spoons</b> {{in western}} {{cultures}} are generally medium to large <b>spoons</b> used for mixing ingredients for cooking or baking. They may be flat {{or have a}} small dip in the middle.|$|R
50|$|The Listen To The City soundtrack album {{consists}} of the primarily instrumental score for the film, and was written, produced and performed by Gordon Deppe of the band <b>Spoons.</b> On two tracks, Deppe is joined by Sandy Horne as co-performer and co-composer; Horne co-starred in the film and was {{also a member of}} <b>Spoons.</b> Rob Preuss, also of <b>Spoons,</b> assists on these two tracks.|$|R
5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden <b>spoon</b> in her hand, with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and devour them in her dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. Less often, they attacked and ate adults; {{they were able to}} find a hidden human by smell.|$|E
5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change to {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the <b>Spoon</b> Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the <b>Spoon</b> Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E
5|$|England {{started the}} {{following}} decade with a Grand Slam {{victory in the}} 1980 Five Nations – their first for 23 years. However in the 1983 Five Nations Championship, England failed to win a game {{and picked up the}} wooden <b>spoon.</b> In the first Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, England were grouped in pool A alongside Australia, Japan and the United States. England lost their first game 19–6 against Australia. They went on to defeat Japan and the United States, and met Wales in their quarter-final, losing the match 16–3.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spoons</b> took a {{break from}} {{recording}} in the 1990s to allow time to focus on family, but Deppe, Horne, and various other players reunited for several <b>Spoons</b> reunion gigs in the 1990s and into the next decade. In 2007, <b>Spoons</b> released Unexpected Guest at a Cancelled Party, a collection of previously unreleased material recorded between 1982 and 1985 by the Deppe, Horne, Preuss, Ross line-up.|$|R
50|$|The game <b>Spoons</b> can {{be played}} with more players, using one or more decks of 52 {{ordinary}} playing cards {{and a number of}} <b>spoons</b> totalling one fewer than the number of players. Even though the game is famous for the usage of <b>spoons,</b> virtually anything can be used. The <b>spoons</b> are placed {{in the center of the}} table in a circle with handles pointing outward so that they may be easily grabbed by any of the players. One person is designated first dealer and deals four cards to each player. The dealer will use the remaining cards to draw from.|$|R
50|$|Preserved {{examples}} of {{various forms of}} <b>spoons</b> used by the ancient Egyptians include those composed of ivory, flint, slate and wood; many of them carved with religious symbols. During the Neolithic Ozieri civilization in Sardinia, ceramic ladles and <b>spoons</b> were already in use. In Shang Dynasty China, <b>spoons</b> were made of bone. Early bronze <b>spoons</b> in China were designed with a sharp point, and may have also been used as cutlery. The <b>spoons</b> of the Greeks and Romans were chiefly made of bronze and silver and the handle usually {{takes the form of}} a spike or pointed stem. There are many examples in the British Museum from which the forms of the various types can be ascertained, the chief points of difference being found in the junction of the bowl with the handle.|$|R
5|$|In {{what turned}} out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the {{required}} thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from the opposing team North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the wooden <b>spoon</b> for finishing on the bottom of the competition ladder.|$|E
5|$|The four-headed god Brahma {{should be}} shown {{seated on the}} ground in the {{foreground}} officiating as the wedding priest and making offerings to the homa (sacred fire) in the kunda (fire-altar). The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and <b>spoon)</b> in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) in his back arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where the bride and groom go around the fire seven times.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many {{of their}} Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, {{possibly}} due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity {{of a large number}} of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of <b>spoon</b> and fork, not knife and fork.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spoons,</b> {{also known}} as Pig or Tongue, is a fast-paced game of {{matching}} and occasional bluffing. It is played with an ordinary pack of playing cards and several ordinary kitchen <b>spoons</b> or other objects.|$|R
50|$|In old times, {{newly married}} couples in Norway ate with linked <b>spoons</b> {{to symbolize the}} linkage of their marriage. Often the <b>spoons</b> and chain were made from {{a single piece of}} wood, {{emphasizing}} wood-carving craftsmanship.|$|R

5|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, the only surviving {{items of the}} coronation regalia were a 12th-century <b>spoon</b> and three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.) Detailed records of old regalia survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings {{from the time of}} Charles I. For the coronation of Charles II, gems were rented because the treasury could not afford to replace them.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a <b>spoon</b> of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, <b>spoon</b> worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5000|$|Wooden <b>spoons</b> {{have been}} made in {{virtually}} every nation on earth and (compared to silver or pewter or gold <b>spoons)</b> represent the ordinary artisan and reflect the life of ordinary folk: this is their [...] "folk art".|$|R

5|$|A {{well-known}} practical joke among chemists is {{to fashion}} gallium <b>spoons</b> {{and use them}} to serve tea to unsuspecting guests, since gallium has a similar appearance to its lighter homolog aluminium. The <b>spoons</b> then melt in the hot tea.|$|R
