5|$|As travel became easier, faster, {{and less}} expensive, Germans <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> unity in {{factors other than}} their language. The Brothers Grimm, who {{compiled}} a massive dictionary known as The Grimm, also assembled a compendium of folk tales and fables, which highlighted the story-telling parallels between different regions. Karl Baedeker wrote guidebooks to different cities and regions of Central Europe, indicating places to stay, sites to visit, and giving a short history of castles, battlefields, famous buildings, and famous people. His guides also included distances, roads to avoid, and hiking paths to follow.|$|E

Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, particularly because Glenn {{seems to have a}} mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election. Although leading in the opinion polls for several years, it <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some loss of support after the rise of the True Finns. Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, an analysis on the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party's political ideology. At the party conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally very supportive of market economy, nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} decade, the future site of Sa Pa township <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> military parties {{as well as}} missionaries from the Société des Missions Etrangères de Paris (MEP) visit. The French military marched from the Red River Delta into the northern mountainous regions as part of Tonkin's ‘pacification’. In 1894-96 the border between China and Tonkin was formally agreed upon and the Sa Pa area, just {{to the south of}} this frontier, was placed under French authority. From 1891 the entire Lào Cai region, including Sa Pa, came under direct colonial military administration so as to curtail banditry and political resistance on the sensitive northern frontier.|$|E

25|$|Another {{study was}} <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{if a new}} RISC {{architecture}} could be defined that could directly support the VMS operating system. The new design used most of the basic PRISM concepts, but was re-tuned to allow VMS and VMS programs to run at reasonable speed with no conversion at all. The decision was also made to upgrade the design to a full 64-bit implementation from PRISM's 32-bit, a conversion {{all of the major}} RISC vendors were undertaking. Eventually that new architecture became Alpha. The primary Alpha instruction set architects were Richard L. Sites and Richard T. Witek. The PRISM's Epicode was developed into the Alpha's PALcode, providing an abstracted interface to platform- and processor implementation-specific features.|$|E
25|$|Staying in Palestine until August 1945, Koestler {{collected}} {{material for}} his next novel, Thieves in the Night. When he returned to England Mamaine Paget, whom he had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> before going out to Palestine, was waiting for him. In 1945 August the couple moved to the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Over {{the next three years}} Koestler would become a close friend of George Orwell. The region had its own intellectual circle, which would have been sympathetic to Koestler: Williams-Ellis' wife, Amabel, a niece of Lytton Strachey was also a former communist; other associates included Rupert Crawshay-Williams, Michael Polanyi, Storm Jameson and, most significantly, Bertrand Russell, who lived {{just a few miles from}} the Koestler cottage.|$|E
25|$|After {{the advent}} of {{unification}} and the electro-pneumatic action, builders of church organs <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the advantages of these systems. As a result, several organ builders began adopting these concepts for use in their church organs. Among these were Austin, Möller, Aeolian-Skinner and Kimball, who used electro-pneumatic action in many of their organs. Today, approximately one fourth of all new or rebuilt church pipe organs use an electro-pneumatic action either exclusively, or as an augmentation to existing tracker actions. In the same vein, some amount of unification was utilized in some church organs, and even today many church pipe organs utilize some degree of unification in areas where it is not critical to the classical sound sought in such instruments, or in instruments where space for pipes is limited. With stops such as the 32' bourdon in the pedal division, or a 16' reed in a manual division, the basic theatre organ concept of extension is commonly—but discreetly—used by even the most noted organ builders.|$|E

25|$|The Castro's age {{as a gay}} mecca began {{during the}} late 1960s with the Summer of Love in the {{neighboring}} Haight-Ashbury district in 1967. The two neighborhoods are separated by a large mountain, topped by Buena Vista Park. The hippie and free love movements had fostered communal living and free society ideas including housing of large groups of people in hippie communes. Androgyny became popular with men even in full beards as gay hippie men began {{to move into the}} area. The 1967 gathering brought tens of thousands of middle-class youth from all over the United States to the Haight which saw its own exodus when well-organized individuals and collectives <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Castro as an oasis from the massive influx. Many of the hippies had no way to support themselves or places to shelter. The Haight became drug ridden and violent, chasing off the gay population, who looked for a more stable area to live.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourth}} quarter, the game took a terrible turn as a hit by Houston's Zachary McMillian took UCF's Breshad Perriman {{to the ground}} for nearly fifteen minutes. The play ended with McMillian ejected from the field for targeting. With emotion driving the Knights, they scored again with a 38-yard {{touchdown}} run by William Stanback, and took a 19–7 lead. UCF <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the game slip away, however, as a blocked field goal attempt eventually led to a Houston touchdown by Wayne Beadle, and the lead was trimmed to 19–14. UCF was forced to punt the ball with three minutes left and gave favorable field position to the Cougars. Houston quickly drove the field, and had 1st & Goal at the UCF 10 yard line with 54 seconds left in regulation. Houston had four attempts at a game-winning touchdown, but failed to convert. On 4th & Goal with 20 seconds left, O'Korn's pass was tipped incomplete by junior safety Brandon Alexander, and UCF held on for the victory.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s a few seaside resorts <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{open top}} buses {{operated}} as tourist attractions on their seaside roads. More resorts started such {{services in the}} years following World War II. In 1955 five old buses had their roofs removed for services in Torbay and one more was converted for Exmouth, another resort served by Devon General. They entered service on 19 June and a new sea front route was started on 19 July. These proved a success and so a larger fleet of new buses were delivered for service in 1961. They were launched at a naming ceremony on 11 May 1961. These were 'convertible' buses that could operated as open tops during the summer and with roofs during the remainder of the year, although after the first winter they were usually stored during the winter as putting the roofs on caused some damage. It took half an hour to fit or remove a roof using the mechanism that had worked a bus washing machine which had recently been superseded. When not in use the roofs were stored on three mobile racks made from old bus chassis from which the bodies had been removed.|$|E

With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls {{that he and his}} father [...] "got on a great deal better" [...] during the time he spent in New York: [...] "We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general." ...|$|E
500|$|The Botanic Garden was reissued {{repeatedly}} in Britain, Ireland and the United States throughout the 1790s. [...] Until {{the publication of}} William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads in 1798, Darwin {{was considered one of}} England's preeminent poets. His poems, with their “dynamic vision of change and transformation”, resonated with the ideals of the French revolution. However, when the revolution entered its more radical and bloody phase, scientific progress became associated with what many <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> as a failed revolution. Anti-Jacobins, who were opposed to the French revolution, denounced the sexual freedom gaining ground in France and linked it to the scientific projects of men like Darwin. George Canning and John Frere published a parody of The Loves of the Plants in the Anti-Jacobin Review in 1798 titled “Loves of the Triangles”, suggesting just these connections.|$|E
