5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability <b>strip,</b> is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The <b>strip</b> intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability <b>strip</b> that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability <b>strip.</b>|$|E
5|$|After CR4, NY179 {{proceeds}} east through Orchard Park as a two-lane boulevard, intersecting {{the northern}} terminus of CR461 (California Road). After crossing under another railroad, NY179 returns to four-lanes, passing south of several <b>strip</b> malls in Orchard Park.

40|$|Conservation <b>strips</b> {{combine the}} {{conservation}} biological control tactics of beetle banks and flowering insectary <b>strips.</b> Conservation <b>strips</b> were established on golf course fairways {{to evaluate their}} effect on arthropod abundance and distribution. The conservation <b>strips</b> contained two flowering plants, alyssum and coreopsis, and an ornamental grass. In general, the plants species in the conservation <b>strips</b> supported a greater abundance of predators, parasitoids and alternative prey than turf. Conservation <b>strips</b> also resulted in a greater abundance of natural enemies and alternative prey in the fairway adjacent to the conservation <b>strips</b> versus fairways without conservation <b>strips.</b> Predation on cutworm larvae in fairways was significantly more frequent when conservation <b>strips</b> were present. For these reasons conservation <b>strips</b> show great potential as a conservation biological control tactic on golf courses.

25|$|A 2015 Federal Highway Administration study {{evaluated}} {{the application of}} shoulder rumble <b>strips</b> and centerline rumble <b>strips</b> in combination by analyzing geometric, traffic, and crash data obtained at treated two-lane rural road locations in Kentucky, Missouri and Pennsylvania. The results suggested {{that the effect of}} combining centerline and shoulder rumble <b>strips</b> further reduces run-off-road crashes compared to shoulder rumble <b>strips</b> alone and both total and fatal+injury crashes compared to centerline rumble <b>strips</b> alone. However, it appeared that shoulder rumble <b>strips</b> do not further reduce head-on+sideswipe-opposite-direction crashes than applying centerline rumble <b>strips</b> in isolation.|$|R

30|$|From Figure  1, for 2.5 % shade, it {{was found}} that <b>stripping</b> {{percentages}} of dyed fabrics increased gradually with the increase of concentration of <b>stripping</b> chemicals (Hydrose and caustic soda) when fabrics were <b>stripped</b> both at 80 °C and 100 °C. <b>Stripping</b> percentages were also found higher at 100 °C than 80 °C under each combination of <b>stripping</b> chemicals. As the temperature of the <b>stripping</b> operation was more, the <b>stripping</b> was more. Both at 80 °C and 100 °C temperature when concentration of caustic soda was doubled from 2.5  g/l to 5  g/l with 5  g/l hydrose as well as from 5  g/l to 10  g/l with 10  g/l hydrose, <b>stripping</b> percentages were slightly increased.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an efficicent combination of techniques for fast <b>stripping</b> and multiresolution rendering of Point-Based Surfaces (PBS) called Surfel <b>Stripping.</b> Surfel <b>Strips</b> are small triangle <b>strips</b> that interpolate the PBS. We propose here two contributions. First, at loading time, we efficiently convert the PBS into triangle <b>strips.</b> This {{is done by}} generating a set of overlapping small triangular meshes that interpolate the PBS, removing redundant triangles and finally <b>stripping</b> the small triangular meshes by using a cache-friendly <b>stripping</b> method. All these operations are performed using an octree data structure. Second, we reuse this data structure for providing a multiresolution interactive visualization of the surfel <b>strips</b> at rendering time. Since Surfel <b>Stripping</b> is local and very fast, it can be used, {{in a lot of}} situations, as an object-space alternative to the image-space surface splatting and considered half way between point-based rendering and local polygonal generation. Rendering Surfel <b>Strips</b> is very efficient since it neither requires multi-pass rendering nor time-consuming vertex/fragment shaders compared to surface splatting. We show also how to exploit the locality of the surfel <b>strips</b> for maintaining compatibility with point-based modeling tools, such as local deformations of surfaces. We finally give some examples of well known visual enrichments developed for polygons, directly applied to PBS thanks to surfel <b>strips...</b>|$|R
