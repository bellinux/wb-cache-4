50|$|The mill was {{originally}} established as North <b>Side</b> <b>Roller</b> Mill. It {{was one of}} the first flour roller mills in the county. It was built in 1896 by a group of Salisbury businessmen to compete with the Salisbury Roller Mill. In the first year of operation, it was producing fifty barrels of flour in each 24-hour day. In 1898, the mill was sold to another company which then went bankrupt in 1906. John D. Grimes, a businessman from nearby Davidson County who established the first roller mill in North Carolina in Lexington in 1879, bought the mill after its bankruptcy for $4,000. By that time, the mill's original three floors had an additional expanded area of two floors.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{thin film}} {{transfer}} mechanism {{has been studied}} and developed to transfer chemically reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) thin film using a roll-to-roll printing system. We discover that shear stress generated on the silicon rubber stamp surface facilitates delamination of the deposited r-GO thin film efficiently. A roll-to-roll apparatus is assembled to demonstrate the shear-induced transfer printing {{in a large scale}} printing system. Shear stress is applied on the stamp surface by rotating the stamp <b>side</b> <b>roller</b> faster than the substrate <b>side</b> <b>roller.</b> The hydrophobic surface is changed to hydrophilic by polydopamine modification for 15 minutes at 60 ˚C in order for r-GO thin film to be directly deposited on the rubber stamp. Roll-to-roll printing parameters such as evaporation time during deposition of r-GO, vertical deformation of stamp, RPM, and RPM ratio between two rollers are investigated and adjusted for successful transfer of r-GO. With the adjusted roll-to-roll printing parameters, r-GO thin film has been transferred successfully to glass and PET substrates at a printing rate of 5 mm/min. The shear stress required to transfer r-GO thin film in our experiment condition with glass substrate is estimated to be 325. 43 kPa by experimental data and computation with ANSYS. A flexible transparent capacitive touch sensor is fabricated with printed r-GO thin film after the sheet resistance is significantly improved by thermal annealing process. Both the shear-induced roll-to-roll printing method and the stamp modification process are expected to contribute to large scale manufacturing systems for flexible printed electronics...|$|E

50|$|Two years later, in 1870, John Barraclough Fell {{replaced}} it with another experimental narrow gauge railway line, dubbed the Parkhouse Tramway, named after the Parkhouse Farm west of the mines. This had a gauge of 8 in and had also a very low centre of gravity and stabilising <b>side</b> <b>rollers</b> on a central beam consisting of two trusses. It was driven by a stationary engine and endless wire rope. It could transport up to 100,000 tons per year. The waggons were each loaded with one ton of iron ore, and small carriages with eight passengers were run with perfect steadiness and safety at a speed of 15 to 20 miles per hour.|$|R

Horizontal <b>side</b> <b>rollers</b> guide the vehicle against the vertical walls of the un-banked track for steering, providing very fast speeds up to 65 km/H (40 mph) on the track. In Japan, Mini 4WD {{is also known as}} mini yonku (ミニ四駆) in Japanese. Though mostly popular in Asia, they are sold in many countries as Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Italy, United States and the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|The {{board was}} {{designed}} to be strapped to the arm of a cavalryman on the arm that he held the horses bridle with. The board is attached to the leather buckle with a swivel joint. This means that the user can twist the whole board on their arm to ensure that the compass alignment is clear. The board incorporates a compass for this purpose. The user can then use the supplied ruler. In earlier versions this was attached with rubber bands but later versions had the ruler permanently attached. The paper was about two or three feet long and was rolled around one of the <b>side</b> <b>rollers.</b> As a sketch was completed then the paper roll was advanced to supply more clear paper. On the back of the board is an Inclinometer to allow the severity of ascents to be recorded.|$|R

50|$|<b>Side</b> {{friction}} <b>roller</b> coasters were {{an early}} innovation in roller coasters which {{enabled them to}} run at greater speeds and without a brakeman. Extra wheels were mounted {{on the sides of}} the cars to guide their movement on the track. This design became obsolete after World War I when side friction was supplanted by under-track mechanisms, which offered better vehicle security and support for greater speeds.|$|R
50|$|Leap-The-Dips was {{designed}} by Edward Joy Morris and constructed by the Federal Construction Company. It {{opened to the public}} in 1902 at Lakemont Park.

40|$|A {{commercial}} {{drum chipper}} was fed alternately and piecewise with poplar stems and poplar tops, {{in order to}} determine the effect of piece size and tree part on machine performance. Chipping stems required most of the available power (231 kW) delivered by the tractor, whereas chipping tops took about half that much. However, productivity was twice as high with stems, compared to tops (i. e. 25 and 11 t h− 1 of oven dry wood, respectively). As a consequence, specific fuel consumption per unit product was 15 % lower with stems, compared to tops – i. e. 0. 61 and 0. 72 L m− 3, respectively. Mean feeding speed was 0. 37 m s− 1 for stems and 0. 41 m s− 1 for tops, but the difference was not significant (p = 0. 1677). Productivity and fuel consumption were strongly related to piece size, but tree part had its own additional effect, independent from size and possibly related to form. When chipping tops it is advisable to feed more pieces at a time, in order to partly compensate for the effect of piece size. Operators expecting to chip primarily small-size materials may acquire special chipper versions with wider drums and additional <b>side</b> <b>rollers,</b> for smoother mass feeding...|$|R

50|$|The first Kennywood Racer {{was first}} built in 1910 as a <b>side</b> {{friction}} <b>roller</b> coaster by Frederick Ingersoll. It was a twin-track racing coaster designed by John Miller that cost nearly $50,000. When it was built, {{it was the}} largest racing coaster in the world. The original Racer had two trains racing side by side on two separate tracks, but it didn't have wheels under the track, so dips and curves were gentle. The trains consisted of three-seat cars with a seating capacity of 18. The Racer was torn down in 1926 and replaced by Kiddieland.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{spinning}} {{roller coaster}} was the Virginia Reel, first built in 1908 by Henry Riehl. Instead of trains, the ride had [...] "tubs" [...] with seats {{built around the}} perimeter facing inward. These tubs spun freely on their chassis as they travelled down the track, which was trough-like and {{similar to that of}} a <b>side</b> friction <b>roller</b> coaster. Virginia Reels did not have big hills or drops, but rather many sharp turns. Toward the end were two helices, and finally a drop into a dark tunnel. The last full size Virginia Reel closed at Pleasure Beach Blackpool in 1982.|$|R

50|$|Leap-The-Dips is {{a wooden}} roller coaster located at Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Constructed in 1902 by the Federal Construction Company and {{designed}} by E. Joy Morris, {{it is the}} oldest operating roller coaster {{in the world and}} believed to be the last surviving <b>side</b> friction <b>roller</b> coaster of the figure-eight variety. Leap-the-Dips operated continuously until 1985, when it closed after falling into disrepair. A fund-raising campaign led to its restoration, with refurbishment efforts beginning in 1997 and ending with a grand-reopening in 1999. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996 and received the Coaster Classic and Coaster Landmark awards from American Coaster Enthusiasts.|$|R
50|$|Scenic railways, {{particularly}} {{in the form of}} <b>side</b> friction <b>roller</b> coasters, require a brakeman to ride with the train around the track to slow it down at certain points on the layout, particularly bends; as the trains are not mechanically held onto the track. The brakeman is responsible for slowing the train down when necessary and stopping it in the station {{at the end of the}} ride. There are only a few examples of such rides now left in existence; the Scenic Railway at Luna Park, Melbourne, Australia, and the Roller Coaster at Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach, UK, are two of the largest examples.|$|R

5000|$|Like steel roller {{coasters}}, wooden {{roller coasters}} usually {{use the same}} three-wheel design, pioneered by John Miller. Each set of wheels includes a running wheel (on top of the track), a side friction (or [...] "guide") wheel (to guide motion in the lateral plane and reduce excessive side-to-side movement known as [...] "hunting") and an upstop wheel (beneath the track to prevent cars from flying off the track). Some wooden coasters, such as Leap-The-Dips, do not have upstop wheels and are known as <b>side</b> friction <b>roller</b> coasters. As a result, the turns and drops are more gentle than on modern wooden roller coasters. Scenic Railway roller coasters also lack upstop wheels but rely on a brake operator to control the speed so that upstop wheels are not necessary. A handful of wooden coasters use flanged wheels, similar to a rail car, {{eliminating the need for}} side friction wheels.|$|R
