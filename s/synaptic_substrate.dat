Low levels of essential n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFAs) {{have been linked}} to neuropsychiatric diseases, but the underlying synaptic alterations are mostly unknown. We found that lifelong n- 3 PUFAs dietary insufficiency specifically ablates long-term synaptic depression mediated by endocannabinoids in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex and accumbens. In n- 3 deficient mice, presynaptic cannabinoid CB 1 receptors (CB 1 Rs) normally responding to endocannabinoids were uncoupled from their effector Gi/o-proteins. Finally, the dietary-induced reduction of CB 1 R functions in mood controlling structures is associated with impaired emotional behavior. These findings identify a plausible <b>synaptic</b> <b>substrate</b> for the behavioral alterations caused by the n- 3 PUFAs deficiency often observed in western diet...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{reward-based}} learning, synaptic modifications {{depend on}} a brief stimulus and a temporally delayed reward, which poses {{the question of how}} synaptic activity patterns associate with a delayed reward. A theoretical solution to this so-called distal reward problem has been the notion of activity-generated “synaptic eligibility traces,” silent and transient synaptic tags that can be converted into long-term changes in synaptic strength by reward-linked neuromodulators. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of eligibility traces in cortical synapses. We demonstrate the Hebbian induction of distinct traces for LTP and LTD and their subsequent timing-dependent transformation into lasting changes by specific monoaminergic receptors anchored to postsynaptic proteins. Notably, the temporal properties of these transient traces allow stable learning in a recurrent neural network that accurately predicts the timing of the reward, further validating the induction and transformation of eligibility traces for LTP and LTD as a plausible <b>synaptic</b> <b>substrate</b> for reward-based learning...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTargeting of {{synaptic}} molecules {{to their}} proper location {{is essential for}} synaptic differentiation and plasticity. PSD- 95 /Dlg proteins have been established as key components of the postsynapse. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the synaptic targeting, assembly, and disassembly of PSD- 95 /Dlg are not well understood. Here we show that PAR- 1 kinase, a conserved cell polarity regulator, is critically involved in controlling the postsynaptic localization of Dlg. PAR- 1 is prominently localized at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Loss of PAR- 1 function leads to increased synapse formation and synaptic transmission, whereas overexpression of PAR- 1 has the opposite effects. PAR- 1 directly phosphorylates Dlg at a conserved site and negatively regulates its mobility and targeting to the postsynapse. The ability of a nonphosphorylatable Dlg to largely rescue PAR- 1 -induced synaptic defects supports the idea that Dlg is a major <b>synaptic</b> <b>substrate</b> of PAR- 1. Control of Dlg synaptic targeting by PAR- 1 -mediated phosphorylation thus constitutes a critical event in synaptogenesis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{relative}} {{timing of}} plasticity-induction protocols {{is known to}} be crucial. For example, anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which increases cortical excitability and typically enhances plasticity, can impair performance if it is applied before a motor learning task. Such timing-dependent effects have been ascribed to homeostatic plasticity, but the specific synaptic site of this interaction remains unknown. ObjectiveWe wished to investigate the <b>synaptic</b> <b>substrate,</b> and in particular the role of inhibitory signaling, underpinning the behavioral effects of anodal tDCS in homeostatic interactions between anodal tDCS and motor learning. MethodsWe used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate cortical excitability and inhibitory signaling following tDCS and motor learning. Each subject participated in four experimental sessions and data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs and post-hoc t-tests as appropriate. ResultsAs predicted, we found that anodal tDCS prior to the motor task decreased learning rates. This worsening of learning after tDCS was accompanied by a correlated increase in GABAA activity, as measured by TMS-assessed short interval intra-cortical inhibition (SICI). ConclusionThis provides the first direct demonstration in humans that inhibitory synapses are the likely site for the interaction between anodal tDCS and motor learning, and further, that homeostatic plasticity at GABAA synapses has behavioral relevance in humans...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{produces}} axonal damage and deafferentation, triggering injury-induced synaptogenesis, a process influenced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their substrates. Here we report results of studies examining the expression and potential role of two membrane-bound MMPs, membrane-type 5 -MMP (MT 5 -MMP) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase- 10 (ADAM- 10), {{along with their}} common <b>synaptic</b> <b>substrate</b> N-cadherin, {{during the period of}} reactive synaptogenesis. Protein and mRNA expression of MT 5 -MMP, ADAM- 10 and N-cadherin were compared in two TBI models, one exhibiting adaptive plasticity (unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion; UEC) and the other maladaptive plasticity (fluid percussion injury + bilateral EC lesions; TBI+BEC), targeting 2, 7, and 15 d postinjury intervals. In adaptive UEC plasticity, membrane-bound MMP expression was elevated during synaptic degeneration (2 d) and regeneration (7 d), and normalized at 15 d. By contrast, N-cadherin expression was significantly decreased at 2 and 7 d after UEC, but increased during 15 d synaptic stabilization. In maladaptive plasticity, 2 d membrane-bound MMP expression was dampened compared to UEC, with persistent ADAM- 10 elevation and reduced N-cadherin protein level at 15 d. These results were supported by 7 d microarray and qRT-PCR analyses, which showed transcript shifts in both hippocampus and dentate molecular layer (ML) for each model. Parallel immunohistochemistry revealed significant MT 5 -MMP, ADAM- 10 and N-cadherin localization within ML reactive astrocytes, suggesting a glial synthetic or phagocytotic role for their processing during recovery. We also investigated the effect of MMP inhibition on molecular, electrophysiological, behavioral and structural outcome at 15 d following TBI+BEC. MMP inhibitor GM 6001 was administered at 6 and 7 d postinjury, during elevated MT 5 -MMP/ADAM- 10 expression and synapse regeneration. MMP inhibition showed: 1) reduced ADAM- 10 and elevated N-cadherin protein expression, generating profiles similar to 15 d post-UEC, 2) attenuation of deficits in the initiation phase of long-term potentiation, and 3) improved hippocampal dendritic and synaptic ultrastructure. Collectively, our results provide evidence that membrane-bound MMPs and N-cadherin influence both adaptive and maladaptive plasticity in a time and injury-dependent manner. Inhibition of membrane-bound MMPs during maladaptive plasticity produces more adaptive conditions, improving synaptic efficacy and structure. Thus, targeting MMP function and expression have potential to translate maladaptive plasticity into an adaptive process, facilitating improved recovery...|$|E

Surprisingly, we found that Cdk 5 loss of function in hippocampal circuits results in severe impairments in memory formation and retrieval. Moreover, Cdk 5 loss of function in the hippocampus disrupts cAMP signaling due to an aberrant increase in phosphodiesterase (PDE) proteins. Dysregulation of cAMP is associated with defective CREB phosphorylation and disrupted composition of synaptic proteins in Cdk 5 -deficient mice.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the role of}} postsynaptic protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) in regulating synaptic strength by loading CA 1 pyramidal cells either with peptides that disrupt PP 1 binding to synaptic targeting proteins or with active PP 1. The peptides blocked synaptically evoked LTD but {{had no effect on}} basal synaptic currents mediated by either AMPA or NMDA receptors. They did, however, cause an increase in synaptic strength following the induction of LTD. Similarly, PP 1 had no effect on basal synaptic strength but enhanced LTD. In cultured neurons, synaptic activation of NMDA receptors increased the proportion of PP 1 localized to synapses. These results suggest that PP 1 does not significantly regulate basal synaptic strength.

CDKL 5 loss-of-function murine models recapitulate pathological signs of the human disease, such as visual attention deficits and reduced visual acuity. Here we investigated the cellular and <b>synaptic</b> <b>substrates</b> of visual defects by studying {{the organization of the}} primary visual cortex (V 1) of Cdkl 5 -/y mice. We found a severe reduction of c-fos expression in V 1 of Cdkl 5 -/y mutants, suggesting circuit hypoactivity. Glutamatergic presynaptic structures were increased, but postsynaptic PSD- 95 and Homer were significantly downregulated in CDKL 5 mutants. Interneurons expressing parvalbumin, but not other types of interneuron, had a higher density in mutant V 1, and were hyperconnected with pyramidal neurons. Finally, the developmental trajectory of pavalbumin-containing cells was also affected in Cdkl 5 -/y mice, as revealed by fainter appearance perineuronal nets at the closure of the critical period. The present data reveal an overall disruption of V 1 cellular and synaptic organization that may cause a shift in the excitation/inhibition balance likely to underlie the visual deficits characteristic of CDKL 5 disorder.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Parkinson disease (PD) is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease. It is characterized by loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra, which causes loss of dopaminergic synapses onto striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Dendritic spines that are localized to these striatal MSNs receive synaptic inputs from both the nigral dopamine neurons and cortical glutamate neurons. Signaling downstream of excitatory, glutamatergic drive is modulated by dopamine. This tripartite connection: glutamate, dopamine, and MSN dendritic spine, is important for normal motor function. Glutamate released from presynaptic terminals binds to and activates two classes of inotropic glutamate receptors that are localized to dendritic spines on striatal MSNs: the α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Once these receptors are activated, they allow for Ca 2 + influx, which in turn activates Ca 2 +-dependent processes that underlie neural plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Proper machinery in the pre- and post-synaptic neurons is required for normal signal transduction. Moreover, this signal transduction requires proper organization of synaptic proteins, which is achieved by specific protein-protein interactions. These protein-protein interactions are dynamic and can be modulated under various conditions, including pathological changes in the phosphorylation status of a specific protein. Catalytically active proteins called phosphatases and kinases specifically regulate the phosphorylation status of synaptic proteins. Pathologically, in PD there is increased autophosphorylation and activation of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This increased phosphorylation may be due to changes in the activity of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1), a highly conserved protein serine/threonine phosphatase that has a diverse set of functions in eukaryotes. Serine/threonine phosphatase substrate specificity is obtained via interactions with targeting and regulatory proteins. One such protein, spinophilin, is a scaffolding protein that targets PP 1 to various <b>synaptic</b> <b>substrates</b> to regulate their phosphorylation.

Rumpel et al. {{draw the}} important conclusions that “encoding of memories in the lateral amygdala is mediated by AMPA receptor trafficking” and that “synaptic incorporation of AMPARs is necessary for learning. ” The key experiment {{used to test the}} importance of the AMPA receptor trafficking involved the overexpression of a recombinant AMPA receptor fragment comprising 81 amino acids of the COOH-terminus of GluR 1 and {{is referred to as the}} “plasticity- block” vector. This fragment is rich in protein-protein interaction sites (including PDZ, Forkhead-associated, 14 - 3 - 3 domain, and ERK and PDK docking sites) and phosphorylation sites for several kinases (PKA, PDK 1, CamKII). The overexpression of this plasticity block vector will interfere with these kinases and protein interactions. Because these kinases and protein interactions are well known to regulate many <b>synaptic</b> (and nonsynaptic) <b>substrates</b> other than GluR 1, it should not be assumed that only AMPA receptors are inhibited by the plasticity block vector. For example, PKA and CamKII phosphorylate multiple ion channels, enzymes, and scaffold proteins (1, 2). These experiments do not therefore prove that AMPA trafficking is either necessary or sufficient for learning. A possible conclusion would be that AMPA receptor trafficking can occur with learning, and further work is necessary before its role in learning is established. ...|$|R

The amplitude of the endplate potentials were reduced by as much as 90 % during bath application of phosphoramidon, a specific inhibitor of metalloendoproteases, and by carbobenzoxy-dipeptide-amide synthetic substrates for metalloendoproteases.

Synthetic <b>substrates</b> in which proline or glycine provided the amino group of the peptide bond, which are not metalloendoprotease substrates, had little or no effect on the amplitude of end-plate potentials.

In addition, synthetic dipeptides with free carboxyl or amino termini, which have a low affinity for metalloendoproteases, also had little effect on synaptic transmission. The inhibition of synaptic transmission by phosphoramidon and the synthetic substrates occurred within 2 to 3 min and was completely reversible. Neither phosphoramidon nor the synthetic substrates altered the dose-response characteristics of the postsynaptic membrane to bath-applied carbachol.
