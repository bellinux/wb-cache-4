25|$|Potatoes are {{generally}} grown from seed potatoes – these are tubers specifically grown to be disease free and provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, {{the areas where}} seed potatoes are grown are selected with care.

Unfortunately, solar radiation measurement instruments are costly and require proper maintenance and calibration. Therefore, solar radiation data are not readily available to the designers of solar energy systems, decision makers, or the investors. Being a developing country, Bangladesh has very less investment in technology to measure solar radiation all over the country. In fact, there is no solar radiation measurement instrument installed in any station of Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD 2015).

Climate data were taken from six climate stations of four District which have different climate type (Oldeman) namely Jeneponto District (D/E), Bulukumba District (D), Wajo District (E) and East Luwu (A/B). The highest average productivity can be found in the southern region with relatively dry climate, while the lowest productivity is in the northern region with relatively wet (humid).
