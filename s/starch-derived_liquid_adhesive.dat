40|$|Common {{available}} conductive adhesives {{are filled}} with about 70 - 90 weight percent of silver particles. There is the technical need to lower the filler content for decreasing the viscosity and the pressure to finally decrease the costs for the highly expensive silver. Our approach to decrease the silver content with {{at the same time}} similar conductivity was to use nano-sized silver particles with different modified surfaces to obtain self-organized distribution of the silver particles in the <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> film followed by conventional curing techniques like temperature or UV curing. Through the self-organization, a bridging of the particles should be achieved which gives a similar conductivity as in highly filled commercial adhesives which follows percolation theory. The influence of the surface modification on the strength of the interaction between differently modified silver particles and the distribution in the <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> was simulated with Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). Surface modification was verified with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The distribution of the silver particles in the cured adhesive film was investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ...|$|R

Twelve {{of these were}} treated through the inferior petrosal sinus and one through the superior ophthalmic vein. In one patient, both approaches were used. The embolic agents were as follows: five patients had balloons only, four patients had minicoils alone, three patients had coils and <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesives,</b> one had balloons and coils, and one had balloons and <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Among the patients who were treated from a transvenous approach, three had an occluded carotid artery caused by trauma, nine failed transarterial balloon attempts, and one had a prior trapping procedure. In the remaining patient, who had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a transarterial approach was judged to be too dangerous. This patient suffered a fatal pontine hemorrhage after subtotal transvenous occlusion of the carotid cavernous fistula with diversion of flow into cortical veins. Another complication occurred when the inferior petrosal sinus was perforated during catheterization, causing a small subarachnoid hemorrhage. The tear was immediately closed with minicoils, and surgical exposure and embolization resulted in complete cure. Of the remaining 12 patients treated, 11 were completely cured an...|$|R

This is the fundamental basis to understand the bonding between adhesive and wood for wood-based composites. For a more porous woody material, such as poplar, a portion of adhesive can over-penetrate the woody surface and others stay on the veneer surface for bonding purpose. Hence, the adhesive materials can penetrate into the cells which upon curing form an anchor (see Fig.  5 b), at the same time leaving some parts of the adhesives on the veneer surface for adhesive transfer and bond formation with the adjacent veneer surface.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Diaphragm-based {{fibre optic}} {{pressure}} sensors can offer high {{temporal and spatial}} resolution pressure measurements at modest cost, but they can suffer from the detrimental effects of temperature cross-sensitivity. A simple construction for these sensors involves a zirconia ferrule as the substrate for a polished copper foil diaphragm, and a <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> as the bonding layer between the two. It is proposed that elimination of the adhesive layer {{through the use of}} direct bonding techniques, such as electroplating or ultrasonic welding, could reduce the temperature sensitivity. The thermal sensitivity of two types of sensor – one with and one without an adhesive layer – is studied using finite element modelling.

30|$|To conclude, a {{substitution}} of 50 % UF resin by solid microspheres (ratio 1 : 1) is possible, without impairing the bonding quality of solid wood joints. This opens {{the option of}} adding {{a huge amount of}} spherical particles directly into a bond line as carrier for, e.g., formaldehyde catchers or self-healing substances. Lap shear strength indicates the quality of a wood joint and was tested at different substitution degrees and temperatures, where it did not underperform against the unmodified adhesive. The spheres did not influence the chemical curing of UF but if added, the penetration of <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> into wood was decreased by 50 %. The finding that adhesive stays closer to the bond line could be preferable if self-healing substances are added to repair damaged glue joints, but this is topic of further research.|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{experimental and}} simulative {{aspects of a}} novel method {{for the production of}} piezo-metal-compounds are presented in order to enhance the series capability of their former manufacturing process. These compounds are sandwich constructions with a piezomodule between two aluminum sheets. Until recently a still <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> surrounded the piezomodule to protect it from damage during forming of the compound and an already solidified adhesive in the outer regions assured the patch fixation. Now the studied novel method employs only one adhesive which takes over both functions at the same time. In order to assure this double function a local pre-curing is pursued. The paper focuses on the local activation of the curing reaction of adhesives using higher temperatures. Hence, a device with a heating and a cooling zone was employed to adjust different temperature fields within one bonded sandwich sheet. Finally, sandwich compounds with partially cured and partially <b>liquid</b> areas of <b>adhesive</b> are manufactured. Moreover, a thermo-chemically coupled continuum mechanical model for adhesives is implemented into ANSYS® and allows for finite element analysis of this spatially graded curing with its heat flow caused by both, local activation and exothermal reaction heat. Hence, alternative production strategies can be evaluated at an early stage of the process development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a highly reliable macro to micro domain interconnection technology for microfluidic applications using Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) casting techniques. Characteristic to the interconnectors are long flanges fabricated in the PDMS film; therefore the contact area between PDMS and tubes is considerably increased {{compared to other}} interconnection technologies. Thus, both glass capillaries and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubes can be held in position very reliably and rigidly. To test {{the reliability of the}} interconnectors, PTFE tubes were successfully connected to microfluidic chips without the aid of any <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Both leakage and pull-out tests demonstrated the functionality and reliability of the PDMS interconnectors; no leakage was detected under a working pressure up to 400 kPa. A pull-out test yielded a pull-out force of 22. 45 N. Furthermore, once a casting mould is fabricated, it can be re-used as a template repeatedly achieving a low cost technology and making it suitable for batch production...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to penetration depth, also {{the variability of}} penetration depth was significantly reduced at the modified variant, indicating a distinct concentration of adhesive close to the specimen surface. One explanation {{could be that the}} microspheres remain on the specimen surface, being solid bodies unable to penetrate the solid wood structure due to the above-micron size. It is proposed that due to the large specific surface area, substantial amounts of <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> adsorb to the surface of microspheres and consequently remain immobilised at the wood surface, reducing overall penetration. In good agreement with a recent study on UF-adhesive modified with microfibrillated cellulose [18] it is proposed that the concentration of adhesive at the specimen surface, provided by UF-microsphere addition, enables the formation of bonds with strength similar to unmodified adhesive. There only a fraction of adhesive contributes to bond formation while a substantial amount of resin penetrates deeply into the bulk and does not contribute to bonding.|$|R

A compound polymer was prepared based on mixing ratio of poly (amideamine) -epichlorohydrin resin (PAE) as an adhesive agent, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a modifier agent, and cationic fatty acid (CFA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as release agents. In order {{to simulate the}} Yankee dryer cylinder, the adherence of paper to the substrate that was coated by the compound polymer solution was measured using a peel strength test. Results indicated that increasing the percent of total solid content of compound polymer would increase peel strength of paper. Peel strength of paper increases if EG as a release agent is used.

40|$|Purpose: We {{assessed}} {{the usefulness of}} superselective angiography in patients with micro-arteriovenous malformations. Patients and Methods: Five patients had superselective angiography for either diagnosis or treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations having a nidus of less than 1 em. All patients presented with an intracerebral hematoma. Results: In one patient superselective angiography confirmed {{the presence of a}} shunt that was suspected due to visualization of an early vein on the follow-up angiogram; in another patient superselective angiography was helpful in defining the topography of the malformation; in the remaining three patients, superselective angiography was used for embolization of the malformation. We were unsuccessful in achieving a complete angiographic cure in these 3; however, superselective angiography revealed an aneurysm in one that was obliterated by the <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> embolic agent. Conclusion: With the recent advances in microcatheters, superselective angiography has a promising role in defining the topography and angioarchitecture of micro-arteriovenous malformations. Micro-arteriovenous malformations may not be angiographically evident at the time of initial hemorrhage due to the hematoma.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effectiveness, initial and long term, of {{embolization}} using polyvinol alcohol particles (PV A) particles {{in patients with}} spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (SDA VF). Methods: The initial treatment in 14 patients with SDA VF was embolization with PV A particles. Postembo-lization occlusion of the SDA VF was documented angiographically in all cases. Results: All 14 patients initially showed an improvement in clinical symptoms, but the neurologic status of 11 patients subsequently deteriorated. Of the 11 patients who had recurrence of symptoms, nine had angiographically proven recurrences of their SDA VF while two had negative follow-up of spinal angiography. PV A embolization is ineffective {{for the treatment of}} SDA VF and is not without risk. Conclusion: On the basis of a literature review of the other two alternative treatments (operation or <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> embolization) available for SDA VF and our preliminary experience with N-butyl cyanoacylate (NBCA) embolization, we suggest that NBCA embolization be the initial treatment of choice for SDA VF; if that procedure is not possible, or is unsuccessful, then operation is recommended.

The effects of adhesives on the mechanical properties of acrylic were studied. The results reveal that both adhesives have excellent bonding properties to acrylic. The stress-solvent crazing value of J- 351 {{is higher than}} that of SY- 50 s. With the application of adhesive on the surface, mechanical properties of acrylic are declined. Casting acrylic shows more drastic decline than that of oriented acrylic. Through the characterization of fracture surface, we find that fracture of tensile sample derives from the side with adhesive. Mechanical properties of acrylic are more sensitive to SY- 50 s, because the <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesive</b> presents integrate bonding interface with acrylic. The interface between J- 351 and acrylic is clear, making acrylic insensitive to J- 351 film.

The increased {{resistance of the}} glued test pieces is the consequence of adhesive being present in the bond, soas of altered wood properties, mainly the increased density and locally decreased wood hygroscopicity, resulting {{as a consequence of}} wood exposed to the gluing conditions. Using an unsteady-state method, the diffusion coefficients were defined. The kinetics of absorption of the massive beech test pieces, glued test pieces (PVAc, UF, MUF, PRF and epoxy <b>liquid</b> <b>adhesives</b> and PF film were used), and parallel ones with no glue bonds but exposed to the gluing conditions, were compared. It was established that the thin glue bonds made by using liquid glues do not present a barrier, which could effectively hinder the transition of bound water into the glued piece. A higher resistance was presented just by FF glue film bonds. There exist statistically significant differences among diffusion coefficients, calculatedby analytical solutions and solutions of an equation of the first order model. Transverse diffusion of water vapour and bound water can be described as the first order system...|$|R

However, in any study of adhesive joint durability, failure near the adhesive/substrate interface becomes an important consideration. In the current study, an interfacially debonding adhesive test, the notched coating adhesion (NCA) test, was applied to LaRC(trademark) PETI- 5 adhesive bonded to chronic acid anodized (CAA) Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Post-failure analysis of the interphase region included X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
