40|$|Fungal {{activities}} of food additives, potassium sorbate, <b>methylparaben,</b> <b>sodium</b> benzoate, propylparaben, sorbic acid and plant activators harpin-protein and potassium dioxide were comparatively examined with ipradion in vitro conditions on two isolates of Botrytis cinerea obtained from strawberry fruits. Food additives and plant activators showed inhibitory effect {{at different levels}} on the mycelial growth of fungus isolates. According to the Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC), sorbic acid (300 μg mL - 1 for each isolate) and comparison fungicide ipradion (10 μg mL - 1 for each isolate) displayed the highest inhibition effect on the radial mycelial growth of fungal isolates. Similar efficacy was obtained at the highest dose (1000 μg mL - 1) from other additives propylparaben (for both isolates), potassium sorbet and methylparaben (for isolate 1) and from plant activator potassium oxide. It was detected that all alternative substances has high inhibition activity according to ED 50 values. Methylparaben, harpin-protein and potassium oxide revealed efficacies similar to ipradion. While harpin-protein {{did not have any}} effect on B. Cinerea germination, other alternative substances excluding potassium sorbate inhibited germination completely at differing doses. Potassium oxide and food additives except potassium sorbate inhibited the spore germination of isolates by 50 % at doses between 25 - 345 μg mL - 1. MIC value of ipradion on spore germination of isolate- 1 and isolate- 2 was determined as 10 and 30 μg mL - 1, while ED 50 values were determined as 2. 9 and 12. 5 μg mL - 1, respectively. Data obtained from the research verified that food additives may be used in traditional and organic agriculture individually, or in appropriate combination with each other or with fungicides. Moreover, the study put forth that harpin-protein and potassium oxide not only activate plants against pathogens, but they may also have toxic effect on different growth periods of fungus. Although ipradion works only with two isolates, its MIC and ED 50 values were considered noteworthy in terms of the resistance risk of B. cinerea...|$|R
40|$|Many Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) {{such as the}} {{antiviral}} agent famciclovir (FCV) {{are required}} for paediatric treatment but are not commercially available in age-appropriate dosage forms. It is common practice to prepare oral liquid dosage forms using commercially available tablets, capsules or powdered API and then dispersing or dissolving the crushed and/or powdered materials in a vehicle that the patient can swallow. Vehicles that are commonly {{used for this purpose}} include methylcellulose, syrup or combinations of these carriers where possible or commercially available suspending agents such as Ora-Sweet®, if available, can be used. However, several critical factors are overlooked when manufacturing extemporaneous formulations including, but not limited to, physical and chemical properties of the API, excipients, compatibility, stability and bioavailability issues. A stability-indicating High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method for the analysis of FCV was developed and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. The method is sensitive, selective, precise, accurate and linear over the concentration range 2 - 120 μg/ml. The stability of 25 mg/ml FCV formulations was assessed in vehicles manufactured from syrup simplex, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), Ora-Sweet® and an aqueous buffer (pH 6) following storage at 25 °C/ 60 % RH and 40 °C/ 75 % RH over six (6) to eight (8) weeks. The shelf life of the products was calculated as the longest period of storage for approximately 90 % of the added FCV to be recovered. Formulations were manufactured using syrup simplex or HPMC with methylparaben and propylparaben individually or in combination and with sodium metabisulphite, ascorbic acid or citric acid as antioxidants. The resultant products were subject to quality control analysis for API content, viscosity, pH and appearance and the resultant data were subject to statistical analysis. The degradation rates were calculated for each product and a degradation profile plotted. The degradation rates of FCV in extemporaneous formulations were compared to those of FCV manufactured using a commercially available suspending agent and a buffered vehicle. FCV undergoes major degradation in the presence of sucrose, as observed for formulations in which the vehicle was syrup and Ora-Sweet®. FCV was found to be most stable when dissolved/dispersed in an HPMC vehicle incorporating sodium metabisulphite and a combination of parabens. The formulation that exhibited the maximum stability was manufactured using an aqueous solution buffered to pH 6. Due to the enhanced stability of FCV when added to a buffered vehicle a formulation in which an HPMC vehicle buffered to pH 6 with <b>sodium</b> metabisulphite, <b>methylparaben</b> and propylparaben was selected for optimisation using a Central Composite Design approach (CCD). In this way it was possible to establish a relationship between input variables such as pH, % w/v HPMC, % w/v antioxidant and % w/v preservative and the responses selected for monitoring by means of response surface modelling. A quadratic model was found to be the most appropriate to describe the relationship between input and output variables. Thirty batches of product were randomly manufactured according to the CCD and analysed to establish the stability in respect of viscosity, pH and the amount of FCV remaining following storage and the data were fitted to models using Design-Expert® software. A correlation between input variables and the responses was best described by a quadratic polynomial model. Analysis of Variance indicated that the response surface models were significant (P-value < 0. 0001). The pH to which a FCV formulation was buffered was the most significant factor to effect the % drug content and the ultimate pH of the formulation, while the % w/v HPMC had the most significant effect on the viscosity of the product. The optimum composition for the manufacture of an oral liquid FCV formulation was predicted using the optimisation function of the Design-Expert® software. A low % error of prediction was established, indicating that the model is robust and that RSM is an appropriate formulation optimisation tool as it has a high prognostic ability. A liquid FCV formulation was developed, optimised and found to be suitable for its intended purpose. However further optimisation is required in respect of colourants, sweeteners and/or flavourants. The approach followed is useful in ensuring the development of quality products and can be applied in future...|$|R
