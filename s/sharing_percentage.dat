50|$|While Medicare {{continued}} to offer FFS, ACOs can {{choose one of}} two payment models (one-sided or two-sided model) based {{on the degree of}} risk and potential savings they prefer. A one-sided model ACO shared savings for the first two years and savings or losses during the third year. The maximum <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage</b> for this model is 50%. In a two-sided model, ACOs shared in savings and losses for all three years. In both cases, ACO savings must exceed 2% in order to qualify for shared savings. The maximum <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage</b> for this model is 60%. In both models the shared loss cap is 5% in the first year, 7.5% in the second year, and 10% in the third year. Aspects regarding financial risk and shared savings were altered in the final regulations.|$|E

This could be accomplished by any combination of elective deferrals and profit sharing contributions. TRA86 introduced an elective deferral limit of $7000, indexed to inflation. Since the profit <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage</b> must be uniform for all employees, this had the intended result of making more equitable contributions to 401(k)'s {{and other types of}} DC pension plans.|$|E
50|$|As per {{the interstate}} {{agreement}} for Inchampalli joint project, Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana) shall bear 78.1% {{cost of the}} dam, land & asset acquisition (including that of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh governments) and rehabilitate the displaced population. But it can draw 2,265 million m³ (80 tmc) from the reservoir and also another 27% (nearly 500 tmc) of water inflows for hydro power generation or irrigation from the reservoir. With this, the only option left for Telangana is to plan lift irrigation projects by using water from the reservoir {{as most of the}} cultivable lands in the state are located above the reservoir water level. The interstate agreement is concluded without fixing the FRL of the reservoir and liberty is accorded to Telangana state to decide the FRL keeping cost and benefits <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage</b> same. The agreed terms would be attractive to Telangana only in case the reservoir capacity is of the order of 1,000 tmc. The approximate land submergence is 2,000 km2 for 1,000 tmc capacity reservoir.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the income distribution among rice-based farming households in Okigwe Agricultural Zone of Imo State, Nigeria. A sample of 120 rice-based farmers was selected by multistage sampling technique. Data were collected with a well structured questionnaire administered to 120 randomly selected rice farmers. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Gini-coefficient model was also employed. The socio-economic characteristic of the farmers revealed that majority of the farmers were educated. Besides, majority of them also hadappreciable experience in rice farming which makes them better rice farmers. It was revealed that income <b>share</b> <b>percentage</b> of the richest households was 17. 65 % followed by the second richest group with income <b>share</b> <b>percentage</b> of 13. 27 %.

40|$|To {{tackle the}} {{challenge}} of providing higher data rates within limited spectral resources we {{consider the case of}} multiple operators sharing a common pool of radio resources. Four algorithms are proposed to address co-primary multi-operator radio resource sharing under heterogeneous traffic in both centralized and distributed scenarios. The performance of these algorithms is assessed through extensive system-level simulations for two indoor small cell layouts. It is assumed that the spectral allocations of the small cells are orthogonal to the macro network layer and thus, only the small cell traffic is modeled. The main performance metrics are user throughput and the relative amount of shared spectral resources. The numerical results demonstrate the importance of coordination among co-primary operators for an optimal resource sharing. Also, maximizing the spectrum <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage</b> generally improves the achievable throughput gains over non-sharing...|$|E

40|$|In {{the next}} years, France will renew a {{consistent}} share of hydroelectric concessions, among which we find those {{insisting on the}} Aspe and its tributaries (for a total of almost 100 MW). Beauty contests will take place, where bidders will present offers for technical and environmental improvements, {{as well as a}} revenue <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage</b> for Local Authorities. This framework generates a potential trade-off between revenue-sharing and environmental improvement. Our work investigates this trade-off by means of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to estimate people's preferences. The experiment has been conducted on a representative sample living in the Aspe valley. In our DCE, we translate the revenue sharing in an immediate rebate in the electricity bill. Respondents could choose higher rebates and lower ecosystem improvements or lower (or no) rebate and higher ecosystem amelioration. According to the experiment results, the highest total willingness to pay (WTP) is above € 144 per household and per year. Moreover, people's marginal WTP for a satisfactory fish stock reaches 250 €/year, that is three times the maximum rebate that was offered. Finally, all environmental attributes are considered as significant and worth a monetary effort. Therefore, hydroelectric concession bidders should give clear priority to environmental aspects...|$|E
40|$|In {{monopulse}} radar antennas, the synthesizing {{process of}} the sum and difference patterns must be fast enough to achieve good tracking of the targets. At the same time, the feed networks of such antennas must {{be as simple as}} possible for efficient implementation. To achieve these two goals, an iterative fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is used to synthesize sum and difference patterns with the main focus on obtaining a maximum allowable <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage</b> in the element excitations. The synthesizing process involves iterative calculations of FFT and its inverse transformations; that is, starting from an initial excitation, the successive improved radiation pattern and its corresponding modified element excitations can be found repeatedly until the required radiation pattern is reached. Here, the constraints are incorporated in both the array factor domain and the element excitation domain. By enforcing some constraints on the element excitations during the synthesizing process, the described method provides a significant reduction in the complexity of the feeding network while achieving the required sum and difference patterns. Unlike the standard optimization approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), the described algorithm performs repeatedly deterministic transformations on the initial field until the prescribed requirements are satisfied. This property makes the proposed synthesizing method converge much faster than GA...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of ratings on an emerging software application market, app market. Given the nature of software application as experience good and the general scarcity of other quality signals such as advertising or branding for majority of app developers, consumers ' ex ante belief on app utility essentially relies on the app rating which itself {{is derived from the}} ex post utility received by peer consumers. We develop an analytical framework which explicitly characterizes this bidirectional ratingutility conversion process, also named as consumer rating behavior, with a new concept "reservation rating. " After integrating consumer rating behavior into consumer's utility formation, we derive the market equilibrium and reveal how the changes in consumer rating behavior affect developers and platform owner's profits and how both developers and the platform owner should optimally react to various consumer rating behaviors in terms of the choices of app price, quality level and revenue <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage.</b> We also reveal how changes in consumer rating behavior would impact the social welfare, suggesting consumers ' responsibility, in terms of proper rating behavior, to the overall goodness of app community. The rating-dependent utility function further enables us to derive a self-selection mechanism to achieve the separating equilibrium in which high and low cost rate developers choose differentiated revenue sharing percentages...|$|E

40|$|We study a risk {{management}} {{problem in the}} scenario of ship procurement. A shipping firm faces a certain financing pressure for the procurement of a new ship. On the other hand, {{the capacity of the}} ship excesses the demand requirement of the firm. The firm wants to reduce the payment and control the risk by selling a percentage of capacity to another shipping company. We introduce an auction mechanism for the firm to select the partner and determine the <b>sharing</b> <b>percentage.</b> Acting as the auctioneer, the firm announces a certain percentage of capacity to a set of buyers. The payment from the buyer is determined as the highest bid level except the winning price in a second-price auction. The bidding strategy depends on two signals: the demand and financial fiction. For both the risk-neutral and risk-averse utility functions, we find the unique equilibrium for buyers, and the unique percentage of sharing capacity for the auctioneer. Our new policy not only reduces the cost of financial fiction, but also increases the overall utilization of ship capacity. The numerical experiments illustrate that the percentage of the payments from auction is usually higher than the percentage of the capacity shared to the partner. The firm improves the performance significantly through our auction mechanism...|$|E
