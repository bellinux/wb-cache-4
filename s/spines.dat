5|$|The <b>spines</b> of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all the <b>spines</b> {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most <b>spines</b> are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened <b>spines</b> (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked <b>spines.</b> Sometimes, one or more central <b>spines</b> are hooked, while outer <b>spines</b> are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the <b>spines</b> resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural <b>spines</b> of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the <b>spines</b> represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the <b>spines</b> were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral <b>spines</b> remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested the <b>spines</b> represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted the neural <b>spines</b> supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of the <b>spines.</b> The presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a striation pattern {{on the surface of}} the <b>spines</b> similar to the bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that the <b>spines,</b> if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior <b>spines</b> forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the <b>spines</b> could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed <b>spines</b> might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the <b>spines</b> may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their <b>spines</b> for neck wrestling.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Degenerative <b>spine</b> {{disorders}} are steadily increasing {{parallel to the}} aging of the population with considerable impact on cost and productivity. In this paper we study the prevalence and risk factors for multiple <b>spine</b> surgery and its impact on cost. Methods: Data on 1, 153 <b>spine</b> surgery inpatients operated between October 2005 and September 2008 (index <b>spine</b> surgery) in regard to the number of previous <b>spine</b> surgeries and location of surgeries (cervical or lumbar) were retrospectively collected. Additionally, prospective follow-up over a period of 2 - 5 years was conducted. Results: Retrospectively, 365 (31. 7 %) patients were recurrent <b>spine</b> surgery patients while 788 (68. 3 %) were de novo <b>spine</b> surgery patients. Nearly half of those with previous <b>spine</b> surgery (51. 5 %) were on different regions of the <b>spine.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} length of stay or hospital charges except in lumbar decompression and fusion (LDF) patients with multiple interventions on the same region of the <b>spine.</b> Significant differences (P<. 05) in length of stay (5. 4 days vs. 7. 4 days) and hospital charges ($ 55, 477 vs. $ 74, 878) between LDF patients with one previous <b>spine</b> versus those with ≥ 3 previous <b>spine</b> surgeries on the same region were noted. Prospectively, the overall reoperation rate was 10. 4 %. The risk of additional <b>spine</b> surgery increased from 8. 0 % in patients with one previous <b>spine</b> surgery (index surgery) to 25. 6 % in patients with ≥ 4 previous <b>spine</b> surgeries on different regions of the <b>spine</b> (including index surgery). After excluding patients with previous <b>spine</b> surgeries on different regions of the <b>spine,</b> 17. 2 % of reoperated patients had additional <b>spine</b> surgery on a different <b>spine</b> region. The percentage of additional <b>spine</b> surgery on a distant <b>spine</b> region increased from 14. 0 % in patients with one <b>spine</b> surgery to 33. 0 % in patients with two <b>spine</b> surgeries on the same region. However, in patients with three or more <b>spine</b> surgeries on the same <b>spine</b> region there were no interventions on a distant <b>spine</b> region during the follow-up period. Conclusion: De novo <b>spine</b> surgery is associated with an increased incidence of additional <b>spine</b> surgery at the same or distant <b>spine</b> regions. Large prospective studies with extended follow-up periods and multifaceted cost-outcome analysis are needed to refine the appropriateness of <b>spine</b> surgery...|$|R

5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural <b>spines</b> of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system.

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, adult males {{of the species}} were characterized by greatly enlarged upper arms (humerus) with a bony ridge covered by skin and black keratinized <b>spines.</b> <b>Spines</b> were also present on the upper surface of the area just before the thumbs.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{cautious}} outlook towards neck injuries {{has been}} the norm to avoid missing cervical <b>spine</b> injuries. Consequently {{there has been an}} increased use of cervical <b>spine</b> radiography. The Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule was proposed to reduce unnecessary use of cervical <b>spine</b> radiography in alert and stable patients. Our aim was to see whether applying the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule reduced the need for cervical <b>spine</b> radiography without missing significant cervical <b>spine</b> injuries. Methods This was a retrospective study conducted in 2 hospitals. 114 alert and stable patients who had cervical <b>spine</b> radiographs for suspected neck injuries were included in the study. Data on patient demographics, high risk & low risk factors as per the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule and cervical <b>spine</b> radiography results were collected and analysed. Results 28 patients were included in the high risk category according to the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule. 86 patients fell into the low risk category. If the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule was applied, {{there would have been a}} significant reduction in cervical <b>spine</b> radiographs as 86 / 114 patients (75. 4 %) would not have needed cervical <b>spine</b> radiograph. 2 / 114 patients who had significant cervical <b>spine</b> injuries would have been identified when the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule was applied. Conclusion Applying the Canadian Cervical <b>Spine</b> rule for neck injuries in alert and stable patients would have reduced the use of cervical <b>spine</b> radiographs without missing out significant cervical <b>spine</b> injuries. This relates to reduction in radiation exposure to patients and health care costs. </p...|$|R

5|$|Many {{species of}} slug caterpillar, Limacodidae, have {{numerous}} protuberances and stinging <b>spines</b> along their dorsal surfaces. Species that possess these stinging <b>spines</b> suffer less predation than larvae that lack them, and a predator, the paper wasp, chooses larvae without <b>spines</b> when given a choice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spines,</b> {{which are}} {{modified}} leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing {{the evolution of}} <b>spines</b> preceded the loss of leaves. Although <b>spines</b> have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. <b>Spines</b> provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near {{the surface of the}} cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration. They can provide some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, <b>spines</b> can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Acrocanthosaurus was its row of tall neural <b>spines,</b> {{located on the}} {{vertebrae}} of the neck, back, hips and upper tail, which could be more than 2.5times {{the height of the}} vertebrae from which they extended. Other dinosaurs also had high <b>spines</b> on the back, sometimes much higher than those of Acrocanthosaurus. For instance, the unrelated Spinosaurus had <b>spines</b> nearly 2meters (6.5ft) tall, about 11 times taller than the bodies of its vertebrae. The lower <b>spines</b> of Acrocanthosaurus had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison, probably forming a tall, thick ridge down its back. The function of the <b>spines</b> remains unknown, although they may have been involved in communication, fat storage, or temperature control. All of its cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae had prominent depressions (pleurocoels) on the sides, while the caudal (tail) vertebrae bore smaller ones. This is more similar to carcharodontosaurids than to Allosaurus.|$|E

30|$|Patients with {{a history}} of {{previous}} lumbar, thoracic or cervical <b>spine</b> surgery, as well as patients with history of <b>spine</b> fractures, dislocations or <b>spine</b> inflammatory diseases were excluded because of the possibility that a previous <b>spine</b> surgery or condition could jeopardize the entire <b>spine</b> biomechanics and thus confound results.|$|R
30|$|After {{confirming}} the timer’s state, the <b>Spine</b> Switch Controller checks the time duration, {{as shown in}} Algorithm 5.

5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the <b>spines</b> is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive <b>spines</b> may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine <b>spines</b> are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short <b>spines,</b> which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{a recent}} paper, smoking {{was shown to}} be an {{independent}} predictor of longterm continued opioid use in <b>spine</b> patients (Krebs et al. 2010). In this paper, we study the interaction of smoking with opioid and antidepressant use and the relationship with prior <b>spine</b> surgery and future <b>spine</b> surgery. Methods: Data on smoking, opioid and antidepressant use were retrospectively collected from 758 <b>spine</b> surgery inpatients [lumbar microdiskectomy (LMD), anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) and lumbar decompression and fusion (LDF) ]. Interaction with history of previous <b>spine</b> surgery and return for additional <b>spine</b> surgery was studied. Followup ranged from one to four years. Results: Significant correlation was detected between smoking and opioid use and between opioid and antidepressant use. History of previous <b>spine</b> surgery correlated with antidepressant use and return for additional <b>spine</b> surgery. Additional <b>spine</b> surgery correlated with opioid use and history of previous <b>spine</b> surgery. Smoking LMD patients on both opioids and antidepressants and smoking ACDF patients on antidepressants who {{have a history of}} prior <b>spine</b> surgery were more likely to return for additional <b>spine</b> surgery. However, in the LDF group, smoking patients on antidepressants without previous <b>spine</b> surgery were more likely to come for another <b>spine</b> surgery. Conclusion: Smokingantidepressantopioid use could be predictive of return for additional <b>spine</b> surgery during the followup years especially if a history of prior <b>spine</b> surgery was reported. Further research is needed on the implications of such an association...|$|R

5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of <b>spines</b> on the back, with an additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of <b>spines</b> at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of <b>spines</b> near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back <b>spines</b> and a pair of <b>spines</b> at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back <b>spines,</b> situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of <b>spines</b> each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E

5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of {{the neck}} had broad neural <b>spines</b> that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural <b>spines</b> had well developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural <b>spines</b> were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural <b>spines</b> had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae.
