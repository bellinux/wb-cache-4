Relationships with social media monitoring companies like Datasift tend to find Lexalyticsâ€™ Salience engine baked into the product itself. Lexalytics is used similarly to monitor sentiment as it relates to stock trading. In December 2014, Lexalytics announced the latest iteration to its sentiment analysis engine, Salience 6. Earlier that year Lexalytics acquired Semantria in a bid to appeal to a wider variety of business models. Created by former Lexalytics Marketing Director Oleg Rogynskyy, Semantria is an SaaS text mining service offered as an API and Excel based plugin that measures sentiment. The goal of the acquisition, which cost Lexalytics less than $10 million USD, was to expand the customer base both within the United States and abroad with multilingual support.|$|E
40|$|Home {{architects and}} {{designers}} use {{many types of}} presentation drawings to convey design ideas. Augmented reality {{is a relatively new}} technology {{that can be used to}} aid in design <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> for residential builders. An augmented reality presentation provides a more complete idea of a design than other presentations such as 3 D model renderings and hand drawn artist sketches. While designers are accustomed to visualizing 2 D plans, this task is difficult for home buyers. This difficulty has been associated with lower spatial ability in people who are not accustomed to reviewing plans. Augmented reality can be used to make visualization easier and help developers save on <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses.</b> The use of augmented reality could lower <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>expense</b> by reducing the number of model homes built to help potential buyers visualize new concepts.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} antecedents and {{consequences}} of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> The results suggest that collaborative <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions have benefits for the organisation in terms of improved business performance. In addition, improvements in collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> will positively affect <b>marketing</b> orientation <b>and</b> leading to superior marketing quality. The research began with {{an exploration of the}} interface between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> through the available literature. The existing research conceptualises the relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> highlights the benefits of interfunctional collaborative behaviour. Therefore, a study was designed to not only identify the antecedents of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> so that the relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> can be assessed and improved to the benefit of the organisation, but also to establish that business performance can be directly influenced by improvements in collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> The research was undertaken through a mixed methodology, utilising exploratory case studies, a large-scale quantitative survey and confirmatory interviews. The data analysis involved four distinct analytical methods: within-case analysis, crosscase analysis, statistical analysis and confirmatory interviews. The large-scale survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was sent to the Managing Directors/Chief Executives of large, UK-based organisations operating in the business-to-business arena. Through the findings from the survey five antecedents to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> were identified - management attitudes towards co-ordination, conflict of interests, communications, <b>market</b> intelligence <b>and</b> organisational learning - and a revised conceptual framework was developed. The correlation and multiple regression analysis confirmed the weighting of each of the independent variables upon collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> established a number of other relationships between the variables. The second part of the research focused on the consequences of improved collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> It was found through the survey that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> may have a positive effect upon business performance. The research also established that marketing orientation was not an antecedent to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> but that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> may have a positive influence on marketing orientation. In addition, it was established that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> has a positive effect on business performance.

Design/methodology/approach â€“ This paper explores the <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> relationship through qualitative research using one-to-one, tripartite interviews with senior executives <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> managers of three, UK-based business-to-business organizations. Findings â€“ The paper indicates that there are two types of factor that affect collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Those that are out of the control of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> staff â€“ management attitudes to coordination, interdepartmental culture and structure and orientation, and four that are internal to the interface â€“ inter-functional conflict, communications, <b>market</b> intelligence <b>and</b> learning. The paper also identifies that senior managers play a critical role in influencing this interface.

40|$|Purpose - The study {{seeks to}} explore the antecedents and {{implications}} of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> further to identify whether there are benefits in terms of business performance of improving collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Three exploratory case studies and {{a review of the}} literature are used to examine the antecedents to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> The case studies allow this fuzzy and undefined area to be clarified and existing theories to be empirically tested. Findings - The study identifies that there are three types of factor influencing collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing: integrators, facilitators, and management attitudes towards coordination. The exploratory case studies establish that senior management plays a pivotal role in creating and improving collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> <b>and</b> that there is a positive correlation between collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> <b>and</b> improved business performance. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are that it is qualitative in nature and the conceptual framework needs be tested through a large-scale survey. In addition, the study considers only large UK organisations and, therefore, future research should consider expanding the study to overseas organisations. Practical implications - There appears to be an established relationship between the level of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> business performance. Further, the attitude of senior managers to improving coordination is critical to influencing collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Originality/value - This study contends that <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> need to collaborate rather than integrate and uses exploratory case studies to support the development of the framework. ...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{into the}} <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> {{interface}} have neglected {{the relationship between}} <b>market</b> orientation <b>and</b> collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> We found that <b>market</b> intelligence processes <b>and</b> management attitudes towards coordination have positive impacts on market orientation, which then has benefits for collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> <b>and</b> business performance. The <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> interface has attracted considerable attention from researchers, but the relationship between <b>market</b> orientation <b>and</b> the level of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> {{has not yet been}} fully explored. This issue is important to help understand how to improve collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> As organizations are competing in increasingly crowded markets with more demanding customers and who are struggling to differentiate their offer from their competitors, the effective operation of the customer-facing interface of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> is critical in helping to achieve success (e. g. Homburg and Jensen, 2007). The objectives of this study are to help understand the relationship between <b>market</b> orientation <b>and</b> collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing; to identify the role of senior management <b>and</b> <b>market</b> intelligence in creating <b>market</b> orientation, <b>and</b> to explore if these variables directly or indirectly impact on business performance. Further, the study aims to contribute to the debate on the <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> interface by bridging gaps found in literature. Evidence from recent studies indicate <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> staff are frequently set individual targets that may pull them in different directions {{and that there is a}} less than optimum working relationship (Dewsnap and Jobber, 2000; Rouzies et al., 2005). Friction can be aggravated by differing perspectives, strong independent cultures and need to maintain independent functionality (Shaprio, 2002; Kotler, Rackham and Krishnaswamy 2006), but <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> still need to coordinate their efforts to maximize the return on their activities <b>and</b> a <b>marketing</b> orientation should facilitate this. If an organization has a market orientation, logic suggests that the organization should be customer orientated and the objectives of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> departments should exhibit greater alignment and ensure that the response to the market is efficient. Senior management need to create an internal culture of cooperation and provide guidance to <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> managers on aligning goals and improving communications. They also have a key role in building an environment that will facilitate the development of <b>market</b> orientation <b>and</b> an understanding of the part that <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> play in achieving organizational objectives. Senior managers also provide <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> with the guidance and tools to enable them to align their activities, share information more efficiently and appreciate each othersâ€™ contribution to achieving objectives. Integrated market intelligence processes enable <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> to understand market conditions more effectively and share information in a structured environment, thereby improving efficiency in responding to customers and competitors. This study explores this topic through a quantitative survey questionnaire sent to Managing Directors/CEOs of large, UK organizations who had separate <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> departments. The study finds an effective market intelligence system that collects <b>and</b> disseminates <b>market</b> information internally positively supports a market orientation, but does not directly impact business performance. A positive senior management attitude towards coordination impacts on marketing orientation, but not directly on business performance or collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Finally, market orientation does have a significant and positive impact on achieving collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> <b>and</b> the findings confirm that this collaboration has a positive and direct impact on business performance. Organizations should not only work to create market orientation, but also need to develop an effective <b>market</b> intelligence system <b>and</b> engender a positive attitude to coordination in senior managers to improving interfunctional collaboration. For too long managers have allowed separate <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> departments to maintain silos, developing their own specialist skills and routines without establishing sufficient links to share and expand joint competences. Collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> is a key element in achieving improvements in business performance...|$|R

The thesis investigates aspects of understanding the importance of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> relationship within a case company, analysing current situation, defining the key players and activities involved in a collaboration process. Academic literature review incorporates key findings about organizational transformation from a product reseller towards a solution provider and the reasons that have initiated that shift. The three main functions that enable successful solution-oriented business operations: management, <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> are examined in the literature review. Special attention is paid to <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> collaboration <b>and</b> its impact of business performance. Based on the academic literature review, the thesis framework is designed in order to examine <b>and</b> enhance <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> collaboration in a solution-oriented organization. The primary data collected through individual interviews with the representatives of the three target groups of the organization is core of the qualitative research conducted in this thesis. The current <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> relationship is captured {{with the use of a}} pre-interview questionnaire. The formulation of research questions as well as interview questions take into consideration the most important aspects of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> collaboration researched in the literature review: an overall solution-oriented strategy of the organization, the management role in solution-oriented organization, <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> collaboration <b>and</b> the impact on business performance of a solution-oriented organization. The research results reveal that a solution-oriented focus needs to be integrated into business operations with the goal to carefully plan internal activities. It is essential to consider both collaborative activities as well as the solutions offered by an organization. For the latter, related information needs to be integrated into the internal processes of a company. Employee empowerment, organizational learning and knowledge sharing needs to be initiated through cross-functional activities. It is essential to eliminate challenges that negatively affect the collaboration process by redesigning internal processes in order to enhance information and communication flow. As a consequence, enhanced <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> relationships have a beneficial impact on business performance of the entire organization...|$|R
