40|$|Results are {{presented}} which show that <b>scribe</b> <b>lane</b> structures can exert a {{significant influence on}} surface-substrate potentials and J-V characteristics measured on a wafer surface in plasma and ion-implant processes. The implications of this phenomenon for comparison of charging damage results obtained with charging test vehicles and product wafers are also discussed. I...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} a novel technique to grow carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on addressable localized areas, at wafer level, on a fully processed CMOS substrate. The CNTs were grown using tungsten micro-heaters (local growth technique) at elevated temperature on wafer scale by connecting adjacent micro-heaters through metal {{tracks in the}} <b>scribe</b> <b>lane.</b> The electrical and optical characterization show that the CNTs are identical and reproducible. We believe this wafer level integration of CNTs with CMOS circuitry enables the low-cost mass production of CNT sensors, such as chemical sensors. ...|$|E
40|$|A CMOS Process Monitor, {{consisting}} of eight basic test structures, has {{been prepared to}} acquire key CMOS parameters to assist in VLSI wafer acceptance. The test structures can be probed using a 2 by N probe pad array and can be arranged to fit into either the interior or the <b>scribe</b> <b>lane</b> of an integrated circuit chip. In order to facilitate the general use of the monitor, a document is being prepared that describes its design, layout, measurement, and analysis. This paper describes the structures included in the monitor, the methodology used to create the monitor, and test results from the monitor...|$|E
40|$|The reduced {{depth of}} focus (DOF) caused by higher {{numerical}} aperture (NA) is making the accuracy of best focus measurement increasingly important. A new overlay pattern is developed herein to precisely measure the best focus of lithographic tools. Specially designed "bar-in-bar " (BIB) was employed to obtain the best focus by using the opposite shifting direction of inner and outer bars when defocused. The inner and outer bars are composed of various pattern sizes. When defocused, the shrinkage of the smaller patterns is more significant {{than that of the}} larger patterns, thus causing the center of gravity to shift. The distribution and pattern sizes are optimized to obtain high reproducibility and sensitive position shifting for various defocus conditions. Employing the special BIB pattern, the best focus, tilting and field curvature can be easily measured via the conventional overlay measurement tool. By adding the special BIB to the <b>scribe</b> <b>lanes</b> of the production wafers, the best focus and tilting of the stepper can be obtained when measuring a layer-to-layer overlay shift, and can then be fed back to the stepper as a reference for following processing wafers...|$|R
40|$|In {{patterning}} the via-hole, uneven hole-size and missing-hole defects {{were identified}} through after etch inspection (AEI), and these defects were characterized as yield killer since {{it led to}} electrical open. Through the after development inspection (ADI) and AEI comparison, the uneven hole-size and missing-hole defects are attributed to the post-developed satellite spots. The distribution of satellite spots always show a strong photo field map that is discovered to correlate with the local pattern density in mask <b>scribe</b> <b>lane.</b> Apart from the possible modifications on pattern density in the <b>scribe</b> <b>lane</b> by retooling the photo mask, this paper describes the work done in reducing the satellite defect. Several development experiments including multiple wafer agitation cycles of dynamic puddle, multiple cycles of scanning rinse, pre-wet before development, wafer rotation speed in rinse, wafer rotation speed in drying and advanced defect reduction (ADR) function of track were carried out. The multiple cycles of scanning rinse coupling with the optimal wafer rotation speed of rinse effectively suppresses the count of satellite spots. Pre spin dry {{in advance of the}} deionized water (DIW) rinse to minimize the pH shock is also effective to reduce the defect count. Multiple cycles of development puddle and scanning rinse have a synergy effect to lower defectivity up to complete suppression of satellite defect. To minimize the throughput loss induced by the long development time, ADR is proposed as better candidate for fully eliminating the satellite defect...|$|E
