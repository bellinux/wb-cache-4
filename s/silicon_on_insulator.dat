25|$|Some ICs combine analog {{and digital}} MOSFET {{circuitry}} {{on a single}} mixed-signal integrated circuit, making the needed board space even smaller. This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the digital circuits on a chip level, leading {{to the use of}} isolation rings and <b>silicon</b> <b>on</b> <b>insulator</b> (SOI). Since MOSFETs require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT, fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and MOSFETs into a single device. Mixed-transistor devices are called Bi-FETs (bipolar FETs) if they contain just one BJT-FET and BiCMOS (bipolar-CMOS) if they contain complementary BJT-FETs. Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density.|$|E
25|$|When a {{negative}} gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, {{it creates a}} p-channel at {{the surface of the}} n region, analogous to the n-channel case, but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the threshold value ({{a negative}} voltage for the p-channel) is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a <b>silicon</b> <b>on</b> <b>insulator</b> (SOI) device in which a buried oxide (BOX) is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and a BOX region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel (UTC) region with the source and drain regions formed on either side thereof in and/or above the thin semiconductor layer. Alternatively, the device may comprise a semiconductor on insulator (SEMOI) device in which semiconductors other than silicon are employed. Many alternative semiconductor materials may be employed. When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part, they are referred to as raised source/drain (RSD) regions.|$|E

Nanoribbon structures offer a relatively easy system to access, control and process, due to their relatively larger scale compared to other nanostructures, such as nanowires (NWs) [5], nanodots (NDs) [6] and nanotubes (NTs) [7]. Nanoribbons or thin <b>silicon</b> <b>on</b> <b>insulators</b> have many advantages, such as low leakage and a high on/off current ratio, ION/IOFF, which leads to low power consumption while the device is inactive [8]. In addition, since their parasitic capacitance is effectively eliminated by the underlying insulating layer, nanoribbon- or thin silicon-based devices have advantages for RF applications [9]. Such structures also have a lower threshold shift in response to temperature variations [10 – 13]. However, the reduction in mobility induced by the thermal scattering causes the operation points of the device to vary with the temperature. This temperature-dependent variation of the operation points makes the devices hard to operate properly. [14] For some high-temperature circuits, it is desirable that the individual devices have a specific operation point where the device characteristics show no variation with temperature. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the constant operation of the fabricated devices in the temperature range from 25 to 150 °C. The method employed to achieve the constant operation of the fabricated devices, {{which is similar to}} zero temperature coefficients (ZTC), is based on the use of a substrate bias (VSUB). By accumulating or depleting the carriers on the channel surface using the substrate bias (VSUB), we show that the device on/off characteristics show minimal variation with temperature.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{effects of}} gate length Lg on the {{performance}} of a top gate <b>silicon</b> nanowire <b>on</b> <b>insulator</b> transistor are studied using three dimensional quantum simulation. From the study it is found that the inverse subthreshold slope and on/off current ratio are very sensitive to gate length. Significant improvement in subthreshold slope and on/off current ratio can be achieved using relatively longer gate with thin gate oxide. This improvement in the subthreshold region is due to better control of channel potential with longer gate. As a result of that the tunneling current through the conduction band is significantly suppressed in the subthreshold regime and there is an improvement in the subthreshold slope and on/off current ratio. Performance metrics such as transconductance gm, intrinsic switching delay τS and unity current gain frequency fT of the device are also calculated and it is found that the on state performance of the device degrades with longer gate as all three parameters degrade with increased gate length.
