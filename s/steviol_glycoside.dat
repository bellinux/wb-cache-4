In response, based on a proposed method by the Japan Stevia Association, we developed an improved method by changing the HPLC conditions and including the use of an octadecylsilyl column instead of an amino-bonded column to enable the rapid and reliable determination of the nine <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> by an isocratic HPLC - UV method. With the developed method, the nine <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> can be separately determined, and identified using individual reference chemicals as standards, unlike the previous identifica tion method, which was based on the relative retention times. In addition, the single stevioside quantification standard was replaced with both stevioside and rebaudioside A quantification standards. Importantly, the validation of the de veloped method was successful. The limits of quantification for the nine <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> were between 0. 2 % and 0. 6 %.

40|$|Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is a shrub {{having a}} high content of sweet diterpenoid glycosides in its leaves, mainly stevioside and rebaudioside A, which are used as noncaloric, natural sweeteners.

The potential antioxidant activity of these <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> was also assessed, as oxidative stress is associated with diabetes. Likewise the insulin effect, <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> caused an increase in glucose uptake into rat fibroblasts by activating the PI 3 K/Akt pathway, thus inducing Glut 4 translocation to the plasma membrane.

Moreover, <b>steviol</b> <b>glycosides</b> counteracted oxidative stress by increasing reduced glutathione intracellular levels and upregulating expression and activity of the two antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase.

40|$|Background: <b>Steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> {{biosynthesis}} pathway {{has emerged}} as bifurcation from ent-kaurenoic acid, substrate of methyl erythritol phosphate pathway that also leads to gibberellin biosynthesis. However, the genetic regulation of <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> biosynthesis has not been studied. So, in present study RNA interference (RNAi) based Agrobacterium mediated transient gene silencing (AMTS) approach was followed. SrKA 13 H and three SrUGTs (SrUGT 85 C 2, SrUGT 74 G 1 and SrUGT 76 G 1) genes encoding ent-kaurenoic acid- 13 hydroxylase and three UDP glycosyltransferases of <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> biosynthesis pathway were silenced in Stevia rebaudiana to understand its molecular mechanism and association with gibberellins. Methodology/Principal Findings: RNAi mediated AMTS of SrKA 13 H and three SrUGTs has significantly reduced the expression of targeted endogenous genes as well as total <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> accumulation. While gibberellins (GA 3) content was significantly enhanced on AMTS of SrUGT 85 C 2 and SrKA 13 H. Silencing of SrKA 13 H and SrUGT 85 C 2 was found to block the metabolite flux of <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> pathway and shifted it towards GA 3 biosynthesis. Further, molecular docking of three SrUGT proteins has documented highest affinity of SrUGT 76 G 1 for the substrates of alternate pathways synthesizing steviol glycosides. This could be a plausible reason for maximum reduction in <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> content on silencing of SrUGT 76 G 1 than other genes.

40|$|Stevia rebaudiana is a {{well known}} natural sweetener.

In present study, we analyzed the effect of varying sucrose (1, 3 and 5 %) concentrations on the genes involved in <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> biosynthesis pathway and content of steviol glycosides. The higher endogenous sucrose content in 5 % sucrose treated plants than that in 3 or 1 % treated plants suggested the uptake of exogenously available sucrose by plants.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from May 5, 2016 - May 5, 2017 Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Paraguay and used traditionally by the native Guarani peoples for centuries to sweeten medicinal teas. Stevia has only been commercially cultivated over the past 50 years and cultural practice information suitable for implementation by growers is limited. Currently stevia’s commercial value is found in its <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> content, especially rebaudioside A. Growers seek information to maximize productivity of rebaudioside A through improved cultural practices. Irrigation management {{is one of several}} important agronomic techniques growers can use to obtain maximum yield while also pursuing water use efficiency. The current trial investigated the effect that soil water tension as an irrigation onset criteria had on stevia dry leaf yields, <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> content and yield, and <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> ratios. The experiment was conducted in a field of Owyhee silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Xerollic Camborthid) at the Oregon State University, Malheur Experiment Station, Ontario, Oregon, N 43 ° 58 ' 53. 273 '' W 117 ° 1 ' 26. 396 ''. Two stevia varieties, SW 109 and SW 129 (S&W Seed Company Inc., Fresno, California), were subjected to soil water tension irrigation criteria of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, kPa over a 57 -day trial period. Harvested plant material was measured for dry leaf yield and several steviol glycosides. Analysis of variance showed significant variety differences in leaf yield, leaf stevioside and rebaudioside A content and yield, and <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> ratios (P= 0. 05). Examining the data by analysis of variance, dry leaf yield, stevioside%, rebaudioside C %, total <b>steviol</b> <b>glycoside</b> (TSG), rebaudioside C yield, and TSG % yield had significant higher results among the wetter compared to the drier soil water tension criteria treatments, yet a preferred treatment regime was not was not clearly evident. When comparing varieties by regression analysis, results showed a highly significant decrease in stevioside % content, and an increase in the ratio of rebaudioside A to stevioside from drier to wetter irrigation onset criteria, whereas, rebaudioside A % content did not show any significant trend at differing irrigation criteria. The results indicate that maximizing dry leaf productivity directly affects the total rebaudioside A yield, which in turn can provide increased crop value to the grower. Irrigating near 10 kPa produced higher dry leaf yield and total rebaudioside A yield, than irrigation at drier criteria. Irrigating stevia at 10 kPa at full canopy, the crop coefficient, k[subscript c], was equivalent to 0. 97 ET₀, averaging 6. 4 mm·d⁻¹ for the days measured...|$|E
