The front plate also contains the inlets for the separation buffers and the sample, the outlets for the fractionation tubes and the platinum wires as electrodes. By applying different buffers over the multiple buffer inlets the operator is able to change pH, salt concentrations or composition and therefore the separation conditions over {{the width of the}} chamber. The separation buffers and the sample are applied by peristaltic pumps, to ensure a laminar flow. A high voltage electric field is applied perpendicular to the laminar flow. Analytes in the laminar flow can be separated by charge density and/or isoelectric point. Because of its highly versatile nature, this technique can make use of different modes of electrophoresis, like for example isotachophoresis, isoelectric focusing or (interval) zone electrophoresis.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the work {{presented}} a deposition system on laboratory scale for the fabrication of amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells has been designed and constructed. The system consists of seven metal sealed UHV stainless steel chambers which are linked by pressure stages. Thus the single chambers result in a long vacuum deposition system which provides the suitable deposition zones for the processes needed. In the first two zones TCO(Transparent Conductive Oxide) and metal contacts are deposited by rf magnetron sputtering whereas two of the other zones are used for the deposition of the a-Si:H layers. In the fifth zone a laser patterning system can be coupled in. The Nd:YAG laser system is necessary to fabricate integrated series connected solar modules. Intensive investigation with regard to a broad characterization of the vacuum system has been carried out. For the initiation of a prevacuum, one central dry operating pump has been installed. The regulation of the necessary pressures in the sputtering zones and the PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) zones has been examined successfully. The pressure stages between the deposition zones allow pressure gradients of more than 1 : 1000 between adjacent chambers. For the intended simultaneous processing a critical <b>separation</b> of the <b>chambers</b> under process conditions and without gate valves is indispensable. By means of the specific resistance of the deposited intrinsic layers the cross contamination of the doping gas phosphine as well as diborane, which flow simultaneously in neighboring deposition zones, has been proved in detail. However, the cross contamination has been minimized by appropriate measures. Thus the cross contamination practically lost its influence on the specific resistance of the i-layer. This has been reached without any further chambers or the application of purge gas.

40|$|SiNW FETs and CNT FETs {{have been}} studied as {{candidates}} for integrable biosensors. Both types show sensing capability, CNT FETs even for uncharged molecules. The “top–down” process developed for SiNW FET fabrication gives much freedom in device designing and is fully compatible with CMOS production schemes. Due {{to the fact that}} the SiNW fabrication reported here uses the same structuring techniques as in CMOS processing, it is very reliable. The fabrication of CNT FETs is based on CVD. By this process CNT FETs with interesting device parameters can be reached. Since CVD needs high temperatures it is not compatible with CMOS techniques. CVD growth leads to a mixture of CNT types which results in a low device yield. The contact regions between the nanoscale CNTs and fabricated metal contacts are very critical. Hysteresis, device break down due to metal etching or chemical disruption and instability in liquid environment have been attributed to the Pd–CNT contacts. It was shown that the degradation of CNT FETs can be recovered. With this both device types show good long term stability. The concept of combining the electrolyte–gate with the back–gate, presented in the example of pH sensing on SiNW FETs, enables stable performance in liquid environment. Based on our current experience we propose the following improvements regarding future device design: SiNW FETs: • Improvement in sensitivity could be reached by removing the top oxide locally and by reducing the nanowire width. An optimal width needs to be found for high sensitivity and low device to device fluctuations. • A higher doping, up to 1018 cm− 3, would enhance the contact properties and lower the threshold voltages. But as the screening length LD is reduced, the nanowire width has to be reduced as well. • Control of the nanowire surface by a thin oxide layer or covalent functionalization could help for stabilization and would allow specific sensing. • Differential measurements between a sensing and a reference SiNW FET would allow stable performance. CNT FETs: Especially with respect to stability and to reproducibility further improvements need to be done. Some possible solutions are: • Humidity free fabrication and annealing before the deposition of the metal contact. • Titanium as contact material. Annealing leads to titanium carbide contacts [32] which are less transparent, but expected to be more stable. • Contact passivation has to be very robust and innert. Therefore we suggest to cover the contact region with silicon oxide or silicon nitride. • Increase of the hydrophobicity of the SiO 2 surface by a monolayer of alkane ended molecules. Due to the improved stability in fabrication and performance reported here and with the further improvements suggested above, we can think about possible applications of SiNW FETs and CNT FETs and give an outlook on possible future developments. The high intrinsic sensitivity of CNT FETs is of interest in real time monitoring of minute amount of molecules — or ultimately single molecules — without labelling. In contrast to conventional sensing techniques, such as fluorescence microscopy, the devices can easily be integrated on a micro chip which is of special interest for in vivo experiments where access with optical instruments is limited. Need in current basic research of biophysics can be met this way. However the limited reliability in fabrication and performance of CNT FETs hinders their integration into complex, highly integrated devices or their implementation in industrial products. In contrast to this SiNWs are well suited in this respect. The fabrication is entirely CMOS compatible and very flexible in design. Devices proved to be robust under the conditions of all performed experiments. Depending on the application of interest the sensitivity can be chosen by adjusting the NW size. The SiNW FETs introduced here can be used as transducers for various sensor types. Implementing on–chip micro pH sensors would be the most direct way to an industrial product. For this purpose, two different surface types are needed: a pH–sensitive surface for the working FET and a pH–insensitive surface for a reference FET. Going beyond this into the field of biosensing, specific receptors have to be immobilized. For multiplex sensing, each SiNW in an array has to be functionalized individually. This can be realized by techniques such as microcontact printing [149], dip-pen- [150] or conventional lithography [151] combined with UV assisted Si-H chemistry [152] or by electrical addressing of individual NWs, for example by electrochemical [153] or local heat assisted [154] Si chemistry. In a next step the SiNW sensor array has to be combined with an electronic read out system — preferably implemented on–chip. Further on such a multiplex sensor device can be integrated in a micro fluidic system. Complex micro fluidic systems including actuators such as pumps and valves, <b>separation</b> and mixing <b>chambers,</b> and liquid multiplexing, all on one chip have been reported [155, 156, 157, 158]. Integrated sensors that can be coupled to actuators via integrated electronic control elements can enhance the functionality of such devices. As an example we think of a ring mixer where the liquid is cycled repeatedly. An integrated sensors could not only monitor the mixing, but the product of chemical reactions in situ. Combining the sensors, logic on–chip electronics and micro fluidic actuators would lead to complex, even programmable Lab-On-Chip systems. Such devices could be used for fast and massively parallel analyzing tools — maybe a key technology for systems biology and an opening to the “post microarray area”...|$|R

The <b>separation</b> <b>chamber</b> has two open side beds with inserted electrodes to allow ventilation of gas generated during electrolysis. To hydrodynamically isolate the separation compartment from the side electrodes, a photo-polymerizable monomer solution is exposed to UV light through a slit mask for in situ membrane formation. These so-called salt-bridges resist the pressure driven fluid, but allow ion transport to enable electrical connection. In earlier devices the same was achieved by using open side channel arrays.

The work presented here is a first of a kind study of this newly invented separator and is meant to determine the minimum inlet gas flow rate necessary for a stable vortex inside the separator for different separator geometries. A dimensional scaling analysis was done to predict this minimum inlet gas flow rate. Experiments were performed {{on the ground and}} in conjunction with NASA using their microgravity simulating plane to determine this minimum inlet gas flow rate. The results of the experiments and scaling analysis are compared. The new design consists of two chambers, a vortex generator and a <b>separation</b> <b>chamber,</b> meant to divide the functions of vortex creation and phase separation. The two phase flow is injected tangentially into the vortex generator causing the inlet linear momentum to be transformed into azimuthal momentum. The two phase mixture in the vortex generator then moves into the <b>separation</b> <b>chamber</b> where the two phases separate due to the density difference between the phases. The dimensional scaling analysis used the Weber number to predict the minimum rotational velocity of the spinning flow in the <b>separation</b> <b>chamber</b> during a stable vortex. This rotational velocity was related to the inlet gas flow rate by the inlet momentum rate. The scaling used the dimensions of each separator tested to predict the minimum inlet gas flow rate needed for a stable vortex. In all, twelve separators were tested, eleven on the ground and one on the plane. The ground testing was a parametric study varying the sizing of the separator components. The flight experiments kept the separator geometry constant and varied the gravitational field in which the separator operated.

The electric field is applied perpendicular to an incoming sample lamina and buffer but also perpendicular to the broad faces of the thin rectangular chamber. A uniform fluid cross-flow then enters and exits the <b>separation</b> <b>chamber</b> through the same broad faces which are porous. A balance is achieved by adjusting either the electric field or the cross-flow so the desired sample fraction with its specific migration velocity encounters an opposing flow of the same velocity. Applying an electric field transverse to the incoming sample lamina and opposing this field with a carefully configured buffer flow, a sample constituent can be selected and focused into a narrow stream for subsequent analysis. Monotonically changing either electric field or buffer cross-flow will yield a scan of all constituents of the sample. Stopping the scan increases the collection time for minor constituents to improve their analysis. Using the high voltage gradients and/or cross-flow to rapidly deflect extraneous sample through the porous screens and into either of the side (purge) chambers, the selected sample is focused in the center plane of the <b>separation</b> <b>chamber</b> and collected without contact or interaction with the <b>separation</b> <b>chamber</b> walls. Results will be presented on the separation {{of a range of}} materials including dyes, proteins, and monodisperse polystyrene latexes. Sources of sample dispersion inherent in other electrokinetic techniques will be shown to be negligible for a variety of sample concentrations, buffer properties and operating conditions...|$|E
