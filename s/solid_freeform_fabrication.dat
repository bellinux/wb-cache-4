40|$|Abstract. In an {{injection}} moulded part, warpage is the distortion caused by non-uniform shrinkage within the plastic part. When looking critically at {{the causes of}} warpage, {{it is found that}} several key parameters of the moulding process have some effect on the warpage. However, the two major categories that contribute to warpage include the part design and the mould design. In mould design, the gate location, runner/gate system and cooling system design are the major factors affecting not only the warpage and part quality but also the injection moulding cycle time. This paper presents an investigation of using different cooling system configuration on warpage and shrinkage of an industrial plastic part with the aim of determining which cooling configuration will provide minimum warpage and cycle time. As conventional injection mould cooling design is based on straight drilling, it limits the geometric complexity of the cooling design, especially curved shape cooling channels. Nowadays, new technology of advanced rapid tooling based on <b>solid</b> <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrications</b> can be been used to provide conformal cooling channels in injection moulds. In this paper, several type of cooling channels are analysed to compare the performance in terms of warpage and shrinkage and to determine which configuration is suitable for minimizing warpage. Autodesk Moldflow Insight (AMI) simulation software is applied to examine the results of the cooling performances and warpage analysis...|$|R

An imaging-based {{approach is developed}} to extract 3 D wound geometry and recognize wound features. Linear healing fashion of the wound margin towards the wound center is mimicked.

Computer models of 3 D engineered porous wound scaffolds are then developed for <b>solid</b> <b>freeform</b> modeling and <b>fabrication.</b> Spatial variation over biomaterial and loaded bio-molecule concentration is developed based on wound healing requirements. Release of bio-molecules over the uniform healing regions is controlled by varying their amount and entrapping biomaterial concentration. Thus, localized controlled release is developed to improve wound healing. A prototype multi-syringe single nozzle deposition system is used to fabricate a sample scaffold.

40|$|For {{propulsion}} related applications, materials {{must be able}} {{to demonstrate}} excellent ablation and oxidation resistance at temperature approaching 3500 'C, adequate load bearing capabilities, non-catastrophic failure modes, and ability to withstand transient thermal shock. A potential list of propulsion-material property requirements includes, low density, high elastic modulus, low thermal-expansion coefficient, high thermal conductivity, excellent erosion and oxidation/corrosion resistance, and flaw-insensitivity. In many cases, they will also {{need to be able to}} be joined, survive thermal cycling and multi-axial stress states, and for reusable applications, the materials must maintain the above attributes after prolonged exposure to extremely harsh chemical environments. The final and possibly most important attribute for these materials are the need to be lower cost and readily available in large quantities. Recently, Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. (ACR) has developed low cost, flexible- manufacturing processes for Zr & Hf-based carbon fiber reinforced composites, materials with good oxidation and ablation resistance up to 3500 C. This process, called Continuous Composite Co-extrusion (C(sup 3)), incorporates carbon fibers to fabricate 'in-situ' carbide and boride-matrix/carbon fiber composites. This is a variation of ACR's manufacturing process for low-cost structural ceramic materials called Fibrous Monoliths With carbon fiber reinforcements. Fibrous Monolithic materials have a distinct fibrous texture, consist of intertwined cells of a primary phase, separated by cell boundaries of a tailored secondary phase and show very high fracture energies, damage tolerance, and graceful failure. Since they are monolithic powder based composites-, they can be manufactured by conventional powder processing techniques using inexpensive raw materials. This combination of high performance and low cost is a breakthrough that could enable wider application of ceramics in high temperature applications. Typical volume fractions of the two phases are 80 to 95 % for the cell phase and 5 to 20 % for the interpenetrating cell boundary phase. ACR is currently developing an innovative <b>solid</b> <b>freeform</b> form <b>fabrication</b> (SFF) approach to produce Hf and Zr based ceramic composite components reinforced with continuous carbon fiber tows for critical structural components such as tubes and blisks. The process is simple, robust and will be widely applicable to a number of material systems. This technique was originally developed at the University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials (UD-CCM) for rapid fabrication of polymer matrix composites by a technique called automated tow placement or ATP. The current process is being developed in collaboration with UD-CCM. The paper will detail the <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> process to create low-cost ceramic fiber reinforced composites for high-temperature applications. The results of mechanical properties and microstructural characterization will be presented, together with examples of complex shapes and parts. It is believed that the process will be able to create complex shaped parts for propulsion applications at an order of magnitude lower cost than current CVI and PIP process...|$|R

Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are two methods applicable for freeform fabrication of Ti-alloys. Manufacturing parameters greatly influence the micro-structure of the product, where e.g. a fast cooling rate in combination with low degree of melting in SLM leads to the predominant formation of martensitic alpha-prime-phase, giving a very hard product.|$|E

40|$|Ionomeric polymer-metal {{composite}} (IPMC) actuators are {{a type of}} soft electromechanically {{active material}} which offers large displacement, rapid motion with only ~ 1 V stimulus. IPMC’s are entering commercial applications in toys (Ashley 2003) and biomedical devices (Soltanpour 2001; Shahinpoor 2002; Shahinpoor, Shahinpoor et al. 2003; Soltanpour and Shahinpoor 2003; Soltanpour and Shahinpoor 2004), but unfortunately they can only actuate by bending, limiting their utility. <b>Freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> offers a possible means of producing IPMC with novel geometry and/or tightly integrated with mechanisms which can yield linear or more complex motion. We have developed materials and processes which allow us to freeform fabricate complete IPMC actuators and their fabrication substrate which will allow integration within other freeform fabricated devices.

50|$|The {{technologies}} {{referred to}} as <b>Solid</b> <b>Freeform</b> <b>Fabrication</b> are what we recognize today as rapid prototyping, 3D printing or additive manufacturing: Swainson (1977), Schwerzel (1984) worked on polymerization of a photosensitive polymer {{at the intersection of}} two computer controlled laser beams. Ciraud (1972) considered magnetostatic or electrostatic deposition with electron beam, laser or plasma for sintered surface cladding. These were all proposed but it is unknown if working machines were built. Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute was the first to publish an account of a solid model fabricated using a photopolymer rapid prototyping system (1981). Even at that early date the technology was seen as having a place in manufacturing practice. A low resolution, low strength output had value in design verification, mould making, production jigs and other areas. Outputs have steadily advanced toward higher specification uses.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the existing soft actuators are fabricated using multistep low yield processes such as micro-moulding, <b>solid</b> <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication,</b> and mask lithography. However, these methods require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved. To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Therefore, special soft systems that can be fabricated in a single step by rapid prototyping methods, such as 3D printing, are utilized to narrow {{the gap between the}} design and implementation of soft actuators, making the process faster, less expensive, and simpler. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints, adhesives, and fasteners. These result in a {{decrease in the number of}} discrete parts, post-processing steps, and fabrication time.|$|E

40|$|A view of {{manufacturing}} processes {{is presented in}} which five distinct categories are defined as casting, deformation, machining, joining, and <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming.</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> is essentially biomimetic and shares problems of morphogenesis with natural processes. Our team in University of London has been exploring three mechanisms of <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming.</b> In dry powder deposition and direct ink-jet printing, the emphasis has turned {{to the problem of}} delivering a complex shape in which the three dimensional spatial arrangement of composition is delivered from the design file. In extrusion freeforming, the aim is to control microstructure at hierarchical levels also from the design file. The quest for 3 -D functional gradients is satisfied by acoustic and ultrasonic dispensing and mixing of powders so that each layer can be patterned. These methods could be extended to deliver the complex patterns demanded by left-handed microwave metamaterials.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors selected ionomeric polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuators from the literature and the authors’ own preliminary experiments as most promising for <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication.</b> The authors performed material formulation and manual device fabrication experiments to arrive at materials which are amenable to robotic deposition and developed an SFF process which allows the production of complete IPMC actuators and their fabrication substrate integrated within other freeform fabricated devices. The authors freeform fabricated simple IPMC’s, explored some materials/performance interactions, and preliminarily characterized these devices in comparison to devices produced by non-SFF methods. Findings – Freeform fabricated IPMC actuators operate continuously in air for more than 4 h and 3, 000 bidirectional actuation cycles. The output stress scaled to input power is one to two orders of magnitude inferior to that of non-SFF devices. Much of this difference may be associated with process-sensitive microstructure of materials. Future work will investigate this performance gap.
