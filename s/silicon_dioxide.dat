40|$|Surface {{modification}} of organic polymers, especially using ultraviolet (UV) excimer and Nd:YAG lasers, {{has been studied}} extensively. Since most of the organic polymers have very strong absorption bands only in the UV or vacuum-UV wavelength region, surface {{modification of}} polymeric materials by lasers in visible ranges is seldom reported. Our research interest is to enhance the surface hydrophilicity of polyimide by Nd:YAG laser at 355 nm and 533 nm. Dyes, such as benzophenone, Disperse Yellow 9 and Rhodamine 6 G, were used to dope the XU 218 polyimide {{in order to achieve}} our goal. The surface changes, after laser treatment, were analyzed by Contact Angles measurement, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Time-of-flight Secordary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToFSIMS). All the doped polyimides show an increase in surface hydrophilicity after laser treatment. XPS and ToF-SIMS proved surface hydrophilicity enhancement is mainly due to chemical changes on the polymer surface. Different dopants lead to the formation of different surface morphologies after laser treatment. Wettability of polyimide doped with <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxides</b> was increased after laser treatment at 533 nm although the doped polymer films are transparent at this wavelength. In order to investigate the reasons of such phenomenon, contact angle measurement, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) were applied to analyze the samples. The contact angles on SiO 2 doped polyimides were changed slightly after laser treatment at 533 nm but XPS results show there is no significant chemical change. From the QCM experiment, the increase in gas diffusion rate of the doped polyimides has been observed after laser exposure at 533 nm. Results supported that the increase in surface wettability is mainly due to the formation of microporosity in the doped polyimides by laser pressure generated in the presence of <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxides...</b>|$|R

For comparison, the value for OsO4 is (−39 ± 1) kJ/mol. It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals (silicon nitride and <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide)</b> used for the detector; further research is required, including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of 269Hs and comparisons with RuO4 in addition to OsO4.|$|E

50|$|More recently, as {{the number}} of {{interconnect}} levels for logic has substantially increased due to the large number of transistors that are now interconnected in a modern microprocessor, the timing delay in the wiring has become so significant as to prompt a change in wiring material (from aluminum to copper layer) and a change in dielectric material (from <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxides</b> to newer low-K insulators). This performance enhancement also comes at a reduced cost via damascene processing, which eliminates processing steps. As the number of interconnect levels increases, planarization of the previous layers is required to ensure a flat surface prior to subsequent lithography. Without it, the levels would become increasingly crooked, extending outside the depth of focus of available lithography, and thus interfering with the ability to pattern. CMP (chemical-mechanical planarization) is the primary processing method to achieve such planarization, although dry etch back is still sometimes employed when the number of interconnect levels is no more than three.|$|R

After the hole injection into 131 A oxides, a transient excess current {{appears in the}} gate current-oxide field char-acteristics and electrons are captured even at low oxide fields for the positive gate polarity. The low field electron cap-ture is explained based on the tunneling of electrons from the substrate into the positive charge and neutral trap centers created near the substrate-Si 02 interface. The transient excess current is suggested {{to be due to}} the two current compo-nents: the displacement current component due to the electron capture by both the positive charge and the neutral trap centers, and the tunneling current component enhanced by the positive charge located near the interface. In 60 A oxides, excess currents appear for both positive and negative gate polarities after the hole injection, and consist of the steady-state leakage current component and the transient current component.

5|$|Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes {{were built}} by eruptions of very thick light-coloured magma, {{including}} trachyte.

5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors.

In {{the context of an}} EU Joint Action (NANOGENOTOX), aimed at establishing a robust methodology for evaluation of the MNMs genotoxicity, the objective of the present work was to characterize the potential genotoxic effects of a panel of well-characterized MNMs in human lymphocytes. Cultures of lymphocytes from healthy volunteers were exposed to several non-cytotoxic concentrations of four TiO 2, six MWCNT and four SiO 2 MNMs, dispersed according to a previously established procedure, for 30 h; concurrent positive controls included a chemical (mitomycin C) and a reference nanosized ZnO. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay was performed according to the OECD guideline 487 and the frequencies of micronucleated binucleate (MNBNC) and mononucleate cells were determined. The results showed that slight but significant increases in the frequencies of MNBNC were observed for some TiO 2 NMs and MWCNTs, as compared to controls, while all SiO 2 NMs were negative in the micronucleus assay; a single dose of ZnO was able to significantly induce MNBNC. However, no clear monotonic dose-response relationships could be disclosed, not enabling clear conclusions about the genotoxicity of the tested MNMs. No influence on cell cycle progression and cell viability was noted by the cytokinesis-block proliferation index. In summary, although the micronucleus assay in primary human lymphocytes is suitable to evaluate the genotoxicity of MNMs following standardized dispersion and assay procedures, data from other cell lines or from other endpoints (e. g. comet assay) have to be gathered in order to achieve a robust genotoxicity evaluation...|$|R
