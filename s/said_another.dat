5|$|Investigators {{originally}} {{theorized that}} {{two men were}} involved in the murders of the Rogers women and this was reenacted in a 1991episode of Unsolved Mysteries. This theory was dismissed when Chandler was arrested. No evidence of a second manother than a former prison cellmate's claim that Chandler <b>said</b> <b>another</b> man, whose identity the cellmate claimed to know but would not reveal has ever surfaced. The second-suspect theory was belied by Chandler's approach of the two Canadian female touriststhat he was willing to approach more than one potential target by himself.|$|E
5|$|Shinkai {{said the}} OVA was {{inspired}} by Dracula and Laputa. He stated that production took seven months to complete. He <b>said</b> <b>another</b> inspiration was his frequent sending of text messaging to his wife when he was working. Shinkai cited the availability of digital hardware and software tools for image production at his workplace, Falcom, and friends' view that individual film production could occur because of the introduction of PlayStation 2 and DVDs.|$|E
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She <b>said</b> <b>another</b> factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E

He <b>said</b> <b>another</b> fisherman sailing with him had died several months before he was rescued. He reportedly survived by eating turtles, birds and fish caught with his bare hands.|$|E
25|$|Fisher {{concluded}} that Binnie had made significant errors of principle and recommended {{that a new}} report should be undertaken. He acknowledged that a new report could still reach the same conclusion as Binnie. Collins agreed and <b>said</b> <b>another</b> report into Bain's compensation claim {{would have to be}} commissioned. Binnie took exception to the criticisms of his report, arguing that he had weighed up the totality of the evidence both for and against Bain. He said the government was clearly 'shopping around' for a report that would allow it to dodge paying compensation.|$|E

25|$|Sometime around 15:30, the Egyptian Air Defense Command {{issued a}} warning that around sixty enemy {{aircraft}} were approaching from the Mediterranean Sea in three directions; one from Port <b>Said,</b> <b>another</b> from Damietta, and the third from Baltim, {{to the west of}} Damietta. Mubarak ordered his pilots in the air to intercept them. The 16 MiG-21s forming the air umbrella over Mansoura moved against the Israeli aircraft with the objective of breaking the enemy formations and forcing them to disperse. 16 MiG-21s took off from Mansoura air base to support those in the air, along with eight fighters from Tanta air base, located west of Mansoura. The MiG-21s intercepted the Israeli formation a few dozen kilometers north of Mansoura.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. <b>Said</b> <b>another</b> way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E

500|$|The nondescript brown honeyeater has a {{noteworthy}} song, usually {{described in}} superlatives. [...] "A glorious voice, easily the best songster among Australian honeyeaters," [...] is how {{one study of}} West Australian birds noted. [...] "As a singer it has no superior among the honeyeater family, or for that matter, among Australian birds," [...] <b>said</b> <b>another</b> report. It has a clear, rolling, musical call, rendered as sweet-sweet-quarty-quarty, which is very loud for {{the size of the}} bird. Both sexes call, usually early in the morning, though the male calls throughout the day during the breeding season. The alarm call is a harsh ke-ke given several times at short intervals.|$|E
500|$|Further success {{followed}} for the Browns and Groza, who was nicknamed [...] "The Toe" [...] by a sportswriter for his kicking abilities. Groza {{led the league}} in field goals and the team won all of its games in 1948, recording professional football's first perfect season. As he grew into a star placekicker, Groza began playing regularly at offensive tackle beginning in 1948. One highlight of that year for Groza was a 53-yard field goal against the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers that was then the longest kick in pro football history. With Groza, the Browns could attempt field goals at a range many other teams could not. [...] "Anywhere from , he was a weapon", Tommy James, Groza's holder for eight years, later <b>said.</b> <b>Another</b> championship win followed in 1949, but the AAFC dissolved after the season, and the Browns were among three teams absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL).|$|E

500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] <b>said</b> <b>another</b> pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun. Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of your machine than you had ever imagined was possible, doing things that done by yourself would have made your hair stand on end." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally {{built to}} hold pirates, the strong room {{was just a}} few yards from the prison's sewer. It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh airâ€”the smell was {{described}} as [...] "noisome"â€”and was full of rats and sometimes [...] "several barrow fulls of dung". Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the [...] "best room on the Common side of the jail", <b>said</b> <b>another.</b> This despite the court's having heard that one prisoner's left side had mortified from lying on the wet floor, and that a rat had eaten the nose, ear, cheek and left eye of another.|$|E
500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never <b>said</b> <b>another</b> word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley <b>said</b> <b>another</b> inspiration for it was that {{there had not been}} many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how [...] "crummy" [...] the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how [...] "crummy" [...] and [...] "dismal" [...] Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The [...] "way they radiate out" [...] had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided {{to put it in the}} clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular".|$|E

UB-50 sank the Messidor, a [...] British coal steamer two days later, sinking {{the ship and}} killing one. The following day, she torpedoed the Rutherglen, a [...] British steam merchant carrying coal. That was followed by {{an attack on the}} Magellan, a [...] British steamer on the following day. She sank with one man. The last ship sunk on the patrol was the Antonio S., a [...] Italian sailboat sunk off the coast of Tunisia.|$|E
500|$|In the {{developmental}} transition from God of War III to Ascension, {{one of the}} graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that {{the limits of the}} God of War III engine restricted artist creativity, so they [...] "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance." [...] For example, the number of UV sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, [...] "independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an editable 'UV set' when laid out flat." [...] Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment. Ascension was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as God of War III had been: [...] "From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree God of War: Ascension was more refinement on the graphics front" [...] <b>said</b> <b>another</b> graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during Ascensions development. The development team also added dynamic lighting, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from God of War III: [...] "the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles" [...] said Perthuis.|$|E
