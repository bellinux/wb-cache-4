In the video, Gaga walks from New York City to Nebraska to get her boyfriend back. According to Gaga: [...] "I'm walking with no luggage and no nothing and it's just me and my ankles are bleeding {{a little bit and}} there's grass <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> shoes and I've got this outfit on and it's real sort of New York clothing and I'm sprinting... And the [...] idea that when you're away from someone you love, it's torture," [...] she continued. [...] "I knew I wanted the video to be about me sprinting back and walking hundreds of thousands of miles to get him back." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{talking with}} his brother, Max wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "Inflikted," [...] inspired by Sepultura's visit in 1992 to Indonesia where {{they saw a}} [...] "crazy ritual". Describing what he saw, Max said, [...] "There was self-inflicted pain, knives, blood, fire. It was insane. It <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] {{was supposed to go}} towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A lot of people had used it before, so he {{had to come up with}} something else." [...] When trying to find a name, he [...] "blurted out" [...] Cavalera Conspiracy, and Igor liked it. Max added, [...] "I think I like it better than Inflikted. It has a ring to it that connects me and Igor as two brothers back together." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{begins with}} a sample of a voice {{shouting}} [...] "con los terroristas", a Spanish phrase which translates to [...] "with the terrorists" [...] in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song [...] "Maldades" [...] by Héctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track [...] "Con Alegría". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to [...] "do the Harlem shake". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Miller Time", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and [...] " [...] <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head for a while". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: [...] "This was my first fight and I didn’t know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I just smiled at him and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts on my face. The other kid, I guess not wanting to fight anymore, or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him, got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{character}} of [...] "Mr. Lovewell" [...] and the album came up while the band was attempting to figure out concepts for the record. According to lead singer Bart Millard [...] "we [...] were {{trying to come up}} with the concept for our next record. For some reason, the words 'love well' got <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head". Millard elaborated that [...] "we're very good, as a nation, at loving well when a massive tragedy takes place... We all of a sudden become very unified, which is a great, great thing. But on a day-to-day basis, we pass up opportunities. We look the other way, or we try to ignore. So the idea of loving well is almost a kind of 'pay it forward' that revolves around the cross". With that general idea, MercyMe was going to name the album Love Well. However, the band decided to make a character that personifies the idea of 'loving well', and came up with the character of 'Mr. Lovewell', partly inspired by The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Because of the character and the more diverse sound the album was going to have, the band felt the original name didn't fit and changed the album name to reflect the character of 'Mr. Lovewell'. Millard has described the character of 'Mr. Lovewell' as [...] "like Buddy the Elf meets Forrest Gump. He sees the good in everyone and knows his neighbors enough to know their needs. Mr. Lovewell may not be the next Billy Graham, but he’s changing the world each day in every little word and deed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|George Miller cites as {{an initial}} {{inspiration}} for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [...] "We were sitting in this bar, having a milkshake, and he looked across at me and said, ‘Antarctica.’ He’d shot a documentary there.

2500|$|In 2003, Jedi Mind Tricks {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Visions of Gandhi. The album title {{was inspired by}} Foxy Brown's verse on the song [...] "Affirmative Action" [...] from Nas' 1996 album It Was Written, in which she raps [...] "They praise Allah with visions of Gandhi". Vinnie Paz explained that it was [...] "always something that <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head but I never applied it to anything. Then I thought with everything going on in Palestine, the war with Iraq, Mumia's in jail. I just felt {{this is a time}} right now that the world and society need someone like Gandhi. So Visions of Gandhi just kind of reflects that." [...] In the following year they released Legacy of Blood.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{enthusiasm for}} Nikolai Gogol's work became {{reflected}} in both her husband's compositions {{and those of}} his friends. On the day of their betrothal, she and Rimsky-Korsakov read Gogol's short story [...] "May Night" [...] together. Afterwards, {{she told him that}} he should write an opera based on it. A week or two later she wrote him, I've been reading yet another of Gogol's stories today, [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi." [...] This is good, too, and would even be suitable for an opera, but not for you; in any case, it's not like 'May Night.' As for that, it's so <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head that nothing will drive it out. Either she or her sister Alexandra then suggested [...] "The Fair at Sorochyntsi" [...] to Mussorgsky. He did not act on it at the time, but a couple of years later, he reconsidered.|$|E
2500|$|Director Christopher Nolan said {{influences}} on Interstellar included the [...] "key touchstones" [...] {{of science fiction}} cinema: Metropolis (1927), [...] (1968), and Blade Runner (1982). About 2001, Nolan said: [...] "The movies you grow up with, the culture you absorb through the decades, become part of your expectations while watching a film. So you can't make any film in a vacuum. We're making a science-fiction film... You can't pretend 2001 doesn't exist when you're making Interstellar." [...] He also said that Star Wars (1977) and Alien (1979) influenced Interstellars production design: [...] "Those always <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head as being how you need to approach science-fiction. It has to feel used—as used and as real as {{the world we live}} in." [...] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced [...] "elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water". Both films end with parents and children being reunited with seemingly impossible age differences.|$|E
