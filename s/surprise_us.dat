[...] That same year, IGN PlayStation Team ranked the fight against her as the sixth best boss battle in the series, while the staff of GameSpy placed her seventh on their list. In 2010, the staff of IGN ranked Sniper Wolf as the 92nd top video game villain of all time, stating that she [...] "probably deserves to be higher on our list" [...] and emphasizing the feeling of helplessness caused by her tactics in [...] "an epic boss battle".

Prior to being paired with Colin, Nekeeta Borden wrote that, [...] "Jill Foster Abbott (cough, cough) Fenmore’s (Jess Walton) Jimmy Choos must have crossed paths with a black cat, because she can’t find a good man to bless her somewhat shriveled heart." [...] Of the character's possible pairing with Colin, she added: [...] "I, for one, hope that Maria Arena Bell and Co. keep Colin in Genoa City and <b>surprise</b> <b>us</b> all by making him a dream lover for Jill. She is a multidimensional character {{with a lot of}} fire, and a great capacity to be soft and vulnerable. Goodness knows she’s been through the ringer. Can Jill find love with Colin, or will her newest dalliance lead to heartbreak?" [...] In 2013, Giddens wrote of Walton's portrayal throughout her run, stating: [...] "Unlike most soap opera recasts, where success or failure depends on chemistry with an opposite sex romantic lead, newcomer Jess Walton would sink or swim, based on her ability to connect with fellow female powerhouse Jeanne Cooper, who played Jill's bitter rival Katherine [...] "Kay" [...] Chancellor." [...] He also commended Walton and Cooper's portrayal of their characters' rivalry, [...] "To say Walton swam alongside Cooper would be an understatement. The two women did a backstroke even Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps would have to admire, during their 26 years as acting partners," [...] he wrote.|$|E

500|$|Released in 1988, the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan, Europe and Brazil) was Sega's {{entry into}} the fourth {{generation}} of video game consoles. Selling 30.75 million units worldwide, the Genesis was the most successful console Sega ever released. The successor to the Genesis, the Sega Saturn, was released in Japan in 1994. The Saturn was a CD-ROM-based console that displayed both 2D and 3D computer graphics, but its complex dual-CPU architecture {{made it more difficult}} to program for than its chief competitor, the Sony PlayStation. Although the Saturn debuted before the PlayStation in both Japan and the United States, its <b>surprise</b> <b>U.S.</b> launch—which came four months earlier than originally scheduled—was marred by a lack of distribution, which remained a continuing problem for the system. Moreover, Sega's early release was undermined by Sony's simultaneous announcement that the PlayStation would retail for US$299—compared to the Saturn's initial price of $399. Nintendo's long delay in releasing a competing 3D console and the damage done to Sega's reputation by poorly supported add-ons for the Genesis (particularly the Sega 32X) allowed Sony to establish a foothold in the market. The PlayStation was immediately successful in the U.S., in part due to a massive advertising campaign and strong third-party support engendered by Sony's excellent development tools and liberal $10 licensing fee. Sony's success was further aided by a price war in which Sega lowered the price of the Saturn from $399 to $299 and then from $299 to $199 in order to match the price of the PlayStation–even though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture and the PlayStation enjoyed a larger software library. Losses on the Saturn hardware contributed to Sega's financial problems, which saw the company's revenue decline between 1992 and 1995 as part of an industry-wide slowdown. [...] Furthermore, Sega's focus on the Saturn over the Genesis prevented it from fully capitalizing on the continued strength of the 16-bit market.|$|E
