40|$|Several {{isokinetic}} <b>strength</b> <b>ratios</b> (bilateral and unilateral) of {{the knee}} have been extensively used: (i) to identify possible anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring strain injury risk factors; (ii) to monitor the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs; and (iii) to determine if an athlete is able to return safely to training and competition sessions after finishing a specific rehabilitation program. However, the precision of these isokinetic <b>strength</b> <b>ratios</b> to evaluate muscle imbalances has been accepted based on theoretical and empirical knowledge, and less based on the scientific evidence regarding their validity and reliability. The purposes of this literature review were: (1) to analyse and compare the validity and reliability of unilateral and bilateral isokinetic <b>strength</b> <b>ratios</b> {{of the knee}} for estimating and monitoring possible muscle imbalances; as well as (2) to report cut-off values to categorize the muscle function as normal or with significantly high injury risk.

The cable is either grounded at both ends or {{laid out in a}} large loop, and energized at low frequencies (less than 1 kHz). Two receiving coils are moved on lines outside of and perpendicular to the long side of the loop or grounded cable and two components of the resultant field are measured. The primary field generated by the large loop or cable interacts with the soil and subsoil and with a conductive body if present which could be a mineral and creates a resultant electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is measured according to two values: the Field <b>Strength</b> <b>Ratio</b> and the Phase Difference occurring between the two receiving coils [...] It is a fixed source horizontal loop method. Separation of the two moving coils is usually from 10 to 30 metres. Using an AC bridge (also called compensator bridge), Field <b>Strength</b> <b>Ratio</b> is measured in percent and Phase Difference in degrees. In-phase (Real) and quadrature (Imaginary) values can be calculated from these data. Observed field <b>strength</b> <b>ratio</b> readings are used to calculate reduced ratios using a formula determined by the loop size and shape or the grounded wire length and the position of the receiving coils relative to the loop or grounded wire. The Turam method is a frequency domain method and in a way is the precursor of the time domain fixed loop methods. It is claimed to have detected large flat lying conductors to a depth of 400 metres.|$|E

This paper investigates the effect of column to beam <b>strength</b> <b>ratio</b> on performance of ductile {{reinforced concrete}} buildings. Fourteen interior frame models of two building categories which are five and ten stories buildings were modeled and analyzed. The main parameter among those models is column to beam <b>strength</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 0 to 2. 0 which are 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 6, 1. 8, and 2. 0. The values are the ratio between column nominal strength (∑Mnc) and beam nominal strength (∑Mnb). In this study, the ratio between column strength to beam probable strength (∑Mprb) of 1. 2 is also investigated. A static nonlinear pushover analysis was used to evaluate the performances of all models. Analysis results show that all models have a life safety performance level. A collapse mechanism of beam sway mechanism was achieved for strength ratios of 1. 4 to 2. 0 for five story frame models and 1. 6 to 2. 0 for ten story frames. The increase in the <b>strength</b> <b>ratio</b> up to 1. 4 can increase ductility factor significantly, however, beyond that the <b>strength</b> <b>ratio</b> does not affect the ductility both for five and ten story frame models.

Failure behavior of X-cor sandwich structure at different energy stages was analyzed, and the effects of the volume fraction of Z-pin implant and the density of the foam core on the failure behavior were also discussed. Z-pin diameter of specimens in low speed impact test was 0. 5 mm, and the implantation angle was 22 &# 176;, and the type of foam and Z-pin implant volume fraction in the experiment was variable. The results show that under 6 J impact energy, the impact energy is mainly absorbed by the panel’s delamination. The sandwich contained Z-pin is beneficial to reduce the delamination area, while the delamination area of blank sample increases by 45. 1 %. The foam density has little effect on the delamination area. The Z-pin fails under 12 J impact energy. The residual compressive <b>strength</b> <b>ratio</b> increases first and then decreases with the increase of volume fraction of Z-pin. The sample has the highest residual compressive <b>strength</b> <b>ratio</b> when the volume fraction reaches 0. 42 %.

Imbalances between agonists and antagonists of the shoulder can lead to increased risk of injury. To acquire information about strength imbalances a handheld dynamometer can be used to assess isometric and eccentric strength and to calculate inter muscular <b>strength</b> <b>ratios.</b> The purpose of the study was to calculate functional and isometric <b>strength</b> <b>ratios</b> in the rotatorcuff in adolescent elite tennis players and compare with a control group of non-overhead athletes and to evaluate the use of a control group. A handheld dynamometer was used to measure rotatorcuff strength in 30 elite adolescent tennis players compared to a control group of 29 non-overhead athletes of the same age. Outcome variables of interest were ER/IR <b>strength</b> <b>ratios.</b> The result of the study showed significant two-way interactions (side × group) for all ER/IR ratios. There were larger differences between the girls’ groups. Overall most participants had lower functional and isometric ratios in the dominant arm compared to the non-dominant arm with larger differences between the arms in the tennis groups and in the girls. There is risk for bias in using the non-dominant arm as control when measuring strength in the rotatorcuff. This study shows that there is a difference in functional and isometric ratios in elite tennis players compared with a control group of non-overhead athletes with largest differences in the girls and in the dominant arm.

This study aimed to determine the differences between seated and supine peak torques and <b>strength</b> <b>ratios</b> and examine the interaction of position with joint velocity. This was a cross-sectional, repeated measures study. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor concentric and eccentric peak torque was measured seated and supine (10 degrees hip flexion) at 1. 04 and 3. 14 rad. s(- 1) in 11 Rugby players. Repeated measures analysis of variance and paired t-tests were used to analyze peak torques and <b>strength</b> <b>ratios.</b> Bonferroni post hoc, limits of agreement, and Pearson's correlation were applied. Seated peak torque was typically greater than that for supine for muscle actions and velocities. The values ranged from 109 +/- 18 N. m (mean +/- sigma) for supine hamstring concentric peak torque at 1. 04 rad. s(- 1) to 330 +/- 71 for seated quadriceps eccentric peak torque at 1. 04 rad. s(- 1). There was a significant position x muscle action interaction; eccentric peak torque was reduced more than concentric in the supine position. Knee joint <b>strength</b> <b>ratios</b> ranged from 0. 47 +/- 0. 06 to 0. 86 +/- 0. 23, with {{a significant difference in}} means between supine and seated positions for functional ratio at 3. 14 rad. s(- 1) observed; for seated it was 0. 86 +/- 0. 23; and for supine, it was 0. 68 +/- 0. 15 (p < 0. 05). Limits of agreement for traditional and functional ratios ranged from 1. 09 x/divided by 1. 37 to 1. 13 x/divided by 1. 51. We conclude that hip angle affects isokinetic peak torques and knee joint <b>strength</b> <b>ratios.</b> Therefore, the hip angle should be nearer 10 degrees when measuring knee joint function because this is more ecologically valid.

The reliability for the assessment of reciprocal (conventional and functional) and bilateral torque ratios was also examined. Fifteen male soccer players (15 ± 1 years) performed two sessions, separated by three days. The testing protocol consisted of five maximal concentric and eccentric hip abductions and adductions of both legs at angular velocities of 30 °/s and 90 °/s. The peak torque was evaluated in young soccer players using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm), and the reciprocal <b>strength</b> <b>ratios</b> (conventional and functional) and bilateral ratios (non-preferred to preferred leg ratios) were calculated. The test-retest reliability for the assessment of peak torque (lCC= 0. 71 - 0. 92) and of reciprocal muscle group ratios (lCC= 0. 44 - 0. 87) was found to be moderate to high.
