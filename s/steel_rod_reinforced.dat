This has been incorporated into the kitchen at some point. The corridor from the hall extends past the back staircase, entered from a lobby via a door from the corridor, to {{the dining room}}. The room has a fireplace to the south wall with a Hopton stone mantel with a tiled surround and a three faceted bowed façade overlooking the garden, with a light to each façade. French windows originally led into the covered cloister, which was subsequently glazed and incorporated into the room.

They contain the principal bedrooms. On the second floor the central block contains the two staircases at either end and their respective landings. The corridor connecting the two wings is slung over part of the double height great hall along the west side, acting as a minstrels gallery. The third floor of the central block contains further bedrooms in the roof space, lit by large dormer windows.|$|E

How a cell organizes these ordered textures around itself, creating its own desirable environment, is a fascinating question.

On the contrary, the cell has ample regulatory mechanisms to control wall texture formation by controlling the insertion of synthases and the distance between individual microfibrils within a wall lamella...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a U-shaped structure with the longest leg 105.5 metres feet long and 23.5 metres feet high. Because of delays in importing the specialized boring equipment needed to install the cast-in-place piles {{called for in the}} original design, {{the decision was made to}} use 1615 15 x 15 inch and 16 x 16 inch reinforced concrete piles. These were driven by a steam-powered hammer. On top of the piles a five- and six-storey steel-framed structure was built. The steel was encased in reinforced concrete and 1.75 million bricks. 21,000 cubic yards of aggregate from the Hutt River with cement from Whangarei were mixed on site to create the concrete. The bricks used for the outer cladding were of a special design, with slots to accommodate vertical corrosion-resistant <b>steel</b> <b>rods</b> that <b>reinforced</b> the brickwork and bound it to the structural members. 1500 tons of decorative Hanmer and Whangarei granite and marble were used to clad the interior and the entranceway. 2500 gallons of paint were used.

40|$|The design {{criteria}} and numerical results {{for a new}} low-cost base isolation technique for simple masonry buildings are presented. The proposed base isolator, named RCW –Reinforced Cut Wall-, {{is made up of}} a layer of weak mortar (50 mm) and an elastomer membrane sheath (4 mm) located between the foundation and the base of the bearing wall, which is reinforced by a series of vertical <b>steel</b> <b>rods</b> (8 - 10 or 12 mm in diameter) connecting it to the foundation. A preliminary series of experimental trials have been performed on a sample set of isolators, during which specific tests have been conducted to check their mechanical properties and to define their assembly techniques. ANSYS 5. 5. 1. numerical simulations of the horizontal and vertical loads, consisting of non linear static incremental analysis, acting in several types of buildings (one, two or three stories high with rectangular floor plan) highlight the system’s efficient performance in terms of force-displacement law. For moderate horizontal actions, the mortar and elastomer layers of the RCW do not cause any relevant foundation-base displacement. Instead, when a prescribed limit is exceeded, the weak layers of the RCW permit large inelastic deformation due to friction behavior, while the vertical teel rods ensure an elastic restoring force that provides an elastic-plastic response of the base dissipator. Design possibilities for the RCW are illustrated, in order to optimize number and size of the <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rods</b> {{as a function of the}} magnitude of vertical loads and seismic actions. Moreover the RCW performs advantages in terms of feasibility and cost-effectiveness: the increase in construction costs with respect to a non-isolated building is very low, due to the same technology of simple masonry buildings, and provides further benefits in terms of isolation from ground humidity...|$|R

40|$|We use the {{three-dimensional}} finite element code DYNA 3 D to analyze two problems: (a) the normal {{impact of a}} cylindrical monolithic or composite rod against a smooth flat rigid target, (commonly known as the Taylor impact test), and (b) the penetration of composite and monolithic <b>steel</b> cylindrical <b>rods</b> into <b>reinforced</b> concrete targets. The composite rod is made of either a steel or copper shell enclosing a ceramic. The ceramic and the steel are assumed to fail at a critical value of the effective plastic strain, whereas no failure is considered in the copper. The thermoviscoplastic response of steel and copper is modeled by the Johnson-Cook relation and the ceramic and concrete {{are assumed to be}} elastic-plastic. Values of material parameters in the constitutive relation for the reinforced concrete (RC) are derived by the rule of mixtures. Failure of a material is simulated by the element erosion technique for ceramic and steel, and element erosion along with stiffness reduction for the RC. The effect of the angle of obliquity of impact on the damage induced in the target is ascertained. For the solid cylindrical copper rod impacting a smooth flat rigid target, the time history of the deformed length and the axial variation of the final diameter are found to match well with the experimental findings. For the composite rod, the diameter of the deformed impacted surface...|$|R
