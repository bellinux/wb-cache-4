2500|$|Flash mobs {{began as}} a form of {{performance}} art. While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political demonstrations.

2500|$|Flash mob {{was added}} to the 11th edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary on July 8, 2004 where it noted it as an [...] "unusual and {{pointless}} act" [...] separating it from other forms of smart mobs such as types of performance, protests, and other gatherings. Also recognized noun derivatives are flash mobber and flash mobbing. Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English defines flash mob as [...] "a group of people who organize on the Internet and then quickly assemble in a public place, do something bizarre, and disperse." [...] This definition is consistent with the original use of the term; however, both news media and promoters have subsequently used the term to refer to any form of <b>smart</b> <b>mob,</b> including political protests; a collaborative Internet denial of service attack; a collaborative supercomputing demonstration; and promotional appearances by pop musicians. [...] The press has also used the term flash mob to refer to a practice in China where groups of shoppers arrange online to meet at a store in order to drive a collective bargain.|$|E

2500|$|In San Francisco, California protests {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} day and {{in different parts of}} the city with up to 150 people arrested for misdemeanors such as trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking an intersection. Part of the success of the group coordinating named Direct Action was due to utilizing <b>smart</b> <b>mob</b> technologies including text messaging, Google Maps, live video-feeds and internet radio updates. In contrast to the first-day protests in 2003 when the city was effectively shut down in many ways, the protests were focussed on specific targets and conveying messages – [...] "there's little point in barricading the Bay Bridge in a city where most people are against the war anyway." [...] In the morning, a group of 500 worked their way through the morning commute effectively tying-up traffic for hours as the police had to block, move and re-block streets and busses for the procession. The Federal Reserve Bank and Chevron Corporation were also targeted with actions and saw arrests. Starting around noon and lasting for several hours the most [...] "dramatic" [...] protests were a die-in – again blocking the main traffic artery, Market Street – directly in front of California Senator Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein supported the Iraq war resolution and subsequent supplemental appropriations bills although she has stated she was deceived by the Bush administration about the weapons of mass destruction. As police arrested dozens of protesters more would take their place. In the evening 7000 marched and rallied in front of San Francisco City Hall hearing speeches including Assemblywoman Carole Migden. Although mostly peaceful some police were pelted with glass Christmas ornaments filled with paint.|$|E

5000|$|Essentially, the <b>smart</b> <b>mob</b> is a {{practical}} implementation of collective intelligence.

5000|$|On 20 January 2001, President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines {{became the}} first head of state in history to lose power to a <b>smart</b> <b>mob.</b> More than one million Manila {{residents}} assembled {{at the site of}} the 1986 People Power peaceful demonstrations that has toppled the Marcos regime. These people have organized themselves and coordinated their actions through text messaging. They were able to bring down a government without having to use any weapons or violence. Through text messaging, their plans and ideas were communicated to others and successfully implemented. Also, this move encouraged the military to withdraw their support from the regime, and as a result, the Estrada government fell. People were able to converge and unite with the use of their cell phones.

50|$|The term, coined in 2003, is {{generally}} not applied to events and performances organized {{for the purposes of}} politics (such as protests), commercial advertisement, publicity stunts that involve public relation firms, or paid professionals.

In December of that year, the [...] "smart mob" [...] concept was highlighted in the New York Times [...] "Year in Ideas".|$|E
50|$|The protests were well-organised. The protesters made phone lists (an early {{form of the}} <b>smart</b> <b>mob</b> {{technique}} of public mobilisation) in case the police entered the tent camps. Some people climbed the trees to deter workers from chopping them down. The situation escalated when government officials started chainsawing the trees {{under the protection of}} police. At one point, officers on horseback charged the demonstrators. Singer Cornelis Vreeswijk was present at the protest, singing songs and offering support. The protests were covered extensively in the press.|$|E
5000|$|According to CNN, {{the first}} <b>smart</b> <b>mobs</b> were teenage [...] "thumb tribes" [...] in Tokyo and Helsinki who used text {{messaging}} on cell phones to organize impromptu raves or to stalk celebrities.
