40|$|There is a {{need for}} in-situ soil {{moisture}} conservation in arid and semi-arid regions due to insufficient rainfall for agriculture. For this purpose, a combination implement [integrated reservoir tillage system (RT) ] comprised of a single-row chisel plow, single-row spike tooth harrow, modified seeder, and <b>spiked</b> <b>roller</b> was developed and compared to the popular tillage practices, viz., minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT) in an arid Mediterranean environment in Egypt. The different tillage practices were conducted at tillage depths of 15, 20, and 25 cm and forward speeds of 0. 69, 1, 1. 25, and 1. 53 m s- 1. Some soil physical properties, runoff, soil loss, water harvesting efficiency and yield of wheat were evaluated. The different tillage practices caused significant differences in soil physical properties as the RT increased soil infiltration, producing a rate of 48...|$|E
40|$|DE 102008053856 A 1 UPAB: 20100712 NOVELTY - The {{method for}} melt-free {{transformation}} of bundles from polycrystalline fibers into bundle of single crystalline fiber or of fibers with single crystalline area, comprises providing (1) bundles of fibers from polycrystalline material, laterally fanning out (3) the fiber bundles {{in such a}} way that the contacts of the fibers of the bundle are abated among each other, recrystallizing (4) the material contained in the fiber bundles in an oven zone at a temperature that lies below the melting temperature of the fiber material, cooling the fiber bundles, and rolling up (5) the fiber bundles. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for melt-free transformation of bundles from polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or of fibers with single crystalline area, comprises providing (1) bundles of fibers from polycrystalline material, laterally fanning out (3) the fiber bundles {{in such a way}} that the contacts of the fibers of the bundle are abated among each other, recrystallizing (4) the material contained in the fiber bundles in an oven zone at a temperature that lies below the melting temperature of the fiber material, cooling the fiber bundles, and rolling up (5) the fiber bundles on a cover or simultaneously cutting the fibers of bundles or all bundles vertically to fiber direction {{in such a way that}} short fibers are received. The fibers are transported over a transport line on which the fanning out takes place, where the fanning out takes place by electrostatic loading of the fibers by guiding the fiber bundles through column between two oppositively loaded electrodes, tightening and relaxing the fibers of the fiber bundles in oscillating manner, guiding the fibers through a compressed air pillow and recrystallizing the fibers in a hot gas stream. The process is continuously carried out and the fiber bundle tension is constantly held over the temperature line. The hot gas stream through which the fiber bundle is guided for recrystallization has a temperature of 0. 8 - 0. 85 T of melt related to the absolute melting temperature of the fiber. The hot gas stream is generated through the combustion of propane-oxygen-mixture containing inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The transport speed of the fiber bundle is 150 - 300 mm/h and/or the fiber bundle tension is 0. 2 - 0. 1 N. The tightening and relaxing of the fiber is carried out by a <b>spiked</b> <b>roller.</b> The fiber bundle tension is adjusted by redirection rods, tensor roller, spring sheet metal and/or transport roller pair in a value of 0. 15 - 0. 18 N. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a fiber bundle. USE - Method for melt-free transformation of bundles of polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or fibers with single crystalline area, useful for the production of single crystalline sapphire fibers. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures simple and efficient melt-free transformation of bundles of polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or fibers with single crystalline area, with good flexibility...|$|E

40|$|In the {{handling}} of agricultural products, peeling and cutting are a job {{that has always been}} done since harvesting until the product is ready to be consumed or processed further. The simple peeling and cutting jobs can be completed manually using a knife or other cutting tool. However, if the amount of peeling coconuts at harvest is large in numbers, manually requires considerable time and labor. Currently design a coconut peeling machine using screw feeding system, which equipped a peeling knife and <b>spike</b> <b>roller.</b> This research proposed to improve the machine performance designed with investigated the variation of peeler blade rotation. The method used in this research was an experimental testing by varying the rotation of the peeler blade (peeling knife and <b>spike</b> <b>roller)</b> and two rollers for forced rotation. Then, the coconut peeling results (coconut husking) were compared and analyses. After testing the rotation of variation of peeling blade and companion blade of coconut peeling machine, that was resulted good husk for 3 of 8 of coconut stripping, which rotation of peeling blade and companion blade of 20 rpm and 15 rpm respectively. These peeling results became better for 3 coconuts due to distance two roller of peeling knifes that whas set up on 175 mm...|$|R

40|$|A field-based {{study was}} {{performed}} to broaden our knowledge of operational efficiency losses associated with the neglect of the proper maintenance of the delimbing and feeding mechanisms of a harvester. The post-harvest assessments of industrial round-wood (IRW) processing damage, fuel consumption and productivity were examined in clearcutting operations. Observations were made of seven combinations of wear levels of feed rollers (A—heavy, B—medium, C and C’—without wear) and sharpening states of delimbing knives (1 —incorrect, 2 —correct), depending {{on the degree of}} feed roller wear and matching of angles of knife blades to the technical requirements. The processing defects of IRW were broken down into unprocessed branches, bark stripping, and damage caused by feed <b>roller</b> <b>spikes.</b> The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements, and the IRW losses in terms of the reject rates (RR) were determined {{in the context of the}} technical condition. The most frequent damage was by unprocessed branches. The harvester with correctly sharpened knives produced the minimum RR (4 % of pine, 6 % of spruce and 6 % birch logs). The quality of IRW harvested under B 1 and C 1 resulted in 6 %, 6 % and 8 %. A 1 turned out to be the lowest (12 %, 10 % and 8 %). Improvement in the maintenance of delimbing knives can reduce the RR of IRW by 5 %. Timely restoration of worn-out rollers can increase productivity by 2 % and reduce fuel consumption by 5 %...|$|R
