5|$|The new {{university}} {{was created by}} law on December 28, 1962, but effective functioning begun in 1966. Before that, only the School of Medicine functioned. In April 1963 the first vestibular, the general admissions exam, happened, with 1,592 candidates competing for 50 spots in the medicine program. The first lecture in the newly created University of Campinas took place on May 20 of the same year. By 1965, the organizing commission for the new university <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a location for a new campus.|$|E
5|$|When Kanō {{attended}} the Tokyo Imperial University in 1877, he <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> jūjutsu teachers. He first looked for bonesetters, called seifukushi. His {{assumption was that}} doctors knew who the better martial art teachers were. His search brought him to Yagi Teinosuke, {{who had been a}} student of Emon Isomata in the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū school of jūjutsu. Yagi, in turn, referred Kanō to Fukuda Hachinosuke, a bonesetter who taught Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū in a 10-mat room adjacent to his practice. Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū was itself a combination of two older schools: the Yōshin-ryū and Shin no Shindō-ryū.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{turned his}} focus to {{domestic}} affairs after the war. Empress Joséphine had still not {{given birth to}} a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Joséphine in January 1810 and <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the Archduchess Marie Louise, who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of King of Rome. His son never actually ruled the empire, but historians still refer to him as Napoleon II.|$|E

5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} {{interested}} in making a film about the drug wars for some time but {{did not want to}} make one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained the rights to the United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Braathens SAFE <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a {{replacement}} for the aging DC-3s and Herons. An order was placed with Fokker for the delivery of their new Fokker F-27 Friendship, a two-engine turboprop with cabin pressurization. Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane, after Aer Lingus. The first craft, LN-SUN, was delivered in December 1958, with the second, LN-SUO, delivered the following year. They were put into service on the main routes: once daily Oslo–Trondheim, once daily Oslo–Ålesund, twice daily Oslo–Stavanger, including one stopping at Kristiansand, and one trip daily Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim. The delivery of the Friendships made the Herons unnecessary, and these were sold. The two DC-3s were kept as a reserve, and {{were used for the}} first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of LN-SUO. They were also used for charter. The airports at Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg had too short runways for the Friendship, and these destinations were terminated.|$|E

25|$|In {{support of}} this hypothesis, Zwicky <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> supernovae, and found a total of 120 by himself (and one more, SN 1963J, in concert with Paul Wild) over 52 years (SN 1921B through SN 1973K), a record which stood until 2009 when passed by Tom Boles.|$|E
25|$|During that period, Theo van Doesburg <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> {{other artists}} {{to set up}} a journal and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more {{successful}} writing about art than working as an independent artist. Quite adept at making new contacts due to his flamboyant personality and outgoing nature, he had many useful connections in the art world.|$|E
25|$|For Granite Broadcasting, {{the deal}} with NBC was expensive; the company showed {{a net loss of}} $44 million for the first three {{quarters}} of 2001, more than double its losses during the same period the previous year. In an attempt to reduce debts, Granite <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a buyer for Detroit WB affiliate WDWB (now WMYD) in October 2001; that station would not be sold until 2014.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasingly}} {{dominant position}} of the Ottoman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean presented an impediment to trade for the Christian nations of the west, who in turn <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> alternatives. Portuguese and Spanish explorers found new trade routes– south of Africa to India, and across the Atlantic Ocean to America. As Genoese and Venetian merchants opened up direct sea routes with Flanders, the Champagne fairs lost much of their importance.|$|E
25|$|Because {{her birth}} {{certificate}} was never found, her legal given name is unknown. The name Salavarrieta is known {{only by the}} names {{her family and friends}} used. Her father referred to her as Apolonia in his will, which Salvador Contreras, the priest who formalized the testament on 13 December 1802, confirmed. She was closest to her brother, Viviano, as she became his de facto guardian when her parents died. When the armed forces in Guaduas <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> her, she began calling herself Policarpa.|$|E

The captain entered the room, ordering one of the cadets to open up another cadet's footlocker, but the cadet refused. Hitchcock ordered no more disorder, left the room, and <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> Thornton around 04:50.|$|E

25|$|Others <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> ways to {{stabilise}} {{the plasma}} during compression, and by 1953 two concepts {{had come to}} the fore. One solution was to wrap the vacuum tube in a sheet of thin but highly conductive metal. If the plasma column began to move, the current in the plasma would induce a magnetic field in the sheet, one that, due to Lenz's law, would push back against the plasma. This was most effective against large, slow movements, like the entire plasma torus drifting within the chamber.|$|E
25|$|When another {{film with}} Bergman, Arch of Triumph (1948), failed {{at the box}} office, he <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> {{character}} parts. Apart from leads in several French films such as Max Ophüls' The Earrings of Madame de... (1953, again with Danielle Darrieux) and Nana (1955, opposite Martine Carol), he also moved into television {{as one of the}} pioneering producers and stars of Four Star Theatre; Four Star Productions would make him and partners David Niven and Dick Powell rich. In 1956, Boyer was a guest star on I Love Lucy.|$|E
25|$|From 1948 Norwegian Air Lines {{introduced}} the 37-seat Short Sandringham on their Oslo routes. This required a much long runway, {{which was not}} possible without interfering with ship traffic in the port. Bergen Municipality therefore <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a suitable site further away from town. Both Herdla and Flatøy were discarded due to distances {{and the need for}} ferry transport, and Hjellestad was found the most suitable site. Bergen Airport, Hjellestad therefore served as Bergen's main airport from 23 August 1948 {{to the end of the}} 1951 season.|$|E

25|$|Levi {{was almost}} unrecognisable {{on his return}} to Turin. Malnutrition edema had bloated his face. Sporting a scrawny beard and wearing an old Red Army uniform, he {{returned}} to Corso Re Umberto.

Levi suffered from the psychological trauma of his experiences. Having {{been unable to find}} work in Turin, he <b>started</b> to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> work in Milan. On his train journeys, he began to tell people he met stories about his time at Auschwitz.|$|R
25|$|If one <b>starts</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> these adjoint {{pairs of}} functors, {{they turn out}} to be very common in {{abstract}} algebra, and elsewhere as well.
