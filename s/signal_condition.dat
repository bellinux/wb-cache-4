5000|$|The {{parity bit}} in each {{character}} {{can be set}} to none (N), odd (O), even (E), mark (M), or space (S). None means that no parity bit is sent at all. Mark parity means that the parity bit is always set to the mark <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> (logical 1) and likewise space parity always sends the parity bit in the space <b>signal</b> <b>condition.</b> Aside from uncommon applications that use the 9th (parity) bit for some form of addressing or special signaling, mark or space parity is uncommon, as it adds no error detection information. Odd parity is more useful than even, since it ensures {{that at least one}} state transition occurs in each character, which makes it more reliable. The most common parity setting, however, is [...] "none", with error detection handled by a communication protocol.|$|E
5000|$|The RS-232 {{standard}} {{defines the}} voltage levels {{that correspond to}} logical one and logical zero levels for the data transmission and the control signal lines. Valid signals are either {{in the range of}} +3 to +15 volts or the range −3 to −15 volts with respect to the [...] "Common Ground" [...] (GND) pin; consequently, the range between −3 to +3 volts is not a valid RS-232 level. For data transmission lines (TxD, RxD, and their secondary channel equivalents), logic one is defined as a negative voltage, the <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> is called [...] "mark". Logic zero is positive and the <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> is termed [...] "space". Control signals have the opposite polarity: the asserted or active state is positive voltage and the deasserted or inactive state is negative voltage. Examples of control lines include request to send (RTS), clear to send (CTS), data terminal ready (DTR), and data set ready (DSR).|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were completed allowing albino rats {{to choose between}} signaled and unsignaled reward conditions. These experiments examined the effects on preference of (1) response dependent versus response-independent reward and, (2) food pellets versus chocolate milk as the reward. All subjects preferred the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> over the unsignaled condition, whether exposed to response-dependent, or to response-independent delivery of rewards. Preference was controlled most effectively by presenting both the signal itself and the correlated stimulus identifying the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition.</b> The <b>signal</b> presented alone (Extinction 3) controlled preference more effectively than did the stimulus correlated with the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> (Extinction 2). The second experiment showed {{that the quality of}} the reinforcer (pellets and chocolate milk) did not affect preference for signaled reward since all subjects preferred the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> at levels comparable to those observed in Experiment 1, with food pellets. These results, along with others, argue against species differences, response-dependency, and reinforcer quality as variables affecting the direction of preference...|$|R

5000|$|The {{theory of}} {{immunocompetence}} handicaps suggests that androgen-mediated traits accurately <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> {{due to the}} immunosuppressive effects of androgens. [...] This immunosuppression may be either because testosterone alters the allocation of limited resources between the development of ornamental traits and other tissues, including the immune system, or because heightened immune system activity has a propensity to launch autoimmune attacks against gametes, such that suppression {{of the immune system}} enhances fertility. [...] Healthy individuals can afford to suppress their immune system by raising their testosterone levels, which also augments secondary sexual traits and displays. A review of empirical studies into the various aspects of this theory found weak support.|$|E
50|$|In the {{breeding}} season, males are diversely coloured. These differences in plumage do not <b>signal</b> <b>condition,</b> probably serving instead for {{the recognition of}} individual birds. However, {{the intensity of the}} red on the bills is regarded an indicator for the animal's quality and social dominance. Red-billed quelea males mate with one female only within one breeding cycle. There are usually three eggs in each clutch (though the full range is one to five) of approximately 18 mm long and 13 mm in diameter. The eggs are light bluish or greenish in colour, sometimes with some dark spots. Some clutches contain six eggs, but large clutches {{may be the result of}} other females dumping an egg in a stranger's nest. Both sexes share the incubation of the eggs during the day, but the female alone does so during the cool night, and feeds during the day when air temperatures are high enough to sustain the development of the embryo. The breeding cycle of the red-billed quelea is one of the shortest known in any bird. Incubation takes nine or ten days. After the chicks hatch, they are fed for some days with protein-rich insects. Later the nestlings mainly get seeds. The young birds fledge after about two weeks in the nest. They are sexually mature in one year.|$|E
40|$|Pigeons chose between 5 -s and 15 -s delay-of-reinforcement alternatives. The first key peck {{to satisfy}} the choice {{schedule}} began a delay timer, and food was delivered {{at the end of}} the interval. Key pecks during the delay interval were measured, but had no scheduled effect. In Experiment 1, <b>signal</b> <b>conditions</b> and choice schedules were varied across conditions. During unsignaled conditions, no stimulus change signaled the beginning of a delay interval. During differential and nondifferential <b>signal</b> <b>conditions,</b> offset of the choice stimuli and onset of a delay stimulus signaled the beginning of a delay interval. During differential <b>signal</b> <b>conditions,</b> different stimuli were correlated with the 5 -s and 15 -s delays, whereas the same stimulus appeared during both delay durations during nondifferential <b>signal</b> <b>conditions.</b> Pigeons showed similar, extreme levels of preference for the 5 -s delay alternative during unsignaled and differentially <b>signaled</b> <b>conditions.</b> Preference levels were reliably lower with nondifferential signals. Experiment 2 assessed preference with two pairs of unsignaled delays in which the ratio of delays was held constant but the absolute duration was increased fourfold. No effect of absolute duration was found.

40|$|The {{parameter}} estimation of Chirp signal model in additive noises {{when all the}} noises are independently and identically distributed (i. i. d.) has been considered. A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to estimate the frequency rate of the considered model by constructing the iterative statistics with one-lag and multilag differential signals. It is observed that the estimator for the iterative algorithm is consistent and works quite well in terms of biases and mean squared errors. Moreover, the convergence rate of the estimator is improved from Op(N- 1) of the initial estimator to Op(N- 3 / 2) for one-lag differential <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> and from Op(N- 2) of the initial estimator to Op(N- 5 / 2) for multilag differential <b>signal</b> <b>condition,</b> respectively, by only three iterations.

The estimator of frequency rate with optimal lag {{is very close to}} Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) as well as the asymptotic variance of least-squares estimator (LSE) at moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

40|$|This study {{assessed}} whether {{choosing a}} <b>signalled</b> shock <b>condition</b> over an unsignalled one {{is controlled by}} a stimulus that predicts the presence of shock (Experiment I), or by a stimulus that predicts the absence of shock (Experiment II). The dependability of these stimuli as predictors of either the presence or the absence of shock was parametrically varied over a wide range, and subjects (rats) were given an option to change from an unsignalled to a <b>signalled</b> <b>condition.</b> In the first experiment, all shocks were preceded by signals; however, {{the probability of a}} signal being followed by shock varied from 1. 0 to 0. 02.

Rats changed to the <b>signalled</b> <b>condition</b> when the <b>signal</b> was completely dependable (all signals followed by shock) and when the dependability of the signal was systematically degraded.
