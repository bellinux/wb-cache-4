[...] On December 15, 2008, the Barlows further praised {{the work of}} George W. Bush, thanking God for him [...] "in regards {{to the issue of}} abortion" [...] and praying for then-president-elect Barack Obama to [...] "have a change of heart towards the issue of abortion." [...] Nevertheless, BarlowGirl {{licensed}} its cover of [...] "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" [...] for the 2009 program Christmas at the White House: An Oprah Primetime Special, where Obama and his wife were interviewed. On November 10, 2016, BarlowGirl showed support for the [...] "Love Trumps Hate" [...] slogan: [...] "Hillary's campaign <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> [...] I think we can all agree on that one phrase." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 18, 2012 on his Twitter Hamiltion {{announced}} that he was releasing an independent album entitled Ill Doesn't Mean Classic it would include the Eminem produced song [...] "I Don't Care", it was released as a mixtape on July 7, 2012. On July 30, 2012, Hamilton released a collaboration mixtape entitled Cinematic Hallucinations: The Bully And The Pet with rapper S.K.E. The Heistman. On August 17, 2012 during an interview Hamilton talked about his change in his music stating [...] "When I was incarcerated, my songs got a little more aggressive, but after I did some time and came back to NYC, I was a little upset at my fans because they were saying some pretty harsh things about me when I was locked up. This is not how you should approach somebody whos been showing you guys free love". Hamilton also talked about how mental illness and drug use didn't {{have anything to do with}} him taking a step back from music stating [...] "People were blaming insanity because certain details didn't hit the surface, but it had nothing to do with drugs, it had nothing to do with alcohol". Hamilton also discussed about his former deal with Interscope Records stating [...] "MC Lyte <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> it was a fight to get me off Interscope. I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and I said this new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, and I took it very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{the primary}} {{theme of the}} novel is that evil can only be {{resisted}} psychically: when the rational controls that order man's existence slacken, destruction comes. Conrad <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> in [...] "Heart of Darkness," [...] but Mr. Doctorow has said it impressively. His book is taut and dramatic, exciting and successfully symbolic.|$|E

5000|$|For Teachers: The California State Board of Education <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> {{in their}} recent 2016 framework, “The greater the {{variation}} of the student population, the richer the learning experiences for all and the more assets upon which teachers may draw.” This being the case it is imperative for teachers to {{read between the lines}} of published standards, recognize them as flawed, and move beyond them widening the scope of knowledge and inclusion within the classroom.|$|E

5000|$|On November 28, 1985, McNally {{died from}} the {{complications}} of a stroke in Palm Springs, California. He was 82. Though McNally was gone, his legacy was not. George Clooney's character—Dodge Connolly—in the 2008 film Leatherheads was based (in part) on McNally. Some said his life was made for Hollywood, but his wife Marguerite probably <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> when she said, [...] "Even when Johnny does the expected, he does it in an unexpected way." ...|$|E
50|$|After Mises died, {{his widow}} quoted a passage {{that he had}} written about Benjamin Anderson. She <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> {{described}} Mises's own personality:His most eminent qualities were his inflexible honesty, his unhesitating sincerity. He never yielded. He always freely enunciated what he considered to be true. If he had been prepared to suppress or only to soften his criticisms of popular, but irresponsible, policies, the most influential positions and offices would have been offered him. But he never compromised.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, {{after just}} one week, the series amassed more than 39 million Japanese viewers. A Fuji TV {{employee}} revealed that after the first episode aired, the number of hits for their website multiplied five-fold, and that they also received many phone calls inquiring about the drama. Since the series airs at 5 p.m. on weekday evenings, it is particularly popular among housewives and students. Taka Tsukazaki, the CEO of Asia Republic Entertainment, perhaps <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> when he called the series an “an immortal masterpiece that will still give rise to discussion even after five or ten years.” ...|$|E

5000|$|This {{system of}} {{representation}} {{by the amount}} of taxes paid left society {{in the hands of the}} rich. Camille Desmoulins <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best,</b> “ … but what on earth is meant by this expression ‘active citizens’ which we hear repeated so often? Active citizens are the men who stormed the Bastille, those who work the land, whereas the idle members of the Court and the clergy, despite the vast estates which they own, are nothing more than vegetables, vegetables like that tree in scripture which bore no fruit and which was therefore condemned to be thrown into the fire and burned.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Allen {{announced}} he had retired his mare on January 16, 2009. [...] "She’s smart, {{and you can}} rate her; you can really do anything with her,” Allen said. “She just seems like she wants to win. She’s a wonderful mare. We would love to retire her undefeated, but more than anything else, we want to retire her sound; she’s been so good to us. We’ve had a little criticism for not running her in open company and not running her in this or that and all this other stuff. But Joel Marr <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best,</b> ‘If it’s so easy, I’m surprised there haven’t been 100 of them like her.’” ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{recreate}} a typical 1800s Cajun village, the design team {{would have to}} transform 10 acre of farmland into a shaded-lived in community with a waterway running through it. The massive undertaking of reconstruction, dredging of bayous and such was accomplished through local carpenters, businessmen, civic organizations and community volunteers. Even the U.S. Army Reservists of the Lafayette area pitched in by building an information center. The end result was a moment captured in time. Perhaps the 1978 Village Director Mrs. Marti Gutierrez <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> in a Times Picayune special section “The old ways are worth keeping alive, worth handing down, worth remembering.” ...|$|E
50|$|Owen {{also did}} {{a piece for}} Cardiff City's {{appearance}} in the FA Cup final for Match of the Day in 2008. It received positive reviews in the media (The Guardian <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was the <b>best</b> part of the day's coverage) and from football fans across the country.|$|R

5000|$|Culture writer Karla D. Romero of the Spanish {{magazine}} Humanize wrote, [...] "His work embodies {{an ancient}} art, {{with a fresh}} perspective and an overall comprehension of a seemingly fictional New York City, where youth {{took to the streets}} to create art, to tag their social message and connect with their city... If you are of the Picasso mindset, 'Bad artists copy, Good artists steal,' then you will probably hate Vázquez's work, not because he doesn't use a medium that is common, but because he does so {{in a way that is}} unique, organic and graceful... If you believe in originality and the force behind doing something unlike anyone else, then you'll love Vázquez's work. I think Dalí <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best,</b> 'The first man to compare the cheeks of a young woman to a rose was obviously a poet; the first to repeat it was probably an idiot,' Vázquez is clearly a poet." ...|$|E
5000|$|Emerson {{actively}} pursued commissions {{through the}} Treasury Department’s Section of Painting and Sculpture, later renamed the Section of Fine Arts. Some people believed that during these difficult times {{there should be}} higher priorities than art. Harry Hopkins, head of the WPA appointed by FDR, <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> artists “Hell! They’ve got to eat just like other people”. [...] Many feared that if the Depression continued for very long, a generation of artists would be lost and a fatal blow would be dealt to American culture. The Section focused on artwork for federal buildings, rather than state or municipal buildings, like the WPA/FAP. Between 1937 and 1944, Emerson entered 16 competitions for mural commissions including the Department of Justice Building, Washington, DC (1936, 1941), Fort Scott, Kansas (1937), Phoenix, Arizona (1937), Worland, Wyoming (1938), Dallas, Texas (1940), Grand Junction and Littleton, Colorado (1940), Social Security Building, Washington, D.C, (1940 and 1942), Amarillo, Texas (1941), and Los Angeles, California (1944). She won two commissions for post office murals, both funded by the Treasury Department Section of Painting and Sculpture.|$|E
5000|$|The Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 {{was held}} March 15 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The #6 of Mark Martin won the pole. It became evident {{late in the}} race that {{hometown}} favorite Elliott would not be victorious on this day. They had missed on the set-up and he was muddled near 15th all day. Late in the race, leaders Allison, Kulwicki and Gant pitted under green for what would be their final pit stop of the day. Every car on the lead lap had pitted for tires and fuel for the final run, except Elliott, whose Budweiser Ford has always enjoyed remarkable fuel mileage. Suddenly, Mike Wallace spun his Dick Moroso-owned Oldsmobile in turn two, bringing out a caution with 40 laps to go. Astonishingly, the result left Elliott on a lap by himself. Elliott cruised the next 40 circuits for his third straight victory. Perhaps crew chief Tim Brewer <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>best</b> when he quipped, [...] "Maybe we should have backed into Victory Lane, that's sure how we got here!" [...] Gant, Eamhardt, Allison and Trickle rounded out the top five.|$|E
50|$|Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979 is a live album by Leonard Cohen {{released}} in 2001.
