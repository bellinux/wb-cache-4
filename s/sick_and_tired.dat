Paul said, “We {{could take care}} of these poor people if we weren’t trying to maintain an empire overseas”. Ron Paul hit continued to discuss the issue of military non-interventionism, “70% of Americans want war over with and are <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of big government at home and overseas”. They want their “civil liberties and not allow government to spend endlessly and bankrupt us”. Paul also answered questions related to his experience with Medicaid and endorsed allowing civil unions for same-sex couples country-wide, with marriage itself handled solely by religious institutions.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the last}} game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a {{commensurate}} payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh. Dunlap announced in November 1887 {{that he would not}} consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. He said at the time, [...] "I am <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers." [...] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met.

500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot over seven {{days with a}} budget of about $68,000. Both Roger and Gene Corman were present {{for most of the}} film's {{production}} and involved creatively as well as financially. Gene was more involved with running the day-to-day operations while the more experienced Roger Corman supervised and provided guidance to both Gene and Kowalski. Martin Varno was also present for shooting. They operated out of the Charlie Chaplin Studios, which was called Kling Studios at the time. Some rewriting was done as the filming progressed, and director Bernard L. Kowalski called it a collaborative process that involved himself, the Cormans and the whole crew. Varno, however, said he was not happy with how the filming process went, and that the Cormans changed dialogue and story elements without his consultation or permission. He said it reached the point where he called his agent and said, [...] "I am not working for these sons of bitches any more! I am <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of the whole thing!" ...|$|E

She regarded this time together as a period of [...] "hardships and tribulations." [...] Agneta experienced unpleasant and difficult travel and multiple bouts of illness. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "And I was so <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> so <b>tired.</b> Both from the trip by sea and the journey in a peasant wagon that shook me.

500|$|Critics reacted in a {{generally}} positive manner to [...] "Summer Love". Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine gave [...] "Summer Love" [...] a positive review and additionally praised [...] "its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated, [...] "a dreary central-casting pop ballad called 'Summer Love' is enlivened only by another of Timberlake's peculiar announcements: 'I'm <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> {{of trying to}} save the world.' Shaheem Reid and Jayson Rodriguez off MTV News stated that [...] "Summer Love" [...] alongside Timberlake's 2007 singles [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "LoveStoned", rocked every iPod, stereo player and stadium during his tour. North by Northwestern's Dagny Salas called [...] "Summer Love/Set the Mood (Interlude)" [...] a stand-out track on FutureSex/LoveSounds. According to him the song [...] "oozes sun, sex, and a sultry affair". A reviewer of IGN commented that [...] "the bulk of the album is focused on funk lite, but with 'Summer Love/Set The Mood (Prelude)' Timberlake and Timbaland slip into darkness." [...] An editor of Billboard criticized Timbaland's production: [...] "hile the track offers cunning instrumentation, Timbaland's heavy production hand is so overwhelming that the singer is pushed {{to the back of the}} track".|$|E
500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I am <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E
500|$|The {{trend of}} wearing whale tail-revealing jeans started to {{dissipate}} somewhat {{in the mid}} 2000s when American clothing designers started shifting focus from low-slung jeans and exposed midriffs to high-waisted trousers and cardigans. Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion writer of The Guardian, claimed that the whale tail and the muffin top (the bulge of flesh hanging {{over the top of}} low-rider jeans), [...] "twin crimes of modern fashion", had led to the decline in the popularity of hipster jeans. She quoted Louise Hunn, editor of the British edition of InStyle, as saying — [...] "When a look goes too mainstream, people start wearing it badly. And then the really fashionable people run a mile". While the thong still represented 24% of the US$2.5 billion annual market in women's underwear, it stopped growing by end of 2004. By 2007, thongs were overtaken by boyshorts and accounted for only 12% of the panties market. Some vendors, including Victoria's Secret and DKNY, started selling thongs that do not result in whale tails. Adam Lippes, founder of the lingerie line ADAM, said, [...] "Women got tired of it. And they got <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of seeing string hanging out of the top of every celebrity's jeans." ...|$|E

500|$|With Miranda {{imprisoned in}} Spain, Bolívar {{emerged as the}} new leader of the Venezuelan {{independence}} movement. He resolved {{that they would have}} to take some time to prepare before returning to the mainland. Growing bored in Curaçao, MacGregor decided to offer his services to General Antonio Nariño's republican armies in Venezuela's western neighbour, New Granada. He escorted Josefa to lodgings in Jamaica, then travelled to Nariño's base at Tunja in the eastern Andes. Miranda's name won the Scotsman a fresh commission in the service of New Granada, with command of 1,200 men in the Socorro district near the border with Venezuela. There was little action in this sector; Nariño's forces were mainly engaged around Popayán in the south-west, where the Spanish had a large garrison. Rafter reports positively on MacGregor's conduct in Socorro, writing that [...] "by the introduction of the European system of tactics, [...] considerably improved the discipline of the troops", but some under his command disliked him. An official in Cúcuta, the district capital, expressed utter contempt for MacGregor in a letter to a friend: [...] "I am <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of this bluffer, or Quixote, or the devil knows what. This man can hardly serve us in New Granada without heaping ten thousand embarrassments upon us." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time... By the time you get the sounds that you want to record the song, you're <b>sick</b> <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E
