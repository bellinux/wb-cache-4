5000|$|Fluide ("Flow" [...] or [...] "Supernatural Powers"), {{the seventh}} attribute, is {{secretly}} rolled by the Meneur de Jeu {{for the character}} and determines how well they can manipulate the supernatural realm. It grants a bonus {{to one of the}} three magical attributes. <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Pratique de la Magie Blanche (SPMB, [...] "Threshold for Practicing White Magic") and <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Pratique de la Magie Noire (SPMN, [...] "Threshold for Practicing Black Magic") are the attributes for the use of magic. <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Pratique de la Magie Autre (SPMA, [...] "Threshold for Practicing Other Magic") is the attribute for using Psychic powers or sensing the supernatural realm. Only the Mener de Jeu knows what the bonus is and to which form of magic it applies; this keeps magic and psychic powers a dangerous mystery to the players. Fluide rolls are handled as the opposite of Skill or Action rolls; a failure means there are no consequences and [...] "D", [...] "C", [...] "B" [...] and [...] "A" [...] are botches. A botched roll has dire consequences, with [...] "D" [...] being minor and [...] "A" [...] being serious or even deadly for the character.|$|R
2500|$|These channels, called [...] "Rigole de la montagne" [...] (Channel of the Mountain) and [...] "Rigole de la plaine" [...] (Channel of the Plain) {{connected}} the upper three reservoirs (Lampy, Cammazes, and Saint-Ferréol) at the <b>seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze. The Rigole de la Montagne measured 24.269km long and has 22 structures between the outlet at Alzeau and the falls of Cammazes. The Rigole de la Plaine measured 38.121km long at 21.45m altitude and included 68 structures between the Crouzet {{bridge and the}} <b>seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze.|$|R
50|$|The Vasague Aqueduct (Aqueduc de Vasague) is one {{of several}} navigable aqueducts on the Canal du Midi. It is quite near the <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze, and crosses a small stream, Le Fresquel.|$|R
50|$|Finally, Aude is crossed by the Canal du Midi {{which is}} a major {{waterway}} that allows tourists to pass from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. It comes into the west of Aude at <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze then joins the Mediterranean at Sète.|$|R
50|$|The {{vineyard}} area extends 25.57 hectares with the grape varieties of 73% Merlot and 24.4% Cabernet Franc 2.6% Petit Verdot the Grand vin Château Mazeyres {{there is an}} annual production of 5,000 cases, and of the second wine, Le <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Mazeyres:ca. 1,600 cases.|$|R
2500|$|For this {{he planned}} to recover the {{mountain}} waters in dams and reservoirs and then forward them to the <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze through channels crossing the <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Graissens. The water from the Sor passing near Revel was the main supply envisaged by Riquet. Other rivers from the Black Mountain were {{also part of the}} system such as the Alzeau, the Laudot, the Rieutort, the Bernassonne, and the Lampy. Indeed, Black Mountain is a region with twice the rainfall of the plain of Lauragais with 1400 millimetres per year at around 500 to 600m above sea level. To store the river water {{he planned to}} create three basins: the Reservoir of Lampy-Vieux, [...] a hexagonal harbour basin at Naurouze, and the Bassin de Saint-Ferréol with a large earth dam across the mouth of the valley of the Laudot stream.|$|R
25|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{profile of the}} Canal du Midi shows it rising from Toulouse (1) to the <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze (2), then dropping down to Castelnaudary (3), Carcassonne (4) and Trèbes (5). The canal continues to Béziers after the passing through the Fonserannes Locks (6), then Agde (7), to finish at Sète on the étang de Thau (8).|$|R
50|$|Bapaume {{has been}} called the <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Bapaume (Bapaume threshold) due to its {{position}} as a crossing point between Artois and the Flanders plain on one side, and the Somme valley and the Paris Basin on the other. From the mid-11th century there was a Bapaume toll which was revised in 1202 and again in 1442.|$|R

25|$|He {{also set}} up {{experiments}} using the Rigole de la plaine which allowed him {{to prove that it}} was possible to bring the water up to the <b>seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze from the river Sor in the Black Mountain. He also built on his property in Bonrepos a model of the canal with locks, tunnels, and épanchoirs (spillways) reproducing the slopes and feeding all with water.|$|R
25|$|It takes 90 {{million cubic}} metres {{of water to}} feed the canal for one year. To do this, Riquet set up a complex system of water supply to the canal. The idea was to capture {{the waters of the}} Black Mountain located several tens of {{kilometres}} away and bring it to the <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze, the highest point of the future canal, through channels.|$|R

2500|$|Initially, two {{reservoirs}} fed {{the highest}} point of the canal at the <b>seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze: the Bassin de Saint-Ferréol had a capacity of 6.3 million cubic metres and was built between 1667 and 1672. The other reservoir was much smaller - the Bassin de Lampy. Called [...] "Lampy-Vieux", it was quickly replaced by the [...] "Lampy-Neuf" [...] with a capacity of 1,672,000 cubic metres built {{over a hundred years}} later between 1777 and 1782.|$|R
25|$|In 1663 Riquet {{conducted}} {{field studies}} to finally fix the path on the Atlantic side by the <b>seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze along {{the valley of}} the Hers-Vif to Toulouse downstream of the Garonne. The navigable part of the river is downstream of Bazacle which was a ford in the centre of Toulouse, blocking navigation. The canal could not consider not going through the economic heart of the region so therefore the final route was via Castres and the Girou.|$|R
2500|$|The Canal du Midi is {{a summit}} level canal, {{climbing}} from Toulouse on the Atlantic side over {{a distance of}} 52 km to the <b>Seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze or summit level, where the feeder canal enters. The total rise is 57.18 m, and the summit level is {{at an altitude of}} 189.43 m. This difference in level down to the sea is covered over the remaining distance of 188km from Naurouze to Les Onglous on the Étang de Thau.|$|R

25|$|On the Atlantic side, he {{proposed}} several layouts: one {{to pass by}} Castres and Revel through the <b>seuil</b> <b>de</b> Graissens and Agout. In fact this river was already under development for navigation. Another route would pass by the Girou river and avoid Toulouse as in the preceding route. On the Mediterranean side the route was not set. He would use the Fresquel until the Aude but the arrival on the coast was first intended to be at Narbonne then at Sète.|$|R
2500|$|In November 1667 an {{official}} ceremony {{laid the foundation}} stone of the Garonne lock in Toulouse {{in the presence of}} representatives of the Parliament of Toulouse, the Capitouls (sheriffs), and the Archbishop of Toulouse, [...] Charles-François d'Anglure de Bourlemont. A first filling of water was made between the <b>seuil</b> <b>de</b> Naurouze and Toulouse during the winter of 1671-1672 and the first boat traffic could begin. In 1673 the section from Naurouze to Trèbes was completed marking {{the end of the first}} [...] "enterprise".|$|R
