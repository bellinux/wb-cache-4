5|$|Less {{than four}} years after his election, Metropolitan Jonah {{was asked by the}} Holy Synod, in a {{unanimous}} decision, to resign from his position. While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. In the statement, the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> made by him.|$|E

Using established procedures to measure <b>decision</b> <b>specific</b> experience construct, we find, from data for Japanese MNCs for the period 1969 - 1991, empirical evidence that firms tend to rely on both old and recent <b>decision</b> <b>specific</b> experiences for their current ownership structure decision, but that they rely more on recent <b>decision</b> <b>specific</b> experience than on old <b>decision</b> <b>specific</b> experience, contrary to the conventional organizational learning view on the temporal importance of <b>decision</b> <b>specific</b> experience. Sub-sample analysis involving developed and developing countries indicates that both old and new <b>decision</b> <b>specific</b> experience are important for both groups of countries, but old (new) <b>decision</b> <b>specific</b> experience is marginally more important for investments made in developing (developed) countries.

50|$|Judicial {{activism}} {{refers to}} judicial rulings that {{are suspected of}} being based on personal or political considerations, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of judicial restraint. The definition of judicial activism and the <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> that are activist are controversial political issues, particularly in the United States. The question of judicial activism {{is closely related to}} constitutional interpretation, statutory construction, and separation of powers.|$|E

Only by keeping score on a variety of controversies can one begin to identify actual power holders. Pluralism was associated with behavioralism.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulatory}} framework for climate and energy for the period after 2020 is of utmost importance for the further development of renewable energy. This dissertation presents {{the development of an}} approach to analyse and accompany the decision making processes among political actors in this field. The analysis focuses on the debate around European climate and energy targets for 2030, as well as the possible harmonisation of the diverse support schemes for renewable electricity in EU member states. The approach builds upon the multi-criteria decision aid method PROMETHEE to address the <b>specific</b> <b>decision</b> problem of support scheme harmonisation.

5000|$|The Farmer Field School (FFS) is a group-based {{learning}} process. During the FFS, farmers {{carried out}} experiential learning activities that helped them understand {{the ecology of}} their rice fields. These activities involve simple experiments, regular field observations and group analysis. The knowledge gained from these activities enables participants {{to make their own}} locally <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> about crop management practices. This approach represents a radical departure from earlier agricultural extension programmes, in which farmers were expected to adopt generalized recommendations that had been formulated by specialists from outside the community.|$|E
5000|$|As per Bayly, [...] "in Stokes {{hierarchy}} of conditions for historical events of Indian Mutiny of 1857, ecology was the longue durée of Indian agrarian history in colonial period. Above this clustered {{a whole range}} of social and economic forces which determined the propensity to revolt and it was the <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> of British officers and Indian leaders which helped translate these propensities into historical action." [...] "Stokes felt that history was generally a 'harmless pursuit' from which few general conclusions could emerge. His own view of political and social priorities derived not from historical theory but from a notion of natural law and from revealed religion.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{varying with}} unit sales, total {{variable}} selling costs {{are more likely}} to vary directly with the monetary value of the units sold - that is, with revenue. Thus, {{it is more likely that}} variable selling costs will be expressed as a percentage of revenue, rather than a certain monetary amount per unit. The classification of selling costs as fixed or variable will depend on an organization’s structure and on the <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> of management. A number of items, however, typically fall into one category or the other - with the proviso that their status as fixed or variable can be time specific. In the long run, all costs eventually become variable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{philosophy}} {{of education is}} a philosophical discipline in which among other topics first of all questions of evaluations are dealt with and evaluation problems are solved. It is analogous to science, but is not a true scientific discipline: To be sure, the theories are, as in all branches of normative philosophy, dealt with {{as much as possible}} on the basis of scientific principles and using scientific methods. However, it also contains extra-scientific value judgments, because such judgments are indispensable for <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> (e.g., on the moral, religious or ideological aims of education). The value judgments are not simply made, but rather as far as possible justified by means of weighing alternative hypotheses.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the focus}} {{regarding}} the Synod of Whitby {{is on the}} <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> made, then it was simply one of many councils held concerning the proper calculation of Easter throughout Latin Christendom in the Early Middle Ages. It {{addressed the issue of}} Easter calculation and the proper monastic tonsure, and concerned only the part of the English Church that answered to the See of Lindisfarne - that is, it was a Northumbrian affair. Wilfrid's advocation of the Roman Easter has been called, [...] "a triumphant push against an open door", since most of the Irish had already accepted the Roman Easter and for this reason Iona [...] "was already in danger of being pushed to one side by its Irish rivals".|$|E
5000|$|This {{theory is}} very {{closely related to}} the human-relations theory. Motivation of workers is gained through rewards, {{occasional}} punishments, and very little involvement in making decisions and goals. Lower-level employees, in this system, have the freedom to make <b>specific</b> <b>decisions</b> that will affect their work. Upper-management still has control over policies and general decisions that affect an organization. Managers will talk to their subordinates about problems and action plans before they set organizational goals. Communication in this system flows both downward and upward, though upward is more limited. This promotes a more positive effect on employee relationships and allows them to be more cooperative. Lower-level employees are seen as consultants to decisions that were made and are more willing to accept them because of their involvement. Satisfaction in this system improves from benevolent authoritative as does productivity.|$|E
