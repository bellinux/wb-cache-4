5|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, <b>selenium</b> is an {{essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate <b>selenium</b> as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as locoweed, require <b>selenium,</b> and their growth indicates the presence of <b>selenium</b> in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.|$|E
5|$|Certain solids are selenium-rich, and <b>selenium</b> can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, <b>selenium</b> {{most often}} occurs in soluble forms such as {{selenate}} (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains {{significant amounts of}} <b>selenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, <b>selenium</b> is {{necessary}} for life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of <b>selenium</b> is about 1 microgram <b>selenium</b> per gram of whole body weight. Much below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, they die from toxic excess.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low <b>selenium</b> soil levels lead to low {{concentrations}} in the plants, some animal species may be deficient unless <b>selenium</b> is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary <b>selenium</b> is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher <b>selenium</b> requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both <b>selenium</b> and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to <b>selenium,</b> some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} of <b>selenium</b> usually involves {{the extraction of}} <b>selenium</b> dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce <b>selenium</b> dioxide, which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental <b>selenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} replaces the sulfur. Commercially, <b>selenium</b> is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for <b>selenium</b> today are glassmaking and pigments. <b>Selenium</b> is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. <b>Selenium</b> is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of <b>selenium</b> as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. <b>Selenium</b> can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental <b>selenium</b> comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of <b>selenium</b> because only a comparably small part of the <b>selenium</b> in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a <b>selenium</b> mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like <b>selenium</b> for the moon well before the discovery of <b>selenium.</b> <b>Selenium</b> is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|Shive held several patents {{including}} <b>Selenium</b> rectifier {{and method}} of making it, Directly heated thermocouple, Photoresistive translating device, <b>Selenium</b> rectifier including tellurium and method of making it, Apparatus for and method of treating <b>selenium</b> rectifiers, Semiconductor photoelectric device, Conditioning of semiconductor translators, Semiconductor amplifier, and Alternating gate current.|$|E
5|$|Some of the <b>selenium</b> oxyhalides, such as <b>selenium</b> {{oxyfluoride}} (SeOF2) and <b>selenium</b> oxychloride (SeOCl2) {{have been}} used as specialty solvents.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{correlative}} epidemiological studies have implicated <b>selenium</b> deficiency (measured by blood levels) {{in a number}} of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. In addition, <b>selenium</b> supplementation {{has been found to be}} a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey <b>selenium</b> was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using <b>selenium</b> were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The <b>selenium</b> cell {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. <b>Selenium</b> transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of <b>selenium</b> rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.|$|E
5|$|In living systems, <b>selenium</b> {{is found}} in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, <b>selenium</b> plays a role {{analogous}} to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.|$|E
5|$|Native (i.e., elemental) <b>selenium</b> {{is a rare}} mineral, {{which does}} not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny {{acicular}} (hair-like) crystals. Isolation of <b>selenium</b> is often complicated {{by the presence of}} other compounds and elements.|$|E
5|$|One {{study of}} 118 exocrine {{pancreatic}} cancer (EPC) patients and 399 hospital controls in eastern Spain found high <b>selenium</b> concentrations to be inversely {{associated with the}} risk of EPC. However, in randomized, blinded, controlled prospective trials in humans, <b>selenium</b> supplementation has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of any disease, nor has a meta-analysis of such <b>selenium</b> supplementation studies detected a decrease in overall mortality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> deficiency, {{defined by}} low (<60% of normal) {{selenoenzyme}} activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues, occurs {{only when a}} low <b>selenium</b> level is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or increased oxidant stress from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> {{disulfide}} {{consists of}} 8-membered rings. It has an approximate composition of SeS2, with individual rings varying in composition, such as Se4S4 and Se2S6. <b>Selenium</b> disulfide {{has been used}} in shampoo as an antidandruff agent, an inhibitor in polymer chemistry, a glass dye, and a reducing agent in fireworks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, <b>selenium</b> is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black <b>selenium</b> is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50°C and converts to gray <b>selenium</b> at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> {{interacts with}} other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of <b>selenium</b> {{deficiency}} on health remains uncertain, particularly {{in relation to}} Kashin-Beck disease. Also, <b>selenium</b> interacts with other minerals, such as zinc and copper. High doses of Se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio and lead to Zn reduction; in such treatment cases, Zn levels should be monitored. Further {{studies are needed to}} conﬁrm these interactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> is a {{catalyst}} in some chemical reactions, {{but it is}} not widely used because of issues with toxicity. In X-ray crystallography, incorporation of one or more <b>selenium</b> atoms in place of sulfur helps with multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> is a {{component}} of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, <b>selenium</b> is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require <b>selenium).</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> {{is used in}} the toning of {{photographic}} prints, and it is sold as a toner by numerous photographic manufacturers. <b>Selenium</b> intensifies and extends the tonal range of black-and-white photographic images and improves the permanence of prints.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} {{of lead in}} drinking water applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, <b>selenium</b> improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. <b>Selenium</b> produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> may be {{measured}} in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of <b>selenium</b> are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine <b>selenium</b> concentrations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> may inhibit Hashimoto's disease, {{in which}} the body's own thyroid cells are {{attacked}} as alien. A reduction of 21% on TPO antibodies is reported with the dietary intake of 0.2mg of <b>selenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Selenium</b> shows {{borderline}} metalloid or nonmetal behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Vitamin E and <b>selenium</b> were {{proposed}} and later rejected {{as a potential}} method of protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity. There is however some experimental evidence in rats that vitamin E and <b>selenium</b> aid in preventing in vivo lipid peroxidation and free radical damage, and therefore prevent retinal changes following repetitive hyperbaric oxygen exposures.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal selenides {{react with}} <b>selenium</b> to form polyselenides, , which exist as chains.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>selenium</b> is an {{essential}} trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from <b>selenium</b> toxicity. This coal was shown to have <b>selenium</b> content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold {{more often than}} in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to <b>selenium,</b> tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of <b>selenium</b> and only traces of tellurium.|$|E
5|$|Anthropogenic {{sources of}} <b>selenium</b> include coal burning, and the mining and {{smelting}} of sulfide ores.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, {{phosphorus}} and <b>selenium</b> {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. <b>Selenium</b> has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{published}} {{its final}} rule establishing {{the requirement of}} minimum and maximum levels of <b>selenium</b> in infant formula.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with its sulfur counterpart (sulfur hexafluoride), <b>selenium</b> hexafluoride (SeF6) is more reactive {{and is a}} toxic pulmonary irritant.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, <b>selenium</b> and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and <b>selenium</b> as grey <b>selenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mixtures of <b>selenium</b> and {{tellurium}} {{are used}} with barium peroxide as an oxidizer in the delay powder of electric blasting caps.|$|E
