40|$|One {{aspect of}} Project REDY (Rural Education-Disadvantaged Youth) was to {{identify}} elements of family living which were satisfying to residents of an economically <b>depressed</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> in Southern Illinois. McVoy's Wants and Satisfaction scale was administered to 115 family heads to determine {{the degree to which}} certain wishes and interests of families residing in the area were satisfied. Four major areas of family living were examined: residence; consumer goods; family welfare; and social participation. It was found that there are aspects of rural life which are very satisfying to rural people, even to those who are severely disadvantaged; there are also certain aspects of rural life which are less satisfying. It was concluded that American society should accept the moral responsibility for improving the <b>depressed</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> rather than attempting to cast rural people into the mold of urban society.

Some findings were: (I) Approximately 87 percent of families living in the area and 74 percent of the severely disadvantagecJ famdies considered themselves as not being greatly dissatisfied with famdy life. (2) Residents of economically <b>depressed</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> have low aspirations for economic success and derive their primary satisfaction from non-economic aspects of family living. (3) Families tended to value thing-oriented aspects of family living more than the people-oriented aspects. (4) They placed a higher value on consumer goods than on residences, and (5) They tended to value the aspects of social participation slightly more than family welfare. It would appear that the families living in the <b>depressed</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> have adjusted their value system so that they are able to gain the greatest satisfaction from those things which are most available to them.

From further afield, Northern England saw immigration from European countries such as Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Scandinavia, and from East Asia and Africa. Some immigrants were well-to-do industrialists seeking to do business in the booming industrial cities, some were escaping poverty, some were servants or slaves, some were sailors who chose to settle in the port towns, some were Jews fleeing pogroms on the continent, and some were migrants originally stranded at Liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to the United States or to colonies of the British Empire.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{introduce}} {{a model of}} community health service organization (as implemented in urban areas) to less developed <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in China and evaluate {{the impact of this}} model on health care utilization. Methods The intervention involved developing leadership at county level, training rural health practitioners, providing clinical management guidelines and standards, encouraging clinic improvements and providing access to subsidies for public health work. We chose 7 townships and 49 administrative villages in Chongyi County as the intervention sites; 3 townships and 9 administrative villages in Luxi County as the comparison sites. Officers from county health bureaus and postgraduates from School of Public Health, Nanchang University visited each township hospital and village clinic in field together and made observations and interviewed clinic staff. Results There was little change in health facilities or workforce in the two areas. However, there was an increase in the use of public health services at township and village level in the intervention sites in Chongyi. In these, the proportion of clinics which had developed a child health (under the age of 3) management system, maternal postpartum visit and chronic disease management increased from 53 %, 51 % and 47 % to 78 %, 73 %, and 71 % respectively. There was no significant change in the comparison sites. Conclusions The trial demonstrated that it was feasible to implement a model of community health service delivery that was adapted to <b>depressed</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> because it required little organizational change, additional funding or personnel. The model had a positive impact on the provision of public health programs, a finding which has implications for efforts to improve access to primary health care in rural China. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{region of}} Valencia has a marked {{territorial}} duality: an urbanised, populated and high-income coastal line, and mountain and <b>depressed</b> inland <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> This territorial duality also derives in a functional duality, so that market and regulation drivers seem to assign <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> specific roles for {{the provision of}} raw materials, energy, water, and the like. One of the clearest examples {{can be found in the}} design and development of the Wing Energy Plan passed by the Regional Government in 2001, which designated areas for the installation of windmills. However, this regulation has resulted in an outstanding emergence of associations that have organised at several levels (from the local to the national) as a strong opposition movement to the local developments of the Plan. With this background, the objective of this paper is to analyze, from a set of case studies, the processes of emergence and the evolution of collective actors (associations) which have been arising in many <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> as a response to the local applications of the Wind Energy Plan.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Rising {{energy costs}} {{coupled with the}} {{diminishing}} incomes associated with rural economic restructuring leave an increasing proportion of rural households faced with the heat or eat dilemma [...] where families must choose between meeting one basic need over another, such as putting {{food on the table}} or keeping the heat on. Effective and sustainable energy relief programs are needed to move low-income families beyond the heat or eat dilemma and toward greater self-sufficiency, particularly in economically <b>depressed</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Over the past two decades, devolution has placed a greater emphasis on local solutions to social problems, yet the capacity in rural places to delivery critical services is often constrained by geographic distances, economy of scale priorities, limited organizational capacity, and community ideologies related to poverty and the poor. Using a case study approach and Lipsky's (2010) theory of Street-Level Bureaucracy as a framework, the failed implementation of Program Power was examined. Program Power, a novel rural Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), was designed as a holistic intervention and proposed the use of intensive case management as a means for moving low income families toward greater energy security and eventual self-sufficiency. This study makes use of existing qualitative data gathered during the EmPowering REAL Families (ERF) implementation study. In-depth interviews and observations with Program Power participants, staff, and community collaborators were examined. The analysis revealed how limited resources (too little time and money) and an organizational ethos about poverty that prioritized individual efforts (motivation and goals) for families who presented with complex needs created work place conditions conducive to the use of case manager discretion, {{while at the same time}} also made it difficult for case managers to respond to families using an individualized intervention. We document, in particular, how case managers, in response, used their discretion to make a series of changes to the program model. Findings thus provide insights into the ground-level challenges faced during the implementation of a rural social support program. Recommendations for policy and program changes are also discussed...|$|R

This objective is approached using district level data for England and Wales, aggregated for 1989 - 1992. Two techniques are used, and compared. The first is the traditional method of mapping Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR), expressed as relative risks. The second technique employed is the relatively new method of empirical Bayes estimates (EBE). It is shown that this is a superior measure for an initial investigation of the distribution of suicide, as relative risks for this comparatively rare condition are highly dependent on the population size of the areas studied. Discernible trends of high risk are shown in high population density, urban areas for both sexes, and in economically <b>depressed</b> agricultural, <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> for men. The effects of economic hardship, unemployment and social disintegration are suggested as contributing to this distribution in an initiatory or exacerbatory capacity, for those suffering from psychiatric vulnerability or existing mental illness.

The analysis analyzes the importance of industrial districts for rural development and provides some recommendations regarding policy strategies. Specifically, the study illustrates some relevant results. First, industrial districts are present in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> of Italy and Spain although their importance is higher in Spain. Second, industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> are geographically concentrated in a few <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Third, patterns of specialization of industrial districts in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> do not differ from their patterns in other <b>areas.</b> Fourth, predominantly <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with industrial districts grow between two and three times faster than the rest of <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Fifth, a significant share of the growth of <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> with industrial districts is explained by the more dynamic behaviour of these districts.
