5|$|The Nizam was {{prepared}} {{to enter into a}} limited treaty with India, which gave Hyderabad safeguards not provided for in the <b>standard</b> <b>Instrument</b> of Accession, such as a provision guaranteeing Hyderabad's neutrality {{in the event of a}} conflict between India and Pakistan. India rejected this proposal, arguing that other states would demand similar concessions. A temporary Standstill Agreement was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India. By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was blockading his state, a charge India denied.|$|E

25|$|In 1828, {{physician}} Philip Syng Physick modified {{an existing}} instrument originally designed by Benjamin Bell for removing the uvula; the instrument, {{known as the}} tonsil guillotine (and later as a tonsillotome), became the <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> for tonsil removal for over 80 years. By 1897, it became more common to perform complete rather than partial removal of the tonsil after American physician Ballenger noted that partial removal failed to completely alleviate symptoms in a majority of cases. His results using a technique involving removal of the tonsil with a scalpel and forceps were much better than partial removal; tonsillectomy using the guillotine eventually fell out of favor in America.|$|E
25|$|The {{final report}} was {{released}} in November 2008, {{one year after the}} crash. It was determined that the accident was caused by pilot error {{as a result of the}} condition known as spatial disorientation. The Turkish Transport minister Binali Yıldırım stated that the crash was a “normal controlled flight into terrain by the fault of the crew.” The report states that the GPWS was not able to produce audible alarms due to a defect. Both the captain and the first officer were rather inexperienced and it was their first approach to Isparta. They did neither enter the <b>Standard</b> <b>Instrument</b> Departure of Istanbul nor the Standard Terminal Arrival Route and approach procedure of Isparta into the flight management system.|$|E

500|$|In rare cases, sound {{reinforcement}} subwoofer enclosures {{are also}} used for bass instrument amplification by electric bass players and synth bass players. For most bands and most small- to mid-size venues (e.g., nightclubs and bars), standard bass guitar speaker enclosures or keyboard amplifiers will provide sufficient sound pressure levels for onstage monitoring. Since a regular electric bass has a low [...] "E" [...] (41Hz) as its lowest note, most standard bass guitar cabinets are only designed with a range that goes down to about 40Hz. However, in some cases, performers wish to have extended sub-bass response that is not available from <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> speaker enclosures, so they use subwoofer cabinets. Just as some electric guitarists add huge stacks of guitar cabinets mainly for show, some bassists will add immense subwoofer cabinets with 18-inch woofers mainly for show, and the extension sub cabinets will be operated at a lower volume than the main bass cabinets.|$|E

This <b>Standard</b> <b>Instrument</b> Departure involved taking-off to the west over the Instrument Landing System localiser and middle marker beacon of the reciprocal Runway 09 Left, turning left to intercept the 145° bearing to the Epsom Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) (to be passed at [...] or more), and then proceeding to Dover.

2500|$|Interiors {{were all}} new and {{featured}} a vastly improved instrument panel, that used ABS plastic {{for much of}} its construction. The <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> cluster featured five equally sized round pods and contained a speedometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge, along with various warning lights. The leftmost pod was a vent for the [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation system. A clock was optional with the <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> package. The [...] "Instrumentation Group", available on all V8 models, featured two large round pods centered on the steering wheel, containing the speedometer (with trip odometer) and a tachometer. A third equal sized pod on the left contained the DirectAire vent. The instrument cluster featured an ammeter, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge and clock in set of smaller stacked pods near {{the centre of the}} instrument panel. The seats were also new for 1972, the standard front bench seat had an integrated headrest for both outboard seating positions featuring, while the available high back buckets also featured integrated headrests. Ford continued to offer [...] "comfort weave" [...] vinyl seats as an option.

Armies from Switzerland and southern Germany {{are known to have}} used the fife (German: Soldatenpfeife) as early as the 15th century. Swiss and German mercenaries were hired by monarchs throughout Western Europe, and they spread the practice of military fifing.

2500|$|When {{the flight}} was [...] from runway 34 and at an {{altitude}} of , air traffic control instructed the crew to continue the approach and report as soon as they had established visual contact with the runway.

Continuing to descend, the aircraft reached its minimum descent altitude (MDA) of [...] – the lowest altitude to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a <b>standard</b> <b>instrument</b> approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided (the airport was not equipped with an instrument landing system) – but both pilots said that they still had no visual reference to the runway or its approach lighting system because of the thick fog.

60|$|Rampore-Bauleah {{is a large}} {{station on}} the north bank of the Ganges, whose stream is at this season fully a mile wide, with a very slow current; its banks are thirty feet above the water. We were most kindly {{received}} by Mr. Bell, the collector of the district, to whom we were greatly indebted for furthering us on our voyage: boats being very difficult to procure, we were, however, detained here from the 16th to the 19th. I was fortunate {{in being able to}} compare my barometers with a first-rate <b>standard</b> <b>instrument,</b> and in finding no appreciable alteration since leaving Calcutta in the previous April. The elevation of the station is 130 feet above the sea, that of Kishengunj I made 131; so that the Gangetic valley is nearly a dead level for fully a hundred miles north, beyond which it rises; Titalya, 150 miles to the north, being 360 feet, and Siligoree, at the margin of the Terai, rather higher. The river again falls more considerably than the land; the Mahanuddy, at Kishengunj, being about twenty feet below the level of the plains, or 110 above the sea; whereas the Ganges, at Rampore, is probably not more than eighty feet, even when the water is highest.|$|E
