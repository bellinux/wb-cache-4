Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate guidance to the pilot on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures.

5|$|Hydrogen {{is highly}} soluble in many rare earth and {{transition}} metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's {{main propulsion system}} is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves.

50|$|A {{convection}} heat storage unit (CHS) system {{is similar to}} an ICS system, except the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> and collector are physically separated and transfer {{between the two is}} driven by convection. CHS systems typically use standard flat-plate type or evacuated tube collectors. The <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> must be located above the collectors for convection to work properly. The main benefit of CHS systems over ICS systems is that heat loss is largely avoided since the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> can be fully insulated. Since the panels are located below the <b>storage</b> <b>tank,</b> heat loss does not cause convection, as the cold water stays at the lowest part of the system.|$|R
40|$|This {{capstone}} {{project is}} a proactive approach to addressing a problem observed in many underground <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> facilities; owners and operator failure to understand the Pennsylvania state regulations. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) enacted the <b>Storage</b> <b>Tank</b> and Spill Prevention Act in 1989. Now, twenty years later, government regulators are still struggling to achieve {{a high rate of}} compliance at <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> facilities. Most of the non-compliant <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> facilities in question are gas stations. Some of the factors contributing to the non-compliance are: limited understanding of the English language; complexity of the regulations; constant evolution of the regulations; and the ignorance of responsibility and consequences. In many cases, these impediments lead to an apathetic attitude toward the requirements. I have created a plain-language guidance document that explains <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> systems and key regulations. My goal is to have the document published by the PA DEP so that it may be handed out to the regulated community. Over the next few years, Pennsylvania will be implementing a federally mandated operator training. This document would be a great complement to the training goals of the federal and state government agencies. In addition, achieving compliance at underground <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> facilities is of great importance for protecting our groundwater supplies. Pennsylvania has had over 14, 000 releases of regulated substances from <b>storage</b> <b>tank...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

40|$|This article {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} thermal {{performance of a}} heat pump system with an ice storage subcooler. The system supplies heating and cooling demands to two greenhouses with temperature ranging 308 similar to 323 K and 273 similar to 291 K respectively and utilizes an ice <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> to subcool the condensed refrigerant, which can enhance the system coefficient of performance (COP). The ice <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> charges for storing ice, when the cooling load {{is less than the}} nominal cooling capacity. While the cooling load is larger than the nominal cooling capacity, the ice <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> discharges for subcooling. The results show that in the charge mode the heat pump COP of ice storage system is 12 % higher than that without ice <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> Under the discharge mode, the ice storage system provides the refrigerator COP 15 % higher than that without ice <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} of {{domestic}} wastewater treatment {{in term of}} bacterial removal using conventional septictank in many developed towns is lack of land to purify domestic sewage into 10 m minimum safety distance according to WHO regulation. It is necessary to develop new treatment system to ensure bacterial will be removed 100 percent less than 10 m distance. Channel System Filter Septictank (CSF Septictank) is designed {{to solve the problem}} above. CSF Septictank is a common septictank equipped with filter tank separated by several partition walls to shape channels. CSF will consist of three parts: initial <b>storage</b> <b>tank,</b> filter <b>tank</b> and final <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> The Filter tank is fully filled with fine sand as filter medium. Wastewater will flows from the initial <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> then pass the filter tank and entering the final <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> as product of CSF Septictank treatment.
