5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or <b>Standard</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach</b> as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off {{the far end of}} the active runway that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E
25|$|The UK had {{for some}} time used a blind landing system known as <b>Standard</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach,</b> an {{adaptation}} of a pre-war German system known as a Lorenz beam.

25|$|During {{development}} of the earlier Mk.

40|$|Many {{applications}} of particle accelerators require beams with high intensity and low emittance {{in a stable}} fashion. An important research area involves the study of space-charge forces in beams, which are significant at low energy. Research reported in this dissertation was done on the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER), a particle accelerator designed for research on space-charge-dominated beams. High-precision control of space-charge-dominated beams is very challenging. However, <b>standard</b> <b>beam</b> control <b>approaches</b> do not work well on UMER. This is due to UMER’s unique structure, {{in which there are}} fewer beam position monitors than beam position correctors and a complex coupling between the horizontal and vertical kicker magnets. In this work, a novel beam control algorithm was devel-oped based on the closed-orbit response matrix, and this algorithm was applied to UMER. The algorithm markedly improves UMER’s multi-turn operation while re-ducing closed orbit distortion. Using the orbit response matrix, a diagnosis method was developed that expeditiously detected malfunctions in components such as bea...|$|R

The first system had been installed in 1932 at Berlin-Tempelhof Central Airport, followed by Dübendorf in Switzerland (1934) and others all over the world. The Lorenz company referred to it simply as the Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer, German for [...] "ultra-short-wave landing radio beacon", or LFF. Prior to the World War II the Germans had deployed the landing aid system at many Luftwaffe airfields in and outside Germany and equipped most of their bombers with the radio equipment needed to use it.

40|$|Hidden Markov {{models and}} linear-chain {{conditional}} random fields (CRFs) are applicable to many tasks in spoken language processing. In large state spaces, however, training can be expensive, because it often requires many iterations of forward-backward. Beam search {{is a standard}} heuristic for controlling complexity during Viterbi decoding, but during forward-backward, <b>standard</b> <b>beam</b> heuristics can be dangerous, as they can make training unstable. We introduce sparse forward-backward, a variational perspective on beam methods that uses an approximating mixture of Kronecker delta functions. This motivates a novel minimum-divergence beam criterion based on minimizing KL divergence between the respective marginal distributions. Our <b>beam</b> selection <b>approach</b> is not only more efficient for Viterbi decoding, but also more stable within sparse forward-backward training.
