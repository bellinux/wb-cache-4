40|$|Objective The {{prevalence}} of {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) is increasing worldwide. Although increased levels of coeliac disease (CD) autoantibodies are often <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> the importance of biopsy-verified CD for the risk of future ESRD is unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to investigate the risk of future ESRD in individuals with CD. Methods This was a population-based prospective cohort study. 29 050 individuals with CD (Marsh III) were identified through small-intestinal biopsy reports obtained between July 1969 and February 2008 in Sweden's 28 pathology departments. ESRD was defined as the need for renal dialysis or renal transplant in accordance with the international classification of disease and procedure codes in Swedish patient registers. Using Cox regression, the risk of ESRD in individuals with CD compared with age- and sex-matched reference individuals was estimated. Results During follow-up, 90 individuals with CD developed ESRD (expected count 31). This corresponded to a HR for ESRD of 2. 87 (95 % CI 2. 22 to 3. 71, p< 0. 001). Adjusting for diabetes mellitus had only a marginal effect on the risk estimate (HR 2. 52, 95 % CI 1. 92 to 3. 31). Excluding individuals with any urinary/renal disorder before study entry, the HR for ESRD in CD was 2. 47 (95 % CI 1. 80 to 3. 40). When restricting the outcome measure to ESRD confirmed by independent data from the Swedish Renal Registry (SRR), the risk estimate increased to 3. 20 (95 % CI 2. 39 to 4. 28). Conclusion This study indicates that individuals with biopsy-verified CD suffer increased risk of subsequent ESRD...|$|E

40|$|Expression of type 1 {{plasminogen}} activator inhibitor in renal {{tissue in}} murine lupus nephritis. Many renal diseases {{are associated with}} fibrin deposition in the glomeruli, a situation that reflects an abnormality in the balance between the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. We recently demonstrated that normal mouse kidney contains very low levels of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1), a potent anti-fibrinolytic protein, but that during endotoxemia, large amounts of PAI- 1 protein and mRNA are expressed in glomerular and peritubular endothelial cells. These results raise the possibility that overexpression of PAI- 1 in the glomerulus {{may contribute to the}} ongoing pathology <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> To directly investigate this possibility, we studied PAI- 1 expression in MRL/lpr mice, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Female MRL/lpr mice develop early onset lupus glomerulonephritis (GN), a disease in which fibrin deposition is detected in the glomerulus and in which anti-coagulation therapy improves the prognosis. We detected very low levels of PAI- 1 mRNA and antigen in the smooth muscle cells of renal vessels and in the renal papilla of 16 control mice. In contrast, PAI- 1 was expressed in relatively high levels throughout the kidneys of 33 out of 34 diseased mice, both within the glomerulus and also in tubules and vessels. Moreover, the level of PAI- 1 in the tissues seemed to correlate with the severity of the disease. PAI- 1 expression was localized to endothelial cells, parietal epithelial cells, tubular epithelial cells and infiltrating mononuclear cells in the tubulointerstitium. None of these cells express detectable levels of PAI- 1 in the normal kidney. The inappropriate expression of PAI- 1 in the kidneys of mice with lupus GN suggests that this important inhibitor of fibrinolysis {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of this disease process...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{mammalian}} embryonic kidney becomes {{progressively more}} elaborate as the ureteric bud branches into undifferentiated mesenchyme. Morphological perturbations of nephrogenesis, {{such as those}} <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> inherited <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> or induced <b>in</b> transgenic animals, require careful and often tedious documentation by multiple methodologies. We have applied a relatively quick and simple approach combining two-photon microscopy and advanced three-dimensional (3 -D) imaging techniques to visualize and evaluate these complex events. As compared with laser confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy offers superior optical sectioning deep into biological tissues, permitting analysis of large, heterogeneous, 3 -D structures such as developing mouse kidney. Embryonic and newborn mouse kidneys were fluorescently labeled with lectins, phalloidin, or antibody. Three-dimensional image volumes were then collected. The resulting volume data sets were processed using a novel 3 -D visualization technique. Reconstructed image volumes demonstrate the dichotomous branching of ureteric bud as it progresses from a simple, symmetrical structure into an elaborate, asymmetrical collecting system of multiple branches. Detailed morphology of in situ cysts was elucidated in a transgene-induced mouse model of polycystic kidney disease. We expect this integration of two-photon microscopy with advanced 3 -D image analysis will provide {{a powerful tool for}} illuminating a variety of complex developmental processes in multiple dimensions...|$|R

Ampicillin and sulbactam are both hydrophilic antibiotics {{and have a}} volume of distribution (Vd) similar to the volume of extra-cellular body water. The volume that the drug distributes throughout in healthy patients is approximately 0.2 liters per kilogram of body weight. Patients on hemodialysis, elderly patients, and pediatric patients have shown a slightly increased volume of distribution. Using typical doses, ampicillin/sulbactam {{has been shown to}} reach desired levels to treat infections in the brain, lungs, and abdominal tissues. Both agents have moderate protein binding, reported at 38% for sulbactam and 28% for ampicillin.15,16 The half-life of ampicillin is approximately 1 hour, when used alone or in combination with sulbactam; therefore it will be completely eliminated from a healthy person in around 5 hours. It is eliminated primarily by the urinary system, with 75% excreted unchanged in the urine. Only small amounts of each drug were found to be excreted in the bile. Ampicillin/sulbactam should be given with caution in infants less than a week old and premature neonates. This is due to the underdeveloped urinary system in these patients, which can cause a significantly increased half-life for both drugs.16 Based on its elimination, ampicillin/sulbactam is typically given every 6 to 8 hours.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical and {{therapeutic}} characteristics of chronic dialysis patients vary widely at national and/or regional levels. Their increased cardiovascular (CV) mortality is not explained by traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors only. Therefore, this study aimed {{to investigate and}} compare the characteristics of patients starting dialysis in a homogeneous Alpin region and possibly to identify new biological parameters (phenotypes or genotypes), which eould {{be responsible for the}} increased CVD <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> end-stage <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> (ESRD) patients. METHODS: A cohort of 279 non-selected consecutive patients entering a dialysis program was prospectively investigated in eight centers of three adjacent regions in France, Italy and Switzerland. In addition to the usual demographic, clinical and biological data, we analyzed at study entry the blood levels of homocysteine, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and antioxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) antibodies, vitamin B 12 status, Lp(a) and haptoglobin phenotypes, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), allele epsilon E 4 of apolipoprotein (ApoE 4) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) genetic polymorphism. RESULTS: At entry, 90. 3 % of patients were hypertensive, 30 % had type 2 diabetes mellitus and 17. 6 % were current smokers; 42 % of patients had already experienced at least one CV event: peripheral artery disease (26 % of the cohort), coronary artery disease (22 %) or ischemic cerebro-vascular disease (16 %). Forty-two patients had had &gt; or = 2 CV events or documented atherosclerotic localizations. Anemia was not optimally treated: mean hemoglobin (Hb) was at 97. 7 g/L and, while overall 62 % of patients received erythropoietin (EPO) prior to dialysis, large national differences were observed. Compared to the reference population, ESRD patients exhibited increased homocysteinemia, Lp(a) levels and ApoE 4 allele prevalence. Conversely, the distribution of Lp(a) phenotype, MTHFR TT, ACE DD and PAI- 1 4 G/ 4 G was equivalent to that of the reference population. In addition, none of the analyzed phenotypical or genotypical parameters, except for the haptoglobin 2. 2 phenotype, could be associated with the existence of a previous adverse CV event. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The clinical characteristics of the ESRD patients entering dialysis in our region were comparable to the currently observed dialysis populations in most European countries with the deleterious role of advancing age, diabetes, previous CVD, smoking and hypertension evident (2). Except for anemia therapy, there were no regional or national differences observed at dialysis start. (3) An analysis of the phenotypic and genotypic CV risk factors demonstrated differences with the reference population only for hyperhomocysteinemia, Lp(a) and ApoE 4 allele prevalence, with no notable differences among the participating centers...|$|R
40|$|Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a {{major cause}} of {{progressive}} chronic renal failure (CRF) and accounts for less than 20 % in the UK of patients requiring dialysis and transplantation. There are many forms of GN, of which IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common, affecting up to 2 % of the adult population. GN is characterised by irreversible and progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and retention of uremic toxins. The rate of progression of GN is increased by various clinical factors including hypertension, and the quantity and specificity of proteinuria. Although albuminuria is most widely studied, higher molecular weight proteins such as immunoglobulins (Ig) are more associated with progression of <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>In</b> this thesis I have explored the hypothesis that an interaction between tubular cells and filtered Ig/immuno complex (Ig/IC) may involve specific cellular receptors, and thus provide a novel mechanism for the initiation of tubular injury and fibrosis. Deposition of Ig and IC is <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> such as membranous glomerulonephritis, and IgAN. Ig/IC are regarded as responsible for the initiation of glomerular injury in these diseases. However, whether Ig/IC contribute directly to tubular injury is unknown. We previously identified a novel IgA receptor, the Fcα/μ receptor (Fcα/μR), in mesangial cells which may contribute to IgAN. This receptor binds both IgA and IgM but not IgG. I hypothesised that Ig and IC, filtered at the glomerulus, may act on Ig receptors in human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) and may play a direct pathophysiological {{role in the development of}} interstitial fibrosis. Specifically, that filtered IgA may bind to the Fcα/μR in IgAN. The activation of Ig receptors may stimulate tubular cells to alter cell proliferation and extracellular matrix formation (e. g fibronectin (FN)), which are pathophysiological characteristics of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in GN. I studied primary and immortalised human PTEC using qualitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for expression of candidate Ig receptors. I investigated the expression of Ig receptors and their regulation by cytokines (e. g. IFN-γ, TGF-β 1 and IL- 1 α) known to be implicated in GN. The receptors studied include the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), the neonatal receptor (FcRn), the Fcα/μR, the classical IgG receptors (FcγR 1, γIIa, γIIb, γIII and the related FcR γ-chain) and the classical IgA receptor (FcαR). None of the classical IgG receptors were expressed by PTEC, nor was the classical IgA receptor. However, the FcRn, pIgR and the Fcα/μR were expressed. Gene expression of these receptors was investigated under cytokine regulation. IFN-γ, IL- 1 α and TGF-β 1 had no effect on FcRn gene expression. The expression of the pIgR gene was up-regulated by IFN-γ and the Fcα/μR transcript level was up-regulated by IL- 1 α and IFN-γ but down-regulated by TGF-β 1. Expression of Fcα/µR protein by tubular cells was confirmed by western blot analysis by using specific Fcα/µR monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of Fcα/µR by PTEC in both normal and diseased kidney and that IgG, IgA and IgM binding varies in parallel with gene expression of related Fc receptors. This binding was associated with increased FN production (assessed by ELISA) and reduced the proliferation of PTEC, demonstrated by [3 H]-thymidine uptake assay. I screened the ability of PTEC to release cytokines under normal conditions and confirmed this by ProteoPlex cytokine array. Among these cytokines there was no significant effect of Ig/IC on IL- 6, IL- 8 and GM-CSF released by PTEC, and this was confirmed by specific ELISA for each individual cytokine. The phosphotyrosine/phospho-ERK signalling pathway was unaffected by Ig/IC; however, IgM was able to activate the phospho-ERK pathway. These results suggest that there might be alternative signalling pathways activated by Ig/IC in PTEC. I then studied the effect of calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressive drugs as a model of tubular toxicity, and statins as immunomodulatory drugs, reputed to protect renal function and known to have immunomodulatory effects. I hypothesised that immunosuppressant agents/statins either alone or in combination with LPS might affect Ig receptors expression, cytokine release, FN production and proliferation by PTEC. My results inferred that immunosuppressive agents alone have a non-inflammatory response on Ig receptor expression. However, in combination with LPS, the study drugs showed a slight inhibitory effect on the expression of the pIgR on PTEC at the highest concentration only. There was no significant effect of immunosuppressant agents alone or in combination with LPS on IL- 6, IL 8 and GM-CSF released by PTEC. Cyclosporine, FK 506 and sirolimus were shown to inhibit both the production of FN and the growth of PTEC at high doses, thereby exerting an antiproliferative effect. Both simvastatin and fluvastatin inhibited LPS induced production of IL- 6, IL- 8 and GM-CSF, FN and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. 1 micromolar simvastatin/fluvastatin was associated with a 35 % reduction in unstimulated FN production, a 51 % reduction in proliferation, and reduced production of IL- 6 (58 %), IL- 8 (65 %) and GM-CSF (57 %). The expression of Ig receptors was increased in a dose-dependent manner in PTEC treated with statins alone or in combination with LPS. In conclusion, the expression of tubular FcRn, pIgR and Fcα/µR by PTEC is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines. The binding of IgA and IgM, possibly through the Fcα/µR, by PTEC may contribute to immune-mediated nephropathy. The FN production and the proliferation suggest that Ig/IC binding may contribute to the pathophysiology of IC-mediated <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> The ability of immunosuppressant agents to reduce FN production, proliferation, and pIgR expression by PTEC may offer potential new strategies for the prevention and treatment of nephrotoxicity, proteinuria and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). The inhibitory effect of statins alone or in combination with LPS on FN production, proliferation and cytokines released suggest that statin therapy may have potential benefit in interstitial nephritis and fibrosis. On other hand, statins alone or in combination with LPS increased the expression of Ig receptors by PTEC. This thesis shows that the novel human Fcα/µR in PTEC may play an important role in the immune mechanisms involved in the tubular response during renal injury associated with tubular Ig/IC deposits <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Patients and methodsAmericans’ Changing Lives Study (ACL), 1986 – 2011, is a 25 -year nationally representative prospective cohort study. ACL followed 3, 361 adults for up to 25 [*]years. Income, education, and unemployment were the main predictors of interest. Death due to <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> was the main outcome. Health behaviors (smoking, drinking, and exercise) and medical risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, and obesity) were the mediators. Cox proportional hazards models were used for data analysis. ResultsHigher income (HR[*]=[*] 0. 75; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 62 – 0. 89) was associated with lower risk of death due to <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> over the 25 -year follow-up period. Although health behaviors and medical risk factors at baseline were also predictors of the outcome, they failed to explain the effect of income on death due to <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> That is, income was associated with death due to <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> above and beyond all potential mediators including behavioral and medical risk factors.

40|$|Much {{evidence}} indicates increased sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Renal</b> ischemia {{is probably a}} primary event leading to increased SNA. Increased SNA often occurs in association with hypertension. However, the deleterious effect of increased SNA on the diseased kidney is not only caused by hypertension. Another characteristic of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> is unbalanced nitric oxide (NO) and angiotensin (Ang) activity. Increased SNA <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> may be sustained because a state of NO-Ang II unbalance is also present in the hypothalamus. Very few studies have directly compared the efficacy of adrenergic blockade with other renoprotective measures. Third-generation beta-blockers seem to have more protective effects than traditional beta-blockers, possibly via stimulation of NO release. Although it has been extensively documented that muscle SNA is increased <b>in</b> chronic <b>renal</b> failure, data on renal SNA and cardiac SNA are not available for these patients before end-stage <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> It is also unknown whether additional treatment with third-generation beta-blockers can delay the progression of renal injury and prevent cardiac injury <b>in</b> chronic <b>renal</b> failure more efficiently than conventional treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors only...|$|R

40|$|AIM: This paper reviews {{progression}} <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: An English language {{literature search}} using Medline (1980 January- 2001 July) {{was done to}} assess research and review articles on progression <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>diseases.</b> RESULTS: Factors that {{increase the risk of}} progression <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> <b>diseases</b> are hypertension, dyslipidaemia, underlying nephropathy, high dietary protein intake and proteinuria. Others are smoking, hyperglycemia, low birth weight, obesity, metabolic syndrome X, genetic factors such as angiotensin converting enzyme 'DD' genotype and chromosome 1 q 21, and exposure to lead. Hypertension induces arteriolar nephrosclerosis. The mechanisms whereby lipids contribute to vascular and renal injury are incompletely understood. Glomerular hyperperfusion and increased proteinuria may explain the adverse effects of increased protein intake on <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> progression. Proteinuria contains numerous toxic/inflammatory systems that promote progression. Cigarette smoking has vasoconstrictive, thrombotic and direct toxic effects on the vascular epithelium. Hyperglycemia is strongly implicated in the progression of complications in diabetics. Oligonephropathy in low birth weight has been suggested to increase the risk for systemic and glomerular hypertension in adult life. In obesity, the combination of hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertrophy and glomerular hypertension is a primary initiating event for glomerular injury manifesting as glomerulomegally and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. Angiotensin I, with enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism, especially the "DD" genotype, predisposes to a rapid decline <b>in</b> <b>renal</b> function. Finally, long-term exposure to low levels of environmental lead affects renal function. CONCLUSION: The control of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, proteinuria, obesity, avoidance of low birth weight, smoking and heavy metals such as lead are intervention strategies for preventing progression of <b>renal</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
