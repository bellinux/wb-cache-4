An example of a safety clutch is the one mounted on the driving shaft of a large grass mower.

It has permanent {{all-wheel drive}} with compensation, from the driver's seat from lockable (longitudinal differential) terrain reduction and an independently acting transverse differential lock. A trailer hook for carrying, if required, various trailers with firefighters equipment. The tires consist of Firestone 1100R20 16 PR U300 0160F, {{each with a}} pneumatic pressure of 7.5 bar at the front and 7.0 bar at the rear. The braking system is based on pure air brakes, equipped with inductor, indirect trailer air pressure brake. The carrying capacity of the DEMAK crane is 7 tons, the rear two support rollers, and a further support can be mounted on the side. The cable winch at the front has a maximum pulling force of 5.0t {{by means of a}} scissor pin, a cable length of 60 meters and 100 meters on the additional pulley. At the vehicles tail can be pulled max 5.0t, secured by a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch.</b> The emergency power generator delivers 3x 380/220V 20kVA. The light mast can be extended to 8.5m over terrain with three headlights each 1000W 7220V fed by the emergency power unit. The fire brigade Bern used such a vehicle. After they passed it on to the volunteer fire brigade of Zug. This Magirus-Deutz Muni is now located in the :de:Zuger Depot Technikgeschichte (Zug depot of technical history).|$|E

This system can provide a continuous change of propeller revolution even in a lower revolution zone of prime mover. However, it hardy make the decelerating condition, because the <b>slipping</b> <b>clutch</b> itself can not make the negative torque. In this paper, the authors have designed a push-pull control system using two <b>slipping</b> <b>clutches</b> {{in order to improve}} the above disadvantage of the conventional <b>slipping</b> <b>clutch.</b> For the evaluation of this system, the whole propulsion system including prime mover, clutches, propeller and ship are numerically simulated using the precise mathematical model described here. From several accelerating and decelerating simulations, the following results are pointed out. 1) FPP’s revolution can be easily changed in the slipping zone by using this system, although the main engine is governed constant revolution. 2) Astern and ahead maneuvering is also performed by this system. 3) The mathematical model for this simulation including engine, clutch, propeller and ship is useful for the design and evaluation of the whole propulsion system. As the result, this push-pull controlled <b>slipping</b> <b>clutch</b> system will be very useful for a marine propulsion system. 第 6 回舶用機関国際シンポジウム ISME (International Symposium on Marine Engineering) Tokyo 2000, 場所：日本都市センター会館, 会期： 10 月 23 日- 27...|$|R

40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) {{requested}} a two-axis pan tilt mechanism be designed, built, and tested for shipboard deployment of a sensor payload. Of paramount consideration to this design was the robustness {{of the system}} {{in the face of}} wave impact loading from "green water" taken over the superstructure of naval vessels. Central to providing such a system is the prevention of drive train failures given wave or other forms of impact loading. Through the course of work completed for his Master's thesis, Nathan M. Mills brought the design effort through initial bench testing. Several failures were experienced due to minor design flaws and mechanical component selection. One component selection that required improvement was the torque limiting <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> used in both the pan and tilt drive sections. The unit selected induced positioning errors resulting from backlash inherent to its design. The backlash encountered is unavoidable when using the type of <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> selected, as it is with many of the slip clutches available to the machine designer. Slip clutches are available that have limited backlash, but the majority of these are friction based and have setpoints that either do not have tight tolerances or change as the component is cycled. The goal of the present work was to design a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> that maintains its setpoint and minimizes backlash to allow for its shipboard use in the NRL sponsored pan tilt system. The design was completed in a manner that supports the use of the <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> in other systems that require accurate positioning and torque overload protection in both marine and non-marine environments. by Thomas Patrick Finley.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is done with the methods learned in our education, Technical Design at the Luleå University of technology. The project {{took place in the}} town of Katrineholm and with the {{plumbing}} company PCT Systems AB. The method that is being used while cleaning pipes consists of a tool that is rotating by a wire connected to a power drill. When the tool is rotating in the pipe it cleans the inner wall, also known as milling. If the tool is stuck the power drill is twisted and the user loses their grip. With that {{there is a possibility that}} the user gets hurt. If the tool starts to lose momentum there is a risk that the wire is damaged. The result in this thesis is to remove these problems and to improve the usability of a power drill in work. The work was done with a part of the creative process that applies segregation of duties, with main function, part function and support functions. The main function in this thesis is a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> and apart from that there are support functions that will ease the usability of the <b>slip</b> <b>clutch.</b> The final concept is a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> that may be applied on a variety of power drills to be used in the cleaning and milling of pipes. The final product shall solve the problems that occur when a tool is stuck or struggling to maintain speed in the pipes. That way it will improve the work environment for the user.

40|$|Time and the {{stopping}} {{distance of the}} electric drive with frequent starting-and-braking modes that contain embedded asynchronous motor with a recessed combined braking device depend on the moment of an electromagnet disinhibition. At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the brake device and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed combined brake device at different moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language. Calculation of the system of differential equations was fulfilled by the Runge – Kutta method. The deceleration of the electromechanical brake at various speeds caused different time values and {{stopping distance}}s. The plots of stopping distance and the braking time at various moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are demonstrated.  The optimum moment of switching on an electromechanical brake, providing small stopping distance and the braking time is the time when the speed wвкл = 0, 6 – 0, 8 of the nominal. In this case the acceptable number of brake applications for friction linings (compared with mechanical braking) will increase by 1. 6 – 2. 8 times.

40|$|An {{improved}} braking cable-payout mechanism {{has been}} developed. Whereas other such mechanisms operate at payout speeds that {{vary with the}} length of payout, this mechanism operates at approximately constant payout speed, regardless {{of the length of}} cord that has already been paid out. The present mechanism includes a spool, a capstan assembly, and centrifugal brakes. The spool is used to store the cord and, unlike in the prior mechanism, is not involved in the primary braking function. That is, the spool operates {{in such a way that}} the cord is unwound from the spool at low tension. The spool is connected to the rest of the mechanism through a constant- torque <b>slip</b> <b>clutch.</b> The clutch must slip in order to pay out the cord. As the cord leaves the spool, it passes into the capstan assembly, wherein its direction is changed by use of the first of three idler sheaves and it is then routed into the first of three grooves on a capstan. After completing less than a full circle in the first groove, the cord passes over the second idler sheave, which is positioned to enable the cord to make the transition to the second groove on the capstan. Similarly, a third idler sheave enables the cord to make the transition to the third groove on the capstan. After traveling less than a full circle in the third groove, the cord leaves the capstan along the payout path. The total wrap angle afforded by this capstan-and-idler arrangement is large enough to prevent slippage between the cord and the capstan. The capstan is connected to a shaft that, in turn, is connected to a centrifugal brake. Hence, the effective payout radius, for purposes of braking, is not the varying radius of the remaining cord on the spool but, rather, the constant radius of the grooves in the capstan. The payout speed is determined primarily by this radius and by the characteristics of the centrifugal brake. Therefore, the payout speed is more nearly constant in this mechanism than in the prior mechanism...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) design layout was completed. The intended application was for coupling the flywheel to the driveline of a flywheel battery hybrid electric vehicle.
