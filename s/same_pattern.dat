Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kīlauea started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea {{with a series of}} explosive eruptions about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.|$|E

5|$|These {{findings}} were later supported by chromatographic analysis of flavonoid compounds. Chromatograms of A.bradleyi showed {{a combination of}} all the compounds found in A.montanum and all those in A.platyneuron. A.×wherryi showed the <b>same</b> <b>pattern,</b> as it also contains chromosomes from both of those species. A specimen of A.stotleri was subsequently shown to form the same chromatograms as well. This showed that it was not descended to A.pinnatifidum, whose chromatograms contain compounds inherited from walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi. Allozyme analysis in the 1980s also supported these hybrid origins of A.bradleyi.|$|E

5|$|It is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} fourth chorus. It starts with an instrumental introduction, and uses a chord progression of C–B–Am7–G, that is also used during the verses and the chorus. In the first verse, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton, and Beckham sing each one line. The chords change to Dm11–Dm9–Dm11–Dm9–Dm7–Em7–F major7–G during the pre-chorus, followed by the chorus. The <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> occurs leading to the second chorus, {{the first part of the}} second verse consists on the repeated use of the words do and ba da, then Bunton and Chisholm sing the rest of the verse. The group then sing the bridge, and end the song repeating the chorus twice. The song uses the verse melody of When You Were Mine (Prince song) with slightly altered phrasing.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures {{had done something}} similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the <b>same</b> <b>pattern,</b> with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E
5|$|Rainbow is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It {{was released on}} November 2, 1999, by Columbia Records. The album followed the <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> as Carey's previous album, Butterfly (1997), in which she began her transition into the urban market. Rainbow contains a mix of hip hop-influenced R jams, {{as well as a}} variety of slow ballads. On the album, Carey worked with David Foster and Diane Warren, who, as well as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, replaced Walter Afanasieff, the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s. As a result of her separation from her husband, Tommy Mottola, Carey had more control over the musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several artists such as Jay-Z, Usher, and Snoop Dogg, as well as Missy Elliott, Joe, Da Brat, Master P, Eve, Lil' Kim, 98°, Phil Collins and Mystikal.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate Infantry, {{the largest}} Corps of the Army, {{had a large}} variety of uniforms, and the greater amount of records. The initial Confederate Army uniform {{consisted}} of a kepi, double-breasted tunic, trousers, and Jefferson bootees/brogans. The kepi was not specified until the 1862 Regulations, as a sky-blue kepi, reflecting the Infantry Corps, with a dark blue band, and leather visor. The tunic was to be of cadet gray, with two rows of yellow-metal (brass or gold) buttons, 'solid' cuff and collar facings in sky-blue, and lined with a lighter gray fabric. The coat was of the <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> specified as regulation for the field and company officers, {{as well as for}} the artillery and cavalry enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The keels for Vittorio Veneto and Littorio {{were laid}} on the same day, 28 October 1934, at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico {{shipyard}} in Trieste and the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa, respectively. Vittorio Veneto was launched on 22 July 1937, with Littorio following exactly one month later on 22 August. While incomplete, Vittorio Veneto went to sea on 23 October 1939 to conduct machinery trials. She was delivered to the Italian Navy in Trieste, still incomplete, some six months later on 28 April 1940. She departed Trieste on 1 May for final fitting out at the dockyard in La Spezia. After completion on 15 May 1940, she went to Taranto to join the fleet. Littorio underwent the <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> of machinery trials prior to completion; she was delivered to the fleet on 6 May 1940.|$|E

Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not so far from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E

5|$|The year 1896 {{followed}} {{much the}} <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> {{as the previous}} year. Individual ship training was conducted though April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included {{a visit to the}} Dutch ports of Vlissingen and Nieuwediep. Additional maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited Bergen from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy Li Hongzhang observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training. The following month, Czar Nicholas II of Russia visited the fleet in Kiel, boarding Wörth on 8 September. The ship won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron during 1896.|$|E
5|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both {{in studies of}} fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern spike in the geologic record; this <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} groups of dinosaurs, neither genus was more common at higher or lower {{elevations}} than the other. However, Gorgosaurus appears more common in northern formations like the Dinosaur Park, with species of Daspletosaurus more abundant to the south. The <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> is seen in {{other groups of}} dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also {{more common in the}} Two Medicine Formation of Montana and in southwestern North America during the Campanian, while centrosaurines and lambeosaurines dominate in northern latitudes. Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. At the end of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurines like Edmontosaurus and chasmosaurines like Triceratops were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were rare.|$|E

5|$|All of the E {{class were}} {{assigned}} to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet upon commissioning during 1934. Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire flotilla was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, many were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. While the F-class ships {{were assigned to}} the 6th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, they followed much the <b>same</b> <b>pattern</b> as their E-class sisters. In April 1939 the 5th and 6th DFs were renumbered the 7th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas, respectively. In mid-1939, newly-commissioned J-class destroyers began to replace the E-class ships and they were reduced to reserve for lack of manpower. Increasing tensions with Nazi Germany in August, caused the British to mobilize the Navy's reserves, which allowed the ships to be manned again and assigned to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Claims that {{termites}} emerged earlier {{have faced}} controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner {{indicated that the}} Mastotermitidae termites may {{go back to the}} Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus. The folded wings of the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina, arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1aand 2a, resemble those seen in Mastotermes, the only living insect with the <b>same</b> <b>pattern.</b> Krishna et al., though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the <b>same</b> <b>pattern,</b> concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.|$|E
