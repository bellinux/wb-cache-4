25|$|Bacon {{has been}} called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the {{possibility}} of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories- history, poesy, and philosophy- which could further be divided into more specific subjects and <b>subheadings.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{widespread}} usage, {{the classification}} {{has been criticized}} for its complexity and limited scope of scheme-adjustment. In particular, the arrangement of <b>subheadings</b> has been described as archaic and as being biased towards an Anglo-American world view. In 200708, the Maricopa County Library District in Arizona, abandoned the DDC in favor of the Book Industry Standards and Communications (BISAC) system, one that is commonly used by commercial bookstores, {{in an effort to make}} their libraries more accessible for patrons. Several other libraries across the United States, and other countries (including Canada and the Netherlands) followed suit. The classification has also been criticized as being a proprietary system licensed by a single entity (OCLC), making it expensive to adopt. However, book classification critic Justin Newlan stands by the Dewey Decimal System, stating newer, more advanced book classification systems [...] "are too confusing to understand for newcomers".|$|E

[...] To avoid {{excessive}} verbiage, {{note that}} each of the following types of objects is a special case of types preceding it: sets, topological spaces, uniform spaces, topological abelian groups (TAG), normed vector spaces, Euclidean spaces, and the real/complex numbers. [...] Also note that any metric space is a uniform space. [...] Finally, [...] <b>subheadings</b> will always indicate special cases of their superheadings.|$|E
2500|$|A {{previously}} confidential email {{written by}} Jobs {{a year before}} his death was presented during {{the proceedings of the}} Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. lawsuits and became publicly available in early April 2014.

2500|$|Views on Watson's {{scientific}} contributions {{while at}} Harvard are somewhat mixed. [...] His most notable achievements {{in his two}} decades at Harvard may be what he wrote about science, rather than anything he discovered during that time. [...] Watson's first textbook, The Molecular Biology of the Gene, set a new standard for textbooks, particularly {{through the use of}} concept heads—brief declarative <b>subheadings.</b> [...] His next textbook was Molecular Biology of the Cell, in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientist-writers. His third textbook was Recombinant DNA, which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought much new information about how organisms function. The textbooks are still in print.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} seven years Stead would develop what Matthew Arnold dubbed [...] "The New Journalism". His {{innovations}} as editor of the Gazette included incorporating maps and diagrams into a newspaper for the first time, breaking up longer articles with eye-catching <b>subheadings,</b> and blending his own opinions with those of the people he interviewed. He made a feature of the Pall Mall extras, and his enterprise and originality exercised a potent influence on contemporary journalism and politics. Stead's first sensational campaign was based on a Nonconformist pamphlet, The Bitter Cry of Outcast London. His lurid stories of squalid life in the slums had a wholly beneficial effect on the capital. A Royal Commission recommended that the government should clear the slums and encourage low-cost housing in their place. It was Stead's first success. He also introduced the interview, creating a new dimension in British journalism when he interviewed General Gordon in 1884.|$|E
2500|$|Speak is a first-person, diary-like narrative. Written in {{the voice}} of Melinda Sordino, it {{features}} lists, <b>subheadings,</b> spaces between paragraphs and script-like dialogue. The fragmented style mimics Melinda's trauma. The choppy sentences and blank spaces on the pages relate to Melinda's fascination with Cubism. According to Chris McGee and DeTora, Anderson's writing style allows the reader to see how Melinda struggles with [...] "producing the standard, cohesive narrative" [...] expected in a teen novel. Melinda's distracted narrative reiterates the idea that [...] "no one really wants to hear what you have to say". In her article, [...] "Like Falling Up into a Storybook", Barbara Tannert-Smith says, By disrupting the present with flashbacks of the past, Anderson further illustrates the structure of trauma. Anderson organizes the plot around the four quarters of Melinda's freshman year, starting the story in the middle of Melinda's struggle. Anderson superimposed the fragmented trauma plot-line upon this linear high school narrative, making the narrative more believable.|$|E
2500|$|These {{organizations}} have a similarly long pedigree on the Minnesota campus. Historically, they are grouped with the undergraduate social fraternities {{because of their}} use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters. [...] Most are organized toward juniors and seniors, or graduate students. [...] Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet the criteria may join or be asked to join, as may non-Greek students. [...] Multiple affiliations may be allowable - see individual societies for details. [...] Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all. The cut-off line where any campus organization falls within these headings or without is long-established convention; those formed prior to 1990 are listed under the <b>subheadings</b> used by various volumes of the Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities, which {{for more than a}} century has been the data source of record for such organizations. [...] Newer groups have been placed in categories similar to Baird's. The latest version of Baird's, 1991, [...] was published before the national development of some of the societies here, and therefore, position and inclusion is, in some cases, assumptive.|$|E
