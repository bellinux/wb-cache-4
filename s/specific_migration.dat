40|$|AbstractMembers of the Frizzled {{family of}} {{integral}} membrane proteins are implicated in many developmental events, including specifying cell fate, orienting cell and planar polarity, and directing cell migration. Frizzleds function as cell surface receptors for secreted Wnt proteins. We report here {{the isolation of}} a mutation in cfz- 2, a Caenorhabditis elegans Frizzled gene. Mutation of cfz- 2 causes defective cell migration, disorganization of head neurons, and can cause ectopic axon outgrowth. Analysis of mosaic animals shows that CFZ- 2 functions cell nonautonomously, but does not rule out an autonomous role. CFZ- 2 is expressed primarily in the anterior of embryos and in several cells in the head of adults. Our analysis of interactions between CFZ- 2 and other Wnt pathways reveals that three Wnts, CWN- 1, CWN- 2 and EGL- 20, and a Frizzled, MOM- 5, function redundantly {{with one another and}} with CFZ- 2 for <b>specific</b> cell <b>migrations.</b> In contrast, CWN- 1, CWN- 2, EGL- 20, CFZ- 2, and MOM- 5 antagonize one another for other migrations. Therefore, CFZ- 2 functions by collaborating with and/or antagonizing other Wnt signaling pathways to regulate <b>specific</b> cell <b>migrations...</b>|$|R

50|$|A large {{proportion}} of immigrants in western European states have come from former eastern bloc states in the 1990s, especially in Spain, Greece, Germany, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom. There are frequently <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> patterns, with geography, language and culture playing a role. For example, there are large numbers of Poles who have moved to the United Kingdom and Ireland, while Romanians and also Bulgarians have chosen Spain and Italy. In fact, with the earlier of the two recent enlargements of the EU, although most countries restricted free movement by nationals of the acceding countries, the United Kingdom did not restrict for the 2004 enlargement of the European Union and received Polish, Latvian and other citizens of the new EU states.

5000|$|The ephrin protein {{family of}} class A and class B guides ligands with the EphB family cell-surface receptors {{to provide a}} steady, ordered, and <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> of the {{intestinal}} epithelial cells from the crypt to villus. The Wnt protein triggers expression of the EphB receptors deep within the crypt, leading to decreased Eph expression and increased ephrin ligand expression, the more superficial a progenitor cell's placement. Migration {{is caused by a}} bi-directional signaling mechanism in which the engagement of the ephrin ligand with the EphB receptor regulates the actin cytoskeleton dynamics to cause a [...] "repulsion". Cell remain in place once the interaction ceases to a stop. While the mucus secreting Goblet cells and the absorptive cells move towards the lumen, mature Paneth cells move in the opposite direction, {{to the bottom of the}} crypt, where they reside. With the exception of the ephrin ligand binding to EphA5, all other proteins from class A and B have been found in the intestine. However, ephrin proteins A4, A8, B2, and B4 have highest levels in fetal stage, and decline with age.|$|E
5000|$|By 2006, {{extraction}} of DNA directly from some archaic human samples was becoming possible. The earliest analyses were of Neanderthal DNA, {{and indicated that}} the Neanderthal contribution to modern human genetic diversity {{was no more than}} 20%, with a most likely value of 0%. [...] By 2010, however, detailed DNA sequencing of the Neanderthal specimens from Europe indicated that the contribution was nonzero, with Neanderthals sharing 1-4% more genetic variants with living non-Africans than with living humans in sub-Saharan Africa. [...] In late 2010, a recently discovered non-Neanderthal archaic human, the Denisova hominin from south-western Siberia, was found to share 4-6% more of its genome with living Melanesian humans than with any other living group, supporting admixture between two regions outside of Africa. [...] In August 2011, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles from the archaic Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes were found to show patterns in the modern human population demonstrating origins from these non-African populations; the ancestry from these archaic alleles at the HLA-A site was more than 50% for modern Europeans, 70% for Asians, and 95% for Papua New Guineans. Proponents of the multiregional hypothesis believe the combination of regional continuity inside and outside of Africa and lateral gene transfer between various regions around the world supports the multiregional hypothesis. However, [...] "Out of Africa" [...] Theory proponents also explain this with the fact that genetic changes occur on a regional basis rather than a continental basis, and populations close to each other are likely to share certain specific regional SNPs while sharing most other genes in common.Migration Matrix theory (A=Mt) indicates that dependent upon the potential contribution of Neanderthal ancestry, {{we would be able to}} calculate the percentage of Neanderthal mtDNA contribution to the human species.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Chemistry in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyPaperboard made from recycled fibres is being used more frequently in direct food packaging applications, {{in addition to its}} use as secondary and tertiary packaging. However, recent research has shown that there is a risk that harmful chemicals may migrate from the paperboard into the food. The simplest approach to reducing the migration of these contaminants is the use of barrier films. The barrier efficiencies of these various films can be examined by means of a migration test into a food simulant, followed by extraction in a suitable solvent. The extract can then be analysed by chromatographic techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the concentration of the specific contaminants. However on a production level, the availability of this type of highly specialised equipment is limited. A simple, cost effective method is needed to evaluate the barrier properties to specific chemical contaminants. The Heptane Vapour Transmission Rate (HVTR) test is a permeation test method for use at quality control level to determine barrier properties to the migration of organic vapours. The first part of the study focussed on establishing a universal correlation between HVTR and <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> of diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) that would be applicable to any type of functional barrier. However, experimental data demonstrated this was not possible as the correlation factor linking HVTR to <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> was largely dependent on the type and morphology of the coating considered. The initial objective of the study was reconsidered in favour of building individual models specific {{to the nature of the}} coating and substrate considered. A correlation between HVTR and <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> of DiBP, DBP and DEHP for a polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) barrier polymer was constructed by varying the applied coating weight. The vapour transport mechanism for the HVTR test and the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> test were found to differ, showing that a direct correlation between HVTR and the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> was again not possible. However, an indirect correlation could be made. The HVTR method gives an indication of film integrity, whereas the coating weight could be used as an indicator of the <b>specific</b> <b>migration.</b> The correlation between the coating weight and the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> yielded an equation that can be used to calculate the <b>specific</b> <b>migration</b> through the PVDC barrier polymer, provided the quantity of the chemical contaminant originally present in the paperboard was known. This equation was specific to the type of barrier polymer, the specific chemical contaminant as well as the intended shelf-life of the food product to be packaged in the paperboard...|$|E
