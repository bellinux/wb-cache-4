The site was cleared in 2008 {{and a total of}} 385 new homes were approved for construction. The name for the development, Pembroke Park, was chosen to reflect the heritage of the site.|$|E
5|$|Brilliant {{remained}} at Deptford until 1776 when the Navy offered her for sale as <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> Navy requirements. Sir William James purchased her on 1 November 1776 for {{the sum of}} ₤800. He retained her name and converted her into an East Indiaman in 1781. Captain Charles Mears sailed Brilliant on 5 May 1782 from Portsmouth for India, where she was to remain.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{injured his}} ankle {{at the start}} of the 2007–08 season, and after playing only four league games, Thun signed him on a six-month loan deal in January 2008. He played 17times for Thun, who {{finished}} bottom of the Super League. Thun were also knocked out of the Swiss Cup by Burgmeier's main employers in the semi-finals. On 13 July 2008, his contract with Basel was terminated early to allow him to find himself a new club after just 23league appearances because he was seen as <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> requirements by manager Christian Gross.|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} and estimate {{a simple}} fiscal policy reaction function for the euro area and individual euro area countries. Our reaction function allows for primary <b>surpluses</b> <b>to</b> feature three components: an anti-cyclical response of primary <b>surpluses</b> <b>to</b> the output gap, {{a response to}} the debt-GDP ratio, and an exogenous fiscal policy shifter. In line with the cyclical adjustment literature and in contrast with much of the previous time-series literature, we find a consistently strong anti-cyclical response of primary <b>surpluses</b> <b>to</b> the output gap for the euro area. We also find a consistently strong positive response of primary <b>surpluses</b> <b>to</b> the debt-GDP ratio. Our estimates are robust to different output gap measures and to different assumptions regarding the order of integration of observables. In addition, we provide statistical evidence in favor of our specification of a fiscal policy reaction function which features persistent fiscal policy shocks as opposed to an alternative specification found in the literature which features fiscal policy smoothing. Altogether, our results help to reconcile widely differing estimates from the literature, and we argue that our results may therefore provide guidance to forecasters and policymakers...|$|R
5|$|Bush used {{a budget}} <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He {{extended}} government funding for organizations providing {{education of the}} dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence. Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.|$|E
5|$|Doe {{was born}} in Reading, Berkshire. As a youth player, he played as a forward for AFC Newbury and Newbury and District Schools {{alongside}} Theo Walcott, before the duo signed for Swindon Town. They played together for four years. He said in one season, that his partnership with Walcott consisted of them scoring about 150 goals. During a tournament in Cardiff, Doe was converted into a centre-back. Doe was with Swindon Town {{from the age of}} 10, until he was deemed <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> requirements by manager Paul Sturrock, and he left in July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> postwar {{requirements}} {{with the}} large numbers of Essex-class carriers in service, and she was assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946. This was a test conducted at Bikini Atoll to evaluate the effect of the atomic bomb on ships. Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny's radio show on 21 April, while Saratoga was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini. She departed from pier 33 and headed out the Golden Gate on 1 May 1946.|$|E

5|$|Sixteen light fleet {{carriers}} were ordered, and {{all were}} laid down as what became the Colossus class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated the Majestic class. The improvements from the Colossus class to the Majestic class included heavier displacement, armament, catapult, aircraft lifts and aircraft capacity. Construction on the ships was suspended {{at the end of}} World War II, as the ships were <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Navy's peacetime requirements.|$|E
5|$|Sydney was {{the first}} of three {{conventional}} aircraft carriers to serve in the RAN, and operated as the navy's flagship during the early part of her career. From late 1951 to early 1952, she operated off the coast of Korea during the Korean War, making her the first carrier owned by a Commonwealth Dominion, and the only carrier in the RAN, to see wartime service. Retasked as a training vessel following the 1955 arrival of her modernised sister ship, , Sydney remained in service until 1958, when she was placed in reserve as <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> requirements.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade {{had always}} been an {{integral}} part of the 6th Airborne Division, but when the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, and its 1st Parachute Brigade was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division, the 6th Airlanding Brigade became <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> the division's requirements. On 15April1946, the brigade ceased being part of the British Army's airborne forces, and was renumbered the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade.|$|E

5|$|The {{captured}} frigates were valuable prizes but the Royal Navy only acquired Medée, {{which it}} took into service as HMS Medee, which it never commissioned but instead {{used as a}} prison ship {{for a few years}} before selling her in 1805. The frigates had come into port shortly before the Peace of Amiens and thus were deemed <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> Navy requirements. The ships and their stores and equipment were sold privately; the proceeds from the sale were paid as prize money in February 1803. The British crews also benefited from head-money, a financial award for each French sailor captured during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} superseded on top link expresses during the 1940s by {{growing numbers of}} Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during peak periods or to deputise for failures. The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> operational requirements, and they were gradually phased out of service. The entire class was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|The refit did {{not begin}} until late January 1945 and was still in {{progress}} {{when the war ended}} in May. She was found to be in the worst shape of any Canadian destroyer when inspected and was declared <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> requirements on 13 June. She was paid off on 17 August 1945 and later sold for scrap to the Dominion Steel Company. Her demolition, however, was not completed until 1950.|$|E
50|$|Best {{known as}} an {{advocate}} for reforming the state's budget procedures, Shafer has introduced legislation mandating zero-based budgeting, requiring budgetary <b>surpluses</b> <b>to</b> {{be returned to the}} taxpayers and requiring periodic sunset review of certain state agencies.

50|$|In recent years, Yemen has {{reported}} increasing non-merchandise deficits. These deficits have, however, been offset by record export earnings, which {{have resulted in}} large enough trade <b>surpluses</b> <b>to</b> keep the current account in surplus—US$175.7 million in 2003, US$524.6 million in 2004, and US$633.1 million (about 4 {{percent of gross domestic}} product) in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Commodity-trade, Marx argues, {{historically}} {{begins at}} the boundaries of separate economic communities based otherwise on a non-commercial form of production.

5|$|The ship {{spent most}} of its early career in the South African Navy {{training}} or making good-will visits to foreign countries. She was laid up in the late 1950s and was recommissioned in 1961 {{to serve as an}} interim training ship until the shore-based training establishment then under construction was completed. This occurred in 1963 and Bloemfontein returned to briefly returned to reserve before she was deemed <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> requirements. The ship was sunk as a target in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA903, <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> Blue Steel trials, was {{converted}} to a similar layout to XA894 to flight test the Olympus 593 Concorde installation. The first flight was on 1 October 1966 and testing continued through to June 1971. In April 1973, XA903 flew with an underslung Rolls-Royce RB.199 turbofan destined for the Panavia Tornado. The RB.199 engine included both the reheat and thrust reverser functions. XA903 was the last B.1 to fly, being retired in February 1979.|$|E
5|$|When {{the brigade}} left the 1st Airborne Task Force, the 1st Special Service Force {{replaced}} them. The task force advanced eastwards {{and reached the}} Franco-Italian border in the Menton area and the French Alps along part of what was the Maginot line. Here they halted in a defensive position for three months before being pulled out. The task force was now <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> requirements and was disbanded on 23 November 1944. Its surviving manpower was used as reinforcements for the other American airborne formations.|$|E

50|$|Real process {{generates the}} {{production}} output from input, {{and it can}} be described by means of the production function. It refers to a series of events in production in which production inputs of different quality and quantity are combined into products of different quality and quantity. Products can be physical goods, immaterial services and most often combinations of both. The characteristics created into the product by the producer imply <b>surplus</b> value <b>to</b> the consumer, and {{on the basis of the}} market price this value is shared by the consumer and the producer in the marketplace. This is the mechanism through which <b>surplus</b> value originates <b>to</b> the consumer and the producer likewise. It is worth noting that <b>surplus</b> values <b>to</b> customers cannot be measured from any production data. Instead the <b>surplus</b> value <b>to</b> a producer can be measured. It can be expressed both in terms of nominal and real values. The real <b>surplus</b> value <b>to</b> the producer is an outcome of the real process, real income, and measured proportionally it means productivity.|$|R

5|$|A primary issue {{during the}} {{election}} was {{the construction of a}} dam on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state's budget <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> its construction. In the election, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal sold {{a number}} of fringe players {{throughout}} the season so Graham could freshen the squad with new players. Having already signed Lee Dixon and Steve Bould from Stoke City, defender Kenny Sansom became <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> requirement and eventually joined Newcastle United. Steve Williams was sold to Luton Town for £300,000 in June 1988. as the player felt first-team opportunities were scarce; the fee Luton paid was £100,000 less than Arsenal originally wanted. Graham Rix went to Caen on a free transfer. Other transfers saw Rhys Wilmot leave the club he joined as a trainee in 1977 after failing to usurp John Lukic as first choice, and Andy Marriott left to join Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in a deal worth £50,000.|$|E
5|$|As the RAF {{received}} newer aircraft {{capable of}} supersonic speeds {{to perform the}} air interceptor role, many Hunters were modified and re-equipped for undertaking ground-attack and reconnaissance missions instead. Hunters deemed <b>surplus</b> <b>to</b> the RAF's requirements were also quickly refurbished for continued service abroad. The Hunter would be procured by {{a considerable number of}} foreign nations. In addition to former RAF aircraft, roughly half of the nearly 2,000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers. The Hunter would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years. As late as 1996, hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world.|$|E

Specifically, we employ the smooth transition regression approach to explore the scope for non-linear fiscal adjustments of primary <b>surpluses</b> in response <b>to</b> the accumulation of debt. The empirical results show the occurrence of a significantly positive reaction of primary <b>surpluses</b> <b>to</b> debt when the debt–GDP ratio exceeded the trigger value of 110 percent.
