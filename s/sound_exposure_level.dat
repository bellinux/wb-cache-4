40|$|The risk {{of effects}} to fishes and other aquatic life from {{impulsive}} sound produced by {{activities such as}} pile driving and seismic exploration is increasing throughout the world, particularly with the increased exploitation of oceans for energy production. At the same time, there are few data that {{provide insight into the}} effects of these sounds on fishes. The goal {{of this study was to}} provide quantitative data to define the levels of impulsive sound that could result in the onset of barotrauma to fish. A High Intensity Controlled Impedance Fluid filled wave Tube was developed that enabled laboratory simulation of high-energy impulsive sound that were characteristic of aquatic far-field, plane-wave acoustic conditions. The sounds used were based upon the impulsive sounds generated by an impact hammer striking a steel shell pile. Neutrally buoyant juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were exposed to impulsive sounds and subsequently evaluated for barotrauma injuries. Observed injuries ranged from mild hematomas at the lowest <b>sound</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to organ hemorrhage at the highest <b>sound</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> Frequency of observed injuries were used to compute a biological response weighted index (RWI) to evaluate the physiological impact of injuries at the different <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> As single strike and cumulative <b>sound</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> (SEL(ss), SEL(cum) respectively) increased, RWI values increased.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern that human-produced ocean noise is adversely affecting marine mammals, as several recent cetacean mass strandings {{may have been}} caused by animals' interactions with naval ‘mid-frequency’ sonar.

In controlled experimental studies, we show that mid-frequency sonar can induce temporary hearing loss in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).

40|$|The {{distance}} at which harbor porpoises can hear underwater detonation sounds is unknown, but depends, among other factors, on the hearing {{threshold of the}} species for impulsive sounds. Therefore, the underwater hearing threshold of a young harbor porpoise for an impulsive sound, designed to mimic a detonation pulse, was quantified by using a psychophysical technique. The synthetic exponential pulse with a 5 ms time constant was produced and transmitted by an underwater projector in a pool. The resulting underwater sound, though modified by {{the response of the}} projection system and by the pool, exhibited the characteristic features of detonation sounds: A zero to peak sound pressure level of at least 30 dB (re 1 s - 1) higher than the <b>sound</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>level,</b> and a short duration (34 ms).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} is to determine the impact by sonic boom noise penetration into the ocean. Since the 1994 LaRC High Speed Research Program Sonic Boom Workshop several new results have been obtained. This talk reviews these results, and emphasizes the two most important findings. The first major result is an improved understanding of the noise spectra of the penetrating sonic boom. It was determined that weighted <b>sound</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> decrease with deeper ocean depths significantly faster than unweighted <b>sound</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> This is because low frequencies penetrate the ocean deeper than high frequencies. Several noise metrics were used including peak, SEL, C-SEL, A-SEL, and PLdB, and results are given for all. These results are important because they show that the sonic boom noise impact on marine life a few meters below the ocean surface may be significantly lower using weighted sound levels than if one were to measure the impact using unweighted levels. The other major finding is the first estimate of the worst case peak levels produced by a penetrating sonic boom being focused by a sinusoidal ocean surface. The method of analysis chosen was computational, a time domain finite difference algorithm. The method is outlined and then example results are presented. For rounded sonic boom waveforms incident on a sinusoidal ocean surface, it is shown that the percentage increase or decrease in pressure is only occasionally larger than 10 %, rarely 25 %.

The seismic surveys {{conducted by the}} Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany during the last 20 years focussed on two areas: The Wedell Sea and the Amundsen/Bellinghausen Sea. Histograms of the Julian days and water depths covered by these surveys indicate that maximum activities occurred from January to March, and most lines were collected either in shallow waters of 200 to 600 m depth or in deep waters of 3000 to 4000 m depth. To assess the potential risk of future seismic research surveys on marine mammal populations an acoustic wave propagation modeling study is conducted for the Weddell and the Amundsen/Bellinghausen Sea. A viscoelastic 2. 5 D finite-difference code is used, which allows to simulate the spherical amplitude decay of point sources correctly. A sinusoidal wavelet of 50 Hz dominant frequency serves as source wavelet. Based on CTD measurements, sediment core samplings and sediment echosounder recordings two horizontally-layered, range-independent generic input models are established for the Wedell and the Amundsen/Bellinghausen Sea, one for shallow (400 m) and one for deep water (3000 m). They indicate that the vertical structure of the water masses {{is characterized by a}} 100 m thick, cold, low sound velocity layer (∼ 1440 - 1450 m/s), centered in 100 m depth. In the austral summer it is overlain by a warmer, 50 m thick surface layer with slightly higher sound velocities (∼ 1447 - 1453 m/s). Beneath the low-velocity layer sound velocities increase rapidly to ∼ 1450 - 1460 m/s in 200 m depth, and smoothly to ∼ 1530 m/s in 4700 m depth. The sea floor is mainly covered with soft fine-grained clayey or silty sediments, so that P- and S-wave velocities of 1600 and 200 m/s and a wet bulk density of 1450 kg/m 3 are assumed. In a first step the acoustic impact of one seismic line of 10 km length is computed for the two generic models, assuming a shot interval of 15 s and a ship speed of 5 kn. The acoustic impact is determined by running the finite-difference scheme once, shifting the resulting wavefields in space and time according to the movement of the ship and the shot interval, and summing-up the appropriate <b>sound</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> derived from the synthetic seismograms.

40|$|The {{installation}} of offshore wind farms in European waters and {{the scale of}} the planned activity have led to concern over the generation of noise and its potential impact on marine life. Much of this concern is centered around the noise generated by pile driving, which is used for the {{installation of}} the turbine foundations, and its potential impact on marine life (Thomsen et al. 2006). The noise generated by pile driving has the potential to cause injury, induce temporary or permanent hearing loss, and evoke avoidance reactions.

The influence of duration, magnitude, and frequency of vibration and the effect of simultaneous noise were combined to provide a method of predicting the relative annoyance for different combinations of noise and vibration.
