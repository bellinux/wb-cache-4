25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
2500|$|She {{started to}} see people that weren't there. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could see them too, but, of course, I couldn't. I would make fun of her like, [...] "I'm {{going to go in}} the other room and you stay here and talk to your friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murasaki {{suffered}} overwhelming loneliness, {{had her own}} {{concerns about}} aging, and was not happy living at court. She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: [...] "Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am.... too has often remarked that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{was not the kind}} of person with whom one could ever relax.... I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect." [...] Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been [...] "the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it". He points out she had [...] "exceptional powers of discernment" [...] and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.|$|E
30|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was a man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had asked}} her if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> might venture to hope for a more {{favorable}} answer if I urged my suit to you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{well she}} had {{estimated}} the sum necessary! Four {{hundred and fifty}} each, <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> And <b>I</b> {{have no doubt that}} we could have done it on that, with care.' ...|$|R
60|$|Minnie {{looked at}} me, smiling. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{was asking for}} a very {{different}} reason.|$|E
60|$|This {{question}} I {{could not}} answer: I had no words. It {{seemed as if}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had answered it.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{went and}} told Marie what I had promised. Somewhat to my {{surprise}} she said that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had acted wisely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't take it {{too much}} to heart," [...] said Lapham, alarmed at the feeling he had excited; [...] "I don't say <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> so. <b>I</b> was trying to guess--trying to----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Not unwelcome to {{the ears}} of Una was this praise, but she was {{properly}} deprecatory: [...] "Why, <b>she</b> probably <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was just a stuffy, stupid, ugly old thing, as old as--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Farintosh {{asked me}} whether I {{was going in}} the army," [...] said Clive, [...] "and <b>she</b> laughed. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had best dock them. Oh, I would like to cut my head off {{as well as my}} hair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He cast {{a curious}} sidewise glance. [...] "Well, I'm not pretty to look at, and then, I reckon <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was {{investigating}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And she wouldn't {{have them}} because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> sent them! As sure as I'm {{standing}} here, I never did it," [...] said the clerk, solemnly.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{maybe she}} saw me after all {{and did not want}} to let on," [...] he thought dismally. [...] "Maybe <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't {{recognize}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{this little}} revulsion of feeling Pansy had been still advancing, and Elfride {{felt it would}} be absurd to turn her little mare's head the other way. 'Still,' <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> 'if <b>I</b> had a mamma at home I WOULD go back!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh Fame!--if I e'er took {{delight in}} thy praises, [...] 'Twas less {{for the sake}} of thy high-sounding phrases, [...] Than to see the bright eyes of the dear One discover, [...] <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was not unworthy to love her.|$|R
6000|$|And so in part it was,--as Mary herself {{very well}} knew; though Lady Ushant herself had {{had nothing to}} do with it. [...] "Lady Ushant," [...] she said, [...] "would be very well pleased,--if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> liked him well enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Barker eagerly, [...] "you don't understand. I {{proposed}} {{to her because}} I thought I was rich. In a foolish moment I thought I had discovered that some old stocks I had had acquired a fabulous value. She believed it, too, but because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was now a rich man and she only a poor girl--a mere servant to her father's guests--she refused me. Refused me because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might regret it in the future, because {{she would not have}} it said that she had taken advantage of my proposal only when I was rich enough to make it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, she's not. How {{should she}} be well? She's {{anything}} but well. She'll be in directly, but <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to see}} you first. I suppose this wretched man is really mad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} it. When I told her, I did it all of a heap, you see; and I fancy <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was just mad at the time." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} she had {{forgotten}} the great sum of the principal, or that, through lifelong training and association, it was so sacred {{to her that she}} did not even dream of touching it. I was silent, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was persuaded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whin I {{saw that}} angel lyin' there," [...] said Sarah Walker's nurse, [...] "as white, if ye plaze, {{as if the}} whole blessed blood of her body had gone to make up the {{beautiful}} glory of her hair; speechless as <b>she</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw a sort of longin' in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no,--he {{has enough}} to bear, poor fellow!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> [...] "No, <b>I</b> won't tell him; besides, it an't true; Missis never deceives us." ...|$|R
60|$|I verily {{believed}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was drunk. I {{must have}} looked pretty hard and fierce, bursting into her room with that big gun in hand. My first action then was to lay the gun on her bureau.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I saw Olive, when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> wasn't looking; it {{was just}} as if she'd taken off a mask. But Robert Cramier will never put up with it. He's in love with her still; I watched him. It's tragic, John." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I've {{no doubt}} of that, Miss MacPherson," [...] said Mrs. Allan amiably. It was a fib for her, minister's wife though she was. She HAD doubt. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would be a dismal failure as teacher of a boys' class.|$|E
6000|$|She {{does not}} come to greet me so frankly as she did, [...] And in her utmost {{openness}} I feel there's something hid; [...] She almost seems to shun me, as if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> [...] Might win her gentle heart again to feelings long gone by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Art there, Watcher-in-the-Night, {{watching}} in the light?" [...] <b>she</b> said or <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> know not which, {{but the words}} {{came to me in}} the Zulu tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If that {{is really}} all,' <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> 'I suppose <b>I</b> must get up and go!' And it flashed through her mind: 'My poor dress will be ruined!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, she {{was quite}} in the right," [...] said Felix composedly. [...] "It served me right for what I played. You see, she didn't know I couldn't help playing it. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did it on purpose." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were a few}} persons present whom <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{should be}} {{interested}} to know,--a Miss Goldsmid, daughter of Baron Goldsmid, and Lord Ockham, her grandson, eldest son and heir of the Earl of Lovelace, to whom she introduced my son.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not mine, certainly,' said Lucilla. 'Good Honor Charlecote {{would have}} run crazy if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had touched a Shelley; a very odd study for Edna. But as to the olive-green, {{of course it was}} bound under the same star as ours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are going?" [...] {{a whisper}} said. [...] "Why are you going?" [...] And Eveleth had {{me by the}} hand and was drawing me gently into the dim drawing-room that opened from the place. [...] "I don't know all my mother has been saying to you. I had to let her say something; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> ought. <b>I</b> knew you would know how to excuse it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. The {{women here}} think you the finest paladin in the world, and Miss Palliser would fly at my throat if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> {{said a word}} against you. But she's in my house, you see; and I'm bound to do exactly as I should if she were my sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{makes things}} worse,' <b>she</b> said. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had only {{got rid of}} my betrayer; and now you say I have killed my husband. You men have no tact.' ...|$|R
