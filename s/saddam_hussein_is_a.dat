He voted for {{replacement}} resolution (H.J Res. 114) in the full Senate to authorize {{the use of military force}} against Iraq, which passed by a vote of 77 to 23, On October 10, 2002, he stated that: [...] Almost no one disagrees with these basic facts: that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tyrant and a menace; that he has weapons of mass destruction and that he is doing everything in his power to get nuclear weapons; that he has supported terrorists; that he is a grave threat to the region, to vital allies like Israel, and to the United States; and that he is thwarting the will of the international community and undermining the United Nations' credibility. [...] He defended his vote on an October 10, 2004, appearance on Meet the Press, saying [...] "I would have voted for the resolution knowing what I know today, because it was the right thing to do to give the president the authority to confront Saddam Hussein...I think Saddam Hussein was a very serious threat. I stand by that, and that's why Kerry and I stand behind our vote on the resolution". However, he subsequently changed his mind about the war and apologized for that military authorization vote.

50|$|After 18 {{months out}} of politics, mainly camping in the outback, Mack {{achieved}} even broader fame by winning the federal seat of North Sydney in 1990. The seat had long been reckoned as a blue-ribbon Liberal seat; it had been held by the Liberals or their predecessors since Federation. However, Mack defeated incumbent Liberal MP and Shadow Foreign Minister John Spender on a large swing of 44.54%, the largest swing to any independent candidate ever. He was re-elected in 1993. During his tenure in federal Parliament, Mack opposed unilateral tariff removal, many of the privatisations and was the only vote against Australian involvement in the Gulf War. In his speech on 22 Jan 1991, Mack said: This war is about oil, because 40 per cent of the world's oil reserves are in this area. This war is about years of greed, of intrigue, of malevolence by local despots and the developed world. <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Frankenstein monster created {{over the last decade}} by the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other western European countries that supplied him with billions of dollars of armaments, and with the technology for chemical and nuclear warfare. France built Saddam's nuclear reactor. In the years 1983 to 1989, United States trade with Iraq increased from $571M to $3.6 billion. Only one month before the invasion, the United States Department of Commerce tried to push through a $7.6m deal to sell Iraq nuclear parts. He successfully opposed the appointment of an Indonesian general involved in East Timor, as ambassador to Australia. He also introduced a private members bill for citizen initiated referendums as practised in Switzerland. He served on the transport and communications committee for six years.|$|E
40|$|The war in Iraq {{to remove}} the regime of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> momentous event.

The collection of data for this overview of polls has been terminated on December 31, 2004. Our review starts with describing how the Iraqi threat was perceived and then moves to the centralq uestion of whetherw ar was the appropriate course of action.

[...] He also has said that Iraq under <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> supporter of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations [...] "with money, with equipment, with technology, with weapons of mass destruction."

40|$|Texts {{and images}} in the print media, outdoor advertisements, and on the Internet form the primary source {{material}} for this article. The Bush administration and the American media, drawing upon well-worn traditions of representation, contrasted American women and Muslim/Middle Eastern women, American and Middle Eastern male sexuality, and the moral qualities (good versus evil) of American and Middle Eastern people. They used those contrasts to explain 9 / 11 and legitimize war in Afghanistan and Iraq. 9 / 11 was simply explained through a contrast between American innocence and Muslim savagery. For Afghanistan, the predominant trope was liberating Afghan women from the Taliban, or white men rescuing brown women from brown men, a story at least {{as old as the}} British Raj. The Iraq representations were more complex; both pro-war and anti-war proponents used the same images of suffering Iraqi women and girls, but to different ends: <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> demon who must be destroyed, or the suffering was caused by sanctions and Western military action. Saddam himself was conflated with Iraq, and images of deviant sexuality were employed. Throughout, American women and girls were portrayed as the right kind of woman: usually white and innocent, or heroic soldiers. In any case, they were free, not oppressed...|$|R
