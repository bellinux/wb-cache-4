25|$|On {{the more}} {{traditional}} business side, Cisco continued to develop its extensive enterprise-focused routing, switching and security portfolio. The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company's product lines, prompting the company to morph the successful Catalyst 6500 Ethernet switch into all-purpose Cisco 7600 routing platform. However, limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier Ethernet segment. This resulted in a new ASR9000 product family intended to consolidate company's carrier ethernet and <b>subscriber</b> <b>management</b> business around EZChip-based hardware and IOS-XR. Cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisition—one example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist Starent Networks that resulted in ASR5000 product line.|$|E

40|$|Functioning mobile {{telecommunication}} networks are {{taken for granted}} in present-day society. The network operator’s objective is to optimise the network’s capabilities {{in order to provide}} fluent connections for <b>subscribers.</b> Network <b>management</b> is based on the huge amounts of data that are recorded {{from all parts of the}} network. The data is used to monitor performance, to detect problems and also to provide novel knowledge to be used in future planning. Anomalous events in the network provide a valuable source of information for network management. This thesis presents an interpretation of anomalies and the basic theory of how to detect them when the probability distri-bution is known. However, since in real life applications the probability distribution is not known, the main focus is on methods that are based on distances. This thesis proposes procedures for anomaly detection and for summarising the infor-mation obtained about the anomalies. The procedures utilise clustering in both the anomaly detection and the further analysis of the anomalies. Scaling of variables af-fects the distances and the results of clustering. Therefore, methods to incorporate ex...|$|R

40|$|Crosstalk {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{impairments}} of digital subscriber line (DSL) systems. To combat this impairment, several techniques were proposed in the literature that employ some form of precoding in the downstream. However, most existing bit allocation algorithms are not applicable to precoded DSL systems when the power in each transmission line is constrained. In this paper, we propose a bit allocation algorithm for this scenario. The proposed algorithm maximizes the bit rate given the available power. It somewhat extends single-user algorithms in that it sequentially allocates bit to the “best ” user and tone. In the proposed algorithm we use a definition of “best ” that is suitable for precoded systems. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves almost the same rates as those of power allocation algorithms, which do not take into account the discrete nature of the transmitted information.
