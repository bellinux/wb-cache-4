2500|$|Ejector <b>Seat</b> <b>Reservation</b> did {{get some}} press in {{mainland}} Europe (specifically France and Germany) and received significant support from licensee Sony Music in Australia, including {{an invitation for}} the group to tour {{the country at the}} end of the year, but that did not prevent it from becoming Swervedriver's poorest selling album. Despite its lack of commercial success, critics have considered Ejector <b>Seat</b> <b>Reservation</b> to be the band's highest achievement. Andy Kellman of AllMusic crowned it their [...] "most cohesive and concise record, best experienced in whole," [...] which [...] "Swervedriver effortlessly committed ... as if they had it in them all along." [...] Magnet magazine's Gil Gershman complimented it as the [...] "work of artists enjoying a towering creative high" [...] that [...] "should have topped every chart and won legions over to the Swervedriver cause." [...] With the addition of George's deep grooves to the mix, melodic efforts like [...] "The Birds", [...] "How Does It Feel to Look Like Candy?", and [...] "Last Day on Earth" [...] saw Swervedriver branching out from their metallic roots and demonstrating their expanding influences in the likes of Elvis Costello, Burt Bacharach, and T. Rex.|$|E

2500|$|Swervedriver's third album, Ejector <b>Seat</b> <b>Reservation,</b> was {{recorded}} primarily at Church Studios and Konk Studios in Crouch End, North London and again {{produced by the}} band and Alan Moulder. Aside from themes of fatalism and flight working their way into its composition, [...] "for some reason we were wanting to reverse the notion of being the band with the American references in our songs and so some very British reference points appeared in the lyrics," [...] explained Franklin. The band had a dispute with McGee over picking the album's launching single—they thought [...] "The Other Jesus" [...] was the obvious choice but McGee overrode them, selecting [...] "Last Day on Earth" [...] {{in an attempt to}} capitalize on the current trend perpetuated by Britpop bands like Oasis of featuring strings and acoustic guitars. Initial promo pressings of the record including the additional track [...] "It's All Happening Now" [...] had to be withdrawn after permission to use lyrics lifted from Bob Dylan's [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] was denied. (They would later be given away to fan club members.) These incidents would prove to be just a precursor to the group's album woes, however. Realizing a vanishing return on their investment, American label A cut the band's funding, telling them the album would not fit into their release schedule for another year and a half. In response, the group requested to be released from their contract. With its loss of the band's licensing to A (approximately $350,000 per album), an already financially troubled Creation released Ejector <b>Seat</b> <b>Reservation</b> domestically on 15 July 1995 but dropped the band a week later. Subsequently, it received no promotional support (aside from a few small ads) and would remain unreleased in North America.|$|E
