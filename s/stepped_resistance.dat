40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{research}} is to decrease energy consumption as well as acceleration and heat time of the engine of main drive crankshaft press when starting it up. Modern crankshaft press designs include a flywheel connected to the engine by a belt drive. The flywheel performing a process operation spends the reserved kinetic energy. By virtue thereof it should possess the significant moment of inertia. It defines duration of acceleration process. High starting currents of engines lead to their vigorous heating and energy consumption at acceleration. The literature describes the way for eliminating these shortcomings, which is confined to the start-up of the asynchronous engine with a phase rotor when the circuit of each rotor phase includes an additional <b>stepped</b> <b>resistance.</b> However, there are no proved recommendations to specified resistance values and duration of engine acceleration at each step. Research used mathematical modeling and process optimization of three-stage acceleration of engine possessing a flywheel with the following optimization criteria: energy consumption at start-up, an equivalent (heating) current of engine, acceleration time. Values of additional resistance and start-up time at each step are chosen to be parameters of optimization. Obtained results show, that optimization of drive start-up allows us to reduce time of acceleration from 27. 3 s up to 11. 24 s, energy consumption from 4405930 Joule up to 2538400 Joule, and an equivalent (heating) current from 60. 34 up to 14. 01 А. As a result of research it is found, that a preferable start-up is the press drive start-up in modes with optimum time of flywheel acceleration and an optimum equivalent current, as the most efficient according to all optimization criteria. </p...|$|E

Figure 3 a illustrates that the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model and the E–J power law based model both respond almost simultaneously to the occurrence of a short-circuit fault. However, as the SFCL needs ~ 2 ms to fully quench due to its E–J characteristic and dynamic temperature (Fig. 3 d), the first peak reduction gained onto the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model is overestimated by 11 % (7.6 and 6.5  kA for the two SFCL models, respectively. 10  kA without SFCL), as shown in Fig. 3 b. In addition, the shunt resistor diverts the major portion of the fault current after the superconductor develops its normal state (Fig. 3 c). Therefore, the shunt resistance effectively lowers the thermal stress on the HTS wire, simultaneously preventing damages by overheating, whilst the recovery time is reduced (Morandi 2013).|$|R

40|$|Shifting {{electrically}} {{a magnetic}} domain wall (DW) by the spin transfer mechanism {{is one of}} the future ways foreseen for the switching of spintronic memories or registers. The classical geometries where the current is injected in the plane of the magnetic layers suffer from a poor efficiency of the intrinsic torques acting on the DWs. A way to circumvent this problem is to use vertical current injection. In that case, theoretical calculations attribute the microscopic origin of DW displacements to the out-of-plane (field-like) spin transfer torque. Here we report experiments in which we controllably displace a DW in the planar electrode of a magnetic tunnel junction by vertical current injection. Our measurements confirm the major role of the out-of-plane spin torque for DW motion, and allow to quantify this term precisely.

30|$|Firstly, {{a double}} {{protection}} strategy, {{the installation of}} two SFCLs in different grid positions, was assessed. According to both the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model and the E–J power law based model, the highest fault current reduction was always achieved when the SFCLs were installed at Location 2 (wind farm) and Location 3 (industrial branch) simultaneously, accomplishing a 400 and 330 % total fault limitation, respectively (Fig. 8 b). Indeed, this arrangement {{can be considered a}} much better strategy in comparison to the results obtained when just a single SFCL was considered, as the total current limitation is improved by ~ 110 %. Furthermore, contrary to the previous case, the current flowing through the integrating point when the fault occurs at the industrial branch (Fault 2) significantly decreased rather than having an adverse effect on the power system. Moreover, under this dual strategy the measured current reduction showed a balanced performance on all the different analysed cases, unlike the results obtained for when a sole SFCL was installed. In addition, if system operators measure the optimal strategy for the installation of two SFCLs {{in terms of the number}} of limited cases, different conclusions can be obtained under the framework of different physical models, e.g., when the step-resistance or the E–J–T power law model is considered. According to the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model, installing the two SFCLs at either Locations 1  &  2 or Locations 4  &  5 produced a positive response to all eight measured fault conditions. When the SFCLs were installed at Locations 1  &  2, a better performance was obtained as the total reduction in the fault current (330 %) was 40 % greater than the performance obtained by SFCLs installed at Locations 4  and  5 (290 %). However, when the E–J–T model was used, installing the SFCLs at Locations 1  &  2 increased the magnitude of the current at the integrating point under the occurrence of a fault in the domestic branch (Fault 2). This was due to the unsuccessful triggering of the SFCL at Location 1, as explained in the previous subsection. Therefore, from the point of view of the system operators, Locations 4  &  5 can be considered as the most reliable solution as it is the only combination capable of limiting all fault conditions and for all the considered scenarios.|$|R

40|$|Research {{addressing}} children's {{perceptions of}} exercise effort (their ‘perceived exertion’) has appeared steadily {{in the scientific}} literature over the last 30 years.

Such laboratory-based research has enabled the general conclusion that children can, especially with practice, use effort perception scales to differentiate between exercise intensity levels, and to self-regulate their exercise output to match various levels indicated on them. However, inconsistencies in the methodological approaches adopted diminish the certainty of some of the interpretations made by researchers. In addition, though often mentioned, the would-be application of effort perception in physical education and activity/health promotion contexts has been relatively ignored. Accordingly, the scope for research in this applied domain is now considerable...|$|R
30|$|Thus, in Fig. 8 c we {{show the}} {{performance}} comparison among five different scenarios when four SFCLs were installed into the power system. With four SFCLs working together, {{all of the}} combinations effectively limited the fault current for all eight studied cases, except for when the SFCLs were described using the E–J–T model and installed at Locations 1, 2, 3, and 5. Under this scheme the measured fault current increased when the fault was initialised at the domestic branch (Fault 2), {{due to the lack}} of action from the SFCL installed at Location 1. When the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model was considered, the accumulated maximum reduction on the fault current was again overestimated, achieving a 480 % reduction when the SFCLs were installed at Locations 1, 2, 3 and 4 or at 2, 3, 4 and 5. In comparison, Locations 2, 3, 4 and 5 produced a prospective reduction of 395 % when the more realistic E–J–T model was considered. The maximum accumulated reduction of the fault current achieved by any of the strategies using four SFCLs was just over 10 % more than the most effective of the strategies using three SFCLs. This enables us to define an upper limit for the number of SFCLs needed.|$|R

The typical material widely used as anode in SOFC is Nickel/Yttria-stabilised Zirconia (Ni/YSZ). The kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction mechanism at Ni/YSZ anode of the SOFC is investigated in this work using the reaction route (RR) graph method, which is a relatively new graphical method for the analysis of reaction kinetics based on the electrical analogy. A mechanism for the hydrogen oxidation reaction consisting of the most promising elementary steps is chosen for the analysis. The RR graph for this mechanism is constructed using the standard procedures. The graph is reduced by exploiting its analogy with electrical resistive circuits. Making use of this reduced graph, an analytical expression for the overall reaction rate is derived for the first time. This rate expression was found to approximate the overall rate obtained using the conventional quasi steady state (QSS) methodology satisfactorily. The reaction pathway containing the two hydrogen spill-over reactions is identified as the dominant pathway in the mechanism.

30|$|Table  1 {{summarizes}} the optimal allocation strategies {{and the corresponding}} performances of the SFCLs modelled during our study. The preferable locations for {{the installation of the}} SFCLs have been determined in terms of the two identified standards: (1) the maximum accumulated fault current reduction, and (2) the maximum number of measuring conditions that could be limited. The results in the table are categorised by the number of SFCLs required by each strategy, and also the physical models used to emulate the characteristics of the SFCLs. In all the cases the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model led to an overestimation of the actual performance figures achievable by the SFCLs when more realistic physical properties were considered. Finally, when the strategy is to maximize the benefits from installing only one or two SFCLs, a compromise must be made between increasing the fault current reduction, and maximizing the actual number of measuring conditions where the fault current can be limited. Therefore, based upon the comprehensive study presented in this paper, we conclude that the optimal installation strategy is the installation of a maximum of three SFCLs at Locations 2, 3, and 4, as this strategy produced the maximum reduction of the fault current for all fault conditions, and the addition of further SFCLs did not represent a significant enough improvement to justify the increased cost.|$|R

30|$|Firstly, the {{decision}} {{can be made}} according to the highest total reduction on the fault current passing through different points and under different fault circumstances as shown in Fig. 8 a. There, it can be observed that for the eight most important cases combining the occurrence of a fault at certain positions and the measuring point for the current reduction, the SFCL installed {{at the port of}} the wind farm (Location 2) appears to be the best option, as in this case the fault current can be reduced in six of the eight different scenarios with an accumulated reduction of 290 % from the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model, and 220 % from the E–J–T power law model, respectively. Nevertheless, this strategy has also an adverse impact on the remaining two other scenarios (F 1 -IP & F 2 -IP). Secondly, a decision can be made in terms of the overall performance for achieving positive impacts under the scope of any of prospective circumstances. In this sense, we have determined that placing the SFCL at Location 5, at the bus-tie between the industrial and domestic branches, is the most reliable option. An SFCL installed at the bus-tie is capable of reducing the harmonics and voltage dips, doubling the short-circuit power, and ensuring even loading of parallel transformers (Colmenar-Santos et al. 2016). Moreover, the recovery characteristics of the SFCL can also see benefit from this arrangement as after a quench of the SFCL, the bus-tie can be switched open for a short time (few seconds) to help the SFCL restore the superconducting state. However, a drawback of this switching strategy is that this measure may temporarily reduce the quality of the power supply, but a strong impact on the normal operation of the power system is not foreseen.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, {{we added}} an {{additional}} SFCL to the grid {{to assess the}} overall performance of this new system. Figure 8 c shows {{that most of the}} installation strategies for three SFCLs produced a reduction of the fault current in all eight measured scenarios. Both SFCL models agreed with the conclusion that the greatest reduction in the fault current was achieved when the SFCLs were installed simultaneously at the Locations 2, 3 and 4. This strategy showed a 470 % total reduction using the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model, and 375 % using the E–J–T model, attaining a significant increase on the overall performance of the system by about 70 and 45 %, respectively, in comparison with the best achieved performance when the dual SFCLs strategy was considered. Besides this huge improvement, the three SFCLs strategy could also respond positively to any fault conditions, which means installing three SFCLs can be considered the most reliable strategy for both overall fault current reduction and the number of cases exhibiting fault current reduction. Moreover, it was found that, under all fault conditions, the fault current levels of all measured points can be reduced to lower than the safety thresholds, which was set as three times of the normal current according to common practice. Until a significant reduction of the overall price of a SFCL is achieved, distribution network operators may not consider this strategy to be be cost-effective in terms of the initial investment, but given the expected reduction on the price of the second generation of high temperature superconducting wires, this decision {{can be seen as the}} most profitable strategy in terms of grid safety and reliability. However, a limit for the maximum number of the SFCLs required must also be established in order to guarantee the maximum benefits at minimum cost.|$|R

In September 1920, they had to face and halt the advance of a highly trained and well equipped Greek Army numbering more than 107,000 men with a force less than 15,000 on the western front. After the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was opened, the regular army was created by merging different Kuva-yi Milliye groups. Kuva-yi Milliye was ultimately dissolved {{towards the end of}} 1920. Although some units of the Kuva-yi Milliye still fought on the southern front until 1921. The First Battle of İnönü is the first war in which the standing army fought against the Greek forces.|$|R
