40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} (a) subgroups among people confronted with unnatural/violent loss characterized by different symptoms profiles of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and depression, and (b) socio-demographic, loss-related, and cognitive variables associated with subgroup membership. We used data from 245 individuals confronted {{with the death of}} a loved one due to an accident (47. 3 %), suicide (49 %) or homicide (3. 7 %). Latent class analysis revealed three classes of participants: a resilient-class (25. 3 %), a predominantly PGD-class (39. 2 %), and a combined PGD/Depression-class (35. 5 %). Membership in the resilient-class was predicted by longer time since loss and lower age; membership in the combined class was predicted by lower education. Endorsement of negative cognitions about the <b>self,</b> <b>life,</b> the future, and one's own grief-reactions was lowest in the Resilient-class, intermediate in the PGD-class, and highest in the combined PGD/Depression-class. When all socio-demographic, loss-related, and cognitive variables were included in multinomial regression analyses predicting class-membership, it was found that negative cognitions about one's grief was the only variable predicting membership of the PGD-class. Negative cognitions about the <b>self,</b> <b>life,</b> and grief predicted membership of the combined PGD/Depression-class. These findings provide valuable information for the development of interventions for different subgroups of bereaved individuals confronted with unnatural/violent loss...|$|E

40|$|The Development of Non-Milk Based Formulated Drinks For Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women. Background: The {{pregnant}} and breastfeeding women need a greater nutrition intake compared to normal women. At {{second and third}} trimester of pregnancy, and during breastfeeding, a woman should have additional nutrient for approximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 grams protein per day. Recently, various formula drinks for {{pregnant and}} breastfeeding women {{are available in the}} market, however most of these formulas are expensive. Objectives: To develop non-milk based formula drinks for pregnant and breastfeeding women which contained adequate amount of additional macro and micro nutrients had good sensory quality and had long <b>self</b> <b>life.</b> Methods: Initially, 13 kinds of drinks were formulated. The drinks contained aproximately 300 Kcal energy and 17 grams protein. They were analyzed for nutrient contain, microbiology and sensory quality in order to vote the best 5 formulas at the laboratory scale. The formulated drinks were packaged and sealed in 150 mL plastic cups. To know the <b>self</b> <b>life</b> of the drinks, storage was carry out in the room, incubator and refrigerator temperature during 12 months. Results: From sensory test, it was concluded that the best five drinks were kweni formula, chocholate formula, ginger formula, guava-orange formula and red bean formula. One cup of 150 ml formulated drink, had 140 - 150 Kcal energy and 8 grams protein. Therefore, to fulfill additional requirements for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the drinks should be consumed 2 cups a day. Conclusions: The formula drink developed could provide additional energy, protein, vitamin and mineral needed by pregnant and breast feeding women. There was no side effect reported by the panelist because of consuming the formula. Keywords: formulated drinks, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, acceptance. </p...|$|E

Large-scale models of what people are doing are being built by credit companies, advertising agencies, and national security agencies, using digital traces that people leave behind them. How can individuals exploit their own data for their own benefit? With this mass of personal data, we will need to induce personal semantic dimensions to sift data and find what is meaningful to each individual. In this chapter, we present semantic dimensions, made by experts, and by crowds. We show the type of information that individuals will have access to once lifelogging becomes common, and we will sketch what personal semantic dimensions might look like...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} three ways of {{measuring}} and defining change in cross-sectional designs are presented. The first measure of change concerns structural stability: continuity in the organisation {{of a set}} of variables across time. The second is level stability: the comparison of means in different groups differing on age or socio-cultural dimensions. The third is based on the changing parameter model (Firebaugh, 1997). In this model, it is the interaction between ageing effects or socio-cultural factors (period and cohort effects) and another variable that is assessed. These three approaches of change are illustrated on the basis of beliefs about the <b>self,</b> <b>life</b> and society assessed in representative populations of elders in two regions of Switzerland (Geneva and Central Valais) in 1979 ({N} = 1608) and 1994 ({N} = 2101) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} {{characteristics that}} can help people juggle their work and personal roles and experience greater job satisfaction are attracting increased research attention. This study presents a conceptual model {{to account for the}} association between employees ’ positive orientation (i. e., the tendency to evaluate <b>self,</b> <b>life,</b> and the future in a positive way) and their job satisfaction (N = 108). As theorized, the results indicate that employees ’ ability to manage their work-life balance fully mediates the relation between their positive orientation and job satisfaction. This suggests that a positive orientation serves as an adaptive personal resource that can facilitate employees ’ ability to balance work and non-work demands and hence can foster job satisfaction. The practical implications for positive psychological interventions in organizational settings are discussed...|$|E
