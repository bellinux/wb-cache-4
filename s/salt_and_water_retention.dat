Animals housed under semi-barrier conditions showed a lower basal plasma vasopressin concentration but were more sensitive to physiological stimuli.

50|$|A {{decrease}} in volume or pressure is a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone {{production in the}} hypothalamus, which exerts its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN:Cr ratio > 20 and a fractional excretion of Na of < 1% and an elevated urine osmolarity.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> in cirrhosis remains unclear. Systemic and portal hemodynamic parameters, including cardiac output, portal {{pressure gradient}} and systemic vascular resistance, were measured in six patients with untreated ascites and in six patients with hepatic cirrhosis with {{no history of}} ascites. Renal blood flow, urinary volume, and humoral factors, including plasma renin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, and urine kallikrein, were measured. Significant differences were seen {{between the two groups}} in urine volume, urine sodium and fractional sodium excretion, plasma angiotensin II, and the ratio between plasma renin activity and urinary kallikrein excretion (PRA:UKallV). A strong correlation existed between urinary sodium excretion and the PRA:UKallV ratio. No significant differences were detected between the groups in portal, renal, and systemic hemodynamics. The present results suggest that humoral changes occur early in ascites.

40|$|Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a {{recently}} discovered hormone, originating from atrial myocardium. The peptide (or family of peptides) induces potent diuretic/natiuretic, vasorelaxing and aldosterone inhibitory effects. We have investigated plasma concentrations of immunoreactive ANP in 10 patients with {{congestive heart failure}} (CHF). Mean plasma ANP concentrations were {{more than three times}} higher in CHF patients than in a matched control group. High plasma ANP concentrations in pathophysiological conditions with a high preload combined with <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> is consistent with a physiological role of this hormone to correct hypervolemia by causing natriuresis and diuresis.

A propensity for hypovitaminosis D, given that melanin is a natural sunscreen, and for secondary hyperparathyroidism in African-Americans make them more susceptible to these systemic manifestations of CHF—a situation which is further threatened by the calcium and magnesium wasting that accompanies the secondary aldosteronism of CHF and the use of loop diuretics...|$|E
