40|$|The {{decline of}} populations of certain seabirds and sea turtles {{around the world}} is partly related to their {{incidental}} capture in large-scale fisheries. However, the impacts of small-scale fisheries on endangered seabirds and sea turtles, being carried out in many places around the world, have been largely neglected by scientists and governments. We monitored 178 fishing days and described a range of poorly known hook-and-line commercial fisheries carried out by the Itaipava fleet, southeastern Brazil, composed by 497 vessels and deploying hooks from 18 degrees S to 35 degrees S. Seven fisheries were defined: fast trolling for tuna and tuna-like species, slow trolling for Bigeye tuna, handlining, <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> for Dolphinfish, pelagic longline for Swordfish, bottom dropline, and pole-and-line with live bait. We observed bycatch of 47 seabirds of six species and 45 turtles of four species. Capture rates were higher for the <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> for Dolphinfish (0. 15 birds/ 1000 hooks and 1. 08 turtles/ 1000 hooks), slow trolling for Bigeye tuna (0. 41 birds/day) and handlining targeting Yellowfin tuna (0. 61 birds/day). Endangered Spectacled petrel (Procellaria conspicillata), Atlantic Yellow-nosed (Thalassarche chlororhynchos), and Black-browed (T. melanophris) albatrosses were the main seabirds caught.

This study uses data on the Maltese fi shing industry, collected through the EU fi sheries data collection system by the Government of Malta, to develop {{our understanding of how}} climate change may impact the Maltese fi sheries sector. The most important fleet segment contributing to the overall productivity of the Maltese fishing industry, both in terms of total biomass landed and total generated income, was comprised of vessels using hooks in 2009 - 2011. These vessels mainly used drifting <b>surface</b> <b>longlines</b> to target large pelagic species. In 2011, this fleet segment accounted for the largest number of full time employment positions, and was the most important fleet segment in terms of total investment.

40|$|Fisheries {{by-catch}} {{is considered}} to be a major threat to loggerhead turtles in the Mediterranean Sea. Technical differences in both gear configurations (e. g. hook and bait type) and fisheries operations carried out by the Spanish Mediterranean <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet could have an effect on by-catch rates and size selectivity. The aim of the present study was to test the differences in by-catch per unit effort and body size of loggerhead sea turtles caught using different gear types in the Mediterranean <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fishery. Our results suggest that differences in the gear type used have an effect on catch rates and size selec- tivity. Thus, surface longliners targeting albacore (LLALB) using smaller hooks tend to capture smaller loggerheads but have the highest by-catch per unit of effort (BPUE), whereas other longlines, such as surface longliners targeting bluefin tuna (LLJAP) and traditional surface longliners targeting swordfish (LLHB), using larger hooks tend to select the larger animals; moreover, LLHB had the lowest BPUE. Disproportionate rates of fisheries-induced mortality on certain size/age- classes can differentially affect sea turtle populations, as each sea turtle age-class contributes differently to current and future reproduction. Thus, fisheries management should not only be focusing on preserving the large juvenile and mature turtles, but also on reducing the total by-catch. Thus, we recommend encouraging the use of LLHB versus other surface gears. We suggest that it is very important to take into account the gear type (and its particular catch rates) when making inferences about the impact of longline fisheries on sea turtle populations.

Loggerheads Caretta caretta (Linnaeus, 1758) can be incidentally captured by surface longlines. A number of captured individuals die during the fishing operation, which we consider direct mortality due to fishing.

40|$|Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) {{and blue}} shark (Prionace glauca) are two apex predators in the pelagic {{ecosystem}} {{of the eastern}} Mediterranean Sea. Our current knowledge on their spatio-temporal distribution patterns and {{the effect that the}} surrounding environment has on them is limited. During the period of 1998 - 2001 and 2003 - 2005, data gathered from a series of surveys on the Greek <b>surface</b> drifting <b>longline</b> fleet were analyzed in order to estimate the effect of spatial, temporal, environmental and operational factors on the abovementioned species distribution and relative abundance (expressed in number of fish caught per 1000 hooks deployed). Application of generalized additive models allowed the identification of various parameters influencing catches as well as the contribution of each one. The optimum model was derived using a cross validation procedure which was based on the principal of parsimony: this principal tends to select those variables that depict more closely the actual trends than those that fit best the underlying dataset. Three sets were investigated for swordfish: (i) all specimens; (ii) individuals of size less than 100 cm of lower jaw fork length; (iii) individuals of size greater than 100 cm. The latter two partitions were considered with the intention to confirm whether maturation differentiates the animal’s behavior. The low number of blue shark catches, compared to swordfish, led us to a diverse modeling approach. Firstly, as a first step we modeled the probability of making a catch and secondly we modeled the positive catch rates separately, as in swordfish. It was deduced that spatio-temporal variables (Longitude, Latitude, Month, year) along with the fishing gear type were the most influential on the catches. Environmental constituents (Lunar index, thermal fronts, sea surface temperature) were of less importance and had only some partial effect. Distance from coast was proven to be a very significant factor, bearing a dual property as a variable: spatial and environmental. In particular, immature and mature swordfish differentiated significantly: adult specimens were more abundant to the south-east (Levantine), at the open seas preferring cooler water masses. In contrast, juveniles were more frequently observed to the north-west (Ionian), close to warmer coastal waters. Seasonally, juvenile swordfish were more proliferate in catches during the start and end of the fishing period, and during years of high water temperatures. Increased concentrations of swordfish were detected in the vicinity of thermal fronts. The lunar disc illumination affected positively all year classes, with maximum catches observed around full moon. Although no obvious decline of swordfish abundance was noticed, average size of specimens caught did decrease considerably during the study period. An extended migratory pattern was not confirmed. However, there were strong indications suggesting that Ionian and Levantine actually represent spawning grounds. Blue sharks were encountered more frequently to the north-west of our study area, during late summer in open sea cool water masses. However, the probability of locally high concentrations was higher to the south-east, during springtime, in coastal warm waters. Their presence in catches showed a constant plummeting trend through the years. Annual spring movements towards the shore are most probably related to reproductive activity. Both species are considered to be under severe fishing pressure. Annual closure of swordfish fishery during the winter months, enforced the past 20 years, represent a set of beneficial measures. Introduction of a minimum landins size for blue sharks, appears to be absolutely essential, since the declining annual abundance trends presented in this study, come as a confirmation of other analogous research. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on 2, 049 trips by {{vessels in}} the Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet in the Indian Ocean during the period 2001 - 2015, {{standardised}} CPUE catch rates were obtained for the blue shark (Prionace glauca) using General Linear Modelling. The main factors considered were year, quarter, area, ratio, gear and the interaction quarter*area. The basic significant model obtained explained 81 % of CPUE variability observed and suggests a stable trend for this blue shark stock in the Indian Ocean. Most of the variability in CPUE was explained by the targeting factor, as represented by the ratio between catch levels for the two most valued and prevalent species landed: swordfish and blue shark. Other significant factors were identified but these were less important. The MIXED model used to analyse sensitivity showed the same trend as that obtained using the basic case...|$|E
40|$|Trials of {{standardized}} catch rates {{in number of}} fish by age were done using log-normal General Linear Modeling (GLM) from trips {{carried out by the}} Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet in the South Atlantic swordfish stock. Indices were developed for a 23 years period (1989 - 2011) for ages ranging from 1 to 5 +, assuming the Gompertz’s sex-combined growth model of the North Atlantic swordfish as a proxy for ageing the size data per trip. The criteria used to define areas, time periods and models were similar to those used to develop the biomass index, including information such as gear style, a target variable and bait type. The models explained between 29 % and 66 % of the CPUE variability. Despite the growth assumptions used, the trials show significant diagnoses and quite stable trend over time of the standardized CPUEs by age obtained...|$|E
40|$|Standardized {{catch rates}} in weight were {{obtained}} using General Linear Modeling (GLM) from sets {{carried out by}} the Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet targeting swordfish in the South central and South western Pacific areas during the 2004 - 2006 period. Year, quarter, area, ratio between swordfish and blue shark species and gear were used for modeling. The model tested explained 75 % of CPUE variability. As {{in the case of the}} Atlantic, most of the CPUE variability was attributed to the ratio between the two species and secondly, tothe gear factor. Other significant, although less important factors were quarter and area and the interaction between the two, while the year was considered the least important of all the factors examined during this period. The time period covered is too short to be able to lead to any conclusions on the standardized CPUE trend, but the results suggest that activity was stable during the Spanish fleet’s initial period of operation in these regions.

40|$|Standardized {{catch rates}} {{per unit of}} effort (CPUE) were {{obtained}} for the stock of the North Atlantic blue shark (Prionace glauca) using General Lineal Models (GLM) {{for a total of}} 5, 639 trips of the Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet targeting swordfish, during the 1997 - 2013 period. The main factors considered were year, area, quarter, gear and ratio between swordfish and blue shark catches. The significant model explained the 84 % of CPUE variability in blue shark. A major part of this variability was explained by the proxy of the targeting criteria, shown as the ratio between the two most prevalent species caught during the trip; swordfish and blue shark. Gear was identified as the second most important factor. Other factors were also significant, but less important. The standardized CPUE trend obtained suggests a stable trend of the North Atlantic blue shark stock and differs substantially from the nominal CPUE trends observed during the period considered.

40|$|Preliminarystandardized {{catch rates}} in biomass were {{obtained}} using General Linear Modeling (GLM) procedures fromsets carried out bythe Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet targeting swordfish in the Indian Ocean over two independent periods, 1993 - 2000 and 2001 - 2007. The factors used for modeling were year, area, semester/quarter, gear and ratio between swordfish and blue shark catches. The models explained 24 % and 51 % of the CPUE variability {{for the first}} and the second period, respectively. As {{in the case of the}} Atlantic and Pacific swordfish, an important part of the CPUE variabilitywas attributed to the ratio between the two most prevalent species inthe catch. Other significant, although less important factors, were also identified. The different sensitivity trials have shown similar trends over time. The conclusions on the standardized CPUE suggest a ‘learning’ and erratic trend over the first period of activityof the Spanish fleet and a decreasing trend during the second period.

40|$|The Mediterranean and Black Seas region {{includes}} twenty-two countries, three continents, and 26, 000 {{kilometers of}} coast. About 80 %, or 32, 950 vessels, {{are less than}} 12 meters in length, and thus characterized as small-scale artisanal fisheries that include trawls, drift nets, purse seines, longlines, and gillnets. According to the IUCN Red List of threatened species, one seabird, 18 marine mammals, and four sea turtles are species of importance. The region provides important habitat for air-breathing marine vertebrates, {{many of which are}} imperiled, including the nearly extinct Mediterranean monk seal. Bottom and <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fishing in the region primarily cause seabird mortality. Dolphin populations have declined due to a variety of factors, including entanglement in gill nets. Various other mammals are critically endangered. Sea turtle bycatch mortality rates range from 10 %- 50 % in a variety of fisheries. Thus, collaboration from the variety of Mediterranean countries will be required to reduce bycatch by fishers...|$|E
40|$|Standardized {{catch rates}} {{in number of}} fish by age were updated using {{log-normal}} General Linear Modeling (GLM) from trips {{carried out by the}} Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet fishing swordfish in the North Atlantic stock. Indices were developed for a 29 year period (1983 - 2011) for ages ranging from 1 to 5 +, using a sex-combined growth model for ageing the size data per trip. The criteria used to define areas, time periods and models were similar to those used in previous papers. However, the models also take into consideration new information such as gear style and a target variable as the analyses by age carried out in the past hadn’t taken into account these two important changes in the fishing strategy which have occurred in recent periods. The base case models explained between 42 % and 45 % of the CPUE variability. The age 1 standardized index suggests a more positive scenario of recruitment after 1996 with a mean overall level around double that of the previous and less favorable phase occurred up to that year...|$|E
40|$|Longlines are {{a fishing}} gear that have {{traditionally}} been used world-wide. Surface longlines are mainly used to fish swordfish, albacore, tuna and some species of sharks, while bottom longlines are used to fish large bottom-dwelling fish such as groupers. Longlines are widely known to interact with several species of sea turtles, and there is increasing concern {{about the impact of}} by-catch on these species. However, there is a paucity of data on sea turtle interactions with bottom longlines. In this paper we analyse the interaction of sea turtles with both bottom and surface longlines in the zone of Zarzis in the south of the gulf of Gabès, which is considered to be an important Mediterranean wintering and foraging area for the loggerhead turtle, Caretta caretta. Results show an important interaction with both types of longlines. Catch rates were estimated to be 0. 823 per 1000 hooks for <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> and 0. 278 per 1000 hooks for bottom longline. Direct mortalities were estimated to be 0 % (n= 33 captures) and 12. 5 % (n= 24 captures), respectively...|$|E
40|$|Standardized catch {{per unit}} of effort (CPUE) were {{obtained}} for the blue shark stock (Prionace glauca) of the Indian Ocean using General Lineal Models (GLM) from a total of 1838 trips of the Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> fleet fishing swordfish during the 2001 - 2013 period. A base-case and two sensibility runs were conducted. The main factors considered into the base-case were year, area, quarter, gear and ratio between swordfish and blue shark catches. The significant base-case model explained the 82 % of the CPUE variability of the blue shark. A major part of this variability was explained by the proxy of the targeting criteria defined as the ratio between the two more prevalent species caught during the trip, the swordfish and the blue shark. Other factors were also significant but less important. The standardized CPUE trend obtained in the base-case suggests a stable trend over time of the Indian Ocean blue shark stock. The sensitivity analyses showed similar trend as the base-case but in one of this runs the general trend obtained was slightly more optimistic when the ratio factor is excluded from the model.

40|$|Standardized {{catch rates}} in weight were updated using General Linear Modeling from {{scientific}} {{records of the}} Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longline</b> targeting swordfish in the Indian Ocean over the period 2001 - 2012. The base case run and several sensitivity runs were conducted for comparison with previous analyses. The main factors used for modeling were year, area, time, gear style and ratio. Different area stratifications, time criteria and other factors were considered in 6 tested runs. The models explained up to 53 % of the CPUE variability. Base case and sensitivity trials for the whole Indian Ocean have shown similar CPUE trends over time. A first period from 2001 to 2007 with an overall decreasing trend in the standardized CPUE indices was predicted by all models followed by a second recovery period from 2007 to 2010 and a third period exhibiting a stable trend from 2010 to 2012. The analyses restricted to the SW regions are also consistent with each another, suggesting a decrease during the first period, an important increase during the second period and stabilization during the third period, with {{the most recent year}} reaching levels similar to those predicted for the initial period of the time series...|$|E
