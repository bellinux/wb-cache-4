40|$|Introduction: Non-prescription {{slimming}} {{products are}} popular {{and can be}} easily purchased from the Internet. However, adulteration of these products with undeclared substances including prescription drugs is not uncommon. We report a case of serotonin syndrome after an overdose of a non-prescription product containing sibutramine. Case report: A 21 -year-old woman presented with somnolence, sinus tachycardia, generalised increase in tone, hyper-reflexia and clonus more prominent in the lower limbs after an intentional overdose of a non-prescription <b>slimming</b> <b>product</b> obtained from the Internet. The product was later found to contain sibutramine and other substances such as animal thyroid tissues, caffeine and phenolphthalein. Quantitative analysis of patient's serum on presentation revealed a sibutramine concentration of 112 ng/mL, which far exceeded the reported peak serum concentration after a single oral dose of 15 mg (the maximum daily recommended dose). No other culpable agent was identified. The overall clinical presentation was compatible with serotonin syndrome associated with sibutramine overdose. The patient made a full recovery after supportive management. Discussion and conclusion: This case highlighted the health threat posed by non-prescription slimming products sold over the Internet. Sibutramine overdose can result in serotonin syndrome, as in overdose of other serotonergic agents. Early recognition and timely supportive treatment are essential to ensure a good clinical outcome. © SAGE Publications 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|My {{colleagues and}} I varied out a survey {{advertisements}} {{for food and}} beverages, <b>slimming</b> <b>products,</b> and dietary supplements in South African magazines. We examined the 5 most popular magazines over one year. They are in 3 major languages (English, Afrikaans, and Xhosa). A fraction of advertisements were for healthy products (such as vegetables, fruit, and low-fat milk) but the large majorities were for unhealthy foods. Misleading advertisements for <b>slimming</b> <b>products</b> and dietary supplements are becoming common. Objective: To survey advertisements for food and beverages, <b>slimming</b> <b>products,</b> and dietary supplements in South African magazines. Methods: We examined the 5 most popular magazines over one year. They are in 3 major languages (English, Afrikaans, and Xhosa). Results: We recorded 959 advertisements; 776 (80. 9 %) were for food and beverages, 86 (9. 0 %) for <b>slimming</b> <b>products,</b> and 97 (10. 1 %) for dietary supplements. The most common advertisements for food and beverages were for restaurants (n= 126), supermarkets (119), alcoholic beverages (79), cereal products (59), confectionery items (59), vegetables (40), and fruit or fruit juices (29). Thirty-nine of them (4. 1 %) carried health claims; these were most common for dairy products (14), followed by non-alcoholic beverages (7), and meat and poultry (6). The most commonly mentioned health benefits were for healthy growth (18), performance claims (13), therapeutic claims (9), and non-serious risk reduction claims (6), and for and energy (6). The majority of health claims referred to iron (17), B vitamins (12), vitamins and minerals (11), essential fatty acids (11), and calcium (9).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this work}} was to assess weight loss claims of <b>slimming</b> <b>products</b> {{available}} in Switzerland. Method: Between May 2008 and February 2013, 31 advertisements for 13 <b>slimming</b> <b>products</b> were analyzed. Results: Total daily weight loss claims ranged between 300 g and 1 kg. 84 % of the advertisements included the photograph of a woman, 61 % showed {{a picture of a}} person before and after using the product, and 51 % claimed that the product had improved marital relationships. The terms ‘natural', ‘miracle/extraordinary' and ‘scientific' were present in 92 %, 77 % and 31 % of the advertisements, respectively. Cost for one package of the product ranged between CHF 49. 00 and 59. 00 (USD 52. 00 and 63. 00), and no correlation was found between cost and weight loss claims. No differences were found for weight loss claims according to presence or absence of a picture or of the terms ‘natural', ‘miracle/extraordinary', and ‘scientific'. Assuming that 5. 3 % of readers bought the product, yearly revenues would range between CHF 12. 5 and 33. 8 million (USD 13. 4 and 36. 2 million).

The media plays a significant role in portraying the meaning of beauty through its representation of women. These influences largely influence and alter women’s perceptions of their body image and in trying to meet the goals of beauty as represented by the media.

40|$|This report {{develops}} a metabolic-nutritional hypothesis, explaining the possible creation of isolated yet significant cases of liver damage in certain population groups consuming <b>slimming</b> <b>products</b> in an uncontrolled manner. This is proposed {{as an alternative}} due to the impossibility to attribute a causeeffect relationship between the consumption of food supplements and food products for particular nutritional uses in relation to weight-control diets per se and the liver damage found in those exposed to these products. There {{seems to be no}} link between the hepatic anomalies noted and the consumption of a specific product. The adverse effects are rather associated to the particular habits ofconsumption of these products that have been attributed with benefits for slimming and for improving general wellbeing. It is not uncommon to find examples of rapid weight-loss behaviour among this group of people, with combinations of food-deprivation alternating with other eating habits and/or taking different botanical extracts or synthetic products or, more generally, taking food supplements to which promising slimming properties have been attributed. A possible relationship is suggested here between the observed liver damage and a liver response which is to some extent physiological, but also anomalous or exacerbated by the excessive release of fat in periods of accelerated mobilisation of the adipose tissue. Thus, we propose that the excess of fatty acids captured by the liver {{in the presence of a}} limited metabolising capacity and/or re-exported triglycerides in sensitive people may increase the fat infiltration and the development of a fatty liver; in general, this is a minor and reversible disorder but if it continues it may cause an inflammatory progression to fatty liver disease: in other words, very serious liver damage.

Theoretical part concentrates on subject of media, commercial advertising and physical appearance, and provides basic information on target area (The Ústí Region) which represents basic database for target population. Collection of primary data was carried out by quantitative research. Then, secondary data analysis: content analysis of documents, and interrogation method: questionnaire technique, were used. Content analysis of documents draws from literary sources, Internet documents, magazines and memoirs. The questionnaire was anonymous; it comprised of combination of in total 27 open a closed questions. Introductory questions were focused on general information on a respondent, following ones concentrated on influence of media (advertising, Internet, TV, etc.) on physical appearance {{of people in}} the Ústí Region. The objective of thesis was to find out if younger age categories were more influenced by advertising (media) at perception of their own look, mainly when they used <b>products</b> (creams, <b>slimming</b> <b>products,</b> diets, [...] .) or services (manicure, hairstyling, fitness, [...] .) supporting better physical appearance, than higher age groups. Hypothesis of the work: Influence of mass-media on physical appearance {{of people in the}} Ústí Region falls with age, assumed that younger age categories were more influenced by media than higher ones. The research, however, showed that majority of respondents was convinced that at examining their own appearance they were not influenced by media. It was, nevertheless, found out that the age category most influenced by commercial advertising (media) was just the category of respondents between 18 th to 29 th year of age. Most respondents state that they do not examine their appearance comparing themselves with celebrities in media and do not use make-ups and aids or products improving their look under influence of commercials or media. During processing of the results it became clear that {{there was a significant difference}} between men and women in being influenced by commercial advertising, or in using various make-ups or services improving their look.

Results reveal two key contributions. First, larger sized models result in consumers feeling less pressure from society to be thin, viewing their actual shape as slimmer relative to viewing a slim model and wanting a thinner ideal body shape. Slim models result in the opposite effects. Second this research reveals a boundary condition for the extent to which endorser–product congruency theory can be generalized to endorsers of a larger body size.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how slimming advertisements work to frame slimness {{as the ideal}} female beauty. To investigate this issue, this study undertakes to analyze two sources of data: slimming advertisements (100 print advertisements altogether) and interviews (40 sets of transcription). The following research questions guide {{the development of this}} investigation: 1) How is the ideal female body textually constructed in the selected slimming advertisements? 2) How is the ideal female body visually constructed in the selected slimming advertisements? 3) In what ways are women influenced by the ideology of the ideal female body? Fairclough’s (1995 a) three-dimensional conception of discourse is used to see the relationship between three levels of a particular communicative event: discourse-as-text, discourse-as-discursive practice and discourse-as-social practice. This analytical framework helps in answering the research questions. The first level deals with discourse-as-text. The thesis examines how multimodal resources are used in slimming advertisements to construct the ideal female body through language and visuals. The linguistic analysis focuses on the lexical choices which are related to the construction of ideal female body. As for the visual analysis, the images related to the ideal female body are examined using the analytical framework of visual social semiotics (Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996). The second level deals with discourse-as-discursive practice. Here the study deals with the consumption of text in terms of how the respondents are influenced by the ideology of the ideal female body as portrayed in the slimming advertisements. Finally, the level of discourse-as-sociocultural practice is discussed based on the findings in all the three research questions. The ways the slimming advertisements promote the ideology of the ideal female body are seen in the light of sociocultural practices that play the key roles in maintaining, disseminating and propagating the ideology behind the ideal female body. The findings of this study demonstrate that these advertisements offer proof of how slimness is a part of a sociocultural system of representation where female beauty is limited to images of women that focus on the slim ideal. It is part of a sociocultural system in which the ideal female beauty is constructed as a young, slender and shapely body. It is also consolidated into a system of belief that objectifies women and dictates how women should look or not look like. Women are expected to measure up to the social expectations of how they should look like. This is done by constructing, promoting and sustaining false beauty needs. This beauty ideology and belief system, as seen in the interviews, has been internalized by most of the Malaysian women. This study, therefore, is timely and significant as it shows how this ideal female body is a social construction. By examining the ideal female body image from the linguistic and visual social semiotics lens as well as supported with interview data, the integration of different tools of enquiry provides insights into the possible causes leading to body dysmorphic disorders. It is hoped that by highlighting this issue, women will learn not be too gullible to fall prey easily to the ‘promises’ of the <b>slimming</b> <b>products</b> and services. This can help Malaysian women to be aware of these false advertising claims and to challenge the prevailing notions of slimness and beauty. This research also hopes to create awareness and a constructive ‘suspicion’ of all processes of text interpretation, in the particular context, the slimming advertisements...|$|R

The lowest value of Cu was found in sample (2) and the highest in sample (Y) and both of samples were from Indonesia. Ni in the slimming tea sample was in the range of 1. 100 to 11. 850 mg/kg. The lowest Ni content was found in sample (2) which product from Indonesia and highest in sample (Z) which is China product. For the Pb analysis, the absorbance measurements for all samples were too low which means that the Pb concentrations were non detectable...|$|R
40|$|Excecutive summary Background: The {{spectrum}} of weight related disorders refers collectively to conditions of overweight and obesity {{as well as}} disordered eating behaviour and eating disorders. Paradoxically, dieting predicts increased body weight, augmented body dissatisfaction, and increased risk of developing an eating disorder. Some studies show that moderate dieters have a more adequate dietary intake than non dieters; others suggest that dieting predicts a behavioural pattern that is counterproductive to sound weight management. The range of weight control behaviours includes both healthful eating behaviours generally recommended for good health, as well as potentially dangerous behaviours such as starving, vomiting and use of laxatives. Qualitative studies suggest overlap {{in the understanding of}} dieting and general healthful eating. Slimming is used in this thesis about the general concept of attempting to reduce body weight. While the term dieting refers to changes in the diet, the term Slimming refers to the activity of reducing weight, and was considered a better translation of the Norwegian term slanking that was investigated in this thesis. A better understanding of what adolescent girls mean when they talk about slimming is needed to interpret prevalence of self reported slimming, as well as for development of good questionnaires for future studies, and good interventions aimed at healthful weight development. The present study aimed to explore Norwegian adolescent girls perceptions of healthiness and slimming as well as the distinction between the two concepts. Methods: Eight semi-structured focus group discussions with a total of 52 participants (28 girls 11 years of age and 24 girls 15 years of age) were conducted during the winter 2006 / 2007 in suburban schools near Oslo. Focus group discussions were carried out in the school setting, during school hours, each lasting for about 45 minutes. Participants were asked questions about their perceptions of healthiness and slimming behaviours. Digital recordings of the discussions were transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were analysed according to recommendations made by Morgan and Krueger, and Dahlgren. Findings: Healthiness was discussed as a healthful lifestyle including both a healthful diet and physical activity. Participants had knowledge about healthful foods and eating habits, and considered balance, moderation and variation important characteristics of a healthful lifestyle. The motivating factors in terms of healthful behaviours were having fun and school performance among the younger girls, while appearance was the main driving force among the older participants. Slimming was viewed as an expression of body dissatisfaction and a desire to loose weight by participants of both ages. Physical activity, healthful food choices, reducing food intake and skipping meals, use of <b>slimming</b> <b>products</b> and eating disorders were discussed as weight control behaviours. Slimming was perceived to be uncommon among 11 year old girls, and common among 15 year old girls although mostly as short term efforts related to season and special events. Concerns about weight and appearance were considered by the older participants to be universal among their peers. The 15 year old girls expressed some concern about development of eating disorders {{as a result of the}} ineffectiveness of slimming. Conclusion: The findings indicate that slimming does not necessarily imply actual behavioural changes among adolescents. The focus on satisfaction/dissatisfaction with own body and on the intention behind the behaviour when distinguishing between healthiness and slimming means that the behaviours of adolescents who are interested in a healthful lifestyle and those who are interested in slimming might not actually differ at all, but that the difference lies in the mindset. Although healthful behaviours might be undertaken by adolescents seeking to loose weight, there can still be a negative effect of the slimming in terms of mental health; being dissatisfied with their own body and continuing to become even more dissatisfied when not achieving the desired effect. This, in turn may lead to use of more extreme weight control behaviours over time...|$|R
