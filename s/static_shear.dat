25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the <b>static</b> <b>shear</b> stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E

Methods: Human microvascular ECs were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding for the marker gene β-galactosidase. Transduced endothelial cells (rtECs) and nontransduced endothelial cells (ntECs) were evaluated by flow cytometry for expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 and tissue factor (TF) on both smooth (coverslips) and graft (Dacron, 6 mm inside diameter) surfaces under <b>static</b> and <b>shear</b> exposed conditions. Graft EC retention was measured after 6 -hour pulsatile perfusions. Platelet and neutrophil adherence was measured on perfused coverslips. Results: Lower levels of ICAM- 1 were expressed by rtECs on coverslips under both static (p < 0. 01 vs <b>static</b> ntECs) and <b>shear</b> exposed conditions (p < 0. 01 vs <b>static</b> and <b>shear</b> ntECs). Accordingly, fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes adhered to rtEC monolayers (p < 0. 01 vs ntECs). No difference in ICAM- 1 and TF expression by static graft seeded rtECs and ntECs was observed. However, graft-seeded rtECs that were exposed to wall shear stress displayed less TF than sheared ntECs (p < 0. 05). Transduction did not affect EC retention to the sheared graft surface. Conclusions: These data suggest that retroviral transduction does not elicit a prothrombotic/proinflammatory phenotype, rather indices of these states appear in some conditions to be reduced. Further, transduction does not adversely affect EC adherence to Dacron graft surfaces under arterial hemodynamics. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 26 : 676 - 84. ...|$|R
