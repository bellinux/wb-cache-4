Structural features are the tight junctions between adjacent endothelial cells {{and the formation}} of marginal folds at the cell-cell contacts. The glucocorticoid hydrocortisone (HC) has been reported to enforce the blood-brain-barrier in vitro measurable by an increase of the transendothelial electrical resistance. This study shows the impact of HC on the mechanical and morphological properties of confluent cell layers of brain microvascular endothelial cells. HC induces an increase in height of these marginal folds and a reduction of the intercellular contact surface. These morphological changes are accompanied by changes in cell elasticity. Staining of fibrous actin indicates that HC induces a reorganization of the actin cortex. The quantitative determination of the local elastic properties of cells reveals for the first time an HC-induced increase of the representative Young's modulus according to cytoskeletal rearrangements.

Therefore, our group examined the mechanical properties of colorectal tissue obtained from both a common animal model and humans. Uniaxial tension tests were performed {{to determine the effects of}} location, orientation, and <b>species</b> (<b>porcine</b> and human) on bowel tissue tensile mechanical properties. Bowel tissue ultimate strength, elongation at failure, and elastic modulus were derived from these tests and statistically analyzed. Ultimate tensile strength (0.58  MPa, 0.87  MPa), elongation at failure (113.19 %, 62.81 %), and elastic modulus (1.83  MPa, 5.18  MPa) for porcine and human samples respectively exhibited significant differences based on species. Generally, human tissues were stronger and less compliant than their porcine counterparts. Furthermore, harvest site location and testing orientation significantly affected several mechanical properties in porcine derived tissues, but very few in human tissues. The data suggests that porcine colorectal tissue does not accurately model human colorectal tissue mechanical properties. Ultimately, the tensile properties reported herein may be used to help guide the design of next generation rectal catheters with tissue mimetic properties, as well as aid in the development of physical and computer based bowel models.|$|E

The detection capabilities for amoxicillin (10 μg kg- 1) and tylosin (100 μg kg- 1) were at the maximum residue limit (MRL) level (50 and 100 μg kg- 1, respectively) for both, for doxycycline (200 μg kg- 1) and sulfathiazole (200 μg kg- 1) at twice the MRL (100 μg kg- 1 for each) and for cefalexin (500 μg kg- 1) at 2. 5 times the MRL (200 μg kg- 1).

Beyond phenotypic differences to other <b>species,</b> <b>porcine</b> T lymphocytes, particularly when derived from infected animals, are known to show high non-specific cytolytic in vitro activity. Here we describe the putative porcine CD 6 antigen (workshop CD 6; wCD 6) which enables a phenotypic separation of T lymphocytes responsible for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. The putative porcine CD 6 analogue, wCD 6, a protein with a molecular mass of 110, 000, shows high specificity for T lymphocytes and is neither expressed on B lymphocytes nor on cells of the myeloid lineage. In the extrathymic T-lymphocyte compartment wCD 6 characterizes two T-lymphocyte fractions: wCD 6 + T lymphocytes including both CD 4 + T-helper cell subpopulations (CD 4 +CD 8 - and CD 4 +CD 8 +) and within the CD 4 -CD 8 + fraction cells with high CD 8 antigen density.

One false positive result and 2 false negative results (samples containing oxytetracycline) were reported with the ExplorerÒ test. In conclusion, Explorerâ test is a robust method, easily automated. Photometric reading allows informatic data storage and objective readings between technicians and days. The Explorer® test {{could be used as a}} wide screening test because it allowed to detect most of the antimicrobial families (penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, sulphonamides and macrolides) in muscles from different animal <b>species</b> (<b>porcine,</b> bovine, ovine, poultry) ...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePorcine circoviruses are {{circular}} single-stranded DNA {{viruses that}} infect swine and wild boars. Two <b>species</b> of <b>porcine</b> circoviruses exist. Porcine circovirus type 1 is non pathogenic contrary to porcine circovirus type 2 which {{is associated with}} the disease known as Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome. Porcine circovirus DNA has been shown to replicate by a rolling circle mechanism. Other studies have revealed similar mechanisms of rolling-circle replication in plasmids and single-stranded viruses such as Geminivirus. Three elements are important in rolling-circle replication: i) a gene encoding initiator protein, ii) a double strand origin, and iii) a single strand origin. However, differences exist between viruses and plasmids and between viruses. Porcine circovirus replication probably involves a "melting pot" rather than "cruciform" rolling-circle mechanism. This review provides a summary of current knowledge of replication in porcine circoviruses as models of the Circovirus genus. Based on various studies, the factors affecting replication are defined and the mechanisms involved in the different phases of replication are described or proposed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{reports a}} {{high-resolution}} comparative map between human chromosomes and porcine chromosomes 2 (SSC 2) and 16 (SSC 16), pointing out new homologies and evolutionary breakpoints. SSC 2 {{is of particular}} interest {{because of the presence of}} several important QTLs. Among 226 porcine ESTs selected according to their expected localization, 151 were RH mapped and ordered on SSC 2. This study confirmed the extensive conservation between SSC 2 and HSA 11 and HSA 19 and refined the homology with HSA 5 (three blocks defined). Furthermore the SSC 2 q pericentromeric region was shown to be homologous to another human chromosome (HSA 1). A complex organization of these syntenies was demonstrated on SSC 2 q. Our strategy led us to improve also the SSC 16 RH map by adding 45 markers. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization of markers representative of each synteny confirmed block order. Finally, 29 breakpoints were identified in both <b>species,</b> and <b>porcine</b> BACs containing two breakpoints were isolated...|$|R

40|$|The epitopes {{of human}} thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH) {{recognized}} by two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), designated MAb 279 and MAb 299, have been characterized. These MAbs are highly specific for the beta-subunit of TSH. The epitope recognized by MAb 279 {{appears to be}} completely conserved between bovine and human TSH and partially conserved in the <b>porcine</b> <b>species.</b> The TSH beta-subunit epitope recognized by MAb 299 is only partially conserved between the human, bovine and <b>porcine</b> <b>species.</b> Both MAbs are capable of inhibiting the binding of TSH to its receptor in a TSH radioreceptor assay, indicating that the epitopes either coincide or are located close to the TSH beta-subunit receptor-binding sites. The carbohydrate moieties of the TSH beta-subunit appear to play little or {{no role in the}} epitope recognition by MAb 279 or MAb 299 while the integrity of the disulphide bonds are essential. The epitopic recognition may also involve lysine residues, as determined by the immunoreactivity with both MAbs following citraconylation of TSH. In addition, the amino acid sequence region between residues bTSH beta 34 - 44 could be excised by trypsin digestion of bovine TSH beta (bTSH beta) without eliminating epitopic recognition by either MAb. These results provide further insight into the relationship between the structure of the TSH beta-subunit epitopes and location of the receptor-binding sites...|$|R
40|$|Monolayer {{cultures}} of thyroid cells lose their iodide organification capacity {{a few days}} before the disappearance of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity. The present studies were performed in order to clarify this point. The above mentioned difference was due to the presence of an inhibitor in the monolayer thyroid cells culture, given that total homogenate prepared from confluent cells caused a significant inhibition of activity of TPO from fresh tissue. The inhibitor was localized in the 105 000 g supernatant of the homogenate of the cell culture, but not in a similar preparation obtained from fresh thyroid. It is thermostable, dialyzable and has a molecular weight of less than 2 kDa. Addition of the inhibitor at the end of the reaction of tyrosine iodination failed to alter the results. This fact suggests that the compound does not destroy the iodinated product. The presence of the cytosolic inhibitor was observed in monolayer thyroid cell {{cultures of}} different <b>species</b> (bovine, <b>porcine,</b> rat and human) but not in free follicles cultures.
