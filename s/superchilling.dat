40|$|Controlled partial {{freezing}} or <b>superchilling</b> of {{food products}} {{can result in}} significant shelf life extensions during the cold chain. Between 10 % - 20 % of the foods water content is frozen and the ice functions as a thermal inertia during storage and transportation. <b>Superchilling</b> in industry can reduce the use of freezing/thawing for production buffers and thereby reduce labor, energy costs and product weight losses. Superchilled products sustain quality parameters commonly associated with fresh/unfrozen products, however some increase in product drip loss may occurring during storage. Implementation of <b>superchilling</b> in industrial process plants and routines require a strict temperature control in the cold chain. Understanding and quantifying thermo-physical processes at and inside the food surface are important for the optimal design of <b>superchilling</b> equipment and packing systems for food products.

40|$|AbstractAn industrial, {{automated}} <b>superchilling</b> {{process line}} needs {{to combine the}} requirement for gentle handling of a valuable raw material with demands for energy efficiency, high capacity and product quality. The results {{from the study of}} three alterative process lines for superchilled processing of fresh cod showed large variations with respect to processing time, need for manual operations, skinning errors and yield. The processing time and need for operators was very high for the Marel <b>superchilling</b> concept, while the quality and yield was high. The alternative involving skinning in a Baader 59 unit followed by <b>superchilling</b> in an impingement freezer was very rapid and showed competitive results for quality and yield. <b>Superchilling</b> in the impingement freezer followed by skinning in the Baade 59 unit resulted in a substantial amount of skinning errors in spite of very rapid processing. An efficient process presupposes a high yield combined with efficient production, large capacity, few operators, few skinning errors and an end product of high quality. The results from the current experiments indicate that superchilled processing of cod by means of skinning in the Baader 59 unit followed by <b>superchilling</b> in the Impingement freezer would be the most competitive alternative, taken the above mentioned factors into account. The method implies short processing time, low amount of skinning errors, little manual operation as well as high yield and quality. a <b>Superchilling</b> is a robust method for conserving fresh food, and brings along many possibilities due to the extended product shelf-life. In the near future it is considered likely that most industrial processing of fresh fish will be done by means of <b>superchilling,</b> and the pioneer industry currently taking on the method will have a great advantage based on the experience from final development and implementation of the <b>superchilling</b> technology...|$|E
40|$|Supercooling is a food {{processing}} technique {{which has the}} potential to significantly increase the shelf life of foods and to reduce wastage of food products from the production and retail sectors. The process uses storage temperatures below the initial freezing point of the food without the product freezing, which maintains the quality attributes associated with fresh foods. This paper reports trials carried out to determine best methods to supercool pork meat and methods to maintain the supercooled state. Trials were carried out to compare storage life of pork meat that had been supercooled with samples that had been <b>superchilled</b> and conventionally chilled.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{bacteriology}} during {{storage of}} the North-Atlantic cod {{has been investigated}} for the past decades using conventional cultivation strategies which have generated large amount of information. This paper presents a study where both conventional cultivation and cultivation independent approaches were used to investigate the bacterial succession during storage of cod loins at chilled and <b>superchilled</b> temperatures. Results Unbrined (0. 4 % NaCl) and brined (2. 5 % NaCl) cod loins were stored at chilled (0 °C) and <b>superchilled</b> (- 2 and - 3. 6 °C) temperatures in air or modified atmosphere (MA, % CO 2 /O 2 /N 2 : 49. 0 ± 0. 6 / 7. 4 ± 0. 2 / 43. 7 ± 0. 4). Discrepancy was observed between cultivation enumeration and culture independent methods where the former showed a general dominance of Pseudomonas spp. (up to 59 %) while the latter showed a dominance of Photobacterium phosphoreum (up to 100 %). Gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MC) showed that trimethylamine was the most abundant volatile in mid- and late storage periods. Terminal restriction polymorphism (t-RFLP) analysis showed that the relative abundance of P. phosphoreum increased with storage time. Conclusion The present study shows the bacteriological developments on lightly salted or non-salted cod loins during storage at <b>superchilled</b> temperatures. It furthermore confirms the importance of P. phosphoreum as a spoilage organism during storage of cod loins at low temperatures using molecular techniques. The methods used compensate each other, giving more detailed data on bacterial population developments during spoilage. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>superchilling</b> {{process is}} defined as a method of {{preserving}} food by partial ice-crystallization. The product quality of superchilled food is very promising, and has nearly the same sensorial attributes and nutritional value as the original product. However, more research is required to make the technology more suitable to the preservation of food. The optimal degree of <b>superchilling</b> and information {{on the development of the}} ice crystals during the <b>superchilling</b> process and storage are needed because of their large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food. The main objective of this thesis was modelling and studying of ice crystallization/recrystallization of food during the <b>superchilling</b> process and storage. In order to fulfil the objective the following research activities have been carried out: A one-dimensional model for predicting partial freezing time necessary to achieve an optimal degree of <b>superchilling</b> in foods was developed. The degree of <b>superchilling</b> is the amount of free water frozen (5 - 30 %) inside the food and is among the most important parameters which influence the quality of superchilled product. The study of the ice crystallization/recrystallization of food in <b>superchilling</b> technology was studied based on the <b>superchilling</b> rate, and the state of food muscle. The relationship between the development of ice crystals in salmon and quality parameters during the superchilled storage was also studied. The final research activity in this thesis was to study differences in the <b>superchilling</b> storage methods, shell freezing and non- shell freezing. The developed model was sufficient to study the thermal behaviour of food, and had the advantage that it was simple, very fast and detailed enough to estimate the <b>superchilling</b> time and behaviour of food. The model was validated experimentally using salmon, and there was good agreement between the numerical and experimental results. Further study to quantify the model using other food products is recommended. The characteristics of ice crystals have a large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food. At a high <b>superchilling</b> rate (227 W/m 2. K, - 30 ℃ and 2. 1 min), smaller and well distributed ice crystals within and outside the cell were formed compared to a slow <b>superchilling</b> rate (153 W/m 2. K, - 20 ℃ and 4. 2 min), where larger and extra-cellular ice crystals were formed. The state of muscle also has an influence on the characteristics of ice crystals. In pre-rigor muscle, the ice crystals were formed inside the cells regardless of the <b>superchilling</b> rate. However, at a slow <b>superchilling</b> rate the ice crystal size was larger than at a high <b>superchilling</b> rate. The formation of the ice crystals inside the cells, regardless of the <b>superchilling</b> rates, is the most important factor for reducing the damage of food muscles and hence maintaining the quality. New information was discovered in this work on the development of ice crystals during the <b>superchilling</b> process and storage of salmon. There was a significant increase in ice crystal size between the <b>superchilling</b> process (day 0) and superchilled storage (after 1 day of storage). The ice crystals formed in the surface layer were 4 times larger after only 1 day of storage than those formed at day 0. Prior to temperature equalisation, ice crystals growth progressed from the surface to the centre of the superchilled food. Different layers with different sizes of ice crystals within the superchilled salmon were also observed. This was due to thermal behaviour within the superchilled sample, and because we have both ice at the surface and water at the centre, the diffusion process should occur. The recrystallization at this time (between day 0 and 1) is unavoidable however, after temperature equalization (after 1 day of storage) and control of temperature during storage there was no significant growth of ice crystals for the entire storage time. The development of ice crystals in red salmon muscle was also studied during the <b>superchilling</b> process and storage. The size of the ice crystals formed in the red salmon muscle was smaller than those formed in the white salmon muscle. In addition, the ice crystals formed in the pre-rigor red muscle was smaller than that formed in the post-rigor red salmon muscle. These findings are significant for the industry because small ice crystals indicate better quality. Quality changes have been studied with a focus on physical measurements, water holding capacity (WHC) and drip loss. The disappearance of liquid water is a major factor affecting the protein changes during superchilled storage. It was observed that the drip loss was lower in superchilled salmon compared to conventional chilled salmon, and frozen salmon between 1 and 14 days of storage. No significant differences were found in WHC and drip loss between 1 and 14 days of storage in superchilled salmon. The two <b>superchilling</b> storage methods showed differences in the development of ice crystals within the superchilled salmon. In non-shell frozen samples, the ice crystals were mainly formed in the extracellular spaces. Fine and well distributed ice crystals were formed in both the intracellular and extracellular spaces in shell frozen samples. Generally, the results found in this study have given more information in the <b>superchilling</b> area. The developed model which can be scaled-up to the industrial level, together with information on the development of the ice crystals, which has a large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food are useful for the industry in estimating the refrigeration requirements for a <b>superchilling</b> system and designing the necessary equipment. In addition, the quality study revealed that the <b>superchilling</b> is practicable if the product is partially freezing fast, with an optimal degree of <b>superchilling</b> (5 - 30 %), good packaging and a strict control of the temperature during superchilled storage.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the current {{experiments}} was to superchill a selection of fresh food by two <b>superchilling</b> methods followed by extensive storage studies and monitoring of quality during superchilled storage. Several methods for <b>superchilling</b> have been implemented at fish processing sites, but to a very limited extent and not adjusted to automated production lines. The current study presents measurements of the efficiency and precision of two methods for <b>superchilling</b> (liquid CO 2 injection and air chilling) {{as well as their}} applicability for the expected development towards automated production lines in fresh food manufacturing. Secondly, as a precision index, the effect of the amount of ice caused by <b>superchilling</b> was investigated with respect to prolonged shelf-life and end product quality. <b>Superchilling</b> by means of liquid CO 2 injection (LIC) and air chilling both gave an acceptable and reproducible ice fraction within a short period of chilling time (1 - 2 minutes). Analyses of drip loss, liquid loss and microbiological quality during storage showed that <b>superchilling</b> improved the shelf life of salmon and chicken fillets significantly- being an important contribution to food safety of fresh food.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{is a part}} of the ERA-NET project SusOrganic: Development of quality {{standards}} and optimised processing methods for organic produce. The <b>superchilling</b> concept and the state-of-art of the technology are summarized with focus on potential implementation for small scale organic production. Production of processed organic food is mostly carried out by small and medium enterprises in demanding, competitive market conditions due to competition from highly cost-efficient large scale producers of conventional products and producers of locally grown food without certification requirements. The <b>superchilling</b> concept can be applied for organic meat and fish products, hereby helping the producer to supply the market with high-quality organic products. The extended shelf life of superchilled products will be beneficial during storage with respect to production and seasonal variations and transportation in order to reach new and far-distant markets. Strict control of the chilling process as well as storage temperature and time, is necessary in order to apply the concept. For these reasons, it might be difficult to apply <b>superchilling</b> towards the end of the cold chain at the retailer or consumer without significant alterations to the cold chain...|$|E
40|$|The {{cold chain}} {{is defined as}} a set of {{refrigeration}} steps that maintain the quality and safety of food product. Refrigerant leakage and the use of fossil fuels to produce electrical power for refrigeration equipment contribute greatly to ozone depletion and global warming.

In this context, microbial quality and security improvement {{during the whole}} food processing chain (from catch to plate), using hurdle technology, a combination of mild preserving technologies such as biopreservation, modified atmosphere packaging and <b>superchilling,</b> are of great interest. Thirty-five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) belonging to the species Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Carnobacterium inhibens, Lactococcus piscium, Leuconostoc gelidum, Vagococcus fluvialis, Vagococcus penaei and Aerococcus viridans, known to possess interesting antimicrobial activity, were chosen for their potential application as bioprotective agents {{as a part of}} hurdle technology applied to fishery products. The selection approach was based on 7 criteria including antimicrobial activity, alteration potential, resistance to chitosan coating and <b>superchilling</b> process, cross inhibition, biogenic amines production (histamine, tyramine) and antibiotics resistance.

Pseudomonas spp. appeared to be responsible for the development of sweet, fruity spoilage odors in haddock fillets coinciding with increasing response of the electronic nose CO sensor suggesting that alcohols, aldehydes and esters contributed to the spoilage odors.

40|$|<b>Superchilling</b> is {{a method}} {{that can be used}} to prolong the shelf life of foods by partial freezing. Knowledge of the effects of this method on both the shelf life and quality of foods is {{important}} in order to find optimal processing and storage conditions and is of great importance both for the industry and for the consumers. Different raw materials of muscle foods were studied with the purpose of creating a basis for further improvements of both the process and the storage conditions. Products from the commercially important species pork (both roasts and rib steaks), Atlantic salmon (both vacuum packed and wrapped fillets) and Atlantic cod (vacuum packed fillets) were chosen to represent different muscle foods. Based on both sensory and microbial evaluations, the superchilled storage improved shelf life of pork roasts from 2 to 16 weeks, and shelf life might even be further prolonged if temperature is kept more constant. The H 2 S-producing bacteria in superchilled cod fillets did not exceed the limit of consumption during the whole storage period of six weeks, while the microbial shelf life of the ice chilled fillets was estimated to be 8 days after processing. Quality changes have been studied with focus on biochemical and physiochemical properties. One of the major goals in meat and fish processing is the ability to retain water and it was observed that drip loss was lower in superchilled samples compared to traditionally chilled samples in all species studied. However, the subsequent liquid loss was higher both in pork roasts and in cod fillets. The extractability of protein was used as a tool to monitor protein denaturation. It was found that myofibrillar proteins denatured more easily during superchilled than during traditionally chilled storage both in salmon and in cod fillets. This was confirmed by electrophoresis in salmon. The amount of free amino acids were higher in cod than in salmon and increased more during superchilled storage than during ice chilled storage indicating exoproteolytic activity during storage. Activities of cathepsins B and B + L in salmon fillets were relatively stable during the storage period in all storage groups, demonstrating that these enzymes are not deactivated at the selected storage temperatures and may therefore lead to softening during subsequent chilled storage. In superchilled samples of all species studied, white spots emerged on the product surface. However, the appearance of spots did not correspond either to higher drip loss or to higher microbial growth on surface of these samples. On the contrary, the total plate counts of superchilled samples were lower than of the other storage groups. This observation also applied to iron agar counts on cod fillets. These findings are interpreted as a strong indication of that the spots most likely were not of microbial origin. The optimal <b>superchilling</b> process and storage conditions remains to be found for the products studied. From the present results it is reasonable to suggest that optimal storage temperature for the vacuum packed salmon fillets is found between the superchilled temperatures in the present experiments. The quality both of the pork roasts and the cod fillets would probably benefit from a storage temperature slightly closer to 0 °C than those studied. It can also be assumed that the control of the <b>superchilling</b> process is more essential to cod than to salmon and pork. In addition, the properties of the raw material are crucial in order to obtain high quality of products after processing and storage. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Meat is a {{perishable}} {{product with}} a short shelf life and therefore short selling times. Therefore, cold chain management in meat supply is of utmost importance {{for the maintenance of}} quality and safety of meat/meat products. Raw meat/meat products are likely to support the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and/or spoilage bacteria, and should be kept at temperatures that do not result in a risk to health. The cold chain should not be interrupted at all times along the meat distribution chain. The complexity of global meat supply chain, with frequently long distribution chains associated with transportation of the product within one country, from one to another country and from one to another continent, makes the solutions for the chilling and freezing regimes, as well as monitoring of time-temperature profiles, very important for the overall success in delivery of product which will be accepted by consumer for its freshness and safety levels.

40|$|AbstractSuperchilling is {{a concept}} where the {{temperature}} is reduced 1 - 2 °C below the initial freezing point of the product. This results in a so-called ‘shell freezing’, where {{a thin layer of}} ice is produced on the product surface during processing. The small amount of ice formed within the product serves as a heat sink, eliminating the need for ice during storage and transport. As an illustration, chilled haddock fillets have approximately 30 % higher environmental impact potential than superchilled fillets due to the need for ice during storage and transport. During storage, the ice distribution equalizes and the product obtains a uniform temperature and the product appears as fresh. Consumer market analysis gives superchilled products as good as or better quality score compared with chilled products. xperiments on different superchilled and chilled food products shows a prolonged shelf life for all superchilled products compared to chilled products. For superchilled salmon and chicken fillets, the shelf life is 50 % longer compared to chilled reference products based on total count of microorganism and a quality limit of 107 CFU/g. Superchilled experiments have shown that the method is robust and appropriate for implementation to the industry, owing to the fact that ice fractions can very between 5 - 20 % without being of major importance to the product quality. <b>Superchilling</b> enable safe, high quality and long term storage of foods. The main advantage is the approximate doubling of shelf life for superchilled products compared to chilled products, high product quality, higher yield and the potential for reduced environmental impacts (approximately 30 %) when changing from chilled to superchilled value chains...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNorwegian seafood {{products}} are important export products {{with regard to}} volume and value. More than 400 trucks of fresh fish {{products are}} weekly transported from Norway to European countries. The traditionally chilled fish is packed in boxes filled with approximately 30 % ice (equivalent to approximately 130 trucks) to keep the temperature low during transport and storage. Superchilled fish contains 10 - 15 % ice. The ice serves as a heat sink and thus, do not require use of ice during transport and storage. Compared with traditionally chilled foods, advantages related to <b>superchilling</b> are among others, extended shelf life, higher yield and reduced microbiological risk. Extended shelf life of superchilled products {{make it possible to}} sell a food product as fresh during a longer period of time. The results show that the traditionally chilled fillets have approximately 30 % higher impact potentials than the superchilled fillets for all environmental impact categories. This number is a direct reflection of the ice content in the boxes with chilled fillets, and this is thus, the most important parameter in this assessment. Transportation by truck and packaging material are by far the two biggest contributors to impact potentials, in both systems, while the electricity used in the ice machine (chilled case) and in the Contact Blast Chiller (superchilled case) have only insignificant contributions. The results indicate the potential for saving in environmental impacts when switching from chilled to superchilled value chains. The truck export of fresh fish from Norway to Europe constitutes a potential for reducing the impact on global warming by approximately 78 × 106 kg of C 02 -equivilants per year.

40|$|Fresh fish is an {{extremely}} perishable food as compared to other food commodities. Considerable research focuses on the control of microbial growth and biochemical reactions to improve fish quality and extent shelf life. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) is a Mediterranean fish of high commercial value due to its desirable characteristics. Products like chilled fillets from marine cultured Mediterranean fish have high commercial potential if their shelf life can be extended through packaging or minimal processing. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate and model the effect of osmotic treatment (40 - 60 % maltodextrin plus 5 % NaCl, 0 - 360 min, 15 - 37 °C) and its combination with modified atmosphere packaging (20 - 80 %CO 2), antimicrobial agents (0. 5 % carvacrol, 0. 5 % glucono-δ-lactone, 1 % citrox, 2 ? 104 IU/ 100 g osmotic solution) and alternative osmotic solutes (trehalose, glucosamine) on the quality characteristics of gilthead seabream and to investigate the potential of using osmosis as a minimal treatment to extend the shelf life of fish products. Osmotic pretreatment caused substantial water loss (12. 3 - 77. 0 %) and solid enrichment (2. 5 - 34. 1 %) with higher solution concentrations showing the highest values of mass flow. A second degree polynomial model described successfully mass transfer during osmotic process. The indices that could more consistently be correlated to storage time and temperature of the products were Pseudomonas sp. growth for aerobically packed fillets and lactic acid bacteria for MAP samples and the chemical index TVB-N, showing high correlation with sensory scores, as also indicated by their similar Ea values. Shelf life at 5 °C was 4 days for untreated fillets and 9, 11 and 13 days for fillets treated with 40, 50 and 60 % maltodextrin, respectively. Osmotic pre-treatment with the addition of nisin in combination with MAP was the most effective treatment resulting in significant shelf life extension of gilthead seabream fillets (48 days compared to 10 days for the control at 0 °C). The results of the study show the potential of using osmotic pretreatment in combination with modified atmosphere packaging, antimicrobial agents or alternative osmotic solutes and <b>superchilling</b> storage to extend the shelf life and improve the commercial value of fresh chilled fish products. The proposed models can be a reliable tool for predicting the shelf life of minimally treated and MA packed gilthead seabream fillets during refrigerated storage...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study discolorations in superchilled muscle food {{discovered}} by Duun (2008) The discolorations was found in salmon, pork and cod, and was not microbiological. The hypothesis as {{that this is a}} form of drip channels formed by the degradation of the muscle, and two storage experiments were initiated to test this hypothesis with the use of biochemical tests of enzyme activity, protein solubility and microbiology. Analyses of samples of superchilled chicken filets showed low amounts of acid soluble peptides, but with a significant increase during the last days of storage. The amount of free amino acids was low and did not change much during storage. This indicates a relatively low and stable activity of exopeptidases, while the peptidase activity rise slightly as the filets are stored and gets a lower quality. Two storage experiments were carried out with superchilled salmon. The first experiment showed very large changes around day 1 and day 3. The temperature is equalized early on day 0 and the ice formation has stabilized on day 1. There are signs of high increase of protease activity on day 1, and the protein solubility drops with 5 % on day 3, before it increase to the previous solubility on day 7. The activity of &# 946;-N-acetyl-glycosaminidase also increase in this period. Measurements of ice crystal size was done in parallel to the biochemical analyses showed large differences between the top layer (which is frozen at the start of <b>superchilling)</b> and the middle. In the second storage experiment {{it was found that the}} top layer has a larger degree of damage to the cells in the top layer, but the cells in the mid layer had signs of more damage to the organelles. This was especially visible in the higher enzyme activity of both cathepsins and glucosaminidases, which was consistently higher in the mid layer of the filets. The original theory about the white spots that appeared late in the storage period was that they might be drip channels. This is supported by the results from the second storage experiment. It would seem that despite the outer layer being most damaged by the initial freezing, the inside of the filet has a higher damage to lysosomes and other internal organelles, which over time gives a lower quality to the inside compared to the outer parts of the filets. When thawed the inside is more degraded by enzyme activity and thus there is more liquid that need to escape and forces itself through the better quality outer layer. The paleness is probably caused by denatured proteins in the drip, but this needs more research to be confirmed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Atlantic cod is an {{important}} species for food production in Norway, and over the last couples of decades; Atlantic cod farming has gradually evolved as an industry in Norway. The harvesting procedures of farmed fish have gained major attention both in the aquaculture industry, research institutions and various organizations dealing with animal welfare issues. According to the legislations, the fish must be stunned before or {{at the same time}} as they are killed and remain unconscious until death supervenes. Adequate handling practices, methods of killing, and equipment are therefore needed. The overall aim of this study was to propose a ‘best practice’ processing line for stunned, bled, gutted, and chilled farmed Atlantic cod, which allows for good fish welfare, low handling stress, efficient bleeding, effective chilling, and maintenance of the intrinsic product quality as produced by farming. Different stunning and killing methods were tested: electrical stunning, AQUI-S TM anaesthesia, percussion stunning and carbon dioxide sedation with or without live chilling. Fish welfare and stress response of Atlantic cod exposed to the different stunning/killing methods were studied. Fish quality was assessed post rigor to assess possible connection between stunning methods and quality of the product. According to the EEG and ECG measurements, both AQUI-S TM anaesthesia (68 ml/l,) or euthanasia, electrical stunning in seawater (170 Hz 33 % duty cycle) and electrical stunning in air (107 Vrms for 15 sec) proved to be efficient stunning methods for cod. The fish can be rendered unconscious for a prolonged period of time. Doses of > 30 ml/l AQUI-S TM should be used for batchwise stunning of cod. Live chilling without an anaesthetic cannot be used as a sedation method for Atlantic cod. Furthermore, live chilling in seawater slurry cannot be recommended, since strong aversive reactions occurred immediately after transfer to the chilling tank. Carbon dioxide sedation at medium levels (245 - 284 mg/l) might be applicable as a potential sedation method for cod. At lower carbon dioxide levels (63 - 80 mg/l), adequate sedation was not achieved. Carbon dioxide sedation at high levels (330 - 550 mg/l) might be applicable, but further research is needed. However, carbon dioxide sedation at very high levels (400 - 1400 mg/l) the welfare of the fish seemed to be compromised. Percussion stunning proved to be a good killing (stunning) method based on handling stress assessments. Based on the quality assessments either of the bleeding methods, gill cutting and direct gutting, can be successfully applied for Atlantic cod. Despite the fact that pre-rigor filleting has several advantages like increased freshness and lower transportation costs, pre-rigor processing also presents problems. As seen in this study fillets cut post rigor were superior to fillets cut pre rigor in terms of various quality properties such as fillet colour, water content, water holding capacity. The shape of pre-rigor processed fillets was different from traditional post-rigor fillets. In terms of chilling efficiency, live-chilling of cod is as effective as traditional chilling using flake ice after gutting. The results do not indicate better freshness of superchilled cod (gutted or filleted) compared to cod stored in ice after 7 days. However, after 14 days of storage the potential advantages of <b>superchilling</b> of gutted cod became more prominent with lower microbiological activity, better maintenance of freshness compared with traditional ice stored cod. Assessments of fish welfare are difficult, and the only reliable assessments were ECG and EEG measurements, but these measurements are not applicable in the industry. Fish behaviour and assessments of Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) might be usable, but needs to be used with caution. Obtaining relevant blood parameters and interpretation of these related to both fish welfare and stress at the time of harvest can be complicated. Our results consistently showed that perimortem handling stress did not cause inferior flesh quality, and indicates that farmed cod can be processed with little risk of reducing product quality. This study has shown that Atlantic cod is not easily excitable, and is more resistant to handling stress than several other fish species. However, this fact should not neglect attention to handling practices since gentle handling is a pre-requisite for adequate fish welfare. Based on the results from this thesis a processing line for farmed Atlantic cod is suggested and presented in the thesis PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|E
