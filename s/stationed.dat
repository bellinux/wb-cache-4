5|$|The {{locomotives}} received transformers in 1947, {{which were}} installed in Oslo, and 2064 was delivered on 24 May. The {{cost of the}} three locomotives was 1,297,905 million Norwegian krone. At first, only one unit was transferred to Flåm. The other two remained in Eastern Norway; one was <b>stationed</b> as a shunter at Oslo West Station, the other in Skien. The units operating in Oslo and Skien had problems with the rheostatic brake operating differently depending on the direction the train was running, something which was not observed in Flåm. The issue was fixed by marginally changing the excitation voltage. The unit <b>stationed</b> in Flåm was periodically sent for service in Oslo, and when this happened, a new unit would be <b>stationed</b> in Flåm. From 21 January 1949, 2064 was returned to Flåm without the other unit being sent back. From 17 February 1955, all three were <b>stationed</b> in Flåm. During the late 1950s, one of the units was <b>stationed</b> as Voss Station for shunting duty. Starting in the late 1950s, the class was also used on the Hardanger Line.|$|E

5|$|An {{alliance}} between the Iazyges and the Dacians led the Romans {{to focus more on}} the Danube than the Rhine. This is reflected by the placement of the Roman legions; During the time of Augustus's rule, there were eight legions <b>stationed</b> along the Rhine, four <b>stationed</b> in Mainz and another four in Cologne. Within a hundred years of Augustus' rule, however, Roman military resources had become centred along the Danube instead of the Rhine, with nine legions <b>stationed</b> along the Danube and only one at the Rhine. However, by the time of Marcus Aurelius, twelve legions were <b>stationed</b> along the Danube. The Romans also built a series of forts along the entire right bank of the Danubefrom Germany {{all the way to the}} Black Seaand in the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia the legions constructed bridge-head forts. Later, this system was expanded to the lower Danube, with the key castra of Poetovio, Brigetio, and Carnuntum. The Classis Pannonica and Classis Flavia Moesica were deployed to the right and lower Danube, respectively; however, they had to overcome the mass of whirlpools and cataracts of the Iron Gates.|$|E

5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents.

As a diplomat, her father was routinely <b>stationed</b> in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia.

Danton frequently guest taught at the National Ballet of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's National Ballet School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E
