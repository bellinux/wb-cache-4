500|$|Richard B. Freeman, {{writing in}} 2011 about the {{contemporaneous}} economic {{situation in the}} United States, called Horton Hatches the Egg a tale of investment. Freeman argued that [...] "economic growth requires long-term investments", as embodied by Horton's sitting on the egg, and that [...] "trust is important in a well-functioning economy", as embodied by Horton's repeated maxim, [...] "I meant what I said,/ and I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant." ...|$|E
500|$|Naturally, {{the absurd}} sight of an {{elephant}} sitting atop a tree makes quite a scene - Horton {{is exposed to}} the elements, laughed at by his jungle friends, captured by hunters, forced to endure a terrible sea voyage, and finally placed in a traveling circus. However, despite his hardships and Mayzie's clear intent not to return, Horton refuses to leave the nest because he insists on keeping his word, often repeating, [...] "I meant what I said, and I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred per cent!" ...|$|E
500|$|Horton Hatches the Egg is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and published in 1940 by Random House. The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird's egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, [...] "I meant what I said, and I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!" [...] Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie's and Horton's features.|$|E

Australian historian Keith Windschuttle, a critic of Carr, <b>said</b> <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> History? {{is one of the}} most influential books written about historiography, and that very few historians working in the English language since the 1960s had not read it.|$|R

500|$|On 20 August 2009, Villa {{scored in}} his first {{official}} match of the season, a 3–0 Europa League qualifier against Stabæk. He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When I talked about the approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke {{in the heat of the}} moment, I was annoyed at the way we lost two points and I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huysmans {{predicted}} {{his novel}} {{would be a}} failure with the public and critics: [...] "It {{will be the biggest}} fiasco of the year — but I don't care a damn! It will be something nobody has ever done before, and I shall have <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say..." [...] However, when it appeared in May, 1884, the book created a storm of publicity. Though many critics were scandalised, it appealed to a young generation of aesthetes and writers.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with an Australian newspaper, Rev. Dr. Thomas Lane Butts said Lee now {{lived in an}} assisted-living facility, wheelchair-bound, partially blind and deaf, and suffering from memory loss. Butts also shared that Lee told him why she never wrote again: [...] "Two reasons: one, I wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity I went through with To Kill a Mockingbird for any amount of money. Second, I have <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to say, and I will not say it again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Palmeiro {{continues}} to strongly deny ever having used steroids intentionally, telling The Baltimore Sun in June 2006, [...] "Yes sir, that's what happened. It's not a story; it's {{the reality of}} what happened", and [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said before Congress because I meant every word of it." [...] Palmeiro passed a polygraph test in which he was not asked if he ever used steroids, but in which he did state that he unknowingly ingested them via a B12 injection. A 2005 New York Times article expressed one writer's belief that Palmeiro's story could perhaps be the truth.|$|E

If I'm skeptical, it's not about now, but about the distant future. We are {{separated}} for too long at a {{time for us to}} be bound together forever. There's something hopeless and very sad about this feeling. You asked me about a child, and I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and a}} woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. I only wish I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Werner Erhard/est sued Frederick, {{reportedly}} in {{an attempt}} to prevent publication of the book. In an article [...] "30 Years After the 'EST' Experience" [...] which appeared in the 2003 Collectors Edition of his book, Frederick discussed the litigation initiated against him by Werner Erhard. Frederick wrote that his 200-plus page manuscript for the book was initially titled The Game of Life and How To Win It. According to Frederick, he sent a copy of the book to about 12 publishers, and also sent a personal copy to Erhard. Frederick wrote that Erhard responded by suing him in U.S. Federal Court, claiming [...] "I had infringed his copyrighted material - BUT, he didn't attach any material to his complaint. Moreover, I never saw anything printed in est, it was all live theater", and I was never asked to sign anything that <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could (or couldn't) do as a result of taking the est training" ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 11, 2006, Robert Novak {{posted a}} column titled [...] "My Role in the Valerie Plame Leak Story": [...] "Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has {{informed}} my attorneys that, after two and one-half years, his {{investigation of the}} CIA leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded. That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, {{at the request of}} Fitzgerald, I have kept secret." [...] Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: [...] "I have cooperated in the investigation." [...] He continues: For nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in my column of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.... In my sworn testimony, I <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to me {{in the middle of a}} long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following my interview with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in [...] "Who's Who in America." [...] (Italics added.) Harlow is the person whom Novak refers to as his [...] "CIA source" [...] for his column [...] "Mission to Niger".|$|E
