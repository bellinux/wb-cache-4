Black <b>abalone,</b> red <b>abalone,</b> <b>green</b> <b>abalone,</b> white abalone, and two other species of abalone have virtually disappeared from Southern California because of withering syndrome, while the Northern California populations have remained more numerous because of the colder waters. <b>Green</b> <b>abalone</b> and white abalone are now not common in Northern California, whereas they were once numerous in Southern California, and black abalone may become extinct in the near future.|$|R

40|$|Enzymes {{responsible}} for the digestion of food protein by juvenile <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis fulgens) were studied when fed algae or a sea grass (Phyllospadix torreyi) naturally occurring in the habitat. The effect of food on the composition and activity of the enzymes was also evaluated.

50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>abalone</b> have {{separate}} sexes and broadcast spawn from early summer through early fall. Maturity is reached at 2.4 to 5 inches (61-128 mm) length or 5 to 7 years. Lifespan {{is up to}} 30 years or more.|$|R
5000|$|At Cabrillo National Monument, <b>Green</b> <b>Abalone</b> (Haliotis fulgens) was documented.

40|$|All California abalone {{species have}} been shown to be {{susceptible}} to infection with the bacterial agent of abalone withering syndrome (WS), although expression of signs of the disease may vary between species and with environmental conditions. We examined thermal modulation of WS expression in <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis fulgens at temperatures mimicking El Niño (18. 0 °C) and La Niña (14. 2 °C) events in southern California. In contrast to results obtained from previous experiments with red abalone, H. rufescens, the higher temperature did not result in higher infection intensities of the causative agent of the disease nor increase in clinical signs of disease. These results demonstrate clear differences in thermal regulation of disease expression between abalone species, and provide further data suggesting that <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> should be a target species of recovery efforts in southern California, where WS is endemic...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} found in shallow water on open/exposed coast from low {{intertidal}} to at least 30 feet (9 m) and perhaps as deep as 60 feet (18 m). Individuals are found in rock crevices, under rocks and other cryptic cavities. Like all <b>abalone,</b> <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> are herbivores. They feed mostly on drift algae and prefer fleshy red algae.|$|R
5000|$|Haliotis fulgens, {{commonly}} called the <b>green</b> <b>abalone,</b> is {{a species of}} large sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Haliotidae, the abalones.The shell of this species is usually brown, and is marked with many low, flat-topped ribs which run parallel to the five to seven open respiratory pores that are elevated above the shell’s surface. The inside of the shell is an iridescent blue and green.|$|R
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>abalone</b> are {{threatened}} by overharvesting and the withering abalone syndrome disease. California has a Abalone Recovery Management Plan to guide conservation efforts.

Forty-eight previously frozen stomachs from wild abalone adults were thawed and individually homogenized.

5000|$|Abalones {{have been}} {{identified}} as one of the many classes of organism threatened with extinction due to overfishing, acidification of oceans from anthropogenic carbon dioxide, as reduced pH erodes their shells. It is predicted [...] that abalones will become extinct in the wild within 200 years at current rates of carbon dioxide production. Currently the white, pink, and <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> are on the federal endangered species list, and possible restoration sites have been proposed for the San Clemente Island and Santa Barbara Island areas. The possibility of farming abalone to be reintroduced into the wild has also been proposed, with these abalone having special tags to help track the population.|$|R
