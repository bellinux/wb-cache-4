2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, <b>sleever</b> bars, bull pins, drift pins and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A <b>sleever</b> bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|E
5000|$|Carmen and Wayne Colson live a quiet, {{suburban}} life. Carmen is a realtor while Wayne is an ironworker. Suddenly {{everything is}} violently changed when they stumble upon an extortion plot hatched by two crooks, Armand [...] "Blackbird" [...] Degas {{and his partner}} Richie Nix. While Richie is unstable and impatient, the Blackbird is calm and collected. After Wayne forces the two away with a <b>Sleever</b> Bar, the criminals decide to exact vengeance on the Colsons, leading to a tense climax.|$|E
5000|$|Conical (or <b>sleevers)</b> {{glasses are}} shaped, {{as the name}} suggests, as an {{inverted}} truncated cone around 6 in tall and tapering by about 1 in in diameter over its height. Also called a [...] "shaker pint" [...] in the United States, as the glass {{can be used as}} one half of a Boston shaker. The most common size found in the US holds 16 oz to the rim.|$|R
50|$|The {{pants and}} <b>sleevers</b> of the dobok are wider and {{longer than the}} {{traditional}} Japanese keikogi. Due to this, practitioners often wear a dobok modeled after the Korean hanbok. The dobok of World Taekwondo Federation-style taekwondo practitioners usually have v-neck jackets, tailored after {{the design of the}} hanbok. Traditional taekwondo practitioners may wear dobok that are identical or very similar to keikogi, with a cross-over jacket front, while International Taekwon-Do Federation-style taekwondo practitioners typically wear a newer design with a vertically closing jacket front.|$|R
