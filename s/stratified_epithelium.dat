50|$|<b>Stratified</b> <b>{{epithelium}}</b> {{differs from}} simple epithelium {{in that it}} is multilayered. It is therefore found where body linings have to withstand mechanical or chemical insult such that layers can be abraded and lost without exposing subepithelial layers. Cells flatten as the layers become more apical, though in their most basal layers the cells can be squamous, cuboidal or columnar.|$|E

Beneath the surface are numerous nodules (f) of lymphoid tissue. Many lymph cells (dark-colored region) pass from the nodules toward the surface and will eventually mix with the saliva as salivary corpuscles (s).|$|E

5000|$|... ===Virology=== HPV {{infection}} {{is limited to}} the basal cells of <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium,</b> the only tissue in which they replicate. The virus cannot bind to live tissue; instead, it infects epithelial tissues through micro-abrasions or other epithelial trauma that exposes segments of the basement membrane. The infectious process is slow, taking 12-24 hours for initiation of transcription. It is believed that involved antibodies play a major neutralizing role while the virions still reside on the basement membrane and cell surfaces.|$|E
50|$|By layer, {{epithelium}} is classed {{as either}} simple epithelium, only one cell thick (unilayered) or <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> as stratified squamous epithelium, stratified cuboidal epithelium, and stratified columnar epithelium that are {{two or more}} cells thick (multi-layered), and both types of layering {{can be made up}} of any of the cell shapes. However, when taller simple columnar epithelial cells are viewed in cross section showing several nuclei appearing at different heights, they can be confused with stratified epithelia. This kind of epithelium is therefore described as pseudostratified columnar epithelium.|$|E
50|$|Keratin 5 (and K14) are {{expressed}} primarily in basal keratinocytes in the epidermis, {{specifically in the}} <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> lining the skin and digestive tract. Keratin intermediate filaments make up the cytoskeletal scaffold within epithelial cells, which contributes to the cell architecture and provides the cells {{with the ability to}} withstand mechanical, and non-mechanical, stresses. K5/K14 keratin pairs are able to undergo extensive bundling due to the non-helical tail of K15 acting as a weak cross-linker at the intermediate filament surface. This bundling increases the elasticity, and therefore the mechanical resilience, of the intermediate filaments.|$|E

50|$|The echidna's {{stomach is}} quite {{different}} from other mammals. It is devoid of secretory glands and has a cornified <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium,</b> which resembles horny skin. Unlike other mammals, which typically have highly acidic stomachs, the echidna has low levels of acidity, almost neutral, with pH in the 6.2-7.4 range. The stomach is elastic, and gastric peristalsis grinds soil particulates and shredded insects together. Digestion occurs in the small intestine, which is around 3.4 m in length. The insect exoskeletons and soil are not digested, being ejected in the waste.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} the mucous {{membrane}} is covered by a single layer of columnar epithelium. This epithelium commences very abruptly at the cardiac orifice, {{where there is a}} sudden transition from the <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> of the esophagus. The epithelial lining of the gland ducts is of the same character and is continuous with the general epithelial lining of the stomach. An important iodine concentration by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is present in mucinous cells of surface epithelium and gastric pits of the fundus and pyloric part of the stomach.|$|E
50|$|The VNO is a tubular {{crescent}} {{shape and}} {{split into two}} pairs, separated by the nasal septum. The medial, concave area of the lumen is lined with a pseudo <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> that has three main cell types: receptor cells, supporting cells, and basal cells. The supporting cells are located superficially on the membrane while the basal cells are found on the basement membrane near the non- epithelium. The receptor neurons possess apical microvilli, to which are localized the sensory receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors which are {{often referred to as}} pheromone receptors since vomeronasal receptors have been tied to detecting pheromones.|$|E
50|$|Keratinized {{surfaces}} are protected from abrasion by keratin and kept hydrated and protected from dehydration by glycolipids {{produced in the}} stratum granulosum. Examples of keratinized <b>stratified</b> squamous <b>epithelium</b> include epidermis of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, and the masticatory mucosa. Skin is also covered with <b>stratified</b> squamous <b>epithelium.</b>|$|R

50|$|The amniotic {{layer of}} the {{umbilical}} cord lining {{has been shown to}} contain a large population of epithelial stem cells (EpSC). These cord lining EpSC exhibit classical pluripotent stem cell markers such as SSEA-4, Oct-4, SOX2 and Nanog. They also express p63, a specific marker of epithelial progenitor cells. In-vitro organotypic culture of cord lining EpSC using the air-liquid interface method resulted in <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> being formed with expression of various forms of cytokeratins. Furthermore, due to their similarity in terms of phenotypic expression of keratins compared to normal human epidermal keratinocytes, cord lining EpSC have the potential to be an alternative source of cells for skin repair and regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Zoologists {{characterize}} amniotes {{in part by}} embryonic {{development that}} includes the formation of several extensive membranes, the amnion, chorion, and allantois. Amniotes develop directly into a (typically) terrestrial form with limbs and a thick <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> (rather than first entering a feeding larval tadpole stage followed by metamorphosis, as amphibians do). In amniotes, {{the transition from a}} two-layered periderm to cornified epithelium is triggered by thyroid hormone during embryonic development, rather than by metamorphosis. [...] The unique embryonic features of amniotes may reflect specializations of eggs to survive drier environments; or the massive size and yolk content of eggs may have evolved to allow direct development of the embryo to a larger size.|$|E
50|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies behind}} the oral cavity, {{extending from the}} uvula {{to the level of}} the hyoid bone. It opens anteriorly, through the isthmus faucium, into the mouth, while in its lateral wall, between the palatoglossal arch and the palatopharyngeal arch, is the palatine tonsil. The anterior wall consists of the base of the tongue and the epiglottic vallecula; the lateral wall is made up of the tonsil, tonsillar fossa, and tonsillar (faucial) pillars; the superior wall consists of the inferior surface of the soft palate and the uvula. Because both food and air pass through the pharynx, a flap of connective tissue called the epiglottis closes over the glottis when food is swallowed to prevent aspiration. The oropharynx is lined by non-keratinised squamous <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium.</b>|$|E

50|$|The upper {{portion of}} the spiral {{ligament}} (which forms the outer wall of the cochlear duct) contains numerous capillary loops and small blood vessels, and is termed the stria vascularis. It produces endolymph for the scala media, {{one of the three}} fluid-filled compartments of the cochlea. The stria is a somewhat <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> containing primarily three cell types (marginal, intermediate, and basal cells) and intraepithelial capillaries. The marginal cells are involved primarily in K+ transport and line the endolymphatic space of the scala media. The intermediate pigment-containing cells are scattered among capillaries. The basal cells separate stria vascularis from the underlying spiral ligament. The stria vascularis also contains pericyte, melanocyte, and endothelial cells.It is the only epithelial tissue that is not avascular (i.e. completely lacking blood and lymphatic vessels).|$|E

40|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the causative {{agents of}} {{cervical}} cancer {{and are also}} associated with other genital malignancies, {{as well as an}} increasing number of head and neck cancers. HPVs have evolved their life cycle to contend with the different cell states found in the <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Initial infection and viral genome maintenance occurs in the proliferating basal cells of the <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium,</b> where cellular replication machinery is abundant. However, the productive phase of the viral life cycle, including productive replication, late gene expression and virion production, occurs upon epithelial differentiation, in cells that normally exit the cell cycle.

40|$|A high {{molecular}} mass protein of 680 kD was identified and purified from the isolated desmosomes in bovine muzzle epidermal cells. This protein, called "desmoyokin" (from the English, yoke) here, showed no binding ability with keratin filaments in vitro, and its molecule had a characteristic dumbell shape approximately 170 nm in length. We {{have succeeded in}} obtaining one monoclonal antibody specific to desmoyokin. By {{the use of this}} monoclonal antibody and antidesmoplakin monoclonal antibody, desmoyokin was shown to be colocalized with desmoplakin at the immunofluorescence microscopic level; desmoyokin occurred only in the <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium,</b> not in the simple epithelium nor in the other tissues. At the electron microscopic level, these two proteins were clearly seen to be sorted out in the plaque of desmosomes with desmoyokin at the periphery and desmoplakin {{at the center of the}} disk- shaped desmosomal plaque, suggesting that these two plaque proteins play distinct roles in forming and maintaining the desmosomes in <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium...</b>|$|E
40|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} by which Neisseria gonorrhoeae invades the mucosal lining to cause local and disseminated infections are still not fully understood. The ability of gonococci to infect the human ureter and the mechanism of gonococcal infection in a <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium</b> were investigated by using distal ureters excised from healthy adult kidney donors. In morphological terms, this tissue closely resembles parts of the urethral proximal epithelium, a site of natural gonococcal infection. Using piliated and nonpiliated variants of N. gonorrhoeae MS 11, we demonstrated the importance of pili in the attachment of gonococci to native epithelial cells {{as well as their}} association with epithelial damage. By electron microscopy we elucidated the different mechanisms of colonization and invasion of a <b>stratified</b> <b>epithelium,</b> including adherence to surface cells, invasion and eventual release from infected cells, disintegration of intercellular connections followed by paracellular tissue infiltration, invasion of deeper cells, and initiation of cellular destruction and exfoliation resulting in thinning of the mucosa...|$|E
