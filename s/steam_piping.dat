2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E

50|$|Superheater {{operation}} {{is similar to}} that of the coils on an air conditioning unit, although for a different purpose. The <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace. The temperature in this area is typically between 1300 and 1600 C. Some superheaters are radiant type; that is, they absorb heat by radiation. Others are convection type, absorbing heat from a fluid. Some are a combination of the two types. Through either method, the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> and the steam within. While the temperature of the steam in the superheater rises, the pressure of the steam does not and the pressure remains the same as that of the boiler. Almost all steam superheater system designs remove droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and associated piping.|$|E

50|$|In {{the oldest}} modern {{hydronic}} heating technology, a single-pipe steam system delivers steam to the radiators where the steam gives up its heat and is condensed back to water. The radiators and steam supply pipes are pitched so that gravity eventually takes this condensate back {{down through the}} <b>steam</b> supply <b>piping</b> to the boiler where it can once again be turned into steam {{and returned to the}} radiators.|$|R
40|$|This {{environmental}} assessment has {{been prepared to}} assess potential environmental impacts associated with the US Department of Energy`s proposed action: the salvage/demolition of the 200 West Area, 200 East Area, and 300 Area Steam Plants and <b>steam</b> distribution <b>piping.</b> Impact information will {{be used by the}} US Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office Manager, to determine if the proposed action is a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. If the proposed action is determined to be major and significant, an environmental impact statement will be prepared.

50|$|The British {{carriers}} {{were attacked}} by kamikaze suicide aircraft and Victorious was hit on 4 and 9 May and near-missed on 1 April, but her armoured flight deck resisted {{the worst of the}} impacts. She remained on station and was back in operation within hours on each occasion, despite damage to an aircraft lift and <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> in her superstructure. Three men were killed and 19 of the ship's company were injured.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was built}} to power coal trains on the 0.57% eastward climb from White Sulphur Springs, WV to Allegheny, VA. With one at the front and another at the back, 11,500-ton coal trains left Hinton, WV and were at full throttle from White Sulphur Springs (a resort) to the top. C&O's 2-6-6-6s also handled coal trains from West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. Huddleston says that 23 locomotives were equipped with <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> for heating passenger trains.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superheater}} {{works like}} coils on an air conditioning unit, however {{to a different}} end. The <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> (with steam flowing through it) is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace. This area typically is between 1300 - 1600 C. Some superheaters are radiant type (absorb heat by thermal radiation), others are convection type (absorb heat via a fluid i.e. gas) and some are {{a combination of the}} two. So whether by convection or radiation the extreme heat in the boiler furnace/flue gas path will also heat the superheater <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> and the steam within as well. While the temperature of the steam in the superheater is raised, the pressure of the steam is not: the turbine or moving pistons offer a [...] "continuously expanding space" [...] and the pressure remains {{the same as that of}} the boiler. The process of superheating steam is most importantly designed to remove all droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and/or associated piping. Superheating the steam expands the volume of steam, which allows a given quantity (by weight) of steam to generate more power.|$|E

50|$|The {{subfloor}} {{may also}} provide underfloor heating and if floor radiant heating is not used, will certainly suffer puncture openings {{to be put}} through for forced air ducts for both heating and air conditioning, or pipe holes for forced hot water or <b>steam</b> heating transport <b>piping</b> conveying the heat from furnace to the local room's heat exchangers (radiators).|$|R
5000|$|While a new Gas Boiler {{replaced}} an out {{of order}} oil boiler in 2015, total replacement of the church's <b>steam</b> heating systems <b>piping</b> has become a priority, as the Upper Church system has been showing signs of deterioration and with several recent leaks. Replacement of the piping is {{to take place in}} the spring of 2017, at an estimated cost of $180,000.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of heated water or <b>steam,</b> <b>piping</b> is used to {{transport}} the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems). The heat can {{be transferred to the}} surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.|$|E
50|$|On June 9, 1985, a 30 in hot reheat line, under 600 {{pounds per}} square inch of pressure, burst open. The reheat line cycles steam back through the boiler stack after it has {{expanded}} through the high pressure (HP) turbine and before it reached the low pressure (LP) turbine. A 1,000-degree steam cloud blew down a door leading to the control room of the station, fatally scalding six workers: Michael Bowman, John Dolan, Ernest Hernandez, Terry Leroy, Danny Norman and Howard Turner. Ten others were injured. The station was out of service for six months while all the <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> was replaced.|$|E
5000|$|Steam {{pipes and}} {{radiators}} {{are prone to}} producing banging sounds often incorrectly called water hammer. The bang is created {{when some of the}} steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the <b>steam</b> <b>piping.</b> Subsequently, steam picks up the water, forms a [...] "slug" [...] and hurls it at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and greatly stressing the pipe. This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy and is often caused by buildings settling and the resultant pooling of condensate in pipes and radiators that no longer tilt slightly back towards the boiler.|$|E
50|$|YIT's recent {{acquisitions}} {{have seen}} the company increase markedly in size - both the company's revenue and workforce more than trebled in the ten years to 2007, making YIT the largest construction company in Finland and the largest supplier of building systems services in the Nordic region by sales. This growth is also reflected in the scope of YIT's business: long-term servicing and maintenance contracts for items such as <b>steam</b> boilers, <b>piping,</b> heating, plumbing and electricity networks and water treatment plants now account for {{over a quarter of}} annual revenues. The Construction Services division, building homes, water and waste treatment plants and infrastructure ranging from railway stations to golf courses remains the group's largest source of revenue as of the end of 2006.|$|R
50|$|Condition {{monitoring}} (or, colloquially, CM) is {{the process}} of monitoring a parameter of condition in machinery (vibration, temperature etc.), in order to identify a significant change which is indicative of a developing fault. It is a major component of predictive maintenance. The use of condition monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to prevent failure and avoid its consequences. Condition monitoring has a unique benefit in that conditions that would shorten normal lifespan can be addressed before they develop into a major failure. Condition monitoring techniques are normally used on rotating equipment and other machinery (pumps, electric motors, internal combustion engines, presses), while periodic inspection using non-destructive testing techniques and fit for service (FFS) evaluation are used for stationary plant equipment such as <b>steam</b> boilers, <b>piping</b> and heat exchangers.|$|R
40|$|As high {{temperature}} <b>steam</b> and process <b>piping</b> expands with heat, joints begin to open between the insulation sections, resulting in increased energy loss and possible unsafe surface temperatures. Many different expansion joint designs are presently in use for both single and double layer insulation construction. However, {{due to the}} installation cost reduction associated with single layer systems and increased thickness capabilities of insulation manufacturers, much attention is being given to utilizing single layer construction as much as possible...|$|R
50|$|The older buildings, {{designed}} by Phillip H. Johnson, were two-storied, {{and made of}} red brick, terra cotta and granite trimmings. They were connected by fire-proof tunnels with walkways {{on top of the}} tunnels for the use of transporting residents, with a parallel <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> system, and were distributed on the 1400 acre campus in the cottage plan formation. The buildings were designed to provide a large number of small rooms occupied by from two to three beds, a few small dormitories with from eight to ten beds, and a large exercising day room. George Lovatt was the architect for several of the buildings constructed post-1937.|$|E
50|$|During normal operation, rotor {{imbalance}} {{can lead}} to vibration, which, {{because of the high}} rotation velocities, could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing. To reduce this risk, considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine. Also, turbines are run with high-quality steam: either superheated (dry) steam, or saturated steam with a high dryness fraction. This prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades (moisture carry over). Also, liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft. To prevent this, along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high-quality steam, condensate drains are installed in the <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> leading to the turbine.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the boiler}} design activities, {{potential}} cost savings {{were identified by}} considering shortening the main and reheat steam lines using two novel arrangements. Firstly, a twin tower or inverse two-pass boiler design was considered, in which firing {{takes place in a}} first tower, with the hot combustion gases moving down and across to a second tower. The final super-heater and re-heater are arranged {{at the bottom of the}} second tower with outlet headers located close to the turbine. The arrangement minimizes the thermal movement between boiler and steam lines providing a significant reduction in the length of <b>steam</b> <b>piping</b> to 25 m and 30 m for each string of 400 MW reference plant. As an alternative arrangement, a horizontal boiler concept, designed with the outlet headers on top of the boiler was considered. The low height boiler design arrangement resulted in a similar shortening of the steam lines to around 35 m to 40 m for each string of a 400 MW reference plant.|$|E
40|$|Even {{with the}} best {{pretreatment}} programs, boiler feedwater often contains some degree of impurities, such as suspended and dissolved solids. The impurities can remain and accumulate inside the boiler as the boiler operation continues. The increasing concentration of dissolved solids may lead to carryover of boiler water into the steam, causing damage to <b>piping,</b> <b>steam</b> traps and even process equipment. The increasing concentration of suspended solids can form sludge, which impairs boiler efficiency and heat transfer capability...|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{distribution}} {{systems may}} also be vulnerable to a situation similar to water hammer, known as steam hammer. In a steam system, a water hammer most often occurs {{when some of the}} steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the <b>piping.</b> <b>Steam</b> picks up the water, forming a [...] "slug", and hurls this at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and greatly stressing the pipe. This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy.|$|R
50|$|Impurities {{in water}} are entrained into the steam {{as it is}} {{generated}} and more may migrate into the <b>steam</b> from process <b>piping</b> materials as it is conducted to the process. These impurities or contaminants can be quite harmful when the steam is an ingredient in industrial manufacturing processes. As microelectronic device size and geometry shrink, the susceptibility to damage from contaminants grows. This requires intervention {{through the use of}} filters, selective membranes or other techniques to clean the water or steam before delivery to process.|$|R
5000|$|The two 6-pounders {{appeared}} to be in fine condition. About 100 to 200 4 inch armor-piercing, blind and shrapnel shells were available, but most were weathered though due to exposure to the elements or from being submerged in Topolobampo Bay. The 6-pounders had plenty of ammunition, but again the shells were in bad shape and dangerous to fire. Crates of small arms ammunition littered the vessel, some whole and filled with ammo, others splintered to pieces. The whole crates were stacked on the bridge and inside the captain's quarters. Among the debris, three cows roamed the hold, adding to the mess. The engines were in a bad state, covered in rust. The generator had been destroyed by salt water, meaning no lights could be used and Tampicos crew had to use lanterns at night. The two boilers were [...] "dead"; the fronts of the casings were missing, along with the hand-hole plates. Tubes inside the boilers were visible; salt crystals hung from them [...] - [...] the <b>steam</b> <b>piping,</b> the fresh-water piping, and the gauges. About 500 tubes needed plugging, according to the Mexican engineers. The rebels improvised with wooden table legs to plug the holes.|$|E
50|$|The NZR JB class steam {{locomotives}} {{were all}} originally {{members of the}} NZR J class of 1939. Built by North British Locomotive Works, Scotland, they all initially burned coal and wore distinctive bullet-like streamlining. After World War II the railways suffered problematic coal shortages, especially in the North Island. Approval was gained to convert 12 of the J class locomotives into oil-burners, to burn heavy fuel oil which was available in plentiful quantities at the time. The conversion saw the installation of a two-nossle burner in the firebox, removal of the grate and ashpan which was replaced with a firepan lined with bricks, shortening of the superheater tubes in the boiler, removal of the spark arrester in the smokebox, removal of the brick arch, addition of the related controls and gauges for the oil burning equipment, and the tender modified to carry an oil bunker and associated <b>steam</b> <b>piping.</b> Similar to the K and KA Classes which were converted to oil burning at the same time, the JB Class utilized a separate, removable tank which sat in the former coal space. However, the full-width coal bunker of the J-type's Vanderbilt tender was cut down so that the oil tank was visible at the sides, with distinctive vertical supports below. The conversion process generally coincided with {{the removal of the}} streamlining, but not always. Once converted, the locomotives were re-classified JB in recognition of the conversion, however they retained their original J class numbers.|$|E

50|$|Bremen Waterworks (1871 - 73), with Dietrich Berg as {{technical}} designer, Poppe designed Bremen's first municipal waterworks, housing it in {{a square}} red-brick Gothic revival tower with four corner turrets which emulated {{the form of the}} Grand Master's Residence in the Marienburg fortress of the Teutonic Knights in East Prussia (now Malbork Castle in Poland).

The shape of the building led to the nickname umgedrehte Kommode (upside-down commode); the turrets have been shortened because of the danger of bricks falling from them.
