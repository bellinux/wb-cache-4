5|$|From the outset, {{the team}} {{wanted to make}} a grand RPG, but were {{restricted}} by their budget and schedule. They were reluctant to cut any content such as one of the time periods or the multiplayer aspect, and they decided to postpone the original release date from March 2000 to June the same year. They also scaled back the scope of their multiplayer testing and canceled the planned release of an interactive pre-launch demo. The delay allowed Nihilistic to retain most of the intended design but they were forced to remove the ability to play the entire single-player campaign as a team online, compensating for this by adding two multiplayer scenarios built using levels from the single-player game. Huebner <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not plan appropriately for multiplayer when building the Java scripts for the single-player game, meaning the scripts did not work effectively in multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not have the right}} colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E

5|$|Xenosaga Episode I was {{the debut}} game title of Japanese {{developer}} Monolith Soft. Company founder Tetsuya Takahashi acted as director and co-writer. Takahashi had previously worked at Square on the PlayStation RPG Xenogears. Initially planned as a six-part series and despite there being concept {{work for a}} sequel, Xenogears was left as a standalone project while Square decided to focus on their established franchises such as Final Fantasy. Another stated reason was that Square <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have the money available to invest in his concept. Following his departure from Square due to disagreeing with their strategy, Takahashi searched for another company which could help him create the game he and others from the Xenogears project envisioned. According to producer Hirohide Sugiura, most of the companies they contacted suggested forming Monolith Soft as an independent developer, with only Namco suggesting that they become a subsidiary, and was willing to both fund the production and manage the logistics and marketing, allowing Monolith Soft staff to focus solely on creating the game. Following this agreement, Namco helped {{in the development and}} marketing of the game. While production of the game began following the foundation of Monolith Soft in 2000, Takahashi had been working on the game's concept since 1999, intending it as a spiritual successor to Xenogears rather than a remake or sequel. Production at Monolith Soft took two years. The development budget apparently reached ¥1 billion—approximately $7,700,000 USD.|$|E

25|$|On 16 June 2017, police <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not believe}} they would find more survivors.

Twenty-four people remained in hospital, with 12 in critical care.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} after the fire, there were {{considerable}} efforts to assign and avoid blame {{on the part of the}} band, the nightclub owners, the manufacturers and distributors of the foam material and pyrotechnics, and the concert promoters. Through attorneys, club owners <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not give permission to the band to use pyrotechnics. Band members claimed they had permission.|$|E
25|$|Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% {{nationwide}} against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, {{but most}} voters <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not {{know enough about}} him to have an opinion of him personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.|$|E

Most were in high-risk options, and the McMahons <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have sufficient financial sophistication {{to make sense of what}} was occurring. Eugene McMahon says his accountants could not, either.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags {{adjoining}} {{it helped}} form {{the ideas of}} modern geology as it is currently understood. It was in these areas that James Hutton observed that the deposition of the sedimentary and formation of the igneous rocks must have occurred at different ages and in different ways than the thinking of that time <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> It is possible to see a particular area known as Hutton’s Section in the Salisbury Crags where the magma forced {{its way through the}} sedimentary rocks above it to form the dolerite sills that {{can be seen in the}} Section.|$|E
25|$|Whitehead's work {{remained}} mostly {{unknown to}} the public and aeronautical community after 1911 until a 1935 article in Popular Aviation magazine co-authored by educator and journalist Stella Randolph and aviation history buff Harvey Phillips. Randolph expanded the article into a book, Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead, published in 1937. Randolph sought out people who had known Whitehead and had seen his flying machines and engines. She obtained 16 affidavits from 14 people and included the text of their statements in the book. Four people <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not see flights, while the others said they saw flights of various types, ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of feet, to more than a mile.|$|E

25|$|During a DJ {{tour for}} the release of the French group Justice's A Cross the Universe in November 2008, {{controversy}} arose when a photograph of Augé DJing with an unplugged Akai MPD24 surfaced. The photograph sparked accusations that Justice's live sets were faked. Augé has since said that the equipment was unplugged very briefly before being reattached and the band put a three-photo set of the incident on their MySpace page. After a 2013 Disclosure concert, the duo was criticized for pretending to live mix to a playback of a pre-recorded track. Disclosure's Guy Lawrence <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not deliberately intend to mislead their audience, and cited miming by other DJs such as David Guetta.|$|E
25|$|The trial {{took place}} in late January and early February 1943; Flynn's attorney, Jerry Giesler, impugned the accusers' {{character}} and morals, and accused them of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and, in Satterlee's case, an abortion (which was illegal at the time). He noted that the two women, who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not know each other, filed their complaints within days of each other, although the episodes allegedly took place {{more than a year}} apart. He implied that the women had cooperated with prosecutors in hopes of avoiding prosecution themselves. Flynn was acquitted, but the trial's widespread coverage and lurid overtones permanently damaged his carefully cultivated screen image as an idealised romantic leading player.|$|E
25|$|At a Ullico {{board meeting}} on March 28, Georgine {{proposed}} returning his profits to the company. But other board members argued this would pressure {{them to return}} their profits, too—something they {{did not wish to}} do. The scandal was causing a split in the AFL-CIO's member unions. Sweeney and some unions argued that surrendering profits {{was the only way to}} restore confidence in the labor movement. But other unions, led by Martin Maddaloni, president of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the plumbers' union), <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> nothing that directors in other companies had not also done. Meanwhile, an aggravated Thompson issued a public statement accusing Ullico and its legal counsel of making defamatory statements about him and his inquiry and misrepresenting the report's findings.|$|E

25|$|A 2014 poll {{commissioned}} by the US Spanish-language network Univision of more than 2,000 Catholics in 12 countries (Uganda, Spain, the US, Brazil, Argentina, France, Mexico, Italy, Colombia, Poland, the Philippines, and the DRC) found that two thirds of respondents were opposed {{to the idea of}} civil same-sex marriage, and around one third was in favor. However, the level of resistance varied between economically developing and developed countries, with 99% of respondents opposed in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo; but a majority in favour in Spain (63%) and the US (54%). Additionally, in all countries a majority of those polled <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not think the Catholic Church should perform marriages between two people of the same sex—although the results again ranged with support strongest in Spain (43% in favour) to Uganda (99% against).|$|E
25|$|Also on September 10, DNI Mike McConnell {{testified before}} the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that the Protect America Act had helped foil a major terror plot in Germany. U.S. intelligence-community {{officials}} questioned the accuracy of McConnell's testimony and urged his office to correct it, which he did in a statement issued September 12, 2007. Critics cited the incident {{as an example of}} the Bush administration's exaggerated claims and contradictory statements about surveillance activities. Counterterrorism officials familiar with the background of McConnell's testimony <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not believe he made inaccurate statements intentionally as part of any strategy by the administration to persuade Congress to make the new eavesdropping law permanent. Those officials said they believed McConnell gave the wrong answer because he was overwhelmed with information and merely mixed up his facts.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that it was too much of an outlier with other poll results.|$|E
