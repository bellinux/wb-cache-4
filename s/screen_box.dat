5000|$|The {{standard}} unit is a single-shaft, double-bearing unit constructed with a sieving box, mesh, vibration exciter and damper spring. The screen framing is steel side plates and cross-members that brace static and dynamic forces. At {{the center of}} the side plates, two roller bearings with counterweights are connected to run the drive. Four sets of springs are fixed on the base of the unit to overcome the lengthwise or crosswise tension from sieves and panels and to dampen movement. [...] An external vibration exciter (motor) is mounted on the lateral (side) plate of the <b>screen</b> <b>box</b> with a cylindrical eccentric shaft and stroke adjustment unit. At the screen outlet, the flows are changed in direction, usually to 90 degrees or alternate directions, which reduces the exiting stream speed. Strong, ring-grooved lock bolts connect components.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiver}} system, {{built by}} A.C. Cossor to a TRE design, was a multiple-stage superheterodyne. The {{signal from the}} selected antennas on the receiver towers were fed through the radiogoniometer and then into a three-stage amplifier, with each stage housed in a metal <b>screen</b> <b>box</b> to avoid interference between the stages. Each stage used a Class B amplifier arrangement of EF8s, special low noise, [...] "aligned-grid" [...] pentodes. The output of the initial amplifier was then sent to the intermediate frequency mixer, which extracted a user-selectable amount of the signal, 500, 200 or 50 kHz as selected by a switch on the console. The first setting allowed most of the signal through, and was used under most circumstances. The other settings were available to block out interference, but did so by also blocking some of the signal which reduced the overall sensitivity of the system.|$|E
50|$|Tensioned {{screen cloth}} is {{typically}} 4 feet by the width or {{the length of}} the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned. Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted {{on both sides of the}} <b>screen</b> <b>box.</b> When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth. Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).|$|E

Its biggest innovation lies in setting two kinds of vibration parameters in screen boxes of two separate units respectively, two kinds of vibration parameters are high-frequency with small amplitude and low frequency with large amplitude. The innovation keeps the advantages in screening efficiency and productivity of the traditional vibrating screen with double amplitudes and different frequency, it also solves design difficulty of elastic coupling in the traditional vibrating screen with double amplitudes and different frequency, so it is full of broad application prospect.

40|$|Abstract. A multi-faceted {{introduction}} {{on current}} state and development trends of tumbler screening technology was proposed, which included that {{the origin and}} development of the tumbler screening machines, a comparison between tumbler screening machines and rotary vibration screens, the structure design and analysis, especially the screen mesh cleaning technology and specific machine applications. The status and development trends of tumbler screening machines in China and abroad especially in German were analyzed. The developing direction of future tumbler screening machines and the situation of Chinese businesses producing tumbler screening machines development were introduced. The Origin and Development Tumbler screening is a special form of screening machine among many other structures, and it is named after the rocking motion of its circular screen. Tumbler screening machines adopt mechanical eccentricity and offset angle forced driving mode. The entire cylindrical <b>screen</b> <b>box</b> makes rocking motion driven by the rocking shaft, and thus the machine belongs to mechanical rocking motion screens.

40|$|International audienceReliable and {{repetitive}} {{high power}} and long pulse tokamak operation is strongly dependant {{of the ability}} to secure the Plasma Facing Components (PFCs). In Tore Supra, a network of 7 infrared (IR) video cameras is routinely used to prevent PFCs overheating and damage in selected regions. Real time feedback control and offline analysis are essential for basic protection and understanding of abnormal thermal events. One important limitation detected by the IR real time feed-back loop during high power RF operation (injected power of 9. 5 MW over 26 s and 12 MW over 10 s have been achieved respectively in 2006 and 2008) is due to the interaction between fast ions which increase the power flux density and flaking of the boron carbide coatings on the Faraday <b>screen</b> <b>box</b> of the ICRH antennas. An IR-based experimental procedure is proposed in order to detect new flakes during plasma operation. The thermal response of the B(4) C coating is studied with and without flaking during plasma operation. The experimental heat flux deposited by fast ion losses on the Faraday screen is calculated for high (3. 8 T) and low magnetic field (2 T) during high RF power operation (with fundamental hydrogen minority and second harmonic ICRH heating schemes respectively). The paper addresses both thermal science issues applied to machine protection and limitation due to fast ions issues during high RF power, long pulse operation. Safety margin to critical heat flux and number of fatigue cycles under heat load are presented in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The Swire Group Charitable Trust funded the design, assembly and installation of a scientific data collection system on their ship the MV Pacific Celebes. The system is now providing data from areas where no or little data exists particularly in the Indian Ocean, Red Sea and Mediterranean. It links with and connects on-going observations in the Atlantic. Data from the system supports projects both at NOC and elsewhere including the IOCPP (International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project). In Singapore and Jakarta, in June 2007, NOC installed the first system on the Swire ship the MV Pacific Celebes. This report details the modifications made to the ship prior to installation, the installation on the ships and lists all the equipment sent to the ship. A diary of the installation process is available as NOC Internal Document No. 10 *. The 4 main scientific instrument packages and control units aboard the Pacific Celebes are :- 1. In the (engine room) machinery space a stainless steel tank connected to the ships pumped seawater supply containing measuring devices for dissolved carbon dioxide and oxygen, total dissolved gas pressure, temperature and conductivity. 2.
