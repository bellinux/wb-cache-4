5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, {{but may also}} be used to physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able to}} <b>see</b> <b>very</b> well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain cannot fall. As a result, {{very cold}} climates <b>see</b> <b>very</b> little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts.

She had been an assistant mistress at Oxford High School and later became a headmistress in Brighton and his medical career had kept him in London. Even after their marriage they found it hard to spend time together as Head spent most weekends from 1903 to 1907 in Cambridge experimenting with Rivers. To cope with the long periods of separation, they started writing a joint diary and commonplace book. Each had a volume and they would exchange them from time to time so that they could comment on each other's experiences, thoughts and reading.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are too low. As semi-arboreal snakes, young boa constrictors may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. Boa constrictors strike when they perceive a threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, boa constrictors in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot <b>see</b> <b>very</b> well, causing it to be more defensive than it might be otherwise.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall <b>see</b> <b>very</b> soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

500|$|Soon after arriving, the 146th Brigade's leading battalions {{began to}} move south. On 21 April, Carton De Wiart's troops engaged in the first {{encounter}} of the war between British and German troops. The British troops, largely confined to the road network and advancing in deep snow, were engaged by a slightly larger German force that was supported by artillery and air support. The Germans, utilizing sledges, motorcycles, and ski-troops were able to outmanoeuvre and force back the British. German follow-up attacks did not materialize, however the Luftwaffe heavily bombed the small port at Namsos. Carton De Wiart cabled the War Office and stated [...] "with my lack of equipment I was quite incapable of advancing on Trondheim and could <b>see</b> <b>very</b> little point in remaining {{in that part of}} Norway sitting out like rabbits in the snow." [...] The evacuation was not ordered {{until the end of the}} month and then completed in the early days of May, following the loss of 157 men of Mauriceforce. The lack of success in Norway, and the withdrawal of the forces attempting to retake Trondheim resulted in the collapse of Chamberlain's Government. Carton De Wiart, considered a daring and aggressive commander, was – per historian Jack Adams – [...] "hampered by... climatic and geographic conditions" [...] in addition to his troops being [...] "inexperienced, poorly prepared and badly backed up".|$|E

500|$|Frank Proffitt, the Appalachian {{musician}} whose {{version of}} [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] the Trio rearranged, watched their {{performance of his}} song on a television show and wrote in reaction, [...] "They clowned and hipswung.

Tears came to my eyes. I went out and bawled on the ridge." [...] Proffitt had learned the song from {{his father and his}} grandmother, who had known Tom Dula and Laura Foster, the killer and the victim in the actual 1866 murder related in the song. Both Proffitt and fellow North Carolina musician Doc Watson sang the older version of the tune, which had [...] "a lively mocking tempo... that retained some of the ghastliness and moral squalor of an actual murder," [...] according to folk historian Robert Cantwell, who also notes that the Kingston Trio's version of the song left out several verses from the traditional lyric. The slower, harmonized Trio version of the Dooley song and other traditional numbers struck Proffitt as a betrayal of [...] "the strange mysterious workings which has made Tom Dooly [...] live..." [...] As recently as 2006, folk traditionalist and influential banjo master Billy Faier remarked: [...] "I hear and <b>see</b> <b>very</b> little respect for the folk genre" [...] in their music and described the Trio's repertoire as [...] "a mishmash of twisted arrangements that not only obscure the true beauty of the folk songs from which they derive, but give them a meaning they never had." ...|$|E

[...] He also praised the CG animation in the OZ sequences. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Hosoda's style and said that it [...] "adds enough dimensions to his characters and kinetic battles that the serene real world seems like a dream state." [...] He also likened Hosoda's style to that of Hayao Miyazaki and Nintendo. Hartlaub complained that Kenji's character is [...] "a bit too over-caffeinated in the first part" [...] {{and concluded that the}} film is [...] "the kind of fun and quirky film that you don't <b>see</b> <b>very</b> often in art houses this time of year." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He stated that [...] "Summer Wars is most appealing in its hushed moments" [...] and also praised Satoko Okudera's writing, stating that it [...] "stakes a claim for the non-virtual world of history and of family ties that stretch back to Japan’s medieval era." [...] He also praised the OZ animation sequences as [...] "visually ravishing explorations of white-on-white cyberspace, but the hectic gaming action sequences feel curiously passé." [...] Burr notes that in the film, [...] "it's what's old that's made to seem refreshingly new." [...] In his review for the New York Post V.A. Musetto gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and called the film [...] "great despite its structural problems". Musetto also complained about the storyline, stating that the [...] "sci-fi elements seem silly rather than suspenseful."
