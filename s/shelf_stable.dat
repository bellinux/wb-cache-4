25|$|Chewing gum {{is rather}} <b>shelf</b> <b>stable</b> {{because of its}} {{non-reactive}} nature and low moisture content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from 3-6%. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not {{required by law to}} be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E

The Mesopotamian Zone is the easternmost unit of the <b>stable</b> <b>shelf.</b> It is bounded in the NE by the folded ranges of pesh-i-kuh in the E, and Hemrin and Makhul in the N.

40|$|Ice {{shelves in}} the Arctic {{lost more than}} 90 % of their total surface area during the 20 th century and are {{continuing}} to disintegrate rapidly. The significance of these changes, however, is obscured by the poorly constrained ontogeny of Arctic ice shelves. Here we use the sedimentary record behind the largest remaining ice shelf in the Arctic, the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf (Ellesmere Island, Canada), to establish a long-term context in which to evaluate recent ice-shelf deterioration. Multiproxy analysis of sediment cores revealed pronounced biological and geochemical changes in Disraeli Fiord {{in response to the}} formation of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf and its fluctuations through time. Our results show that the ice shelf was absent during the early Holocene and formed 4, 000 years ago in response to climate cooling. Paleoecological data then indicate that the Ward Hunt Ice <b>Shelf</b> remained <b>stable</b> for almost three millennia before a major fracturing event that occurred ∼ 1, 400 years ago.

40|$|We {{modelled}} {{the flow}} of the Larsen C and northernmost Larsen D ice shelves, Antarctic Peninsula, using a model of continuum mechanics of ice flow, and applied a fracture criterion to the simulated velocities to investigate the ice shelf’s present-day stability. Constraints come from satellite data and geophysical measurements from the 2008 / 09 austral summer. Ice-shelf thickness was derived from BEDMAP and ICESat data, and the density–depth relationship was inferred from our in situ seismic reflection data. We obtained excellent agreements between modelled and measured ice-flow velocities, and inferred and observed distributions of rifts and crevasses. Residual discrepancies between regions of predicted fracture and observed crevasses are concentrated in zones where we assume a significant amount of marine ice and therefore altered mechanical properties in the ice column. This emphasizes the importance of these zones and shows that more data are needed to understand their influence on ice-shelf stability. Modelled flow velocities and the corresponding stress distribution indicate that the Larsen C ice <b>shelf</b> is <b>stable</b> at the moment. However, weakening of the elongated marine ice zones could lead to acceleration of the ice shelf due to decoupling from the slower parts in the northern inlets and south of Kenyon Peninsula, leading to a velocity distribution similar to that in the Larsen B ice shelf prior to its disintegration...|$|R
