40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} the fourth most common {{malignancy}} and the second leading cause of mortality among cancer patients in the world. Nutritional and epidemiological {{studies have indicated that}} zinc, iron and copper status modulates the risk of developing cancer and on the other hand, apoptosis has been reported to play a decisive role in precancerous changes. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether there is any relationship between <b>serum</b> zinc, <b>iron</b> and copper levels and apoptosis (as an early indicator of gastric cancer changes) in human gastric mucosa. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 62 subjects with over 18 years of age, referred to 2 hospitals (Shahid Madani and Imam Reza hospitals) in Tabriz, Iran between October and December 2008 to undergo an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Serum levels of zinc, iron and copper were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL technique. Stepwise regression was exploited to access the relationship between apoptosis rate and <b>serum</b> zinc, <b>iron</b> and copper levels. Mean number of apoptotic (TUNEL positive) cells, <b>serum</b> zinc, <b>iron</b> and copper levels were 2. 150. 22, 111. 472. 18 (g/dl), 145. 205. 24 (g/dl) and 137. 523. 04 (g/dl) respectively.

5000|$|<b>Serum</b> <b>iron</b> levels (i.e. iron {{not part}} of the {{hemoglobin}} in red cells) may be measured directly in the blood, but these levels increase immediately with iron supplementation (the patient must stop supplements for 24 hours), and pure blood-serum iron concentration, in any case, is not as sensitive as a combination of total <b>serum</b> <b>iron,</b> along with a measure of the serum iron-binding protein levels (TIBC). The ratio of <b>serum</b> <b>iron</b> to TIBC (called iron saturation or transferrin saturation index or percent) is the most specific indicator of iron deficiency when it is sufficiently low. The iron saturation (or transferrin saturation) of < 5% almost always indicates iron deficiency, while levels from 5% to 10% make the diagnosis of iron deficiency possible but not definitive. A transferrin saturation of 12% or more (taken alone) makes the diagnosis unlikely. Normal saturations are usually slightly lower for women (>12%) than for men (>15%), but this may indicate simply an overall slightly poorer iron status for women in the [...] "normal" [...] population.|$|E

Median distance decreased from 600 m below the 6 th decade to 420 m in the 8 th decade of age. Dialysis dependence predicted 101. 5 m shorter distance in the adjusted model that explained 70 % of variability in results.

Methods: Male Wistar rats weighing 282 ± 17 g were randomly submitted to sham operation (S), FP and JP after total gastrectomy.

Results: Fourty six rats were operated and thirty survived for eight weeks. Five (33. 3 %) died after FP and 11 (52. 3 %) after JP (p 0. 05). The JP rats had a significant decrease in serum albumin, glucose, transferrin, iron, folate and calcium, compared to sham (p< 0. 05). <b>Serum</b> gastrin, <b>iron</b> and calcium were significantly higher in JP rats than in FP rats (p< 0. 05).
