The {{break-up}} song, written from Watkins' perspective, was described as [...] "scathing", and like [...] "Aimee Mann-style modern pop", with lyrics like [...] "I hope you meet someone your height <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> eye to eye/With someone as small as you". Watkins said the song wasn't written for anyone in particular, but said [...] "I had this clever line and decided to build a song around it." [...] "Jealous of the Moon", the third track, was co-written by Chris Thile and Gary Louris of Jayhawks fame. This song was released as a promotional single in the United States. The fourth track and first instrumental on Why Should the Fire Die?, [...] "Scotch & Chocolate", earned Nickel Creek a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Instrumental. However, the song lost to the trio's former record producer Alison Krauss with her band Union Station for [...] "Unionhouse Branch", from the band's twelfth album, Lonely Runs Both Ways. As with the first three songs on the album, critics responded favorably to [...] "Scotch & Chocolate". Rolling Stone considered the song to be [...] "Celtic-infused", Slant Magazine named it the best song on the album, and Stylus Magazine [...] called it a [...] "brisk, lively instrumental". The latter also said the song was [...] "every bit as physically exciting as Shooter Jennings or Big and Rich." ...|$|E

[...] On August 7, Xbox World 360 ran a story featuring information on the as yet still officially unannounced title. According to the article, the game would be [...] " [...] meets Total War", and would feature an open world environment combined with RPG and RTS elements. The article revealed the game would take place in New York City, Miami and Havana, and would once again feature extortion of business owners as a central gameplay element. It also revealed information about the crew mechanic, character classes, crime ring bonuses, and the basics of the favor system. In a press release on August 8, EA officially announced the game, which would be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and was slated for a February 2009 release.
