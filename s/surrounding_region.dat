5|$|Al-Mukhtar and his {{supporters}} viewed Ubayd Allah's death as justice {{for his role in}} the killing of Husayn at Karbala in 680. As a result of the battle, al-Mukhtar gained control over Mosul and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region,</b> and he appointed Ibn al-Ashtar governor of Mosul. The Umayyad rout posed a major setback to Abd al-Malik's plans of establishing Umayyad authority over Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Olympic Committee chose Toronto and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region</b> as the Canadian candidate. No other Canadian {{city was}} {{given a chance to}} bid in a {{domestic}} race, and thus Toronto was selected without a vote. Toronto's interest in bidding came after failing to land the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Olympics, which were held in Atlanta and Beijing respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Persians were {{alerted to}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Greeks by a boat from Histiaea, but did not at first believe it. They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning. The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the regency's {{alliance}} with Dušan was paying dividends for the Serbian ruler alone, {{as he had}} free rein to plunder and occupy all of Macedonia and Epirus. By the end of 1345, only Thessalonica, held by the Zealots, Serres and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region,</b> which remained loyal to the regency, along with Berroia, which still held out under Manuel Kantakouzenos, remained outside Serbian control.|$|E

5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and rare species of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and <b>surrounding</b> <b>region</b> face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing vehicular traffic.|$|E
5|$|Detainees {{who were}} not {{suspected}} of involvement with the Croatian armed forces were evacuated from Vukovar to other locations in Serbia and Croatia. The non-Serb population of Vukovar and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region</b> was systematically ethnically cleansed and at least 20,000 of Vukovar's inhabitants were forced to leave the town, adding to {{the tens of thousands}} already expelled from across eastern Slavonia. 2,600 people disappeared {{after the fall of the}} town, of whom around 550 are still missing. There were also incidents of war rape, for which two soldiers were later convicted.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, John Evans, then {{a former}} {{governor}} of the Colorado Territory, constructed a toll road from Evergreen to Morrison via Bear Creek canyon. The early road offered access to various mining and logging resources along the creek. This road had over twenty bridges over Bear Creek, {{most of which were}} made of wood from the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region.</b> By the late 1870s, toll roads were no longer common, and the path's maintenance responsibilities were passed to Jefferson County.|$|E
30|$|The local spatial {{autocorrelation}} analysis {{compensates for}} {{the limitation of}} the Moran’s I value not describing the pattern of spatial correlation of regional elements as a whole. This paper uses the Moran scatter plot to further examine the local spatial characteristics of the minority population density in China. The Moran scatter plot is divided into four quadrants: HH (high attribute values of a certain <b>region</b> and its <b>surrounding</b> <b>regions),</b> LH (low attribute value of a certain region and high attribute values of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>regions),</b> LL (low attribute values of a certain <b>region</b> and its <b>surrounding</b> <b>regions),</b> and HL (high attribute value of a certain region and low attribute values of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>regions).</b> Among them, quadrants HH and LL are spatially positively correlated, indicating strong homogeneity while quadrants LH and HL are negatively correlated, indicating strong heterogeneity.|$|R

The Riverina Leader, the local free community newspaper was launched in May 1979.|$|E

5|$|The South Volcanic Zone has a {{long history}} of eruptions and poses a threat to the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region.</b> Any {{volcanic}} hazard—ranging from minor ashfalls to pyroclastic flows—could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Despite its inactivity, Cerro Azul could again produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would probably be quickly organized. Teams such as the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) are prepared to effectively evacuate, assist, and rescue people threatened by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century saw the {{division}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in three steps, among the neighboring states. The Kingdom of Prussia acquired Białystok and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region</b> during the third partition. The city became the capital of the New East Prussia province in 1795. Prussia lost the territory following Napoleon Bonaparte's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition as the resultant 1807 Treaties of Tilsit awarded the area to the Russian Empire, which organized the region into the Belostok Oblast, with the city as the regional center.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and divert attention from the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. The Lithuanians sought to achieve as much protection for Vilnius as possible. The agreement resulted in a ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to Vilnius. Although neither Vilnius or the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region</b> was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians have described the agreement as allotting Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Boston's {{colleges and}} {{universities}} exert {{a significant impact on}} the regional economy. Boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from around the world, who contribute more than US$4.8billion annually to the city's economy. The area's schools are major employers and attract industries to the city and <b>surrounding</b> <b>region.</b> The city is home to a number of technology companies and is a hub for biotechnology, with the Milken Institute rating Boston as the top life sciences cluster in the country. Boston receives the highest absolute amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of Health of all cities in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became {{an important component of}} the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the <b>surrounding</b> <b>region</b> facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E
5|$|By 17 December the {{situation}} in Java had worsened, and the brigade was moved again, sent as reinforcements to assist the Indian division. They arrived at Batavia three days later. The brigade's mission was to restore law and order and disarm the Japanese military forces in the area. They were told to expect to remain in Java until relieved by units of the Royal Netherlands Army. Under the command of the 23rd Indian Infantry Division, the brigade carried out Operation Pounce, clearing the town and <b>surrounding</b> <b>region</b> of dissidents. In January 1946 they were moved to garrison Semarang.|$|E
