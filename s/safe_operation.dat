5|$|The {{accident}} investigation {{concluded that the}} crash was primarily attributable to Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' inadequate reactions to the previous incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} and aircrew response during the final flight of the aircraft. Holland's disregard for procedures governing the <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting <b>safe</b> <b>operation.</b> As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

5|$|The Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and Load Line (LL 66) {{conventions}} {{focus on}} shipboard safety issues.

25|$|Supercapacitors are {{low voltage}} components. <b>Safe</b> <b>operation</b> {{requires}} that the voltage remain within specified limits. The rated voltage UR is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously and remain within the specified temperature range. Capacitors should never be subjected to voltages continuously {{in excess of the}} rated voltage.|$|E
25|$|The rated AC voltage {{for film}} {{capacitors}} is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10nbsp&°K is the allowed limit for <b>safe</b> <b>operation.</b> Because dielectric losses increase with increasing frequency, the specified AC voltage {{has to be}} derated at higher frequencies. Datasheets for film capacitors specify special curves for derating AC voltages at higher frequencies.|$|E

Captain Lee Jeong-min (Hangul: 이정민; Hanja: 李鄭閔), aged 49, in the right seat (co-pilot position) filled the dual role of a check/instructor captain and pilot in command, responsible for the <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> of the flight.

25|$|As {{commonly}} used, 10-30 and 10-50 plugs {{required the}} frame of the appliance to be indirectly grounded via a strap connecting to the neutral blade. <b>Safe</b> <b>operation</b> relied on the neutral conductor in turn being connected to system ground at the circuit breaker or fuse box. If the neutral conductor were to break, disconnect, or develop high resistance, the appliance frame could become energized to dangerous voltages. Modern practice is to require a separate safety grounding conductor whose only purpose is to divert unsafe voltages, and which does not carry significant current during normal operation.|$|E
25|$|Ship's {{engineers}} operate, maintain, {{and repair}} engines, boilers, generators, pumps, and other machinery. Merchant marine vessels usually have four engineering officers: a chief engineer and a first, second, and third assistant engineer. On many ships, Assistant Engineers stand periodic watches, overseeing the <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> of engines and other machinery. However, most modern ships sailing today utilize Unmanned Machinery Space (UMS) automation technology, and Assistant Engineers are Dayworkers. At night and during meals and breaks, {{the engine room}} is unmanned and machinery alarms are answered by the Duty Engineer.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 2015, the Commerce and Treasury Departments took {{additional}} coordinated {{actions in}} support of the President’s Cuba policy. These actions included a rule published by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) that amended the terms of existing license exceptions that are available for Cuba, increased the number of license exception provisions that are available for Cuba, created a new Cuba licensing policy to help ensure the safety of civil aviation and the <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> of commercial passenger aircraft, and made the deemed export and deemed reexport license requirements for Cuba consistent with other sanctioned destinations.|$|E
25|$|The {{published}} {{figures show}} that both capacitor types, tantalum and aluminum, are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> for decades under normal conditions. But a great difference exists {{in the case of}} wear-out failures. Tantalum capacitors with solid electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so that the constant failure rate is least, up to the point when all capacitors fail. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, however, have a limited time of constant random failures up to that point when the wear-out failures start. This time of the constant random failure rate corresponds with the lifetime or service life of “wet” aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|E
25|$|During operation, the boiler's {{water level}} is {{constantly}} monitored, normally via a transparent tube {{referred to as}} a sight glass, or with a gauge. Maintaining a proper water level is central to the efficient and <b>safe</b> <b>operation</b> of the boiler. If the water level is too high, steam production is decreased, efficiency is lost and in extreme cases, water will be carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, if the water level gets too low, the crown (top) and/or side sheets of the firebox may become exposed. Without sufficient water to absorb the heat of combustion, the firebox sheets may soften and melt, with the possible result of high-pressure steam being ejected with tremendous force through the firebox and into the locomotive's cab. The development of the fusible plug, a device to release pressure in conditions of excessively high temperature and low water levels was intended to protect against this occurrence.|$|E
