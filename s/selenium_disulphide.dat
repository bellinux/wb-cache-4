40|$|A medium was {{developed}} for the more rapid culture of Pityrosporum ovale. [35 S]Methionine was utilized preferentially as sole sulphur source from which cysteine/cystine were synthesized. Growth was less on cysteine, negligible on cystine and nil on inorganic sulphite and sulphate. <b>Selenium</b> <b>disulphide,</b> amorphous sulphur, stable colloidal (red) selenium and selenourea were extremely toxic, entering the organism by diffusion. Tellurium and seleno-methionine entered the organism, the latter by active transport, but were not toxic for up to I week of incubation although synthesis of [75 Se]seleno-methionine was demonstrated. Selenite and metallic (black) selenium were not toxic and did not enter the organism. Possible mechanisms of toxicity are discussed...|$|E
