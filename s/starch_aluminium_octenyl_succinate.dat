The quality characteristics of obtained bread were compared to control wheat flour bread and bread containing 0. 5 % hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC).

Moreover, the addition of all chosen starches influenced the decrease in dough stability.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> starch is a stabilization-modified starch {{produced}} by esterification of native starch with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). When modified {{in this way}} the starch tends to improve its functional characteristics, can be used to tailor starch to specific food applications. Therefore, optimization of reaction conditions of <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> starch is critical for modification. The preparation of OSA starches from potato starch in an aqueous alkaline solution was investigated. The reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, OSA concentration, concentration of starch slurry, reaction time and pH, were studied and optimized, as they influence esterification. Under the optimization conditions, the degree of substitution (DS) could reach 0. 01862. The products were confirmed by the presence of the carbonxylate signal around 1558 cm- 1 in the fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. By scanning electron microscope (SEM), OSA starch granules were proved to transfer to some smaller anomalistic ellipses and had slight rough on their surfaces. X-ray diffraction showed that esterification occurred primarily in the amorphous regions and the crystalline pattern of starches did not change. The thermal characteristics of the OSA starch were studied by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA revealed that the OSA starch were thermally more stable than the native starch. The OSA starch exhibited 50 % weight loss at 320 °C, while the native starch underwent 50 % weight loss at 312 °C.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the effects of}} concurrent ball milling (BM) and octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modification on the starch microstructure and physicochemical properties (swelling, emulsifying, and rheological). Unlike normal OSA-modified starches, the BM/OSA-modified starch displayed new features such as reduced viscosity and rigidity but increased paste stability during shearing, heating and cooling, regardless of the substitution degree. More interestingly, while the physicochemical properties could be regulated by simply altering the BM treatment time, BM/OSA was more efficient and effective at modulating starch properties during the initial period (approx. 10 h), as seen by the rapid evolutions in starch structural disruption and OSA esterification.

Rice, tapioca, corn, wheat and potato starches were modified with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) at 3 % level. Structural characterization, molecular weight, starch digestibility and physical properties of starch granule stabilized emulsions were studied for modified starches. Modified potato (0. 022) and wheat (0. 018) starches had the highest and lowest degrees of OSA substitution, respectively. For all starches, amylose and amylopectin molecular mass was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower for OSA starches. OSA modification may have hydrolyzed the small amylose and amylopectin chains, or caused rearrangement of the starch molecules. Although the starch modification improved emulsification properties, botanical source showed more influence on this parameter.

40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the {{adsorption}} at emulsion droplets of potato starch, which was hydrophobically modified with <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> anhydride (OSA), a surface active macromolecule containing ultrahigh molar mass components. The {{results show that}} the substance works as an efficient emulsifier and that it can in some cases generate high surface loads (10 mg/m(2)). The results can be explained as an interplay between kinetic factors during the formation of the emulsion and the physical-chemical properties of the hydrophobically modified starch, such as the degree of substitution, molar mass, and radius. In turbulent flow fields, such as in a high-pressure homogenizer, the mass transport to the interface favors the adsorption of larger molecules as they are transported more rapidly to the interface. The larger molecules are also likely to have a higher substituent density and adsorption energy than smaller ones. This in turn is likely to give high surface loads and strengthen the effect of kinetic adsorption factors, as the large molecules will be overrepresented at the surface...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{mechanical}} degradation {{and changes in}} conformation of a branched ultrahigh molar mass biomacromolecule, hydrophobically modified starch, as caused by high-pressure homogenization. The characterization was performed with asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF) with multiangle light scattering (MALS) and refractive index detection. The starch which had been chemically modified with <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> anhydride (OSA) proved to be very large and polydisperse. Upon high-pressure homogenization, the molar mass and rms radius (r(rms)) decreased, {{and the extent of}} these changes was related to the turbulent flow conditions during homogenization. The treatment also induced an increase and scaling with size in the apparent density of the macromolecules. To further study the changes in conformation, it was necessary to calculate the hydrodynamic radii (r(h)). This can be determined numerically from the elution times in the analysis and the flow conditions in the AsFlFFF channel. The results showed that the treatment can cause a dramatic decrease in the quotient between r(rms) and r(h), suggesting major conformational changes. These results together could be interpreted as degradation and "crumpling" of the macromolecule, which would give a decrease in rrms and an increase in apparent density, together with a "fraying" of more outer parts of the macromolecule, which could give rise to the increase in r(h) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prolonged}} {{efficacy of}} antimicrobial peptides {{is important for}} {{reducing the risk of}} pathogen contamination and thus improving food safety. In this work, nisin and epsilon-poly-L-lysine (EPL) were used as the peptide models, Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O 157 :H 7 were selected as pathogen models. Phytoglycogen (PG), a dendrimer-like carbohydrate polymer from maize mutant was used to prepare phytoglycogen <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> (PG-OS), an amphiphilic, negatively charged nanoparticle to deliver antimicrobial peptides. Two types of delivery system were designed and tested: nanoparticle dispersion and nanoparticle-stabilized emulsion. The result showed that PG-OS nanoparticles were effective to prolong the efficacy of nisin against Listeria, and PG-OS-stabilized emulsion was superior to prolong the efficacies of both nisin and EPL against Listeria and E. coli, respectively. For example, PG-OS emulsion retained an effective inhibitory activity of nisin against Listeria after 50 days storage, compared with only 5 days for nisin only. In addition, PG-OS emulsion retained an effective inhibition of EPL against E. coli for over 20 days, compared with 10 days of EPL-only solution. To understand the retention of peptides with delivery systems, the adsorption and availability of peptides was also studied using other approaches. In general, this work demonstrated a novel strategy to enhance food safety and may also benefit other application areas. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of starch {{that had}} been hydrophobically modified with <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> anhydride (OSA) at the oil/water interface during emulsification was studied. The starch samples were of waxy barley origin and were varied in molar mass and degree of substitution (DS). The particle size of the emulsions was measured and the adsorbed amount of starch was determined through serum depletion. The results show that adsorption is governed by the relationship between interfacial area and OSA-starch concentration. The surface load of OSA-starch can in some cases become very high, reaching 16 mg/m(2). The emulsification occurs under nonequilibrium and turbulent flow conditions. Under these conditions kinetic factors are likely {{to play an important}} role in the adsorption process. Turbulent flow favors transport to the interface of larger molecules over small ones, which could lead to higher surface loads by causing jamming at the interface. A model that treats the adsorption as a collision between particles in turbulent flow has been used, and it shows that the adsorption time of a polymer decreases with increasing polymer radius. It also shows that the time scale of adsorption is shorter than the time scales for configurational changes of macromolecules at interfaces and that emulsion droplet-droplet collisions are of similar time scales as adsorption, which gives further indications that kinetic factors are important during adsorption. The simulation results give a reasonable explanation to why large molecules such as OSA-starch can be efficient as emulsifiers...|$|R
40|$|The food {{processing}} industry {{has focused on}} using conventional methods for food preservation. However, the recurring incidence of food borne illnesses and outbreaks due to pathogenic or spoilage organisms have called for creation of novel intervention strategies. In recent years, antimicrobial compounds from natural sources are gaining significant importance in improving food safety and security. However, antimicrobials suffer from extensive degradation when applied to complex food systems due to several specific or non-specific interactions. There is an urgent need {{for the protection of}} such antimicrobials to prolong their activity in foods. One strategy of achieving the goal is by the combination with a delivery vehicle. In this work, we explored the interaction between novel carbohydrate biomaterial and model antimicrobial compounds. In addition, we studied the protection of such antimicrobials using carbohydrate based colloidal systems. In the first part, we examine the interactions between nisin and carbohydrate based materials in non-emulsion (aqueous) and emulsion systems. Phytoglycogen <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> (PG-OS), a dendrimer-like amphiphilic material was used as the model carbohydrate nanoparticle and nisin was used as the model antimicrobial peptide. Equilibrium dialysis experiments showed that PG-OS with different degree of substitution (DS) interacts with nisin in a Langmuir monolayer adsorption pattern in both non-emulsion and emulsion systems. The monolayer adsorption capacity (Qm) increased in non-emulsion system and was significantly higher in the emulsion system. At the equivalent concentration of PG-OS (5. 0 mg/mL), and nisin (200 µg/mL), adsorbed nisin concentration in aqueous and emulsion systems were 22 and 157 µg/mL, respectively. The study demonstrated that DS of PG-OS can be used to control nisin adsorption in the non-emulsion system. In addition, the distribution of PG-OS at the droplet interface affects nisin adsorption in the emulsion system. ^ In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we studied the protection of nisin as model antimicrobial using starch <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> or starch-OS based oil-in-water emulsion system against Listeria monocytogenes. Cantaloupe juice was used as the model food system because of its significant protease concentration, which depletes nisin activity. Nisin was combined with starch-OS stabilized emulsion at 500 µg/mL initial concentration and compared with nisin solution in cantaloupe juice model. The study demonstrated that protease in cantaloupe juice was the key factor behind nisin depletion. Antimicrobial efficacy tests revealed that starch-OS stabilized emulsion can prolong nisin activity till 6 days of interaction with cantaloupe juice. In addition, equilibrium dialysis experiments demonstrated that nisin adsorption to the colloidal system was responsible for prolonged antibacterial activity. In the last part, the protection of nisin and thymol combined with starch-OS emulsion against a model Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes) and a model Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella Typhimurium) in cantaloupe juice is reported. Thymol, being a volatile essential oil component suffers from extensive loss from foods due to evaporation, therefore it needs to be protected using a delivery vehicle. In general, combinations of nisin and thymol formulations demonstrated minor collaborative effects with regards to bacterial inhibition. Delivery system combined antimicrobials demonstrated effect till 7 days of incubation with cantaloupe juice. Out of all formulations, nisin and thymol combination with emulsion demonstrated the best antibacterial efficacy for a prolonged period of time. After 7 days of incubation, it showed 2. 53 and 2. 80 log 10 CFU/mL difference against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium, respectively. Overall, this research was an attempt to understand the interaction and extend the effect of antimicrobial molecules combined with carbohydrate materials as colloidal systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{emulsifiers}} and {{interfacial technology}} are {{crucial for the}} stability of emulsions and govern the quality and value of a broad variety of foods. Conventional emulsifiers such as food-grade surfactants, modified starch, and gum arabic are widely used. However, {{there is a strong}} need for novel technologies for enhanced emulsion stability, especially for superior oxidative stability of polyunsaturated lipids. The hypothesis of this research was that, by strengthening the physical and electrostatic interfacial layer at the water-oil interface, the oxidative stability of emulsions can be significantly improved. To test this hypothesis, two novel strategies have been established. First, an amphiphilic carbohydrate nanoparticle, phytoglycogen <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> (PG-OSA), was created by modifying phytoglycogen, a food-based dendritic alpha-glucan (starch analogue). Due to its dendritic structure, PG-OSA has high molecular density in aqueous dispersion which may allow it to form a strong interfacial barrier against the permeation of pro-oxidative components. This is considered as the primary factor for the much reduced lipid oxidation observed in PG-OSA-based fish oil emulsions. Second, it was discovered that epsilon-polylysine, a GRAS-status antibacterial polypeptide {{can be used as a}} highly efficient anti-oxidative compound in emulsions. The interfacial electrostatic repelling of transition metal ions by the positively charged polylysine molecules could be the primary reason. When PG-OSA and polylysine were used together, the reduction of fish oil oxidation was the most significant, suggesting additive or synergistic effects between physical blocking and electrostatic repelling at the oil/water interface. In general, this work revealed novel and functionalities -for food-based nanoparticle emulsifiers. It was further observed that PG-OSA has a much reduced in vitro digestibility compared with its starch counterpart, suggesting its potential health benefit. Under a broader background, this work highlighted the potentials of using carbohydrate nanoparticles in food and non-food areas. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of gels of hydrophobically modified potato starch (HMPot) and high amylopectin potato starch (HAPP) were studied by small deformation oscillatory rheometry. The hydrophobic modification consisted of <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> anhydride (OSA) chains grafted {{mainly on the}} amylopectin molecules. The theological behaviour of HMPot {{was different from the}} behaviour of native potato starch and HAPP. At concentrations higher than similar to 15 %, the moduli for HMPot starch were higher than for native potato starch and HAPP. A higher level of OSA Substitution led to lower moduli values. The gel formation of HMPot was slower than the gel formation of native potato starch and HAPP. This was explained by the formation of amylose-OSA inclusion complexes and OSA-OSA hydrophobic interactions. Decreasing concentrations of HMPot in HMPot-HAPP mixtures led to reduced moduli values, and a theological behaviour resembling that of HAPP. At HMPot concentrations lower than 50 % in the HMpot-HAPP mixture, amylose or OSA seemed not to contribute to the network formation. Addition of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to HMPot reduced the moduli at lower concentrations (1 %). Further increase in SDS concentration (2 %) increased the moduli values. However, the moduli values were still lower than for pure HMPot. The decrease in the moduli when SDS was added is Suggested to be due to a replacement of OSA by SDS in the amylose-inclusion complex. The strengthening of the existing OSA-OSA hydrophobic interaction when further SDS was added, is explained by the formation of polymer-micelles. When SDS was added to native potato starch and HAPP the theological behaviour was different from that observed for HMPot starch. The moduli increased when SDS was added to native potato starch and HAPP. With increasing SDS concentration, the storage modulus (G') of native potato starch and HAPP increased to the same value. Consequently, the {{rheological properties}} of native potato starch and HAPP were suggested to be dominated by amylopectin and not by amylose. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

To design particles of small size characteristics, small dextrin (approximately 15 nm) were prepared from waxy starches (WS) by enzymatic depolymerization with ?-amylase of previous gelatinized WS granules. The small dextrin and phytoglycogen were converted to amphiphilic molecules by 3 % and 7 % <b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> anhydrate (OSA) modification. Water sorption capability and the glass transition temperature (Tg) {{were associated with the}} physical stability of OSA-dextrin, OSA-phytoglycogen, and proteins like whey protein concentrate 80 % (WPC), whey protein isolate (WPI), and ?-lactalbumin (?-L). Depolymerization of WS incremented their water sorption capability and reduced the Tg at high relative humidity (RH) environment compared to native WS. The OSA modification did not change the adverse effect of depolymerization. The moisture sorption isotherm method could not accurately predict the effect of adsorbed water on the physical characteristics of the proteins, but it was consistent regarding the effect of plasticization by water adsorption on the Tg values of OSA-polysaccharides exposed to higher than 70 % RH. The effectiveness of inexpensive encapsulating method based in self-assemble interaction of pure and combination of amphiphilic biopolymers in aqueous system was assessed using both fluorescent spectroscopy and rheological principles. Structure micelle-type formation of WPI (0. 6 g/L) and ?-lactalbumin (2. 5 g/L) was determined by fluorescence. Different types of structure are formed by OSA-polysaccharides (10 - 20 g/L). Dynamic oscillatory tests at 0. 01 Pa, 23 ?C and neutral pH (7. 0) using an analysis of the relaxation time ??? value (G?/G?*?), showed high sensitivity to type, concentration and combination of biopolymers. A distinguishable linear reduction of ??? values (slope) up to a critical frequency value can be used as indicator of structure formation. Absorbance measurements (600 nm) were congruent with OSA-polysaccharides interaction-adsorption by electrostatically precipitated proteins and with the entrapment efficiency based on precipitated protein. The ??? slope value approach demonstrates the possibility to evaluate the geometric aspect ratio of anisotropic particles formed from electrostatic precipitation of proteins alone or in combination with OSA-polysaccharides. This new rheological evaluation demonstrates the possibility to assess interactions of self-assembled amphiphilic biopolymers in aqueous solution. Electrostatic precipitation (pH= 4. 5) of protein alone or combined with OSA-polysaccharides was well-suited and it offers a safer alternative to entrap volatile and thermolabile compounds than the commonly used PLGA (poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid) ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. It {{is well known that}} where-ever combustible dusts are handled, or result as a waste product, unwanted ignitions and explosions can occur. Dust explosions present a high potential risk in the process industries. The past has shown that, in the European Union, more than 2, 000 dust / air or gas / air explosions occur each year. In Germany alone the damage of dust explosions costs more than £ 16, 000 per day. A lot of fundamental research work on dust explosion has been done for single vessels however, in reality, vessels are normally connected via pipes to other process vessels. To prevent secondary vessel explosions, and to protect interconnected vessels from the effects of explosions, further research into these complex phenomena is required. This research work concerns the investigation of dust explosion phenomena in interconnected vessels. Large scale tests were conducted in which I m' or 4. 25 m' process vessels were connected via a pipe to a realistically filled 9. 4 m' vessel. Pressure transducers were placed in the vessels and along the pipe, also photo diodes, positioned along the pipe, were used to measure the pressure development and the flame front velocity respectively. In further investigations the process vessels were connected to an open ended pipe. It was possible to estimate, {{with the aid of a}} CCD camera, the flame shape and flame length of the emerging flame jet dependent on the explosion course at the process vessel. The results have shown that, under different circumstances, dust explosion propagation from the primary process vessel through the connecting pipe which reaches the secondary silo as a flame jet, may ignite a dust / air mixture and thereby initiate a secondary dust explosion. The expected reduced explosion over-pressure of such a secondary dust explosion may be much higher than in case of a single vessel explosion. For the first time an empirical mathematical model for calculating the flame front propagation time inside a connecting pipe after a dust explosion in a connected explosion vessel has been developed. The model is validated for dust and gas explosions in different vessels, independently of whether the explosion vessels are vented or closed and for different diameters of the connecting pipe. A numerical simulation model for dust explosions in closed spherical vessels was written in a C comparable language which runs under Windows 3. 11 and Windows 95 on a standard PC. The validation of this numerical model is in good accordance with measurement results of real dust explosions. The model shows good agreement with data from explosions in closed vessels for maize <b>starch,</b> <b>aluminium</b> and magnesium dusts and propane gas.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of water in}} food structure and stability is well known, {{and the role of}} water as a plasticiser for biopolymers has been extensively studied during the last 25 years. Recently, understanding of the mechanisms of water plasticisation of glassy carbohydrate matrices at the molecular level has increased and its relevance to the rate of mass transfer has been emphasized. There appears to be a lack of such studies with food proteins, although the water factor is similarly recognised for example in protein-based edible films. Furthermore, food stability is currently evaluated on the basis of water activity and the physical state of the matrix. Therefore, it would be important to consider whether the major food polymers, starch-based carbohydrates and proteins, really act similarly with respect to water. In the present work, the role of water in system stability and biopolymer interactions was studied in two different systems: cast films with and without plasticiser and spray-dried particles with a dispersed lipid phase. Plasticisation of amylose films by glycerol and water was studied by proton NMR relaxometry. In glassy amylose the proximity of Tg did not strongly affect the amylose mobility. The second moment M 2, which is a measure of strong dipolar interactions and decreases with increasing distance between the protons contributing to it, decreased slightly with increasing water content. It was thus suggested that glassy state swelling occurred in amylose film. Swelling behaviour is probably important when mass transfer in the matrix is considered. In rubbery state, high concentration (30 %) of glycerol increased the mobility of amylose despite the phase separation that occurs in these systems already at much lower plasticiser content. The data on mobility of plasticised amylose was combined with results presented earlier on oxygen permeability of these films. Although increasing mobility generally resulted in increased permeability, conditions were found in which the plasticiser induced segmental motions in amorphous amylose without appreciable loss in oxygen barrier properties. In powder particles, the stability of embedded lipid phase was studied in traditional carbohydrate carriers, i. e. hydrolysed (maltodextrin with gum Arabic as an emulsifier) and modified (<b>octenyl</b> <b>succinate</b> derivative) starches, and in whey protein isolate. Powders with oils rich in volatile flavour or in polyunsaturated fatty acids were prepared by spray-drying and characterised by laser diffraction and scanning electron microscopy for oil distribution and by differential scanning calorimetry for their glass transition temperatures (Tg). The powders were stored under controlled conditions, and the effect of relative humidity on the rate of oxidation was studied by following the increase in peroxide value during storage. Formation of hydroperoxides is linked with oxygen transfer in the system, as it is the oxygen consuming step of the reaction. In the case of powders with embedded oil rich in volatiles, the release of limonene and carvone was studied as a function of time and temperature. The starting hypothesis of this work was that a higher water vapour sorption at higher humidity would increase oxygen permeation in the matrices and lead to an increased rate of oxidation. This was in fact found to be the case in carbohydrate matrices during storage at 20 °C, at which temperature the rate of oxidation in matrices was higher at RH 54 % than at RH 11 %. An opposite behaviour was found for bulk oil, suggesting that the effect of water in matrix-dispersed oil was due to matrix properties. At elevated temperatures, a difference was found between hydrolysed and modified starches. The stability of oil in modified starch still correlated with the proximity of Tg, whereas the hydrolysed starch completely lost its barrier properties at 50 °C, which could not be explained by the Tg of the matrix. When volatiles release was studied at elevated temperature (70 °C), little release from dry matrices was found. Intense release was found in the proximity of the glass transition temperature in all the systems. In whey protein isolate matrix, oxidation of matrix-embedded oil was retarded compared to that of bulk oil at all humidities, but followed almost the same pattern as bulk oil with respect to humidity. The rate of oxidation was high at low humidities (RH 0 % and RH 11 %), was retarded at intermediate humidities (RH 50 % and RH 75 %) and again increased at high humidity (RH 90 %), at which caking of the powder was observed as an indication of physical instability. Thus, it appeared that water did not have a similar role in the matrix formed of globular proteins as it had in a glassy carbohydrate matrix. The {{importance of}} storage conditions and matrix properties for relating oxygen transfer to the rate of oxidation was demonstrated. Furthermore, it was proposed that the high solubility of the volatiles in non-volatile triglyceride phase was the reason for the retention of limonene and carvone in the matrices at elevated temperatures...|$|R
