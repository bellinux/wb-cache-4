500|$|As of 2007, the [...] {{site of the}} South {{station is}} under redevelopment, after having sat as a {{brownfield}} site for almost 10 years. St Paul's Developments, the <b>site</b> <b>developer,</b> had often applied for planning permission to build housing and leisure facilities on the site {{over the course of}} six years, only to be refused. It was finally granted permission to begin building a £4.7 million housing estate on the site in 2007. Named Riverside Crescent, this is being constructed by Barratt and Persimmon. It will have 522 residential units, from two-bedroom flats to five-bedroom houses, as well as [...] of open space, a riverside walkway and a restaurant. A new bus link to Blaydon will improve transport links. The plans for the residential development first went on display at Stella RC Primary School on 5 October 2005. Other proposals for the site had included industrial development, which met opposition, and restoration to grassland, seen as unfeasible.|$|E
500|$|The city's goal is {{to create}} a mixed-use {{development}} with green space and affordable housing. By April 2017, a special committee had narrowed the search for a plan and <b>site</b> <b>developer</b> down to five proposals. In May 2017, the Barry administration selected a proposal called Cloud Hill by the Nashville-based Mathews Company and backed by music producer T Bone Burnett. The proposed redevelopment of the 21-acre site includes music and art space, a community center, open park space, and affordable housing. The footprint of the baseball diamond and outfield would be turned into the Great Lawn, a [...] green space accommodating amateur baseball and soccer. Renderings show the guitar scoreboard and a portion of the outfield wall intact. The plan, which awaits final approval by Metro Parks and the Metro Council, has been met with concerns by citizens and groups whom would rather see the property restored entirely to parkland and the site's history preserved. Other concerns have been raised over the lack of transparency in the city's planning process and the privatization of publicly owned land.|$|E
