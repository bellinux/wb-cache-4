25|$|Hydroalumination of alkynes may {{be either}} stereospecifically cis or trans {{depending}} on the conditions employed. When a dialkylalane such as di(isobutyl)aluminium hydride (DIBAL-H) is used, the hydrogen and aluminium delivered from the reagent end up cis in the resulting alkenylalane. This <b>stereospecificity</b> {{can be explained by}} invoking a concerted addition of the H–Al bond across the triple bond. In the transition state, partial positive charge builds up on the carbon forming a bond to hydrogen; thus, the carbon better able to stabilize a positive charge becomes attached to hydrogen in the product alkenylalane. Hydroaluminations of terminal alkynes typically produce terminal alkenylalanes as a result. Selectivity in hydroaluminations of internal alkynes is typically low, unless an electronic bias exists in the substrate (such as a phenyl ring in conjugation with the alkyne).|$|E

The latter process {{consists of an}} activation step. followed by a hydroxylation at position 2 and cleavage of the hydroxyacyl-CoA, generating formyl-CoA (precursor of formate/CO 2) and, in case of phytanic acid as substrate, pristanal (precursor of pristanic acid). The stereochemistry of the overall pathway, cofactor requirements and substrate specificity of the hydroxylase and the cleavage enzyme, which is homologous with bacterial oxalyl-CoA decarboxylases, will be discussed. With regard to beta -oxidation, peroxisomes contain different acyl-CoA oxidases, multifunctional proteins and thiolases, Based on substrate spectra and <b>stereospecificities</b> of these enzymes, a model was proposed whereby straight chain and branched compounds are degraded by separate pathways. The biochemical findings in mice lacking the D-specific multifunctional protein, however, do not fully support this model. These animals, together with the Pex 5 (-) mice, might be useful to pinpoint the pathological factors contributing to the brain abnormalities in Zellweger patients.

VHA reductase I and VHA reductase II were completely separated {{at the end of}} the DEAE-Sepharose step. The apparent molecular masses of reductase I and reductase II were estimated (by gel filtration) to be approximately 390 kDa; their denaturing molecular masses were 39 - and 40 -kDa, respectively (by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Their pI values were 6. 6 and 6. 0, respectively (as determined by isoelectric focusing), and the optimal pH values were 8. 0 and 9. 0, respectively, although both enzymes exhibited a broad optimal pH range of between 7. 5 and 9. 0.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} has been conducted to investigate the possibility that substrate channelling might occur in the bifunctional forms of enzymes carrying out C-terminal amidation, a post-translational modification essential to the biological activity of many neuropeptides. C-terminal amidation entails sequential action by peptidylglycine mono-oxygenase (PAM, EC 1. 14. 17. 3) and peptidylamidoglycolate lyase (PGL, EC 4. 3. 2. 5), with the mono-oxygenase catalysing conversion of a glycine-extended pro-peptide into the corresponding alpha-hydroxyglycine derivative, which is then converted by the lyase into amidated peptide plus glyoxylate. Since the mono-oxygenase and lyase reactions exhibit tandem reaction <b>stereospecificities,</b> channelling of the alpha-hydroxy intermediate might occur, {{as is the case}} for some other multifunctional enzymes. Selective inhibition of the mono-oxygenase domain by competitive ester inhibitors, as well as mechanism-based mono-oxygenase inactivation by the novel olefinic inhibitor 5 -acetamido- 4 -oxo- 6 -phenylhex- 2 -enoate (N-acetylphenylalanyl acrylate), has little to no effect on the kinetic parameters of the lyase domain of the AE from Xenopus laevis. Similarly, inhibition of the lyase domain by the potent dioxo inhibitor 2, 4 -dioxo- 5 -acetamido- 6 -phenylhexanoate has little effect on the activity of the monooxygenase domain in the bifunctional enzyme. A {{series of experiments}} on intermediate accumulation and conversion were also carried out, along with kinetic investigations of the reactivities of the monofunctional and bifunctional forms of PAM and PGL towards substrates and inhibitors.

30|$|The <b>stereospecificities</b> of {{the three}} Rhizobium sp. RC 1 dehalogenases were characterised further by Huyop and Cooper (2003) and Huyop et al. (2004). DehL degrades l- 2 -chloropropionate and dichloroacetate; DehD is active against d- 2 -chloropropionate and monochloroacetate; and DehE dehalogenates 2, 2 -dichloropropionate, d,l- 2 -chloropropionate, monochloroacetate, dichloroacetate, and trichloropropionate. The lactates {{produced}} from d- or l- 2 -chloropropionate by the three dehalogenases have inverted configurations (Leigh et al. 1988). All these three dehalogenases can also act on 2, 3 -dichloropropionate with 2 -hydroxy- 3 -chloropropionate being the assumed product. DehE can act on brominated substrates and does so more rapidly {{than it does to}} chlorinated substrates (Huyop et al. 2004). Huyop and colleagues assessed the specificity of DehE against mono-, di-, and tri-chloroacetates and the corresponding bromoacetates. All tested bromoacetates had greater associated specificity constants (a determinant of catalytic efficiency) than did their corresponding chloroacetates, suggesting that the brominated compounds would be the preferred DehE substrates (Huyop et al. 2004). DehL and DehD also use dibromoacetate and monobromoacetate, respectively, as substrates, although they are more active against the corresponding chlorinated substrates (Huyop and Cooper 2003). Rhizobium sp. RC 1 DehD is the most kinetically active d-specific dehalogenase found (Huyop and Cooper 2003), suggesting that it would be the best d-specific dehalogenase for industrial production of l-specific products. For example, in the industrial production of herbicides and pharmaceuticals, DehD can be used instead of the d- 2 -haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas in conjunction with a chiral feedback chemical to produce the l- 2 -chloropropionate intermediate (Taylor 1990).|$|R

40|$|Degradation of arylglycerol-β-aryl ether is {{the most}} {{important}} process in bacterial lignin catabolism. Sphingobium sp. strain SYK- 6 degrades guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether (GGE) to α-(2 -methoxyphenoxy) -β-hydroxypropiovanillone (MPHPV), and then the ether linkage of MPHPV is cleaved to generate α-glutathionyl-β-hydroxypropiovanillone (GS-HPV) and guaiacol. We have characterized three enantioselective glutathione S-transferase genes, including two genes that are involved in the ether cleavage of two enantiomers of MPHPV and one gene that is involved in the elimination of glutathione from a GS-HPV enantiomer. However, {{the first step in the}} degradation of four different GGE stereoisomers has not been characterized. In this study, three alcohol dehydrogenase genes, ligL, ligN, and ligO, which conferred GGE transformation activity in Escherichia coli, were isolated from SYK- 6 and characterized, in addition to the previously cloned ligD gene. The levels of amino acid sequence identity of the four GGE dehydrogenases, which belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, ranged from 32 % to 39 %. Each gene was expressed in E. coli, and the <b>stereospecificities</b> of the gene products with the four GGE stereoisomers were determined by using chiral high-performance liquid chromatography with recently synthesized authentic enantiopure GGE stereoisomers. LigD and LigO converted (αR,βS) -GGE and (αR,βR) -GGE into (βS) -MPHPV and (βR) -MPHPV, respectively, while LigL and LigN transformed (αS,βR) -GGE and (αS,βS) -GGE to (βR) -MPHPV and (βS) -MPHPV, respectively. Disruption of the genes indicated that ligD is essential for the degradation of (αR,βS) -GGE and (αR,βR) -GGE and that both ligL and ligN contribute to the degradation of the two other GGE stereoisomers...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{potential}} energy calculations {{have been carried}} out to determine the preferred conformations of penicillins and penicillin sulphones and their 1 -oxa- 1 -dethia and 1 -carba- 1 -dethia analogues. With the exception of 1 -oxa- 1 -dethia penicillins, all the other compounds favour C 2 and the C 3 puckered conformations of their five-membered rings. Replacement of C 2 methyl groups by hydrogen atoms as in bisnorpenicillin V or oxidation of sulphur in position 1 as in sulphones, makes the C 3 puckered form much less favourable. Addition of an amino-acyl group at the C 6 atom, however, makes the C 3 puckered form more favoured in penicillin G or V and in 1 -carba- 1 -dethia penicillins. Through the replacement of the sulphur atom at position 1 by an oxygen atom or by a -CH 2 group increases the non-planarity of the lactam peptide bond, it significantly affects the relative disposition of the C 3 carboxyl group with respect to the β-lactam ring. These conformational differences have been correlated with the biological activities of these compounds. The present study suggests that the conformation of the bicyclic ring system may be more important for initial binding with the crosslinking enzyme(s) involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan and that the mode of binding is influenced {{by the nature of the}} side-group at the C 6 atom. These studies predict, in agreement with experimental results, that the 1 -oxa- 1 -dethia penicillin nulceus is an inhibitor of penicillianses. The study also suggests that the <b>stereospecificities</b> of the crosslinking enzyme(s) and penicillinases are very similar with regard to the nature of the side-group at the 6 atom and the confirmation of the bicyclic ring system.

40|$|Polyketides are {{a diverse}} group of natural {{products}} produced in many bacteria, fungi and plants. These metabolites have diverse biological activities and several members of this group are in clinical use as antibiotics, anticancer agents, antifungals and immunosuppressants. The different polyketides are produced by polyketide synthases, which catalyze the condensation of extender units into various polyketide scaffolds. After the biosynthesis of the polyketide backbone, more versatility is created to the molecule by tailoring enzymes catalyzing for instance hydroxylations, methylations and glycosylations. Flavoprotein monooxygenases (FPMO) and short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) are two enzyme families that catalyze unusual tailoring reactions in the biosynthesis of natural products. In the experimental section, functions of homologous FPMO	 and	 SDR	 tailoring enzymes from	 five	 different angucycline	 pathways	 were studied in vitro. The results revealed how different angucyclinones are produced from a common intermediate and that FPMO JadH and SDR LanV are responsible for the divergence of jadomycins and landomycins, respectively, from other angucyclines. Structural studies of these tailoring enzymes revealed differences between homologous enzymes and enabled the use of structure-based protein engineering. Mutagenesis experiments gave important information about the enzymes behind the evolution of distinct angucycline metabolites. These experiments revealed a correlation between the substrate inhibition and bi-functionality in JadH homologue PgaE.
