25|$|In London, {{he joined}} a <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> union, the Progressive Society of Carpenters and Joiners, {{to which he was}} elected {{secretary}} in 1854, and chairman in 1858. He believed that progress could be made if all trade unions representing the building trades were united in one society, so in 1859 organised the Building Trades Conference. At the conference, the unions agreed to demand a maximum working day of nine hours from their employers. The employers refused, resulting in strike action and a lockout. Eventually the unions conceded, but due to his actions Potter became a prominent figure in the New Model Unions movement. He was regarded as a more intellectual, 'respectable' trade unionist, due in part to his smart appearance and restrained public speaking style. He was made an executive member of the London Trades Council (LTC).|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the army}} has been poorly trained; however Australia has {{recently}} made this {{the focus of the}} Enhanced Defence Partnership programme, supplying training, advisors and equipment. New Zealand is also contributing training assistance under its Mutual Assistance Programme. Equally army personnel have in the past trained with the French in New Caledonia, while US Special Forces have occasionally undertaken joint exercises in PNG. At present, however, over 90 per cent of the budget is dedicated to pay and retrenchments, and as a consequence there is little left to fund training exercises. While most soldiers are not currently formally qualified for their rank, there are determined moves to professionalise the army after the restructure is complete. Indeed, {{the army has}} an officer training academy and a <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> training capacity, which is being boosted by Australian personnel. A small number of officer candidates also undertake training at the Royal Military College – Duntroon, in Canberra. Australian procedures are followed as a matter of course, and their influence is increasing as more joint training exercises are held.|$|E

25|$|Many {{enterprises}} {{were taken}} over by the state or failed, <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> and production shops had to join cooperatives, but only a small proportion of peasant agriculture was made collective (over ten percent of the arable area) by {{the start of the war}} with Germany. Among the industrial installations dismantled and sent east were most of the Białystok textile industry factories. The results of the Soviet economic policies soon resulted in serious difficulties, as shops lacked goods, food was scarce and people were threatened by famine. Nevertheless, the conditions were better under the Soviets than in the German-run General Government. Industry was developed in Lviv and elsewhere and unemployment was officially eliminated by the spring of 1940. The living standards, following the initial collapse, kept gradually improving, many services were free or inexpensive and the poor and people with technical education fared better than under the Polish rule. The cities, of which Lviv and Białystok were particularly well-maintained by the Soviet authorities, were in much better shape than the countryside. The situation was very difficult for the Polish retirees, deprived of their pensions, and for the tens of thousands of war refugees who fled German-occupied Poland and settled in the eastern cities.|$|E

After walking about aimlessly for a short time, as if to see whether he was watched, he had proceeded some distance along the quay, and had then gone into a large house used as a tavern and sailors' boardinghouse, but which did but a <b>small</b> <b>trade,</b> the landlord having a bad name in the place.|$|E

Dame Ursley maintained her intercourse with this superior rank of customers, partly by driving a <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> in perfumes, essences, pomades, head-gears from France, dishes or ornaments from China, then already beginning to be fashionable; not to mention drugs of various descriptions, chiefly {{for the use of the}} ladies, and partly by other services, more or less connected with the esoteric branches of her profession heretofore alluded to.|$|E
60|$|In {{the long}} period of three and a-half centuries which had elapsed between the Jutish conquest of Kent and the {{establishment}} of the West Saxon over-lordship, the politics of Britain had been wholly insular. The island had been brought back by Augustine and his successors into ecclesiastical, commercial, and literary union with the continent: but no foreign war or invasion had ever broken the monotony of murdering the Welsh and harrying the surrounding English. The isolation of England was complete. Ship-building was almost an obsolete art: and the <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> which still centred in London seems to have been mainly carried on in Frisian bottoms; for the Low Dutch of the continent still retained the seafaring habits which those of England had forgotten. But a new enemy was now beginning to appear in northern Europe–the Scandinavians. The history of the great wicking movement forms the subject of a separate volume in this series: but {{the manner in which the}} English met it will demand a brief treatment here. Some outline of the bare facts, however, must first be premised.|$|E

60|$|Cold and {{uncertain}} {{as the weather}} is, {{there is still a}} great deal of <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> carried on in the open air. Women and men sit in the streets with a stock of combs and such small things to sell, the women knitting as if they sat by a fireside. Cheap crockery is laid out in the street, so far out that without any great deviation from the regular carriage-track a wheel might pass straight through it. Stalls of apples are innumerable, but the apples are not fit for a pig. In some streets herrings are very abundant, laid out on boards. Coals seem to be for sale by the wheelbarrowful. Here and there you see children with some small article for sale,--as, for instance, a girl with two linen caps. A somewhat overladen cart of coal was passing along and some small quantity of the coal fell off; no sooner had the wheels passed than several women and children gathered to the spot, like hens and chickens round a handful of corn, and picked it up in their aprons. We have nothing similar to these street-women in our country.|$|E
60|$|The artizan class, {{such as it}} was, {{must have}} been {{attached}} to the houses of the chieftains, probably in a servile position. Pottery was manufactured of excellent but simple patterns. Metal work was, of course, thoroughly understood, and the Anglo-Saxon swords and knives discovered in barrows are of good construction. Every chief had also his minstrel, who sang the short and jerky Anglo-Saxon songs {{to the accompaniment of}} a harp. The dead were burnt and their ashes placed in tumuli in the north: the southern tribes buried their warriors in full military dress, and from their tombs much of the little knowledge which we possess as to their habits is derived. Thence have been taken their swords, a yard long, with ornamental hilt and double-cutting edge, often covered by runic inscriptions; their small girdle knives; their long spears; and their round, leather-faced, wooden shields. The jewellery is of gold, enriched with coloured enamel, pearl, or sliced garnet. Buckles, rings, bracelets, hairpins, necklaces, scissors, and toilet requisites were also buried with the dead. Glass drinking-cups which occur amongst the tombs, were probably imported from the continent to Kent or London; and some <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> certainly existed with the Roman world, as we learn from Bæda.|$|E
6000|$|In the [...] "Journals of the Irish House of Commons" [...] (vol. ii., p. 77) [...] is {{the record}} of a {{petition}} presented in the year 1695, by the [...] Protestant porters {{of the city of}} Dublin, against one Darby Ryan, [...] "a papist and notoriously disaffected." [...] This Ryan was complained of [...] for employing those of his own persuasion and affection to carry a [...] cargo of coals he had bought, to his own customers. The petitioners [...] complained that they, Protestants, were [...] "debased and hindered from [...] their <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> and gains." [...] Another set of petitioners was the [...] drivers of hackney coaches. They complained that, [...] "before the late [...] trouble, they got a livelihood by driving coaches in and about the [...] city of Dublin, but since that time, so many papists had got [...] coaches, and drove them with such ordinary horses, that the [...] petitioners could hardly get bread.... They therefore prayed the [...] house that none but Protestant hackney-coachmen may have liberty to [...] keep and drive hackney-coaches."

40|$|The stealth trading {{hypothesis}} {{asserts that}} cumulative price changes {{are due to}} medium size trades. Using data for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a pure order-driven market, we find evidence to support this hypothesis. This result {{is consistent with previous}} research on a hybrid market, the NYSE. However, we also find that <b>small</b> <b>trades</b> contribute significantly to cumulative price changes. Our analysis suggests that combining positive and negative price changes can obscure the effect of trade size on cumulative price change. By separately considering positive and negative price changes we demonstrate that <b>small</b> <b>trades</b> make the largest contribution to price change. Therefore, in an order-driven market stealth traders appear to use <b>smaller</b> <b>trades.</b> We also find that larger trades explain a greater portion of the cumulative price change on high volatility days. This demonstrates that stealth trading is more difficult when volatility is high, therefore forcing informed traders to trade more quickly using larger trades. 2 I...|$|R

He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a <b>small</b> <b>trade</b> in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest." ...|$|E
