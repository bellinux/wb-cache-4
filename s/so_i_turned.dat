25|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{around and}} there's this {{beautiful}} Indian woman walking up; a Native American. She said 'Are you Glen Keane? The animator that's {{going to do}} Pocahontas?' I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, {{and this is my}} sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind – I could see her.|$|E
500|$|On 8 July 2009, Xinhua {{released}} {{an interview with}} Huang Cuilian, the [...] "Han girl" [...] whose alleged rape triggered the disturbances. The 19-year-old trainee from rural Guangdong, who had worked at the factory less than two months, said: [...] "I was lost and entered the wrong dormitory and screamed when I saw those Uyghur young men in the room... I just felt they were unfriendly <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> and ran." [...] She recounted how one of them stood up and stamped his feet as if to chase her. [...] "I later {{realized that he was}} just making fun of me." [...] She said she only found out hours later that she was the cause of the violence.|$|E
500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> around." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> tory for the nonce, And {{think the}} radical a bore, Who cannot see, thick-witted dunce, That {{what was good}} for people once Must be as good forevermore.|$|R
6000|$|... "I take note--I take note," [...] {{said the}} Doctor. [...] "But having done <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to our {{category}} again. Even with that solemn vow on your lips, {{you take your}} place in it. There is nothing against you but an accident, if you will; but with my thirty years' medical practice, I have seen that accidents may have far-reaching consequences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed not. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> and turn. Can {{you imagine}} what Lord Mountclere is coming for? But don't say what you think. Before I reply to this letter we must go into new lodgings, to give them as our address. The first {{business}} to-morrow morning will be {{to look for the}} gayest house we can find; and Captain Flower and this little cabin of his must be things we have never known.' ...|$|R
500|$|Arular {{takes its}} title from the {{political}} code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam, during his involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers; she contends that her father's [...] "revolutionary ideals" [...] are the album's thematic base. [...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> it around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same time I {{thought it would be a}} good way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As I {{read the}} utopian socialists, the {{scientific}} socialists, the German Social Democrats and revolutionary socialists—whatever I could in either English or French—I {{came to the}} conclusion that almost all of them, including my grandfather, were engaged in an effort to change human nature. The more I thought about it, the more I thought this was not likely to be a successful effort. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my attention more and more to political philosophy and less and less to socialist activism of any kind." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{and passed}} beneath the great arch {{into the city}} of London.|$|E
6000|$|... "There he was, and I hadn't {{thought of}} {{anything}} to say to him; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>turn</b> round. The moonlight was brighter than many a day I could remember in the North Sea.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> saying, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> the despatch-box {{upside down}} upon the table. At sight of the heap of bank paper and gold that lay {{in front of us}} between the candles, or rolled upon the floor alongside, I stood astonished.|$|R
5000|$|Ettore's two {{brothers}} {{left the country}} and advised him to do the same, but {{he was reluctant to}} leave the country, hoping that the Duce would alter his views. He wrote an anguished letter to Mussolini, expressing his pain: [...] "Was it all a dream we nurtured? I can’t believe it. I cannot consider changing religion, because this would be a betrayal - and we are fascists. And <b>so?</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to You - DUCE - so that in this period, so important for our revolution, you do not exclude that healthy Italian part from the destiny of our Nation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--then stopped. 'Here,' I said, 'is {{an outcast}} like myself. This {{is the man}} for me.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> back and came to you--you. And--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The fact is,' said Tom, 'that I thought {{more would}} {{be gained by}} staying at home, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my travels into a {{binocular}} tube,' &C.|$|E
60|$|I {{am always}} anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to him quickly, {{and asked him}} {{what it was that}} {{disturbed}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Dick, [...] "my {{impression}} is that he didn't mean to start at all, and wouldn't have done <b>so</b> if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>turned</b> him out." ...|$|R
5000|$|When asked, in an {{interview}} with the b3ta website, [...] "In the event of the end of the world, what would be the last thing you'd do before death?" [...] Lunn answered: [...] "I'm constantly being told at the end <b>I</b> would <b>turn</b> to God. <b>I</b> always point out it was your God that made me an atheist. I have been teetotal for fifteen years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> would <b>turn</b> to drink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{turn the}} gas {{on to the}} kitchens," [...] said Cokey. [...] "If <b>so</b> be <b>I</b> didn't <b>turn</b> her on, yeou young gen'lemen 'ud be larnin' your book by candlelight." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the gates}} of this Chapel were shut, [...] And ‘Thou shalt not’ writ over the door; <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to the Garden of Love [...] That so many sweet flowers bore.|$|E
60|$|When {{the prow}} {{of the first}} craft touched {{the side of the}} Sari it {{contained}} only dead and dying men. The other two dugouts were approaching rapidly, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my attention toward them.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the gates}} of this Chapel were shut [...] And [...] "Thou shalt not," [...] writ over the door; [...] <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to the Garden of Love [...] That so many sweet flowers bore.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> saying <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{and rode}} off. We went direct to the {{authorities}} above-mentioned, told who we were and what we had done, guided a party of men {{to the scene of}} the intended murder; and then, while the stars were beginning to twinkle in the darkening sky, returned to see what was going on in the little cottage on the hill at Sunny Creek.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; I can't {{say that}} I shall be shot if it be not so; {{but if it}} be not so, {{if you do not}} agree that it shall be <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> shall be <b>turned</b> out of Greshamsbury." ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR BRO,--What I wanted of the [...] "Liar" [...] Sketch, {{was to work}} it {{into the}} California book--which I shall do. But day before {{yesterday}} I concluded {{to go out of}} the Galaxy on the strength of it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>turned</b> it into the last Memoranda I shall ever write, and published it as a [...] "specimen chapter" [...] of my forthcoming book.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my {{shoulder}} {{to her and}} stood waiting, Fra Gervasio beside me, clenching {{his hands in his}} impotence and mute despair. And then an approaching clank of mail heralded the coming of the captain.|$|E
60|$|He {{held out}} his hand and clasped mine for a moment. I would have spoken, but before I could find words he had {{disappeared}} through a curtained door into his inner apartment. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> away and went.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not want}} Dick to think me overinquisitive, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> the talk into other channels. It {{appeared}} that Miss Sampson had not left any instructions for me, so I was glad to go with Dick to supper, which {{we had in the}} kitchen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can stand}} it," [...] he muttered grimly. [...] "Margaret must be married, {{and it is}} my fortune, and hers, that you are here. I had little hopes of Four Eyes. McCan was <b>so</b> hopeless <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> him over to a squaw who had lighted her fire twenty seasons. If it hadn't been you, it would have been an Indian. Libash might have become the father of my grandchildren." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I know that, I know that. Well, now we {{understand}} each other, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> must be <b>turning</b> home. Thank {{you so much}} for having been quite candid with me. Good morning, Miss Layard; remember me to Stephen." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{softened}} voice {{announced that}} he was subdued; <b>so</b> <b>I,</b> in my <b>turn,</b> became calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but I would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.|$|R
60|$|Unluckily, {{in spite}} of my having proved the truth of the dervish's words in so many instances, I was firmly {{convinced}} that he was now keeping concealed from me some hidden and precious virtue of the ointment. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> a deaf ear to all he said.|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, {{so unlike}} my usual self {{that it seemed}} almost {{the image of a}} stranger. [...] "Jane!" [...] called a voice, and I hastened down. I was {{received}} {{at the foot of the}} stairs by Mr. Rochester.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> and beckoned to my captains, and Kari beckoned to his. They came, and in {{the hearing}} of all, very clearly and quietly as was his fashion, he {{repeated}} every word that he had said to me, adding to them others of like meaning. While he spoke I thought, not listening over-much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come by it!" [...] he exclaimed; [...] "ye {{could come}} by twice the sum, av ye liked. Sure, didn't I {{find that they}} wos chargin' tshoo dollars--aiqual to eight shillin's, I'm towld--for carryin' a box or portmanter the length o' me fut; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>turns</b> porter all at wance, an' faix I made six dollars in less nor an hour. But as I was comin' back, I says to myself, says I, `Larry, ye'll be the better of a small glass o' somethin'--eh!' <b>So</b> in <b>I</b> goes to a grog-shop, and faix I had to pay half-a-dollar for a thimbleful o' brandy, bad luck to them, as would turn the stomik o' a pig. I almost had a round wi' the landlord; but they towld me it wos the same iverywhere. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> wint and had another in the nixt shop I sees, jist to try; and it was thrue. Then a Yankee spies my knife,--the great pig-sticker that Bob Short swopped wi' me for my junk o' plum-duff off the Cape. It seems they've run out o' sich {{articles}} just at this time, and would give handfuls o' goold for wan. <b>So</b> says <b>I,</b> `Wot'll ye give?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So,</b> <b>I</b> neither <b>turned</b> {{aside from}} the {{straight}} direction, nor hurried my steps, nor looked back any more. At the time I had resolved on, I left London for Cornwall, without making any attempt to conceal my departure. And though I knew that he must surely be following me, still I never saw him again: never discovered how close or how far off he was on my track.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mrs. Pennel, I am {{come here}} for a good sit-down by your kitchen-fire, this evening," [...] said Mr. Sewell. [...] "Emily has gone out to sit with old Mrs. Broad, who is laid up with the rheumatism, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> am <b>turned</b> loose {{to pick up my}} living on the parish, and you must give me a seat for a while in your kitchen corner. Best rooms are always cold." ...|$|R
