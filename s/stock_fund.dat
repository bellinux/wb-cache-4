40|$|This paper studies {{mutual fund}} investors' asset {{allocation}} decisions using monthly flow data of U. S mutual fund industry from 1984 to 1998. We find that mutual fund investors change their asset allocations between {{stocks and bonds}} in reaction to business conditions tracked by changes in expected stock market returns. They tend to allocate less into <b>stock</b> <b>funds</b> during the trough of a business cycle when expected stock market returns are higher and to allocate more into <b>stock</b> <b>funds</b> during the peak of a business cycle when expected returns are lower. We also find that variables that capture the changes of real macroeconomic activities have strong impact on mutual fund investors' asset allocations between stocks and bonds. During expansions of the economy, they tend to invest more into <b>stock</b> <b>funds</b> than into bond funds. During recessions of the economy, they tend to invest less into <b>stock</b> <b>funds.</b> Mutual fund investors' economic trend chasing behavior and their negative reaction {{to changes in the}} future expected stock market returns provide some evidence that they are irrational and could play a destabilizing role in the financial markets. ...|$|R

5000|$|Notable {{issues that}} Schweizer {{addresses}} {{in the work}} are Noam Chomsky's acceptance of money from prominent institutions whose policies he opposes (such as the Pentagon), living in an expensive home, and his visitation of socialist states such as Cuba. Chomsky considers himself an anarchist, not a liberal. Schweizer, {{in the rest of}} the work, makes similarly-toned accusations against individuals the book focuses on, particularly surrounding political issues such as environmentalism, labor, and taxation. After the book's publication, Chomsky talked to Schweizer about his creation of a trust fund for his daughters and grandchildren. In Schweizer's follow up discussion with Chomsky, Schweizer reveals that even though Chomsky abhors corporations and refers to them as [...] "fascist", Chomsky's own retirement fund is invested in large capitalization NYSE companies and the TIAA-CREF <b>stock</b> <b>fund.</b> Schweizer points out: A look at the <b>stock</b> <b>fund</b> portfolio quickly reveals that it invests in all sorts of businesses that Chomsky says he finds abhorrent: oil companies, military contractors, pharmaceuticals, you name it.|$|E

50|$|Expense ratios are {{important}} to consider when choosing a fund, as they can significantly affect returns.

50|$|Using {{the concept}} of asset allocation, {{researchers}} divide active management into two parts; one part is selecting securities within an asset class, while the other part is selecting between asset classes. For example, a large-cap U.S. <b>stock</b> <b>fund</b> might decide which large-cap U.S. stocks {{to include in the}} fund. Then those stocks will do better or worse than the class in general. Another fund may choose to move money between bonds and stocks, or some country versus a different one, et cetera. Then one class will do worse or better than the other class.|$|E
50|$|A <b>stock</b> <b>fund</b> or {{equity fund}} is {{a fund that}} invests in stocks, also called equity securities. Stock funds can be contrasted with bond funds and money funds.

This may be a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund.
