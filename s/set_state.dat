Observer status was granted in 2010, when Slovakia signed the General Agreement on Cooperation in which information about ongoing education programmes was shared and Slovakia was invited to various negotiations of the ESA. In 2015, Slovakia signed the European Cooperating State Agreement based on which Slovakia committed to the finance entrance programme named PECS (Plan for the Euroepan Cooperating States) which serves as preparation for full membership. Slovak research and development organizations can apply for funding of projects regarding space technologies advancement. Full membership of Slovakia in the ESA is expected in 2020 after signing the ESA Convention. Slovakia will be obliged to <b>set</b> <b>state</b> budget inclusive ESA funding.|$|E
25|$|Paul Dryden Warfield {{was born}} in Warren, Ohio. His father, Dryden Warfield, was a deacon in a Baptist church. Warfield {{attended}} Warren G. Harding High School in Warren, {{where he was a}} star running back and defensive back for the Panthers. He scored 92 points as a junior in 1958, a campaign highlighted by a 6–0 victory over powerhouse Massillon Washington High School. The following season, as a senior he scored 93 points, including all three of his team's touchdowns in the final game of the season. As a basketball player he was noted for his speed, often leading fast breaks. He also ran track and field at Warren G. Harding, and was the state broad jump champion in 1957. He <b>set</b> <b>state</b> records in the broad jump, 100-yard dash, and 180-yard hurdles.|$|E

[...] He won both hurdles and the long jump at the 1947 CIF California State Meet. [...] After graduating, he attended Compton Junior College (now El Camino College Compton Center), where he was a standout on Compton's undefeated football team in 1948 that won the Junior Rose Bowl. That year, he had a 105-yard kickoff return touchdown in a game played at the University of Mexico. Already being considered one of the best players in football, McElhenny drew high praise; Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon remarked he had [...] "never seen such a combination of speed and size." [...] One of his Compton teammates was 1952 Olympic gold medalist Sim Iness.|$|E

2500|$|ThumbEE (erroneously called Thumb-2EE in some ARM documentation), {{marketed as}} [...] (Runtime Compilation Target), was {{announced}} in 2005, first appearing in the Cortex-A8 processor. ThumbEE is a fourth instruction <b>set</b> <b>state,</b> making small changes to the Thumb-2 extended instruction set. These changes make the instruction set particularly suited to code generated at runtime (e.g. by JIT compilation) in managed Execution Environments. ThumbEE is a target for languages such as Java, C#, Perl, and Python, and allows JIT compilers to output smaller compiled code without impacting performance.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{systematic}} study of properties of the quantum entropy and of the Holevo capacity considered {{as a function of}} a <b>set</b> of quantum <b>states.</b> The properties of restriction of the quantum entropy to arbitrary <b>set</b> of <b>states</b> are discussed. For some types of sets necessary and sufficient conditions of boundedness and of continuity of restriction of the quantum entropy as well as necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of the Gibbs state are obtained. The Holevo capacity of an arbitrary <b>set</b> of <b>states</b> and its general properties as a function of a set are considered. The notion of the optimal average state of an arbitrary <b>set</b> of <b>states</b> with finite Holevo capacity is introduced. The condition of existence of optimal measure for a <b>set</b> of <b>states</b> is obtained. The general results concerning the quantum entropy and the Holevo capacity are illustrated by considering the several examples of <b>sets</b> of <b>states.</b> Comment: 79 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

In this paper, we further improve on this scheme by augmenting the <b>set</b> of <b>state</b> variables with auxiliary state variables. These auxiliary state variables are added to capture some important internal conditions in the combinational logic. Approximate symbolic forward reachability onoverlapping subsets of this augmented <b>set</b> of <b>state</b> variables yields much tighter approximations than earlier methods. ...|$|R
