Visual accessories of interest include, for example, binoculars, <b>stereomicroscopes,</b> and binocular periscopes. It is the nature of these magnifying optical devices that the transverse (normal) magnification and longitudinal (depth-wise) magnification are different. That is why an object viewed through magnifying optical devices looks different from the same object viewed with the naked eye from a closer distance − the object looks &quot;squashed &quot; (foreshortened) through telescopic instruments and the opposite through microscopic instruments. We rigorously describe the quantitative relationships that must exist when presenting a scene on a screen that stereoscopically simulates viewing through these visual accessories...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of liver and intestinal fluke infections was surveyed on residents of Savannakhet Province, Laos. Fecal specimens {{were collected from}} a total of 981 residents in 4 Mekong riverside villages and examined by the Kato-Katz thick smear technique. The results revealed that the overall helminth egg positive rate was 84. 2 %, and the positive rate for small trematode eggs, including Opisthorchis viverrini, heterophyids, or lecithodendriids, was 67. 1 %. To obtain adult flukes, 38 small trematode egg positive cases were treated with a 20 - 30 mg/kg single dose of praziquantel and purged. Diarrheic stools were then collected from 29 people and searched for helminth parasites using <b>stereomicroscopes.</b> Mixed infections with O. viverrini and 6 kinds of intestinal flukes were found, namely, Haplorchis taichui, Haplorchis pumilio, Haplorchis yokogawai, Prosthodendrium molenkampi, Phaneropsolus bonnei, and echinostomes. The total number of flukes collected was 7, 693 specimens (av. no. per treated person; 265. 3). The most common species was O. viverrini, followed by H. taichui, P. molenkampi, echinostomes, H. pumilio, P. bonnei, and H. yokogawai.

50|$|The company, Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics'), {{was formed}} in 1917 with the merger of three Japanese optical {{manufacturers}} to produce precision optical glass. In 1925 the brand expanded to produce the first microscope with a revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives - the Joico microscope. Over {{the next few decades}} the microscopy division progressed considerably with the introduction of groundbreaking polarising and <b>stereomicroscopes</b> in addition to metrology products for measuring and inspection. Nikon launched the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes in the 1970s and established the CF Optical system. The 1980s saw more than 80 new products, including the inverted Diaphot microscope, which was at the forefront of IVF techniques. The introduction of the Eclipse range of infinity optics in the 1990s was a radical departure from traditional microscope design. This in-house expertise in optical technologies has been instrumental in differentiating Nikon from its competitors. CFI60 optics offer advantages for both industrial and biological applications as lenses generally have higher numerical apertures (N.A.s) and longer working distances than comparable lenses and provide increased resolution, greater light-gathering capability and high performance in confocal imaging. The infinity optical system also has the benefit that the distance between the objective and the eyepiece tube is not fixed, allowing a variety of imaging modules to be inserted into the light path without any compromise in optical quality. This has allowed microscopes to be transformed into versatile imaging workstations that provide users with instant access to several imaging methods. Using a Nikon Diaphot microscope, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell. Nikon's photographic capability has extended to a series of digital camera systems optimized for microscopy-based applications enabling the digital transfer of images.|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{number of}} studies on {{reproduction}} have mentioned Origanum Vulgare extract’s ability to reduce mortality rates and improve fertility rates. However, other {{studies have suggested that}} it is possible to use Origanum Vulgare extract to induce abortion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different doses of Origanum Vulgare on embryo survival and macroscopic abnormalities in mice. Methods: In this study, 24 mice Balb/c female weighting approximately 25 - 30 g were divided into 4 groups. Origanum Vulgare extract was prepared; different concentrations (2. 5, 12. 5, and 25 mg in 0. 25 ml distilled water) were administered, by oral gavage, to three experimental groups of mice between day 6 (starting gastrulation) until day 15 of pregnancy (end of organogenesis). The control group consisted of six mice that received 0. 25 ml of distilled water daily. On day 16 of study, pregnant mice were anesthetized by chloroform and fetuses were removed and stained with Alcian Blue, Alizarin Red s and microwave irradiation. Morphological and skeletal abnormalities were investigated by light and <b>stereomicroscopes.</b> Results: The results of this study showed that high doses of the Origanum Vulgare extract significantly decreased the mean number of embryos (10  0. 5, P> 0. 05), mean number of live embryos (7  0. 5, P> 0. 05) in each mouse and resulted in significant reduction in mean weight(1184  8 mg, P> 0. 05) and crown-rump length(11. 9  0. 23 mm, P> 0. 05) and the overall size of fetuses compared to control group, whereas there was no significant difference between the groups receiving low dose of Origanum Vulgare extract with control group. In addition, under the effect of the Origanum Vulgare extract the subcutaneous bleeding seemed (2  0. 1, P> 0. 05) significantly more frequent compared to the control group. Conclusion: Origanum Vulgare extract did not have any positive effect on fetal development; and high dosages led to an increased incidence rate of abortion and fetal malformations in the fetuses of women who received it...|$|R

50|$|Mycoplasmas, {{are among}} the {{smallest}} self-replicating organisms, are parasitic species that lack a cell wall and periplasmic space, have reduced genomes, and limited metabolic activity. Mycoplasma pneumoniae cells have an elongated shape that is approximately 0.1-0.2 µm (100-200 nm) in width and 1-2 µm (1000-2000 nm) in length. The extremely small cell size means they are incapable of being examined by light microscopy; a <b>stereomicroscope</b> is required for viewing the morphology of M. pneumoniae colonies, which are usually less than 100 µm in length. The inability to synthesize a peptidoglycan cell wall {{is due to the}} absence of genes encoding its formation and results in an increased importance in maintenance of osmotic stability to avoid desiccation. The lack of a cell wall also calls for increased support of the cell membrane(reinforced with sterols), which includes a rigid cytoskeleton composed of an intricate protein network and, potentially, an extracellular capsule to facilitate adherence to the host cell. M. pneumoniae are the only bacterial cells that possess cholesterol in their cell membrane (obtained from the host) and possess more genes that encode for membrane lipoprotein variations than other mycoplasmas, which are thought to be associated with its parasitic lifestyle. M. pneumoniae cells also possess an attachment organelle, which is used in the gliding motility of the organism by an unknown mechanism.|$|E
