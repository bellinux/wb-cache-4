60|$|It is an observation, indeed, of my own, but I {{believe it}} will hold true almost in all the chief trading towns in England, {{that there are more}} tradesmen undone by having too much trade, than for want of trade. Over-trading is among tradesmen as over-lifting is among strong men: such people, vain of the <b>strengh,</b> and their pride {{prompting}} them to put it to the utmost trial, at last lift at something too heavy for them, over-strain their sinews, break some of nature's bands, and are cripples ever after.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{if you go}} to {{a garden}} to buy flowers, plants, trees, and greens, if you know what you go about, know the names of flowers, or simples, or greens; know the {{particular}} beauties of them, when they are fit to remove, and when to slip and draw, and when not; what colour is ordinary, and what rare; when a flower is rare, and when ordinary--the gardener presently talks to you as to a man of art, tells you that you are a lover of art, a friend to a florist, shows you his exotics, his green-house, and his stores; what he has set out, and what he has budded or enarched, and the like; but if he finds you have none of the terms of art, know little or nothing of the names of plants, or the nature of planting, he picks your pocket instantly, shows you a fine trimmed fuz-bush for a juniper, sells you common pinks for painted ladies, an ordinary tulip for a rarity, and the like. Thus I saw a gardener sell a gentleman a large yellow auricula, that is to say, a running away, for a curious flower, and take a great price. It seems, the gentleman was a lover of a good yellow; and it is known, that when nature in the auricula is exhausted, and has spent her <b>strengh</b> in showing a fine flower, perhaps some years upon the same root, she faints at last, and then turns into a yellow, which yellow shall be bright and pleasant the first year, and look very well to one that knows nothing of it, though another year it turns pale, and at length almost white. This the gardeners call a run flower, and this they put upon the gentleman for a rarity, only because he discovered at his coming that he knew nothing of the matter. The same gardener sold another person a root of white painted thyme for the right Marum Syriacum; and thus they do every day.|$|E

40|$|Results from {{a series}} of {{laboratory}} impacts into clay slurry targets are compared with photographs of impact craters on Mars and Ganymede. The interior and ejecta lobe morphology of rampart-type craters, as well as the progression of crater forms seen with increasing diameter on both Mars and Ganymede, are equalitatively explained by a model for impact into Bingham materials. For increasing impact energies and constant target rheology, laboratory craters exhibit a morphologic progression from bowl-shaped forms that are typical of dry planetary surfaces to craters with ejecta flow lobes and decreasing interior relief, characteristic of more volatile-rich planets. A similar sequence is seen for uniform impact energy in slurries of decreasing yield strength. The planetary progressions are explained by assuming that volatile-rich or icy planetary surfaces behave locally {{in the same way as}} Bingham materials and produce ejecta slurries with yield <b>strenghs</b> and viscosities comparable to terrestrial debris flows. Hypothetical impact into Mars and Ganymede are compared, and it is concluded that less ejecta would be produced on Ganymede owing to its lower gravitational acceleration, surface temperature, and density of surface materials...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory for {{interlayer}} pairing of chiral electrons in graphene materials {{which results in}} an unconventional superconducting (S) state with s-wave spin-triplet order parameter. In a pure bilayer graphene, this superconductivity exhibits a gapless property with an exotic effect of temperature-induced condensation causing an increase of the pairing amplitude (PA) with increasing temperature. We find that a finite doping opens {{a gap in the}} excitation spectrum and weakens this anomalous temperature-dependence. We further explore the possibility of realizing variety of pairing patterns with different topologies of the Fermi surface, by tuning the difference in the doping of the two layers. In trillayer graphene, the interlayer superconductivity is characterized by a two components order parameter which can be used to define two distinct phases in which only one of the components is non vanishing. For ABA stacking the stable state is determined by a competition between these two phases. By varying the relative amplitude of the corresponding coupling <b>strenghes,</b> a first order phase transition can occur between these two phases. For ABC stacking, we find that the two phases coexist with a possibility of a similar phase transition which turns out to be second order. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{geometrical}} {{frustration in}} low-dimensional charge ordering systems are theoretically studied, mainly focusing on dynamical properties. We treat extended Hubbard models at quarter-filling, where the frustration arises from competing charge ordered patterns favored by different intersite Coulomb interactions, which are effective models for various charge transfer-type molecular conductors and transition metal oxides. Two different lattice structures are considered: (a) one-dimensional chain with intersite Coulomb interaction of nearest neighbor V_ 1 {{and that of}} next-nearest neighbor V_ 2, and (b) two-dimensional square lattice with V_ 1 along the squares and V_ 2 along one of the diagonals. From previous studies, charge ordered insulating states {{are known to be}} unstable in the frustrated region, i. e., V_ 1 ≃ 2 V_ 2 for case (a) and V_ 1 ≃ V_ 2 for case (b), resulting in a robust metallic phase even when the interaction <b>strenghs</b> are strong. By applying the Lanczos exact diagonalization to finite-size clusters, we have found that fluctuations of different charge order patterns exist in the frustration-induced metallic phase, showing up as characteristic low energy modes in dynamical correlation functions. Comparison of such features between the two models are discussed, whose difference will be ascribed to the dimensionality effect. We also point out incommensurate correlation in the charge sector due to the frustration, found in one-dimensional clusters. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{focus on}} the perceptual deficits of {{children}} with learning disabilities has led edu-cators to ask whether an instructional program should be directed at a child's perceptual strengths or weaknesses. In this study, a sample of {{children with learning disabilities}} was divided into two groups, one with au-ditory perceptual strengths (audiles), the other with visual perceptual strengths (visiles). The differences between the strong and weak per-ceptual skills within each group were statisti-cally significant. Other perceptual and language {{differences between the two groups}} were not significantly different. An experimental Word Form Configuration Training Program, which directed all teaching input through the visual modality, significantly modified the visual perceptual behavior and reading achievement of the visile and not the audile children in the experimental groups. Verbal intelligence has been clearly delineated to relate to reading achievement for most populations of children, except for those with learning disabilities, who, by definition, have normal intelligence. Visual perception, one of the central information processing behaviors, has been reported to have a high positive relationship to academic achievement for learn-ing disabled children (Chalfant and Scheffelin, 1969). Visual perception is the ability to discriminate among the figural characteristics of form, which in reading means the physical properties of letters and words. Learning dis-ability was operationally defined as a year or more of perceptual deficit, normal verbal intel-ligence (IQ of 85 or above), and at least six months of academic achievement difficulty in one subject area. In this study, the subject area was limited to reading. Shea (1968) has recom-mended that children doing poorly in reading because of perceptual discrimination problems be trained extensively in the perception of letter and word form configuratons.
