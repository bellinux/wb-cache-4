40|$|Abstract—Here {{we examine}} the cause, size and future of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>carbon</b> sink. To {{estimate}} {{the size of the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>carbon</b> sink we review a comprehensive landbased analysis of the carbon sink in the coterminous U. S. For the 1980 s, the sink is between 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 PgC y – 1, and is split approximately evenly between forest and non-forest sectors. The nonforest sink is caused by fire suppression on non-forested lands, sediment burial in resevoirs, alluvium and colluvium, and agriculturual practices. The forest sink has been attributed to changes in land use and the enhancement of plant growth by CO 2 fertilization, N deposition and climate change. To estimate the relative contribution of land use and growth enhancement in forest ecosystems, we use forest inventory data from five states spanning a latitudinal gradient in the eastern U. S. Land use is the dominant factor governing the rate of carbon accumulation in forests in these states, with growth enhancement contributing far less than previously reported. The estimated fraction of aboveground net ecosystem production due to growth enhancement is 2. 0 +/ – 4. 4 %, with the remainder due to land use. To forecast the future of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>carbon</b> sink, we used the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED). We first modeled carbon sources and sinks from 1700 – 1990, and then projected patterns to 2100. Our projections indicate that the land-use portion of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>carbon</b> sink will decrease in the future, with a half-life of approximately 50 years, as U. S. ecosystems gradually equilibrate with current patterns of natural and anthropogenic disturbance...|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} several model-based tools to analyse the {{dynamics}} of the Arctic Basin between 1997 and 2006 as a linked system of land-ocean-atmosphere C exchange. The analysis estimates that terrestrial areas of the Arctic Basin lost 62. 9 Tg C yr[superscript - 1] and that the Arctic Ocean gained 94. 1 Tg C yr[superscript - 1]. Arctic lands and oceans were a net CO[subscript 2] sink of 108. 9 Tg C yr[superscript - 1], which is within the range of uncertainty in estimates from atmospheric inversions. Although both lands and oceans of the Arctic were estimated to be CO[subscript 2] sinks, the land sink diminished in strength because of increased fire disturbance compared to previous decades, while the ocean sink increased in strength because of increased biological pump activity associated with reduced sea ice cover. Terrestrial areas of the Arctic were a net source of 41. 5 Tg CH[subscript 4] yr[superscript - 1] that increased by 0. 6 Tg CH[subscript 4] yr[superscript - 1] during the decade of analysis, a magnitude that is comparable with an atmospheric inversion of CH[subscript 4]. Because the radiative forcing of the estimated CH[subscript 4] emissions is much greater than the CO[subscript 2] sink, the analysis suggests that the Arctic Basin is a substantial net source of green house gas forcing to the climate system.

40|$|Climate {{concerns}} {{linked to}} greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO), have taken {{center stage in}} the national 2 energy policy debate.

In general, the burden of a U. <b>S.</b> <b>carbon</b> tax is fairly highly concen-trated among a few industries. For these industries, the magnitude of the burden depends critically on the way the tax is designed. The costs to these industries in terms of profits and output are much lower when the tax is introduced on a destination basis (i. e., based on carbon emis-sions associated with the consumption or use of fuels) than when it is introduced on an origin basis (i. e., based on emissions associated with the production or supply of fuels).
