500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies so much that I had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E
500|$|Foley {{accepted}} {{the failure of}} the film saying, [...] "I knew it was doomed before even filming started. The day before the first shoot, I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just looked to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I remember the first time we took off our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Bouncing Back, Rivers {{described}} how she developed bulimia nervosa after the 1987 suicide of Rosenberg, {{and the subsequent}} death of her psychologist, with whom she'd developed a close friendship, of AIDS. Additionally, Rivers' relationship with her daughter had been strained at the time; according to Rivers, the confluence of events resulted in her contemplating suicide in her California home. [...] "I got the gun out, the whole thing," [...] she recalled in a 2008 interview. [...] "And [...] my dog came and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap... {{and that was a}} big turning point in my life. My little, stupid dog, a Yorkie, who I adored, literally came and sat on my lap....and literally, he saved my life. Truly saved my life." [...] Rivers eventually recovered with counseling and the support of her family.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was placed}} in solitary {{confinement}} with clothing, a pallet bed, table and armchair in [...] "the worst of all the cells", where he suffered greatly from the darkness, summer heat and [...] "millions of fleas". He was soon housed {{with a series of}} cell mates, and after five months and a personal appeal from Count Bragadin was given warm winter bedding and a monthly stipend for books and better food. During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cell mates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began to gouge through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor's chamber. Just three days before his intended escape, during a festival when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was perfectly happy where he was. In his new cell, [...] "I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> armchair like a man in a stupor; motionless as a statue, I saw that I had wasted all the efforts I had made, and I could not repent of them. I felt that I had nothing to hope for, and the only relief left to me was not to think of the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair. The {{appearance}} of his twin-brother {{in the story}} was a complication in itself. Two criminals escaped from the Assizes, instead of one! ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hammock {{and gazed}} {{out across the}} plain at this thrilling and majestic sight, and I suppose that Billali noticed it, for he brought his litter alongside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most preposterous!" [...] I exclaimed, {{and then}} {{suddenly}} realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair {{and stared at him}} in blank amazement.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood on}} one foot, as it were, as I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> rickety chair.|$|E
60|$|FAITH. I've <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{cell and}} cried all night--night after night, I have. [With a little laugh] I cried all the {{softness}} out of me.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning, as I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{office at the}} prison, setting all things in order for whoever should succeed me, Martina entered, as she had done before.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no sound}} in the room except the lapping voices of the fire, but we two listened intently, and she at least took comfort from what she heard. She {{recovered}} herself and half rose. I <b>sat</b> still <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair by the screen.|$|R
60|$|One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, {{about the}} hour {{when a man}} gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down {{in her lap and}} made a little face of disappointment.|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} {{hovering}} about between {{his hat and}} his umbrella {{for a place to}} write on. He now <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair, at my blotting- paper and inkstand, with the long walk up his head in accurate perspective before me, as I stood with my back to the fire.|$|R
60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 20th of June 1845, I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room at York Fort, musing on the probability of my being dispatched to some other part of the Company's wide dominions.|$|E

'Twas dead of the night, when I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dwelling; One glimmering lamp was expiring and low; Around, {{the dark}} tide of the tempest was swelling, Along the wild {{mountains}} night-ravens were yelling,-- They bodingly presaged destruction and woe.

6000|$|... "It is my house," [...] he said. [...] "I do {{not often}} leave it. I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{sleeping}} chamber behind"--he {{pointed to the}} silken curtains through which he had passed--"I heard your entrance and guessed with pain and regret at your mission." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{raised my}} hand. Mr. Marx whispered, [...] "Now!" [...] And the bouquet was lying at her feet. She {{picked it up}} gracefully, shot a coquettish glance up towards me, and then the curtain fell, and I <b>sat</b> back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair, feeling quite {{convinced}} that I had made an utter fool of myself.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{the quality}} of my voice gave her an intimation of unusual gravity. She looked at me {{steadily}} for a moment and <b>sat</b> down slowly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> armchair.|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> {{at dinner}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> prime, And glimpsed <b>my</b> face <b>in</b> the sideboard-glass, And started as if I {{had seen a}} crime, And prayed the ghastly show might pass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Craig!" [...] she cried. [...] "Craig! I saw {{his face}} as I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair there, talking to the Captain. I saw a man's white face--nothing else. He must have been leaning over the rail. He heard me call out and he disappeared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better {{than some}} grown-up women," [...] she said. [...] "She <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room while I dressed the other afternoon. Mrs. Leffingwell {{had sent her}} with a note about that French governess. And, by the way, she speaks French {{as though she had}} lived in Paris." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{comes to}} me that for some days, three or four, I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cell at the palace, for here I was kept because, as I learned afterwards, it was feared that if I were removed to that State prison of which I had been governor, some attempt would be made to rescue me.|$|E
60|$|Not {{having this}} {{resource}} open to me, I <b>sat</b> myself down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bedroom, to consider--if {{the matter of}} Dubourg went any further--what it was my business to do next.|$|R
60|$|I {{arrived at}} the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour's {{loitering}} about the Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always first, appeared with his key. Then I <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> shady corner, {{looking up at the}} sunlight on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking about Dora; until Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp and curly.|$|R
60|$|There came no summons from Rowchester, and I dined alone. I {{must have}} dozed over my after-dinner {{cigarette}}, for {{at first that}} soft rapping seemed {{to come to me}} from a long way off. Then I <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair with a start. My cigarette had burnt out, my coffee was cold. I had been asleep, and outside some one was knocking at my' front door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me think," [...] {{said the}} old man. [...] "For how many Christmas times running, have I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> warm place, and never had {{to come out in}} the cold night air; and have made good cheer, without being {{disturbed}} by any such uncomfortable, wretched sight as him there? Is it twenty, William?" ...|$|E
60|$|So he went, and for {{the next}} two hours or more I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> private room dictating letters to Heliodore on matters {{connected}} with the duties of my office. The work came to an end at last, and I was preparing to take my evening ride on a led mule when Martina entered the room.|$|E
60|$|But my knee {{was bothering}} me terribly. As well as I could make out, the kneecap seemed {{turned up on}} edge {{in the midst of}} the swelling. As I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bunk {{examining}} it (the six hunters were all in the steerage, smoking and talking in loud voices), Henderson took a passing glance at it.|$|E
6000|$|... "The curious thing," [...] he remarked, {{with the}} manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation, [...] "is that I didn't think--at all. I <b>sat</b> with her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> arms amidst the stones--in a sort of lethargy--stagnant.|$|R
40|$|Now the cab {{was leaving}} the {{downtown}} area and was entering the residential district. I <b>sat</b> forward <b>in</b> <b>my</b> seat {{and looked out the}} window.
