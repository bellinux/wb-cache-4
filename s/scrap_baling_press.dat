40|$|Reintroductions of {{the boll}} weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, into {{areas of the}} United States {{where it has been}} {{eradicated}} or suppressed are very expensive to mitigate. There is concern that a cotton gin in an eradication zone may serve as a site of boll weevil reintroductions when processing cotton harvested in a neighboring infested zone. Similarly, there is a question whether weevil-free areas can safely import gin products, such as cottonseed and baled lint, from infested areas without risking an introduction. Many countries require fumigation of imported U. S. cotton bales to protect against boll weevil introductions, costing the U. S. cotton industry millions of dollars annually. In previously reported experiments, we quantified the potential for boll weevils to survive passage through precleaning machinery in the gin. In this study, we quantified survival potential of boll weevils passing through the gin stand and segregating into the cottonseed, mote, or lint fractions. We also examined boll weevil survival when passed with ginned lint through a lint cleaner. We present a flow chart of experimentally determined survival potentials of boll weevils passing through the various subprocesses of the gin, from which one can calculate the risk of a live boll weevil reaching any point in the process. Our data show that there is virtually no chance of a boll weevil being segregated alive into the cottonseed or of one surviving in the lint to approach the <b>bale</b> <b>press.</b> Therefore, quarantine or fumigation of cottonseed and cotton bales to guard against boll weevil introductions is unnecessary...|$|R

40|$|Cotton is {{harvested}} as seed cotton, {{which includes}} fiber attached to seeds mixed with extraneous matter like leaves and stems. A module builder {{is used to}} compress the seed cotton into large rectangular modules that allow in-field storage until being transported to a ginning facility, where the fiber and seed are separated and cleaned. On-board module-building systems are now being used on harvesters and offer virtually continuous harvesting, without the need to transfer seed cotton to a separate module builder. With their smaller size and shape, these packages could possibly be transported more economically by loading multiple packages on a truck. However, their density is similar to traditional modules, so any transport advantage is minimal. Transportation costs could be reduced significantly by creating higher-density cotton packages at harvest. Compression of seed cotton to levels observed with module-building systems has not proven to damage cottonseed, but some {{research has shown that}} higher compression levels could cause damage. Moisture content and storage duration may also influence the effect of compression on the seed. The objective of this research was to quantify the effects of these factors, individually and in combination, on cottonseed across two cotton varieties. Humidity chambers were used to achieve desired experimental seed cotton moisture levels. A miniature <b>bale</b> <b>press</b> (16. 6 x 8. 3 x 6. 2 in.) was used to compress bales of seed cotton to different densities. Germination and seed crackage were quantified to determine the impact on the cottonseed. Data analyses indicated that compression density, moisture content, storage time and position of the sample in the bale were all significantly related to seed damage; however, cotton variety was not significantly related. Moisture was most strongly related to reduction in germination, while compression density was most strongly related to increasing crackage.

The advantage of baling tires {{is that a}} volume reduction of approximately ten (10) is achieved, and handling bales is much simpler, and therefore cheaper, than whole tire or tire shreds. The use of tire bales in highway structures, however, requires that the mechanical properties of the tire bales are known.

40|$|Sticky cotton is a {{nightmare}} for producers, {{as it is for}} the entire cotton sector. Now, a new bacteria-based biological process has been developed and patented, offering hope against this scourge. The technology is already being used in Cameroon and is expected to be extended to the cotton-growing areas of West Africa. Cotton stickiness is caused by the sugary excretion of insects onto cotton flowers. This honeydew, which clogs and damages machinery, also causes fibres to snap, rendering them useless for production. Manufacturers refuse to accept such poor quality cotton, leading to significant losses for producer countries. The new process, the result of a joint initiative between the EC and European manufacturers, involves exploiting the sugar-consuming capacities of certain lactic bacteria. At the ginning stage, before the <b>bales</b> are <b>pressed,</b> the sticky cotton is treated with a solution containing these bacteria. Within 5 to 20 days, the cotton loses its stickiness and can be processed in the normal way, with no adverse impact on either the look or the quality of the fibre. The stakes are high for African cotton growers, who are affected to varying degrees by sticky cotton, depending on the year. Too high a level of sticky cotton can seriously damage a country s image and bar it from the international market.

The potential impacts induced on the environmental components were analysed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) procedure called ‘‘WISARD” (Waste Integrated System Assessment for Recovery and Disposal). Paper recycling was the phase with the greatest influence on avoided impacts, while the collection logistics of dry residue was the phase with the greatest influence on produced impacts.

50|$|At Weybourne {{the coast}} has an unusually steep shingle beach which was {{regarded}} as vulnerable {{to the threat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588. The village was also a well-used location for smuggling items such as over-proof gin and <b>pressed</b> <b>bales</b> of tobacco. The coast between Sheringham and Weybourne was popular for landing goods because ships could anchor closer to the shore {{than anywhere else in the}} area. There was also a convenient gap in the cliffs through which goods could be easily transported. Local folklore says that the miller at the local windmill would stop the mill's sails in the form of a cross to warn the smugglers that the customs or coastguards were on to them; when the coast was clear he would set the sails going once more. On Weybourne beach there was so little cover for the waiting land party that the men were reputed to bury themselves neck-deep in the shingle until the smuggling vessel appeared on the horizon. This story perhaps stretches credulity, but the fact that it is also told of Suffolk locations adds at least a little weight. In the 1800s, William J. Bolding, the owner of Weybourne water mill and much of the inland areas at Weybourne, reputedly turned a blind eye to goods landed on the beaches bordering his property, and was rewarded with contraband left discreetly on his doorstep. In February 1837, a Lieutenant George Howes and his men from Weybourne intercepted a large gang of armed smugglers at nearby Kelling. Many shots were exchanged and the coastguards recovered five horses with carts carrying 540 gallons of brandy and around 4,000 pounds of manufactured tobacco.|$|R
