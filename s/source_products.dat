2500|$|The modern {{phenomenon}} of fan fiction {{as an expression}} of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via Star Trek fandom and their fanzines published in the 1960s. The first Star Trek fanzine, Spockanalia (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example. These fanzines were produced via offset printing and mimeography, and mailed to other fans or sold at science fiction conventions for a small fee to help recoup costs. Unlike other aspects of fandom, women dominated fan fiction authoring; 83% of Star Trek fan fiction authors were female by 1970, and 90% by 1973. One scholar states that fan fiction [...] "fill the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official <b>source</b> <b>products</b> offered on the television and movie screen." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies whether {{parallel}} traded products spark {{price competition}} in pharmaceutical markets {{and whether they}} are any cheaper than locally <b>sourced</b> <b>products.</b> We follow a game-theoretic approach and employ descriptive statistics and econometric methods to {{study the effects of}} parallel trade on competition from a theoretic and empirical perspective. The theoretic approach suggests that there is a unique Nash equilibrium, and the parallel trader sets prices at the same level as the locally <b>sourced</b> <b>product,</b> while the price of the latter remains unaffected by parallel trade. However, there may be deviations from this equilibrium in the presence of particular policies or generic competition, in which case the parallel traded product may be priced at lower levels than the locally <b>sourced</b> <b>product.</b> Empirical analysis confirms the predictions of the theory. Descriptive statistics show that there is no gap between locally sourced and parallel traded products, unless generics or policies encouraging parallel trade are present. Results of the econometric analysis show that parallel trade does not trigger price competition and that the price of the locally <b>sourced</b> <b>product</b> remains unaffected by parallel trade. Therefore, any savings for health insurance occurring as a result of parallel trade are limited...|$|R
