25|$|Without {{an actual}} comb one {{can look at}} the phase vs frequency. Without a carrier–envelope offset all {{frequencies}} are cosines. This means that all frequencies have the phase zero. The time origin is arbitrary. If a pulse comes at later times, the phase increases linearly with frequency, but still the zero-frequency phase is zero. This phase at zero frequency is the carrier–envelope offset. The <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> not only has twice the frequency, but also twice the phase. Thus for a pulse with zero offset the <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> of the low-frequency tail is in phase with the fundamental of the high-frequency tail, and otherwise it is not. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) measures how the phase increases with frequency, but it cannot determine the offset, so the name “electric field reconstruction” is a bit misleading.|$|E

25|$|Beating {{can also}} be heard between notes that are near to, but not exactly, a {{harmonic}} interval, due to some harmonic of the first note beating with a harmonic of the second note.

As well as with out-of tune notes, this can also happen with some correctly tuned equal temperament intervals, because of the differences between them and the corresponding just intonation intervals: see Harmonic series (music)#Harmonics and tuning.|$|E

25|$|If {{the voltage}} across the {{photoresistor}} does {{not exceed the}} threshold, which varies between 100 and 300 mV depending on the material, then the coefficient of nonlinear distortions has a value within 0.01%, which is almost independent of the voltage.

25|$|Wide-field multiphoton {{microscopy}} {{refers to}} an optical non-linear imaging technique tailored for ultrafast imaging in which a large area of the object is illuminated and imaged {{without the need for}} scanning. High intensities are required to induce non-linear optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence or <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> generation. In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light, and the image is obtained by stage- or beam-scanning the sample. In wide-field multiphoton microscopy the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified pulsed laser source to attain a large field of view (~100µm). The image in this case is obtained as a single frame with a CCD without the need of scanning, making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the object of interest. With wide-field multiphoton microscopy the frame rate can be increased up to a 1000-fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy.|$|E

Working in this laboratory allowed the young chemist Sister to begin her research with new polarographic methods. In order to carry out analysis of organic compounds by the means of alternating-current (ac) polarography Yulia built with her own hands a polarograph and received the first polarograms. Sister was the first in Moldova (with Y. S. Lyalikov), who applied the methods of ac polarography and <b>second</b> <b>harmonic</b> ac polarography for analyzing organic compounds. Then, together with the physicist Vil Senkevich, they assembled an automatic device, and only later began the serial production of polarographs in the USSR.
