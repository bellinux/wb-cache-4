5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E
5|$|A <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> of Operation Dragoon {{was the use}} of {{the port}} {{facilities}} in Southern France, especially the large ports at Marseille and Toulon. After Operation Cobra and Operation Dragoon, the Allied advance slowed almost to a halt in September due to a critical lack of supplies. The ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of supplies were unloaded, which was more than one third of the Allied cargo shipped to the Western front.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give <b>significant</b> <b>benefit.</b> Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E

25|$|The anti-convulsant drugs {{gabapentin}} and pregabalin {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} pain. Gabapentin may be of <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> for pain relief in about 35% of people with fibromyalgia. It is not possible to predict who will benefit, and a short trial may be recommended to test the effectiveness of this type of medication. Approximately 6/10 people who take gabapentin to treat pain related to fibromyalgia experience unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, abnormal walking, or swelling from fluid accumulation. Pregabalin demonstrates a substantial benefit in about 9% of people. Pregabalin reduced time off work by 0.2 days per week.|$|E

25|$|Temple Grandin began {{shooting}} in October 2008 at Austin Studios in Austin, Texas. The film was noted for filming in Texas {{at a time}} when TV and film production had grown scarce in the state, and legislators were seeking to expand financial incentives to draw more film crews. Grandin producer Scott Ferguson said that Arizona, New Mexico and Canada had all been considered before producers had chosen Texas, in part because different areas of the state could be used to represent the rural West and New England. Ferguson also credited the abundance of trained film crews in the Austin and Dallas regions as a <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> to {{shooting in}} the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fluoxetine and other antidepressants {{in the treatment}} of mild-to-moderate depression is controversial. A meta-analysis published by Kirsch in 2008 suggests, in those with mild or moderate symptoms, the efficacy of fluoxetine and other SSRIs is clinically insignificant. A 2009 meta-analysis by Fournier which evaluated patient-level data from six trials of the SSRI paroxetine and the non-SSRI antidepressant imipramine has been further cited as evidence that antidepressants exhibit minimal efficacy in mild to moderate depression. A 2012 meta-analysis using individual patient level-data of fluoxetine for the treatment of depression concluded statistically and clinically <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> was seen irrespective of baseline depression severity, and no significant effect was found on baseline severity on observed efficacy.|$|E
25|$|One {{recent study}} of neuroplasticity {{involves}} work done {{by a team of}} doctors and researchers at Emory University, specifically Dr. Donald Stein and Dr. David Wright. This is the first treatment in 40 years that has significant results in treating traumatic brain injuries while also incurring no known side effects and being cheap to administer. Dr. Stein noticed that female mice seemed to recover from brain injuries better than male mice, and that at certain points in the estrus cycle, females recovered even better. This difference may be attributed to different levels of progesterone, with higher levels of progesterone leading to the faster recovery from brain injury in mice. However, clinical trials showed progesterone offers no <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> for traumatic brain injury human patients.|$|E

25|$|Other. A 2012 {{systematic}} review found insufficient low bias {{evidence to support}} the use of spinal manipulation as a therapy for the treatment of hypertension. A 2011 {{systematic review}} found moderate {{evidence to support the}} use of manual therapy for cervicogenic dizziness. There is very weak evidence for chiropractic care for adult scoliosis (curved or rotated spine) and no scientific data for idiopathic adolescent scoliosis. A 2007 systematic review found that few studies of chiropractic care for nonmusculoskeletal conditions are available, and they are typically not of high quality; it also found that the entire clinical encounter of chiropractic care (as opposed to just SM) provides benefit to patients with cervicogenic dizziness, and that the evidence from reviews is negative, or too weak to draw conclusions, {{for a wide variety of}} other nonmusculoskeletal conditions, including ADHD/learning disabilities, dizziness, high blood pressure, and vision conditions. Other reviews have found no evidence of <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> for asthma, baby colic, bedwetting, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, gastrointestinal disorders, kinetic imbalance due to suboccipital strain (KISS) in infants, menstrual cramps, insomnia, postmenopausal symptoms, or pelvic and back pain during pregnancy. As there is no evidence of effectiveness or safety for cervical manipulation for baby colic, it is not endorsed.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{inequality}} both {{leads to}} {{and is a}} result of food insecurity. According to estimates women and girls make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little {{progress has been made in}} ensuring the equal right to food for women enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women face discrimination both in education and employment opportunities and within the household, where their bargaining power is lower. On the other hand, gender equality is described as instrumental to ending malnutrition and hunger. Women tend to be responsible for food preparation and childcare within the family and are more likely to spend their income on food and their children's needs. Women also play an important role in food production, processing, distribution and marketing. They often work as unpaid family workers, are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, varying from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services. Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20–30%; raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%. While those are rough estimates, the <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> of closing the gender gap on agricultural productivity cannot be denied. The gendered aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization.|$|E
500|$|Cornwallis also {{negotiated}} with the parliament {{the passage of a}} bill offering amnesty to most of the rebels. [...] This idea was vigorously opposed both in the Protestant-controlled Irish Parliament and in London. [...] By the time the bill passed and received the royal signature in October, it contained numerous exceptions, meaning that anyone with a role of significance in the rebellion was likely not eligible. The bill was also enacted too late to be of <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> anyway. He offered financial compensation for losses incurred by loyalists, the terms of which were significantly abused, as claims were often made well in excess of actual losses. This policy of lenience was furthermore disliked by politically influential Protestants, which complicated some of Cornwallis's later activities.|$|E

500|$|In 1651 England and the Netherlands went to war. [...] Word of this {{arrived in}} the New World in 1652, and rumors flew around the English colonies of New England that the Dutch in New Amsterdam were conspiring {{with all of the}} region's Indians to make war against them. [...] Leverett and Robert Sedgwick both saw a <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> for their trading {{operations}} if the Dutch could be eliminated as competitors, and lobbied for military action against New Amsterdam, although religious moderates like Simon Bradstreet were opposed to it. [...] New Amsterdam's Director-General Peter Stuyvesant invited a delegation from New England colonies to New Amsterdam to discuss the matter. [...] Leverett was one of the commissioners sent in 1653; he took careful note of the colony's defenses while he was there. [...] The New Haven Colony petitioned the Commonwealth government of Oliver Cromwell for assistance against the Dutch threat, a position supported by Leverett, who went to England with Sedgwick in 1653 to press the colonial case for war.|$|E
500|$|The most <b>significant</b> <b>benefit</b> {{of the use}} of the {{technique}} is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available. [...] Intensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within [...] of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time, though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical-storm force (...) and weak hurricane- or typhoon-force (...) is the least certain. [...] Its overall precision has not always been true, as refinements in {{the technique}} led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to [...] [...] The method is internally consistent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity. [...] Some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2.5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule, which can work to the technique's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s. [...] Systems with small eyes near the limb, or edge, of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique, which can be resolved through use of polar-orbiting satellite imagery. [...] Subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak, which {{led to the development of}} the Hebert-Poteat technique in 1975. [...] Cyclones undergoing extratropical transition, losing their thunderstorm activity, see their intensities underestimated using the Dvorak technique. [...] This led to the development of the Miller and Lander extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances.|$|E
