A gate leakage current is detected before failure but is not necessarily responsible for the failure. For some tested devices, the failure appears in an open state mode after physical short-circuit between gate and source.

40|$|Abstract—Non-linear {{magnetic}} {{problems are}} commonly solved by iterative methods. This paper discusses {{the application of}} the Picard-method and the Newton-method in the context of solving time-harmonic problems. It is shown that the overall computation time can be decreased by initiating the non-linear solution process using Picard-iterations and by switching to Newton-iterations as soon as an estimator indicates that this is appropriate. The estimator relies on the equivalence between the Newton-method and the gradient based methods for minimizing non-linear multivariate functions. The developed hybrid Picard-Newton method is applied for the simulation of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>operation</b> of a 400 kW four-pole induction motor.

40|$|The {{unsymmetrical}} <b>short-circuit</b> <b>operation</b> of a nonsalientpole alternator with dampers {{is described}} by four linear periodic coefficient equations. All periodic terms are at fundamental frequency. The equations are solved by indirect use of Floquet's theorem, allowing the time constants to be determined first. This determination {{is based on the}} fact that there exist recurrent relations for the current's harmonics, and it is shown in the paper that convergence of these recurrent relations for{pm}{infty}can be ensured only if the time constants fulfill a relationship which is one of the findings of the paper. Then, it is shown that a knowledge of the time constants and of the above-mentioned recurrent relations yields a convenient Floquet reference frame. Eventually there is no more difficulty to completely determine the currents from the initial conditions. A complete numerical example has been treated and the results of the present method tally with those yielded by a classical Runge-Kutta method...|$|E

For this study, ageing has been obtained using repetitive <b>short-circuit</b> <b>operations.</b> Among monitored parameters during ageing, on-state resistance and short-circuit current level are those, which have the strongest evolution. The top-metal degradation has been characterized via the on-state resistance measurement during ageing.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} experimental robustness tests made on Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs and SiC Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) {{submitted to}} <b>short-circuit</b> <b>operations</b> (SC) or current limitation modes. For SiC MOSFETs, a gate leakage current is detected before failure without {{being responsible for}} the immediate failure. Nevertheless this gate leakage current is not without effect on {{the integrity of the}} SiC MOSFETs. Based on several robustness tests performed on SiC MOSFETs and on the comparison with experimental results obtained with SiC BJTs, the paper points out two main failure modes for SiC MOSFETs. The first one results in a simultaneously short circuit between drain and gate and drain and source and the second one in a degradation of the insulation between gate and source leading to a short circuit between gate and source. For some tested devices, the failure appears in a very interesting open state mode between drain and source after physical short-circuit between gate and source with a mode of failure very similar to those observed for SiC BJT...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{efficient}} conversion {{and control of}} electrical power in many application areas has rapidly increased the demand for power devices with better and better performances. In order {{to go beyond the}} limit imposed by Silicon devices, {{there has always been a}} great interest for new materials. In recent years, Silicon Carbide Power devices, mainly power diodes and MOSFETs, have become commercially available and have begun to replace their Silicon counterpart in many application areas. The reason lays in some superior material properties that allow developing higher efficient power systems. Nevertheless, a wider spread of these devices could not be achieved without a deep analysis of the elements that might affect their reliability.

40|$|Over {{the recent}} years, smart grids have {{received}} great public attention. Many proposed functionalities rely on power electronics, which {{play a key}} role in the smart grid, together with the communication network. However, “smartness” is not the driver that alone motivates the research towards distribution networks based on power electronics; the network vulnerability to natural hazards has resulted in tightening requirements for the supply security, set both by electricity end-users and authorities. Because of the favorable price development and advancements in the field, direct current (DC) distribution has become an attractive alternative for distribution networks. In this doctoral dissertation, power electronic converters for a low-voltage DC (LVDC) distribution system are investigated. These include the rectifier located at the beginning of the LVDC network and the customer-end inverter (CEI) on the customer premises. Rectifier topologies are introduced, and according to the LVDC system requirements, topologies are chosen for the analysis. Similarly, suitable CEI topologies are addressed and selected for study. Application of power electronics into electricity distribution poses some new challenges. Because the electricity end-user is supplied with the CEI, it is responsible for the end-user voltage quality, but it also has to be able to supply adequate current in all operating conditions, including a short-circuit, to ensure the electrical safety. Supplying short-circuit current with power electronics requires additional measures, and therefore, the short-circuit behavior is described and methods to overcome the high-current supply to the fault are proposed. Power electronic converters also produce common-mode (CM) and radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic interferences (EMI), which are not present in AC distribution. Hence, their magnitudes are investigated. To enable comprehensive research on the LVDC distribution field, a research site was built into a public low-voltage distribution network. The implementation was a joint task by the LVDC research team of Lappeenranta University of Technology and a power company Suur-Savon S¨ahk¨o Oy. Now, the measurements could be conducted in an actual environment. This is important especially for the EMI studies. The main results of the work concern the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>operation</b> of the CEI and the EMI issues. The applicability of the power electronic converters to electricity distribution is demonstrated, and suggestions for future research are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{everything}} {{seems to indicate that}} pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) is experiencing a second, or even third, youth (Fayolle and Lafon, 2008). Main drivers of such reemergence are mostly related with concerns on climate change and depletion of fossil fuels, which have been transposed into international agreements, regional directives, and national and local regulations (UN, 1998; EC, 2009). As a consequence of these concerns and associated regulations, there has been a strong deployment of renewable energy (REN) technologies, which is still ongoing. Amongst all REN sources, wind seems to be at present the one with the largest economically feasible potential (Lu et al., 2009), but also with the highest variability (Wan, 2005; Taulan et al., 2009; Paradinas et al., 2012), and the most difficult to predict (Greaves et al., 2009; Hodge et al., 2012). In this context, PHES “reemerges” as an excellent means to integrate wind power into the electric power system, not only because of its maturity and technically proven flexibility, but also because of its significant remaining potential (EURELECTRIC, 2011; IEA, Technology Roadmap, 2012; Lacal Arántegui et al., 2012). Within this new role, special attention is given to variable speed PHES (Schwery and Kunz, 2009; EPRI, 2013; HEA, 2013) and hydraulic <b>short-circuit</b> <b>operation</b> (Taulan et al., 2009; Lippold et al. 2012). The objective of this report is to describe some current trends and future challenges on PHES in relation with its role in REN integration, with special emphasis on mechanical aspects of hydraulic machinery, power electronics devices used for variable speed operation, and utilities’ operation strategies both in liberalized and centralized markets contexts. The remainder of this document is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, after a brief introduction and historical background, the new generation of PHES is presented with particular focus on those equipped with variable-speed technology. Typical configurations of pumped-storage hydropower plants (PSHPs) are also briefly described, discussing their capability for providing grid support services, such as load-frequency regulation, inertia and short-circuit power. Chapter 2 focuses on reversible pumpturbines, discussing their operating limits and presenting the state-of art of the research on their unstable behavior. In chapter 3, the operating principle and some basic aspects of the electrical machines most widely used in PSPHs are described. In chapter 4, power electronics devices typically used in PSHPs for both start-up in pumping mode and variable speed operation are described in detail, along with some recent developments on variable speed drives. In chapter 5, utilities’ operation strategies are reviewed in detail, and some future challenges to make the best possible use of PHES assets according to their new role are identified...|$|E

It {{is well known}} that these lines are used within the distribution system of very high voltage levels and are used to transfer large amounts of energy over long distances. The essential prerequisite for the transfer of such an amount of energy is to achieve the greatest efficiency possible. Therefore, there are methods developed, by which under known circumstances {{on one end of the}} line we can calculate the line ratios at the other end. These methods can be classified into exact, approximate and graphic methods. With approximate methods, T – element and ? – element, the most popular ones, are used.

40|$|Magnetoforming of tube or {{sheet metal}} parts can {{significantly}} extend the range of geometries conceivable with state-of-the-art forming methods. A major advantage is the considerably higher forming speed of the process achievable by using a magnetic piston without inertia. Key for this technology {{is the development of}} reliable, long-lifetime, high current pulse power generators able to deliver tens to hundreds of kiloamps of peak current to a mainly inductive load which is highly variable in time during the forming process. A high-current, high energy pulse generator for electromagnetic forming of large area sheet metal has been developed and was taken into operation. Design criteria were reliability and safety for all possible load cases, including short circuits and <b>short-circuiting</b> loads under <b>operation,</b> at nominal peak currents of up to 200 kA and peak pulse energies of up to 100 kJ. In order to comply with the safety requirements, an all-solid-state design has been chosen using high power semiconductor switches for pulse forming instead of ignitrons or spark gaps. Due to constraints concerning space and manageability, the coupling between the load and the pulse forming unit is achieved via a semi-rigid bundle of high voltage cables, allowing an adjustment of the carrier of the forming coil while being electrically connected to each other. We report on the development of a pulse generator for peak currents of 50 kA to up to 200 kA at a pulse width of typically around 100 µs, depending on the load parameters. In order to meet lifetime requirements suitable for industrial applications, the short circuit handling capability of peak currents of up to 450 kA is a major issue in the pulse generator design. A modular 3 -branch design of parallel capacitor banks has been adopted to achieve the requirements concerning reliability, lifetime, and short circuit handling. The prototype pulse generator is based upon off-the-shelf devices, including high-current semiconductor switches. First operating results of the commissioning phase of the installation are reported...|$|R
