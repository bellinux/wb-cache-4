5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former record label) and MCA Records. Anthony {{said that he}} would not record in English until he felt he was ready to do <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his record label for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

5|$|Norway sent {{a strong}} {{contingent}} with four jumpers {{able to win}} the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the speed, with Central European jumpers wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the most vocal speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by reducing their speed on the in-run.|$|E
5|$|The BP Pedestrian Bridge, {{or simply}} BP Bridge, is a girder {{footbridge}} in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States.

Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry, it opened {{along with the rest}} of Millennium Park on July 16, 2004. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually agreed to do <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Pritzker family funded the Pavilion.|$|E

5|$|The {{disagreement}} between Jackson and Raw during the Battle of Long Tan had long-term {{effects on the}} structure of the Australian Defence Force. Raw's initial refusal to commit helicopters contributed {{to the development of a}} long-lasting perception among some Army officers that the RAAF was reluctant to support their service in battle. Some members of the Army also wrongly believed that RAAF pilots had refused to conduct the supply mission, and only did <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> squadron was threatened with being withdrawn from South Vietnam and they were spoken to forcefully by Raw. Influenced by this perception, the Army subsequently advocated for the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to be transferred to its control, and this finally occurred in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{observatory}} {{was built}} in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first path to the summit was built {{at the same time as}} the observatory and was designed to allow ponies to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five. The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a rack railway to the summit, none of which came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{received}} {{an invitation to}} {{become a member of the}} Knickerbockers a month or <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> team's September 23, 1845, creation. He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers. Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine runs for his team as they defeated a side picked by William R. Wheaton, 51–42. The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19. Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23–1. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' lineup, he made one out and did not score a run.|$|E

5|$|Baseball, {{widely known}} as America's pastime, is well {{established}} in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked {{with that of the}} sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals.|$|E
5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation {{by means of an}} adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E
5|$|Following Joseph Stalin's {{consolidation}} {{of power in}} the 1920s the post of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with 'Leader of the Soviet Union' because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government. The post of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the communist party, the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> death or removal of a Soviet leader, the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen's {{agreement}} that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement, despite their own right to do <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> two companies were unable {{to agree on a}} new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan move forward on sequels with/without Pixar, and put Toy Story 3 into pre-production at Disney's new CGI division Circle 7 Animation. However, when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following the 2006 merger of the companies, he put all sequels on hold and Toy Story 3 was cancelled. In May 2006, it was announced that Toy Story 3 was back in pre-production with a new plot and under Pixar's control. The film was released on June 18, 2010, as Pixar's eleventh feature film.|$|E
5|$|Gaza {{was granted}} to Herod the Great by Roman emperor Augustus in 30 BCE, where it formed a {{separate}} unit within his kingdom; and Cosgabar, {{the governor of}} Idumea, {{was in charge of}} the city's affairs. On the division of Herod's kingdom, it was placed under the proconsul of Syria. After Herod's death in 4 BCE, Augustus annexed it to the Province of Syria. In 66 CE, Gaza was burned down by Jews during their rebellion against the Romans. However, it remained an important city; even more <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> destruction of Jerusalem by Titus the following year. Titus passed through Gaza on his march toward to Jerusalem, and again in his return. The establishment of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea restored trade links with Petra and Aila.|$|E
5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E

5|$|Iron Man 3 grossed $409 {{million in}} North America and $805.8 million in other {{countries}} for a worldwide total of $1.2 billion, outgrossing both of its predecessors combined. Worldwide, it became the 5th-highest-grossing film, the second-highest-grossing film of 2013, the second-highest-grossing film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (behind Marvel's The Avengers), the highest-grossing film of the Iron Man film series, the sixth-highest-grossing film distributed by Disney, and the highest-grossing threequel. It achieved the sixth-largest worldwide opening weekend with $372.5 million. On the weekend of May 3–5, 2013, the film set a record for the largest worldwide weekend in IMAX with $28.6 million. On its 23rd day in theaters, Iron Man 3 became the sixth Disney film and the 16th film overall to reach $1 billion. It is the first Iron Man film to gross over $1 billion, the second Marvel film to do <b>so</b> <b>after</b> <b>The</b> Avengers, and the fourth-fastest film to reach the milestone. As part of the earlier distribution agreement made with Disney in 2010, Paramount Pictures received 9% of the box office gross generated by Iron Man 3. Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $391.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{became aware}} {{that there was a}} spy {{operating}} within the Turkish Embassy, they investigated Bazna, installed a new alarm system, and initiated an unsuccessful sting to catch him selling intelligence. He stopped selling information to the Germans by the end of February 1944 and left the embassy within a month or <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> war, Bazna was questioned for war crimes, but he was never charged with espionage. He attempted to buy and operate a hotel in Ankara with the proceeds of his spying career, but it was discovered that much of the money was counterfeit. He served a brief prison sentence for circulating forged notes. Bazna lived in Ankara with his family for many years and obtained work doing odd jobs. He moved to Munich in 1960 and worked as a night watchman before dying in 1970 of kidney disease. Bazna published a memoir of the Cicero affair in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} first {{presented}} to the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević. Milošević found the plan wholly acceptable and promised he would ensure {{the leadership of the}} RSK eventually supported it. He endorsed the plan because it ensured the preservation of Serbian territorial gains of 1991, retained Croatian Serb administration of the areas where the peacekeepers would be deployed and allowed the JNA to shift its focus to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vance then met Yugoslav defence minister JNA General Veljko Kadijević, who also endorsed the plan and was apparently urged by Milošević to do <b>so.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> plan was accepted by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and Kadijević in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. The Accord was a precondition for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force. It comprised four provisions; the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks, the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian aid.|$|E
