40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} ensure the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> train against the track {{buckling}} in a sultry weather, a speed reduction scheme has been implemented in railway operating companies. However, this scheme {{is based on the}} limited knowledge on the buckling behavior of the CWR track. The rational speed reduction scheme based on the probabilistic method for the buckling of the CWR track is proposed to apply to Korea high and normal speed railway. Permissible level of the reduced speed according to the rule of restricted speed signal, accepted degree of the buckling probability, the practically managing degree of the variation of the rail temperature, and effects of the maintenance work on the track condition are reflected in the rational speed reduction scheme...|$|E

40|$|In {{electric}} trains, a pantograph {{is mounted}} {{on the roof of}} the train to collect power through contact with an overhead catenary wire. The carbon-strip suspension of a pantograph, along which contact with the catenary occurs, is subjected to harmonic and stochastic contact-force excitations. In this paper, vertical dynamics of the carbon-strip suspension is studied with an aim of improving the reliability and <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> trains. A single-degree-of- freedom model of the carbon-strip suspension with nonlinear stiffness is developed using parameter values of the DSA X pantograph. Through stochastic averaging, a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation governing the stationary response of the carbon-strip suspension is set up. Based on the transition probability density of the stationary response, it is found that random jumps and bifurcations in the carbon-strip motion can occur. The possibility of motion bifurcations and the frequency of random jumps warrant consideration in advanced design of carbon-strip suspensions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E

Several numerical models in deterministic way to assess the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> road vehicles under crosswinds were proposed. Actually, the natural wind is a random process in time domain due to turbulence, and the surface roughness of a road is also a random process but in spatial domain.

This study tries to explore the dynamic reliability of a road vehicle subjected to turbulent crosswinds. Based on a nonlinear vibration system, the dynamic responses of a road vehicle are simulated to obtain the dynamic reliability. Monte Carlo Simulation with Latin Hypercube Sampling is then applied on the possible random variables including the vehicle weight, road friction coefficient, and driver parameter to look at their effects. Finally, a distribution model of the dynamic reliability and a corresponding index for the wind-induced vehicle accident considering these random processes and variables is proposed and employed to evaluate the safety of the running vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As a {{dedicated}} digital mobile communication system designed for railway application, GSM-R must provide reliable bidirectional channel for transmitting security data between trackside equipments and on-train computer on high-speed railways. To ensure the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> <b>running</b> trains, redundant network architecture {{is commonly used}} to guarantee the reliability of GSM-R. Because of the rigid demands of railway security, {{it is important to}} build reliability mathematical models, predict the network reliability and select a suitable one. Two common GSM-R wireless architectures, co-sited double layers network and intercross single layer network, are modeled and contrasted in this paper. By calculating the reliabilities of each reliable model, it is clear that more redundant the architecture is, more reliable the system will be, the whole system will bear a less failure time per year as the benefit. Meanwhile, as the redundancy of GSM-R system raises, its equipment and maintenance will cost much, but the reliability raise gently. From the standpoint of transmission system interruption and network equipment failure, the reliability of co-sited double layer network architecture is higher than the intercross single layer one, while the viability and cost of the intercross redundant network is better than co-sited one in natural disasters such as flood and lightning. Taking fully into account reliability, viability and cost, we suggest that intercross redundant network should be chosen on high-speed railway...|$|E

Scientifically grounded methods of providing the effective and reliable running of the combined systems of heat evaporation-condensation type are worked out. Based on the study of structural, hydrodynamic and capillary transport properties of fine-fibre capillary structures for combined ICS, relations of the pores size, permeability and capillary pressure of the initial structural parameters, regularity of capillary filtering are obtained. Regularities for determining the limits of heat transfer capability of ICT systems under the influence of various thermal factors are got.

The change of the road surface conditions can have significant influence on the <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> a <b>running</b> vehicle on the road. Nowadays, {{there are a lot}} of CCTVs that are installed to observe the road surface with the unaided eye, and it is common for an administrator to determine the road surface conditions after confirming visually. However, there is a limitation to quickly determine the road surface conditions manually.

Previous and related work has shown that runtime monitoring techniques {{can be useful in}} order to validate or guarantee the <b>safety</b> and security <b>of</b> <b>running</b> programs. Yet, those techniques have not yet been able to make the transition to everyday use in software development processes. One problem that hinders industry adoption is that the required specifications use a cumbersome notation. As a consequence, only verification experts, not programmers, can understand what a given specification means and in particular, whether it is correct. In 2001, researchers at Bell Labs proposed the Timeline formalism. This formalism was designed with ease of use in mind, however originally for static verification. In this article, we describe how software safety specifications can be denoted visually in the Timeline formalism and subsequently be transformed into finite automata suitable for runtime monitoring, using our meta-modelling and model transformation tool AToM 3. Those automata are then fed to an existing monitoring backend that generates efficient runtime monitors for them. Those monitors can then automatically be applied to Java programs. Our work shows that the Timeline to automata transformation is not only feasible in an efficient and sound way but also might help programmers identify correspondences between the original specification and the generated monitors. We argue that visual specification <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> criteria and subsequent automatic synthesis of runtime monitors will help users reason about the correctness of their specifications {{on the one hand and}} effectively deploy them in industrial settings on the other hand. ...|$|R
