If R and G are sets of points in Ed, a hyperplane h is a weak linear <b>separator</b> <b>of</b> R and G {{if it is}} an exact separator for the largest possible subset of R∪G (weak spherical separators are defined analogously). Furthermore, over all weak linear <b>separators</b> <b>of</b> R∪G, if h attains the greatest minimum orthogonal distance from the points of the subset it separates, then h is called wide. Using the algorithms of this paper, wide weak linear <b>separators</b> <b>of</b> point sets in Ed {{may be found in}} O(nd) time and space; for spherical separators, these complexities rise to O(nd+ 1). For both cases, under certain conditions, it is shown that the space complexity may be reduced to O(n). A linear-time algorithm for finding a wide exact linear <b>separator</b> <b>of</b> point sets in Ed is also presented, variations of which are used to find exact linear <b>separators</b> <b>of</b> sets of hyperspheres in Ed in O(n) time and space, and weak separators in O(nd+ 1) time and space...|$|R

40|$|Chordal graphs form an {{important}} and widely studied subclass of perfect graphs. The set <b>of</b> minimal vertex <b>separators</b> constitute an unique class <b>of</b> <b>separators</b> <b>of</b> a chordal graph and capture {{the structure of the}} graph. In this paper, we explore the connection between perfect elimination orderings of a chordal graph and its minimal vertex separators. Specifically, we prove a characterization <b>of</b> these <b>separators</b> in terms <b>of</b> the monotone adjacency sets of the vertices of the graph, numbered by the maximum cardinality search (MCS) scheme. This leads to a simple linear-time algorithm to identify the minimal vertex <b>separators</b> <b>of</b> a chordal graph using the MCS scheme. We also introduce the notion of multiplicity of a minimal vertex separator which indicates the number of different pairs of vertices separated by it.

We show that such safe separators are a very powerful tool for preprocessing graphs when we want to compute their treewidth. We give several sufficient conditions for separators to be safe, allowing such separators, if existing, {{to be found in}} polynomial time. In particular, every inclusion minimal <b>separator</b> <b>of</b> size one or two is safe, every minimum <b>separator</b> <b>of</b> size three that does not split off a component with only one vertex is safe, and every inclusion minimal separator that is an almost clique is safe; an almost clique is a set of vertices W such that there is a v∈W with W-{v} a clique.
