25|$|Immersion <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> are {{dry suits}} carried {{for use by}} ship and {{aircraft}} crew who will be immersed in cold water if the craft must be abandoned. Unlike immersion survival work suits, these are {{not intended to be}} worn all the time, and are only to be used in an emergency. <b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> will typically be a one-piece design made of fire-retardant neoprene, optimized with quick donning features, and produced in high visibility colours with reflective tape patches.|$|E
500|$|... 2. Since 1980, <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> {{have been}} {{required}} aboard ship in each crew member's quarters and at their customary work station with strobe lights affixed to life jackets and <b>survival</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{disaster}} {{is one of}} the best-known in the history of Great Lakes shipping. Gordon Lightfoot made it the subject of his 1976hit song [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] after reading an article, [...] "The Cruelest Month", in the November 24, 1975, issue of Newsweek. [...] The sinking led to changes in Great Lakes shipping regulations and practices that included mandatory <b>survival</b> <b>suits,</b> depth finders, positioning systems, increased freeboard, and more frequent inspection of vessels.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflatable}} <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> is {{a special}} type of <b>survival</b> <b>suit,</b> recently developed, which is similar in construction to an inflatable boat, but shaped to wrap around the arms and legs of the wearer. This type of suit is much more compact than a neoprene <b>survival</b> <b>suit,</b> and very easy to put on when deflated since it is just welded from plastic sheeting to form an air bladder.|$|R
50|$|A ship's captain (or master) may be {{required}} to hold drills periodically to ensure that everyone can get to the <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> storage quickly, and don the suit in the allotted amount of time. In the event of an emergency, {{it should be possible to}} put on a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> and abandon ship in about one minute.|$|R
50|$|An {{immersion}} <b>suit,</b> or <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> (or {{more specifically}} an immersion <b>survival</b> <b>suit)</b> {{is a special}} type of waterproof dry suit that protects the wearer from hypothermia from immersion in cold water, after abandoning a sinking or capsized vessel, especially in the open ocean. They usually have built-on feet (boots), and a hood, and either built-on gloves or watertight wrist seals.|$|R
2500|$|Dry suit {{inflation}} only {{applies to}} diving. [...] <b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> and other dry suits designed for wear {{on the surface}} have no inflation or dump valves as suit squeeze and achieving neutral buoyancy are not issues.|$|E
2500|$|Surface {{dry suits}} may have socks or ankle seals fitted. Socks are {{normally}} made from latex rubber {{or from a}} breathable material similar {{to the rest of}} the suit. An outer boot or shoe would normally be worn over these socks to protect them from wear and the risk of puncture. The outer boot also provides more warmth than the thin layer of latex. A regular sock (e.g. a woollen sock) would normally be worn inside the drysuit sock for comfort. Latex rubber ankle seals are sometimes fitted in place of socks and can allow better foot control of water skis and surfboards. <b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> may have neoprene socks of the same material as the suit, with tougher soles and ankle ties to keep them on the feet, as the [...] "one-size fits all" [...] socks must be too big for most users.|$|E
2500|$|The Bell 212 {{registered}} as G-BDIL was a twin-engine two-bladed medium helicopter manufactured on 18 July 1975. For the flight the rear bench seats were removed to allow fitting a rescue winch, leaving only two rear seats available {{and the remaining}} two cabin crew using safety harnesses. The aircraft had an Certificate of Airworthiness that was valid until 30 January 1983 and a Certificate of Maintenance that was valid until 27 October 1982 or 7,567.5 airframe hours. The airframe had a total of 7,532.25 hours {{at the time of}} the accident. [...] The gross weight of the aircraft and the estimated center of gravity were both within authorized limits. [...] The aircraft had two liferafts installed and all six personnel were wearing immersion <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> and life vests with personal locator beacons. The aircraft was also equipped with a SARBE beacon and an underwater locator beacon, both activated by immersion in salt water. [...] Available navigation equipment installed included a Decca Navigator System, VOR, and ADF receivers. During the flight, the co-pilot had asked for the non-directional beacon located on the Murchison platform to be turned on to assist in finding the Baffin Seal but the beacon remained off until after the accident because the platform's radio operator was fixing an equipment issue.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{garments}} overlap into scubadiver-type drysuits. Others may {{have many of}} the features of a <b>survival</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|R
50|$|This type of <b>survival</b> <b>suit's</b> {{flotation}} {{and thermal}} protection is usually better than an immersion protection work suit, and typically extends a person's survival by several hours {{while waiting for}} rescue.|$|R
50|$|Class S - A 121.5 MHz unit {{similar to}} Class B but is often {{included}} {{as an integral}} part of a lifeboat or <b>survival</b> <b>suit.</b> Their use is no longer recommended by the U.S. Coast Guard.|$|R

Activities include a parade, talent show, royal crowning ceremony, and various competitions such as an oyster shucking contest, ping pong tournament, and a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> race.|$|R
50|$|However, like an {{inflatable}} boat, the inflatable <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> loses all protection properties {{if it is}} punctured and the gas leaks out. For this reason, the suit may consist {{of two or more}} bladders, so that if one fails, a backup air bladder is available.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> in Europe {{were invented}} by Daniel Rigolet, captain of a French oil tanker. Others had experimented on similar suits abroad.|$|E
50|$|These zippers {{are very}} common where {{airtight}} or watertight seals are needed, such as on scuba diving dry suits, ocean <b>survival</b> <b>suits,</b> and hazmat suits.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{inflatable}} <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> {{has been}} put on and zipped shut, the wearer activates firing handles on compressed carbon dioxide cartridges, which punctures the cartridges and rapidly inflates the suit. This results in a highly buoyant, rigid shape that also offers very high thermal retention properties.|$|R
50|$|The Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment {{is a type}} of <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> {{that can}} be used by sailors when {{escaping}} from a sunken submarine. The suit is donned before escaping from the submarine and then inflated to act as a liferaft when the sailor reaches the surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{first record}} of a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> was in 1930 when a New York firm American Life Suit Corporation offered {{merchant}} and fishing firms what it called a safety suit for crews of ocean vessels. The suit came packed in a small box and was put on like a boilersuit.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{subjects}} on the courses is Basic sea survival where the students {{learn how to}} use life rafts, lifejackets, <b>survival</b> <b>suits,</b> flares, MOB and personal safety equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{helicopter}} rescued Cache Seel, who was {{the only}} crewmember {{to make it to}} the life raft. Vermeersch and Rivera, who were wearing <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> like Seel, were found dead in the water. Vermeersch was recovered by the helicopter, and Rivera was recovered by Stimson. Edwards, Luna and Marrs fell into the water without <b>survival</b> <b>suits,</b> and their bodies were never found. According to Seel's account, Edwards and Luna were thrown overboard while trying to release the life raft. Vermeersch ultimately freed it, but only Seel made it to the raft after 50 minutes in the water.|$|E
50|$|Founded by Olav Zipser In 2009, The FreeFly Astronaut Project is a {{scientific}} research mission toward {{the development of}} appropriate techniques and <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> for high-altitude and low-earth-orbit emergency re-entry survival and rescue situations.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, {{the company}} took over Piel owned by Pirelli, {{specialised}} in survival equipment. It took the company 4 years {{to design and}} create the TPS (Thermal Protective Survival), a soft, light and isolating <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> which saved the life of Raphaël Dinelli and Thierry Dubois, during the Vendée Globe Race in 1996.|$|R
2500|$|Crew {{members who}} must {{work on the}} decks of {{commercial}} ships wear a type of dry suit also known as an immersion <b>survival</b> work <b>suit.</b> Single engine aircraft ferry pilots flying between North America and Europe, and helicopter pilots that must fly over the open ocean, must wear a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> in the cockpit, so {{they can continue to}} fly the aircraft, then exit immediately if the aircraft is ditched in cold water after an engine failure. These suits are also used on shore when working on docks, bridges, or other areas where cold water immersion is a safety risk. They are usually a three-part system consisting of: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1959 {{the company}} created a very compact <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> for the US Air Force. The seven piece suit {{was made of}} nylon and goose down and came vacuum packed in a small box. It was used in jets and space capsules. The coat {{converted}} into a sleeping bag. Gerry expanded into outerwear and produced {{some of the first}} lightweight down jackets.|$|R
50|$|Dry suit {{inflation}} only {{applies to}} diving. <b>Survival</b> <b>suits</b> and other dry suits designed for wear {{on the surface}} have no inflation or dump valves as suit squeeze and achieving neutral buoyancy are not issues.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the Coast Guard {{required}} that <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> be required on all winter North Atlantic runs. Later, {{as a direct}} result of the casualties on the Marine Electric, Congress pushed for and the Coast Guard eventually established the now famous Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer program.|$|E
5000|$|The vessels also {{received}} degaussing against magnetic mines, and seamen were issued watertight <b>survival</b> <b>suits</b> if {{the ship had}} to be abandoned. An important part of security was strict secrecy regarding routes and destinations, as made famous in the slogan [...] "Loose lips sinks ships".|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue {{the role}} of the false self in the human personality, {{regarding}} it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization - a kind of caretaker, a <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.Five levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.|$|R
5000|$|After Dick Grayson officially sanctioned Damian's role as Robin, while a {{standard}} Robin tunic was retained, the bodysuit {{was replaced with}} a black <b>survival</b> <b>suit,</b> the grayish cape with a yellow [...] "para-cape" [...] which grants him a gliding capability, the black mask with a green one, a bulkier utility belt to carry more arsenal and gadgetry, a black hood, and flexible green gloves and boots.|$|R
5000|$|The film is {{included}} in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 Collection Volume 12 from Rhino. It provided several running gags that were repeated throughout the series: humming the jazzy music whenever an aircraft is seen flying, mentions of the [...] "poopie suit" [...] (an Air Force <b>survival</b> <b>suit</b> designed to help contain body heat {{in the event of}} a bailout over water), and the use of the word [...] "refueling" [...] as a synonym for any long, dull scene.|$|R
