40|$|The {{bioavailability}} {{of a new}} {{film-coated tablet}} of ticlopidine hydrochloride was compared in 12 healthy male subjects {{to that of the}} older <b>sugar-coated</b> <b>tablet.</b> Plasma levels of ticlopidine were measured by gas-liquid chromatography up to 120 h after a single 500 mg dose of each preparation. Drug intake was separated by a four-week interval. No statistically significant differences could be found between the pharmacokinetic parameters for these two preparations. Bioequivalence was confirmed when applying the test of Westlake to the area under the curves (calculated difference: 8. 3 %; upper limit: 20 %). No unwanted effect was reported during the study...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sugar-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> of bevonium methylsuliate (CG 201) were {{administered}} to the patients complaining of enuresis and urinary frequency (so-called bladder neurosis). The clinical results were as follows: Of eighteen cases of enuresis, six patients ceased to be enuretic, two were definitely improved and ten showed no improvement. Of fifteen cases of bladder neurosis, ten patients showed the improvement of urinary frequency and five showed no improvement...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop and {{validate}} a method to assess the dissolution behaviour of rociverine <b>sugar-coated</b> <b>tablets.</b> In our laboratories, an HPLC-MS in reverse phase method of analysis was developed for the dosage of unknown rociverine solution. This analytical method was applied to determine the dissolution rate of rociverine tablets produced by the industrial procedure, {{because there is no}} official method description. Dissolution tests were carried out in sink conditions as follows: dissolution medium HCl 0. 01 N, paddle rotation speed 50 rpm and vessel volume 1000 ml. The dissolution test gave satisfactory results: 95 % of the drug was dissolved within 30 min and drug dissolution was concluded after 60 min. The method was demonstrated to be adequate for Quality Control of rociverine tablets. Validation was inferred from specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{in children}} of the Kyoto Prefectural Kiyo Gakko, a protectory established according to the Child Welfare Law, was reported. <b>Sugar-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> of T- 312 F, a preparation of TTFD, a new derivative of vitamin B 1, were given in 13 children with nocturnal enuresis. It was markedly effective in 5 cases, effective in 5 cases and ineffective in 3 cases. In the ineffective cases, sleep was so deep {{that it was impossible}} to waken the patient. In such cases as these, concomitant used of other treatments appears to be advisable. The treatment is being continued at present and the results will be reported later. The authors are grateful to Mr. Jiro Kondo, principal of Kyoto Prefectural Kiyo Gakko and Mr. Takao Katsuyama, teacher of the protectory, for their cooperation and to Takeda Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. for the supply of the drug...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Three {{dimensional}} terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) {{was evaluated}} as anovel {{tool for the}} nondestructive characterization of different solid oral dosage forms. The time-domain reflection signal of coherent pulsed light in the far infrared was used to investigate film-coated <b>tablets,</b> <b>sugar-coated</b> <b>tablets,</b> multilayered controlled release tablets, and soft gelatin capsules. It is possible to determine the spatial and statistical distribution of coating thickness in single andmultiple coatedproductsusing 3 DTPI. The measurements are nondestructive even for layers buried underneath other coating structures. The internal structure of coatingmaterials can be analyzed. As the terahertz signal penetrates up to 3 mm into the dosage form interfaces between layers in multilayered tablets can be investigated. In soft gelatin capsules it is possible tomeasure {{the thickness of the}} gelatin layer and to characterize the seal between the gelatin layers for quality control. TPI is a unique approach for the nondestructive characterization and quality control of solid dosage forms. The measurements are fast and fully automated with the potential for much wider application of the technique in the process analytica...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a host of}} {{pharmaceutical}} formulations of diclofenac, which ensures {{that it can be}} used orally, rectally, intrarectally, or topically. Objective - to comparatively analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters and time course of changes in the serum concentration of diclofenac potassium after oral administration in a dose of 50 mg as sachets or <b>sugar-coated</b> <b>tablets.</b> Results. There is evidence that patients tolerate both its sachets and tablets equally well, as confirmed by subjective and objective observations. There are neither marked side effects nor considerable changes in laboratory tests and in the values of vital functions. Diclofenac potassium as early-action tablets (50 and 100 mg) exerts a very good analgesic effect in treating migraine since the plasma concentration of the drug peaks on an average of an hour of administration (range 0, 33 - 2 hours) and the analgesic effect developed following 60 - 90 min. Conclusion. By comparing the rate of absorption, it may be concluded that diclofenac potassium as sachets will produce a much rapider analgesic effect. Thus, the high solubility of diclofenac potassium and its very good absorbability (as sachets in particular) make the drug a superior analgesic that has a rapid analgesic activity...|$|R
40|$|The maca plant (Lepidium meyenii Walp.) {{belongs to}} the family of root tubers and comes from the high altitudes of the Peruvian Andes. The {{indigenous}} population eats the fresh tu-bers of the plant after heating them or they are dried and further processed for instance as flour. For some years now maca-containing products have been on sale in Germany as food supplements, in particular on the Internet. In some cases it is claimed that the capsules, <b>sugar-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> and lozenges increase potency, fertility and libido. They are also said to improve the performance of athletes. As the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has received several inquiries about maca-containing products, the Institute undertook a health assessment of the root tuber. In the scientific literature there are only very few studies which can be used for a health as-sessment of maca. There are no systematic studies. When maca or maca extracts were ad-ministered in some animal experiments, effects on the sexual organs and on the hormone balance were observed. This could lead to adverse effects. In the available scientific literature there is no concrete evidence of adverse effects resulting from maca consumption by human beings although the database is insufficient. Based on the data available at the present time, no safe intake of maca from food and food supplements can be derived...|$|R
