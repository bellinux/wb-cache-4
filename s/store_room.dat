5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged {{that it was}} too {{dangerous}} to continue the raid as Behars distress message may have alerted the Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small and extremely hot <b>store</b> <b>room</b> on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E
5|$|The chapel on {{the upper}} floor became a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> in the early 1980s for pieces being sold off. The stained glass window of the chapel, with the Spencer crest, dates to 1588, and was brought to Althorp from Wormleigton. The organ {{on the other hand}} is far more recent, {{acquired}} from the parish of Meriden in the 1990s. A number of earlier occupants of Althorp, particularly George John and Frederick, were devout Christians and would preach in the chapel, and Robert, 6th Earl Spencer would hold a daily service here. It is still used for family christenings, and for services at Christmas, Easter and Harvest Thanksgiving.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{the second}} largest Danish fort after Kronborg, the {{inspiration}} for Shakespeare's Hamlet. It was built by Ove Gjedde {{with the help of}} local laborers in Danish style. The lower compartment in the basement adjoining the fort was used as a <b>store</b> <b>room,</b> prison and a rest room for the soldiers, while the governor and priests resided in the second level. Fort Dansborg was the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. Originally a fishing village, Tharangambadi (referred as Tranquebar) was fortified by the Danish, who used the port as the main trading post for the colony, with the major export of the colony being cotton textiles. During the middle of the 18th century, the commercial importance of the town declined and the centre of textile production moved to Serampore in the state of Bengal. But Tranquebar still remained the headquarters of the Colony. The fort and the town was sold to the British in 1845 and, along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not a trading post anymore.|$|E

5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine <b>store</b> <b>room.</b> Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
25|$|The now {{demolished}} lighthouse-keeper's {{quarters and}} a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> were constructed nearby.|$|E
25|$|Elements {{that are}} not of {{cultural}} heritage include: the building's ramps, awning, and doors at the main entrance portico; lightweight partitions and suspended ceilings throughout; kitchen and <b>store</b> <b>room</b> fitouts; and steel shelters of the garden and roof deck.|$|E

25|$|The House {{contained}} {{a number of}} hidden rooms that were accessed either through the diary room or through a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> off the living area. At various points in the show, {{all or part of}} these rooms were opened up for various tasks and twists.|$|E
25|$|Guitarist Nathan Connolly, {{previously}} {{a member}} of the band File Under Easy Listening had been working in an HMV <b>store</b> <b>room</b> in Belfast at the time.

25|$|After {{allegations}} {{made against}} the Blood Bank and Eye Bank, {{the state government}} of AP constituted a high-level committee {{to look into the}} allegations. The committee worked under the guidance of the project director of AP State AIDA Control Society, comprising experts from finance and technical fields, verified records pertaining to the collection and disposal of blood samples, blood grouping, screening, sterilisation, medical waste disposal, camps conducted, blood expiry, quality control, <b>store</b> <b>room,</b> record room and purchase of equipment.|$|E
25|$|On 21 December 1878, Iserbrook was berthed at Roundtree′s Dock {{it could}} {{extinguish}} itn Darling Harbour at Sydney with three people aboard: her captain, Joseph Frazer; her first mate, Mr. Hampshire, and her sailmaker, Mr. Barron. At about 4;00 p.m., {{the three men}} went into the <b>store</b> <b>room</b> to procure grog. Captain Frazer pulled the plug from a cask, thinking it contained molasses, but it contained rum, whicb began to spill into the room. The men struck matches {{to find their way}} in the darkness, and one of the matches fell onto the spilled onto the spilled rum, which caught fire. The fire spread quickly; Hampshire and Barron escaped, but Frazer was trapped in the <b>store</b> <b>room</b> and died in the fire. Iserbrooke was scuttled in the harbor in an attempt to control the fire, but this was only partly successful, and the portion of the ship above water level continued to burn for some time until the local fire department could extinguish. Captain Frazer′s remains eventually were recovered after the ship was pumped out and raised early in 1879. Iserbrook′s damaged hulk remained afloat in the harbor until 30 January 1880, when it sank again. Deemed not worth further salvage efforts in July 1880, the wreck was destroyed with explosives in October 1880.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009, {{following}} {{the restoration of}} the station, a new pub, the Sheffield Tap, opened next to platform 1B. The room, located within the main station building, had been used as a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> for 35 years but was used for much longer as a bar and restaurant, catering for first class passengers since 1904. The bar is noteworthy for its restored early 20th century interior and its selection of quality cask ales and beers from around the world. Since opening, the bar has won the National Railway Heritage Award and the Cask Ale pub of the year award.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ruined {{buildings}} within the fort, including granaries, <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> and magazines. Some {{of these were}} used as prisons by the East India Company administrator Thomas Munro.|$|R

25|$|In {{the initial}} stages of the war, Russia endured heavy losses at the Masurian Lakes and Tannenberg and it was to the Winter Palace that many of the wounded returned. Rechristened the Tsarevich Alexey Nikolayevich Hospital, from October 1915, the palace was a fully {{equipped}} hospital, its staterooms transformed into hospital wards. The Fieldmarshals' Hall became a dressing station, the Armorial Hall an operating theatre. The small throne room became a doctor's mess room, while more lowly staff were accommodated in the Nicholas Hall and the Anteroom. Nurses were housed in the more intimate apartments once reserved for members of the extended Romanov family. The 1812 Gallery became a <b>store</b> <b>room,</b> the vestibule of the Jordan staircase the hospital's canteen, and its landings offices.|$|E
25|$|The {{submerged}} hull {{was split}} into forty watertight compartments. Four housed the steam engines, placed forward, the boilers, electrical systems and <b>store</b> <b>room.</b> The rest were allocated to coal storage. A belt of forty smaller compartments {{wrapped around the}} hull, forming a rigid structural frame. Popov sent the drawings to the Dutch naval architect Bruno Tideman, who ran {{a series of tests}} of a paraffin wax model in a ship model basin and concluded that the design was feasible. According to Tideman, the ship could reach 14 knots with 8,500 indicated horsepowers, below Popov's earlier estimate of at least 10 thousand horsepower (the first Livadia could make 13 knots on mere 460 horsepower). Tideman insisted that the contract must be awarded to a first-rate firm and that the plans be approved by him.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013 the Diocese of Winchester exhumed {{the bones}} from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's {{and placed them}} in secure storage. The diocese made no claim they were the bones of Alfred, but {{intended}} to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of King Richard III. The bones were radiocarbon-dated but {{the results showed that}} they were from the 1300s and therefore unrelated to Alfred. In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, which had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum <b>store</b> <b>room,</b> was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son Edward, but this remains unproven.|$|E
5000|$|Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur {{suffered}} damage by looters during the 2011 Egyptian protests. Part {{of the false}} door from {{the tomb of the}} priest Rahotep was stolen, and <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> were broken into.|$|R
50|$|An overcrowded museum made {{expansion}} necessary, but {{the outbreak}} of World War I stopped all construction. Péringuey persuaded the authorities to purchase four old corrugated iron buildings in 1922, which subsequently served as <b>store</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|In time, Snikeria became overpopulated. So, many Sniks slowly {{immigrated to}} Mars, and {{developed}} a subterranean system of paths and supply lines. Besides a Head Office of administration, other important locations include <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> and lecture halls.|$|R
25|$|The {{structure}} {{takes advantage}} of the sloping site to include a sub-floor dining room which runs the length of the stand beneath the front seating. This is accessed via stairs at the front which lead to a number of sets of entrance doors just below ground level. This dining room has been refurbished, with new entrance doors, new leadlight windows and a false ceiling. Most of the original arched leadlight windows at each end have been sheeted over. Behind the dining room, cut into the slope of the land, is a long kitchen. At the southeast end of the kitchen is a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> and a steep timber stair leading up to the service entrance. There are also toilets at the sub-floor level, accessed externally. The men's toilet is located at the southeast end of the building and the women's at the northwest end.|$|E
25|$|There he {{was allowed}} to draw and paint imprisoned Russian officers, and his commander, Karl Moser (who assumed that Schiele was a painter and {{decorator}} when he first met him), even gave him a disused <b>store</b> <b>room</b> to use as a studio. Since Schiele {{was in charge of the}} food stores in the camp, he and Edith could enjoy food beyond rations. By 1917, he was back in Vienna, able to focus on his artistic career. His output was prolific, and his work reflected the maturity of an artist in full command of his talents. He was invited to participate in the Secession's 49th exhibition, held in Vienna in 1918. Schiele had fifty works accepted for this exhibition, and they were displayed in the main hall. He also designed a poster for the exhibition, which was reminiscent of the Last Supper, with a portrait of himself in the place of Christ. The show was a triumphant success, and as a result, prices for Schiele's drawings increased and he received many portrait commissions.|$|E
25|$|Klingon-backed gorillas attack Kirk's team, {{who have}} taken {{position}} in the Klingons' <b>store</b> <b>room</b> but the attackers are defeated. However, they discover that in the fracas, a sniper rifle was taken. Taylor, Kirk and the Starfleet crew ride out to stop the Klingons, and prevent Kor from assassinating Ursus who has gone to talk down Marius. They defeat Kor and his colleagues, but the Klingons beam back up to their ship. Ursus and Marius fight, with Ursus victorious. Kirk and his team leave to pursue Kor, leaving the rifles {{in the hands of}} the gorillas who are no longer puppets of the Klingons. The Enterprise chase Kor's ship for three days, and find themselves back at the alternative Earth as the atmosphere is destroyed by a cobalt bomb which eradicates all life on the planet. The Enterprise pursues Kor back through the portal to their own universe. Meanwhile, Cornelius, Zira and Milo are in orbit on-board a primitive space vessel having witnessed the destruction below. Not knowing what to do, they consult a tricorder left behind by Kirk's team which instructs them on how to travel through time using a slingshot effect.|$|E
