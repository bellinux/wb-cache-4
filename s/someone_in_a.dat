5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

25|$|The Werther effect {{not only}} predicts an {{increase}} in suicide, {{but the majority of}} the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar the person in the publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide. The increase generally happens only in areas where the suicide story was highly publicized. Upon learning of someone else's suicide, some people decide that action may be appropriate for them as well, especially if the publicized suicide was of <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar situation as them.|$|E

25|$|Marcion was a Church leader from Sinope (present-day Turkey), who preached in Rome around 150CE, but was {{expelled}} and {{started his own}} congregation, which spread throughout the Mediterranean. He rejected the Old Testament, and followed a limited Christian canon, which included only a redacted version of Luke, and ten edited letters of Paul. Some scholars do not consider {{him to be a}} gnostic, but his teachings clearly resemble some Gnostic teachings. He preached a radical difference between the God of the Old Testament, the Demiurge, and the highest God, who had sent Jesus to the earth to free mankind from the tyranny of the Jewish Law. Like the Gnostics, Marcion argued that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit appearing to men {{in the shape of a}} human form, and not <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> true physical body. Marcion held that the heavenly Father (the father of Jesus Christ) was an utterly alien god; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it.|$|E

He learns that McCrary's son Matt (Johnny Simmons) thought that his family was {{not doing enough to}} stop molesters after his sister Katie's rape and murder, so Matt contacted <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> support group to discuss non-violent ways of vengeance. Megan interviews Mrs. Tillman again and realizes that her husband, Scott, molested their daughter. The team learns of a new victim and finds the house where he is being held. Inside, they find the victim being held hostage by Mrs. Tillman. Megan convinces Mrs. Tillman to not kill the molester by promising that he will be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and the agents arrest both people. After the arrest, the team and Charlie says goodbye to Larry at the office. Megan and Larry say goodbye near the walkway, where Buzz Aldrin appears to escort Larry to the launch. On launch day, everyone gathers at the house to watch the launch, with both Eppes brothers toasting Larry seconds before liftoff.|$|E
25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide <b>someone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E
