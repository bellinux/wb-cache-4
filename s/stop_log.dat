50|$|Go Home Lake is a lake in west central Ontario in the Township of Georgian Bay, District of Muskoka. Go Home Lake is {{a natural}} lake which is {{actually}} part of the Musquash River system also spelled as Musquosh River on some maps. It was opened up as a recreational lake starting in the late 1950's when Crown Lands were surveyed, subdivided and auctioned off in Public Bids that took place from 1958 through 1962. In the early 60's the construction of two dams was completed, a permanent earthen dam at the Go Home River outlet and a <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> dam (control dam) at the Musquash River outlet. The intent of the dams was to control the water level to maintain a constant water level throughout the boating season eliminating the seasonal fluctuations in the water level.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} {{includes a}} dam located 2 km upstream from the powerhouse, {{which is used}} to divert and control the water flowing to the generating station. It consists of a main sluice operated from Thunder Bay and six <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> sluices operated manually on-site. The intake structure is located on the eastern end of the dam and water flow into the aqueduct is controlled by three gated intake openings. The 2 km aqueduct has an internal diameter of 5 m, and terminates at a large surge chamber. Four penstocks lead from the surge chamber, one for each unit, following the natural slope of the escarpment. Each is sized appropriately for requirements of the unit at which it terminates. Penstocks carry water from the surge chamber to the generating station, which generates electricity then flows back into the Kaministiquia River.|$|E
50|$|Stoplogs are {{hydraulic}} engineering control {{elements that are}} used in floodgates to adjust the water level or discharge in a river, canal, or reservoir. Stoplogs are sometimes confused with flashboards, as both elements are used in bulkhead or crest gates. Stoplogs are typically long rectangular timber beams or boards that are placed {{on top of each other}} and dropped into premade slots inside a weir, gate, or channel. Present day, the process of adding and removing stoplogs is not manual, but done with hydraulic <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> lifters and hoists. Since the height of the barrier can only be adjusted through the addition and removal of stoplogs, finding a lighter and stronger material other than wood or concrete became a more desirable choice. Other materials, including steel and composites, can be used as stoplogs as well. Stoplogs are designed to cut off or stop flow through a conduit.|$|E

40|$|Emergencies {{resulting}} in uncontrolled flow through spillway gates {{often lead to}} millions of dollars lost to repairs, lack of dam productivity, property damages, and risks to public health and safety. A considerable need exists for reliable emergency dewatering systems to prevent these consequences. Stop logs are {{the most commonly used}} dewatering system for spillway gates but are typically designed for maintenance purposes only. They have been found in most cases to be unreliable for emergency closure under flowing conditions. Considering the economic advantages a dewatering system would provide were it functional for the dual purposes of maintenance as well as emergency closure, a new <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> design was developed. This study assesses the design that enables deployment under no-flow conditions as well as flowing, or emergency conditions. The information found in this study provides dam owners, operators, and engineers with options to reduce damages resulting from uncontrolled releases owing to partial or complete failure of spillway gates, including the failure of gates to close after having been raised.

40|$|The writers {{appreciate}} the {{additional information on}} emergency stop-log deployment provided in the discussion by researchers from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. The studies noted were not found {{during the course of}} the research, and their inclusion would have been beneficial in the published paper. The writers also are grateful for the opportunity to respond to questions raised in a subsequent discussion of the article and are pleased to provide the following responses: Response # 1 : The observation made by the discusser is correct in that the data shown in Figs. 5 and 6 of the published article are not the actual forces that would be experienced by the hoist mechanism but rather represent the maximums to be expected. The most significant forces of concern for designing the hoist are the extremes that the hoist would experience during deployment of the stop logs, and those are what are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The hoist forces induced by the stop logs would actually go to zero during the deployment process because the stop logs are dogged and left resting on the pier and the hoist used to retrieve and make ready the next <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> for installation. Response # 2 : The horizontal axes in Figs. 5 and 6 vary from 0 to 6 and 0 to 10 meters, respectively. The distance measured is the vertical distance from the bottommost point of the bottom <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> to the seating surface on the spillway. Response # 3 : The force reduction shown in Fig. 5 “EL 310. 39 - 0. 005 m/s[*]EL[*] 310. 39 - 0. 005 [*]m/s” has been reviewed by the writers, and its cause is unknown. The writers’ best estimate of the reduction prior to submersion is related to seal friction between the rubber seal used on the model stop logs and pier. A flexible membrane was used to seal the sides of the stop logs to the piers. Response # 4 : The insight provided by the discusser is appreciated and useful. The intent of the referenced sentences was to describe common problems associated with the typical installation of stop logs in flowing water and not to convey all possibilities of uplift or downpull. The discusser is correct in that uplift can occur for other reasons, as shown by the data presented in the paper. Response # 5 : The 14 - and 16 -gate spillways use hollow structural sections (HSS) having a depth of 0. 406 m, and the 7 -gate spillway uses HSS having a depth of 0. 610 meters, which agree with the discusser’s estimate. The depth was an important design consideration that was necessary for the design of the model stop logs and was considered by the licensed professional engineers performing the design. The weight of each log and the details of each <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> were carefully considered as the stop logs are presently being implemented on a specific structure. The paper was not intended to be a design guide but rather to introduce the concept and validate the performance of the specific designs. Response # 6 : The writers expect this seating force to be sufficient. The HSS tubes are being constructed to allow water ballast to be added to increase the seating force if necessary. Response # 7 : The discusser is correct; the friction forces are not governed by the same scaling laws that govern fluid flow for hydraulic modeling. For that reason, careful machining and high-quality stainless-steel axle bolts were used in conjunction with machined aluminum wheels. The purpose of the model was to validate whether the design was deployable under emergency conditions. The notion of using sealed bearings was considered and dismissed after a discussion about friction between the model and the prototype. The rationale was such that the prototype bearings will have less friction than the model and that the model would be conservative pertaining to stop-log stalling. One of the important considerations of the design was to size the hoists and not resolve component forces. In none of the cases investigated was the hoist force greater than the static weight of the stop logs. Certain tests, which were not included in the published paper, were completed with the stop logs stalled at some opening. In those cases, the hoist forces were similar to those with stop-log movement. Additionally, different rates of stop-log deployment showed very similar hoist forces, and it was determined that the hoist forces were a function of position and not deployment rate. Response # 8 : The writers apologize for the confusion and hope that the following sentences clear it up sufficiently. The intent was to set depths corresponding to approximately one-third and two-thirds of the free-flowing depth at the spillway crest. Therefore the gate was inserted to approximately one-third of the flow depth to create the two-thirds flow depth and the gate insertion of two-thirds created the one-third depth. In retrospect, it would have been better to simply list gate elevations and flow depths. Read More: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Turbine {{dewatering}} and stop/startup {{may lead}} to the death of tons of fish at Brazilian power dams. The Três Marias Dam (TMD) on the São Francisco River has adopted two techniques to reduce the quantity of fish, mostly mandi (Pimelodus maculatus, Pimelodidae), affected by these maneuvers. They are: (i) spill before turbine dewatering to attract fish out of the tailrace, and (ii) fish screens in the <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> slots during turbine stop/startup to prevent fish from entering the draft tube. Here, we investigated whether spill and fish screens reduced the quantity of fish affected by turbine dewatering and stop/startup at TMD. We also determined whether the biomass of mandi trapped during turbine dewatering may be predicted by turbine discharge (Q) and/or catch per unit effort (CPUE) of mandis in the tailrace. Due to insufficient statistical power, our data were inconclusive as to whether spill attracted mandi out of the tailrace. We verified that the presence of fish screens significantly reduced the biomass of dead/moribund fish during turbine stop/startup. The biomass of mandis trapped in the draft tube during turbine dewatering was mainly influenced by Q (r² = 0. 67), followed by CPUE (r² = 0. 49). Since the trapped fish biomass correlated negatively with Q, we recommend that Q be maximized before turbine dewatering to reduce quantity of mandi trapped in the draft tube. The information presented here may be useful for reducing the quantity of fish affected by turbine maneuvers at TMD, as well as other dams...|$|E
40|$|The flood defence in the {{historical}} town centre of Dordrecht is situated in the Voorstraat, which is a busy shopping street. The dike itself is too low at some places, but with a system of flood stop logs in the doors of buildings along the street some extra height can be reached. The reliability of the <b>stop</b> <b>log</b> system is doubted however, so plans for strengthening the flood defence are needed. One important issue for strengthening the flood defence is the climate change. Warming of the earth would lead to sea level rise and higher river discharges. The rate of climate change is unsure however and various scenarios have been made which range from minor to major changes. The water level at Dordrecht is determined by both the sea level and river discharges, so climate change could have severe consequences for the safety against flooding of Dordrecht. When {{the advice of the}} Delta Committee is followed, the safety standards of the dike rings should be heightened and much higher water levels have to be expected. Also the plans for the Rijnmond-Drechtsteden area are important for the strategy of strengthening the flood defence in the town centre of Dordrecht. A system of barriers in this area could protect Dordrecht against flooding, but {{it is also possible that}} strengthening the flood defence in the town centre of Dordrecht is still needed. Strengthening the flood defence in the Voorstraat is difficult. Therefore also a new flood defence through the part of the town centre which now lies outside the flood defence is considered. Various alignments are possible, of which a flood defence along the river, which protects the entire town centre against flooding has been elaborated. This new flood defence will consist of an automatically floating barrier in the quays. Under normal circumstances this barrier is invisible and when the water level rises the barrier automatically floats up. At one part of the alignment buildings stand with the facades directly along the river. Here a boulevard through the river will be made, separated from the buildings. By integrating the floating barrier in the structure the boulevard can be kept low. Inside the flood defence there is place for a marina and a swimming area. At five places in the alignment a harbour has to be crossed. For this purpose at four places a flood gate will be made, which under normal circumstances lies at the bottom, so it is not visible and ships can pass. When a flood is expected the gates are closed. At one place, at the largest harbour crossing, a multi-functional barrier will be made. This barrier consists of two gates which stand horizontally when retaining a flood. After the flood the gates are lifted and rotated to form a bridge and viewing platform over the harbour. Because of the floating barrier the largest part of the new flood defence will not be visible under normal circumstances, so it will have little impact on {{the historical}} town centre. Therefore it is a good and sustainable solution for protecting the entire town centre of Dordrecht against flooding for a long time. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
