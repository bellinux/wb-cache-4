This article explains this practice and evaluates its welfare implications. The analysis shows that firms with asymmetric convex costs can use horizontal subcontracting to allocate production more efficiently between them and consequently generate a mutually beneficial surplus. For a wide range of parameters, this increase in production efficiency leads to an increase in industry output. The counterintuitive result is that welfare is thereby enhanced. In fact, when industry output falls, welfare can still increase if production costs are sufficiently lowered. ...|$|R

We particularly consider {{the impact of the}} classical transactional attributes, such as specificity and uncertainty, along with other governance mechanisms, such as contractual completeness and relational governance, on duration clauses. The results show that the probability of signing an indefinite-duration contract is related positively to the specificity of the activity and negatively to the degree of completeness of the contract and the uncertainty regarding future demand. Contrary to some classical arguments, these findings suggest that an explicitly long-term contract is not always needed to protect against contractual hazards.

40|$|Lockheed Martin {{designs and}} builds {{commercial}} satellites to customers' specifications. The customers, such as telecommunications companies and weather forecasters, are very price sensitive and, usually, {{award contracts to}} the lowest priced bids. Lockheed manufactures satellites {{using a combination of}} in-house manufacturing, purchasing, and subcontracting (for subcontract parts). The subcontract parts constitute a majority of a satellite's costs. Lockheed uses contracts and other supply management techniques to stay competitive and to keep satellite, specifically subcontract part, costs under control. Some of the subcontract part contracts are managed under <b>subcontract</b> <b>agreements</b> called long-term agreements (LTA). A small supplier pool, long turnover (for bringing these suppliers onboard), regulatory requirements, and capital-intensive nature of the industry are important considerations in evaluating these LTAs. The LTAs embody the risks inherent in project supply chains, specifically, price, currency, and supply risks. In such events, LTAs can become a liability and can lead to monetary losses or discord with suppliers. This thesis provides an overview of the satellite supply chain, analyzes supplier relations to better understand the business dynamics, and analyzes LTAs to better control the satellite input costs.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} role that a {{subcontracting}} relationship can have on a subcontractor’s ability to innovate in process and product. The specification {{of different types of}} subcontracting is based on the transaction cost and knowledge-based approaches, from which we identify two types of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>agreements</b> (“traditional ” <b>subcontracting</b> vs subcontracting of supply). The originality of the framework relies on the introduction of a new set of variables to measure inter-organizational practices and tools and the absorptive capacities of subcontractors (Cohen and Levinthal 1990). This revisited framework can help to measure the full impact of subcontracting relationships on process and product innovation. The empirical test is based on 93 small subcontractors specialized in traditional intermediate goods. Using a bivariate probit model, we give evidence that process and product innovation is not generally mutually supportive in the case of small manufacturing subcontractors. The results show that the probability of innovating in process or product is positively affected by subcontracting of supply. The research also demonstrates that process and product innovation is reinforced by different inter-organizational practices and tools as well as distinct absorptive capabilities of subcontractors...|$|R

The semantic interrelationships between primitive image features are exploited by perceptual grouping to extract structure to detect the presence of manmade objects. Segmentation and detailed object representation are not required. The system analyzes each image to extract features that are strong evidence {{of the presence of}} these objects. These features are generated by the strong boundaries typical of manmade structures: straight line segments, longer linear lines, coterminations, "L" junctions, "U" junctions, parallel lines, parallel groups, "significant" parallel groups, cotermination graph, and polygons. A K-nearest neighbor framework is employed to classify these features and retrieve the images that contain manmade objects. Results are demonstrated for two databases of monocular outdoor images.

40|$|Landscape {{and related}} {{environmental}} works are discussed {{as an integral}} and essential aspect of most land development projects, whether they are building or civil works, environmental protection, rehabilitation or landscape beautification. Problematic contractual issues that regularly arise in landscape contracting {{from the use of}} standard forms of construction contracts for pre-main contract, in-main contract and post-main contract landscape work are identified and discussed. These forms of contracts have essentially been written for traditional building and engineering works and are shown to be inadequately addressing the unique contractual aspects relating to landscaping works. The study focuses on the issues to be addressed in a contract between an employer and a landscape contractor for work to be undertaken before the main construction contractor has been appointed and on landscape subcontract work undertaken during the construction under the main contract. It addresses the problems surrounding the contractual practical termination of the landscape subcontract, the defects liability period and interim landscape maintenance as well as landscape maintenance work after the landscape installation has reached final completion. The study points towards an appropriate form of contract for use in conjunction with the JBCC contract system to provide for the particular requirements of landscape contracting. It indicates the necessary compatibility between landscape subcontractual requirements and the JBCC Nominated/Selected <b>Subcontract</b> <b>Agreement.</b> This required compatibility warrants a revision of or an addendum to the JBCC document. The requirements for a landscape maintenance contract, for use after termination of the landscape installation (sub) contract, are shown to be sufficiently different from the installation contract to warrant changes or addenda to the standard construction contract form. From a review of literature on the landscape contractual environment in South Africa and a study of contracts commonly used in South Africa, pertinent landscape contractual issues are identified for the three phases in which landscape and related environmental works are performed, i. e. before the main construction contract, during the main construction contract and during the landscape maintenance period after completion of the main contract. These issues are formalised and tested for validity and relevance by means of a survey conducted amongst developers and owners of building and engineering works, contractors and professional consultants. The research is summarised, findings and conclusions {{for each of the three}} landscape works phases are presented and recommendations made to address the confirmed contractual problematic issues. The survey confirms the JBCC suite of contracts as the most widely used for landscaping contracts in South Africa and the recommendations therefore focus thereon. The study concludes with a proposal for an addendum to the JBCC’s Nominated/Selected <b>Subcontract</b> <b>Agreement</b> entitled “General and specific conditions of subcontract for landscape and related works” and recommendations for further study of related issues identified in the survey but which fall outside the focus of this study.

Experiments with vortex generator jets (VGJs), conducted in AFRL‟s low-speed cascade at Wright-Patterson AFB, have demonstrated dramatic reductions in separation losses. Before flow control can {{become an integral part}} of LPT design, research must be conducted in more realistic engine conditions. This can best be accomplished through a combined experimental and computational program that uses both tools in a complementary fashion. Such a program was initiated at BYU in 2007 to better understand the basic physics of the separation control phenomenon and establish the quantitative links between the underlying flow physics and LPT performance under a variety of conditions. A new, high performance LPT blade design (L 1 A) was received from AFRL. CFD was used to design a new 3 -passage cascade facility with the L 1 A blade. The new cascade was completed at Ohio State University under a <b>subcontract</b> <b>agreement</b> between BYU and OSU since the PI moved to OSU in July 2007.

The main advantages of qualitative surveys are {{that they are able}} to catch the “business climate”; are very timely and quite inexpensive; are more robust against misreporting than traditional surveys. A number of statistical techniques allow converting the results of qualitative surveys in quantitative indicators. In general, the survey was a successful experiment that shed some light on the structure and dynamics of the Albanian economy. In particular, the survey confirmed that Italy and Apulia are among the most interesting markets for the Albanian firms, and vice versa, also thanks to <b>subcontracting</b> <b>agreements.</b> Also, many Albanian firms declared to compete with Italian firms on the same markets. The majority of respondents seem to have balanced and “modern” relationships with the bank system, even though the local small Albanian banks seem to be unable to follow the fast evolution of the most dynamic firms. This fact suggests the need for restructuring the Albanian credit sector. The survey confirmed that Albanian economy is fast growing, and that entrepreneurs are more optimistic about the future, compared to their European counterparts, at least just before the worsening of the ongoing world financial crisis. In any case, a number of firms complained for some credit restriction. Finally, the network of interviewers and respondents established during the survey can be exploited in the next years to gather timely information on the evolution of the Albanian economy during 2008 summer. ...|$|R

40|$|Gas {{storage is}} a {{critical}} element in the natural gas industry. Producers, transmission & distribution companies, marketers, and end users all benefit directly from the load balancing function of storage. The unbundling process has fundamentally changed the way storage is used and valued. As an unbundled service, the value of storage is being recovered at rates that reflect its value. Moreover, the marketplace has differentiated between various types of storage services, and has increasingly rewarded flexibility, safety, and reliability. The size of the natural gas market has increased and is projected to continue to increase towards 30 trillion cubic feet (TCF) over the next 10 to 15 years. Much of this increase is projected to come from electric generation, particularly peaking units. Gas storage, particularly the flexible services that are most suited to electric loads, is critical in {{meeting the needs of}} these new markets. In order to address the gas storage needs of the natural gas industry, an industry-driven consortium was created [...] the Gas Storage Technology Consortium (GSTC). The objective of the GSTC is to provide a means to accomplish industry-driven research and development designed to enhance operational flexibility and deliverability of the Nation's gas storage system, and provide a cost effective, safe, and reliable supply of natural gas to meet domestic demand.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{international}} economic integration has been continuously reinforced {{over the past}} decade. Such phenomenon is especially visible at the regional level, {{with the increase of}} Regional Integration Agreements (RIA), such as Mercosur, ASEAN, NAFTA and the project of European Union (EU) Eastern enlargement. Trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows are generally recognised as the two main channels of economic integration. Consequently, the most relevant issues in the debate on RIA relate to trade creation, trade diversion and to the possible reallocation of FDI and the respective economic effects. Since the beginning of the negotiation process for the Eastern enlargement of the EU, trade and FDI have {{played an important role in}} the approximation of member states and applicants. CEEC' transition phase to a market economy may now be considered as completed, since the geographical reorientation of trade seems to have reached its limits. Industrial recovery and rapidly rising levels of productivity in these countries induced changes in the sectoral composition of output, which will in turn influence trade patterns. The flows of FDI to the CEEC and the establishing of <b>subcontracting</b> <b>agreements</b> with EU industrial firms have become substantial, and were crucial to the restructuring process of industrial production and of international trade. The implementation of production and distribution networks involving Eastern and Western European firms has contributed to a stronger integration of Eastern firms in the world economy, in spite of the fact that some forms of alliance have not generated the upgrade or the technological autonomy of these firms. In the context of the enlargement, there is a potential risk of generalization of such forms of industrial cooperation, contributing to an asymmetric integration of Europe. The CEEC' integration in the EU will promote a broad market liberalisation and a higher level of economic and monetary stability. The new competitive environment will reinforce the role of the market as a mechanism of economic adjustment and of efficient resource allocation. As a consequence, the process of industrial and entrepreneurial restructuring, and the sectoral and geographical reorientation of trade patterns of the countries involved will be reinforced...|$|R
30|$|Putting {{forward the}} idea of interfirm network {{relations}} has changed the traditional way of studying enterprises. Unlike the corporate governance modes of hierarchies or market, the operation of any interfirm network does not rely on prices or the mandates of formal authorities; instead, it derives from mutual trust, common interests, and shared reputation that have been created through interactions between enterprises {{over a long period}} of time (Podolny and Page 1998; Li 2010; Lin 2002).

The objective of the audit {{was to determine whether}} Los Alamos` consultant agreements contained adequate sole source justifications. The audit showed that Los Alamos may not have acquired some of its consultant agreements at the lowest possible cost because it did not prepare adequate sole source justifications for 17 sole source consultant agreements valued at $ 842, 900. This condition existed because: (1) requesters did not follow policies and procedures when preparing sole source justifications, (2) Los Alamos did not have an internal mechanism to reject consultant agreements that were not adequately justified, and (3) the Department did not review consultant agreements to evaluate the adequacy of sole source justifications.

40|$|Abstract. ‘International subcontracting’ (sous-traitance de marché or de {{services}} or sous-traité, sous-entreprise, Zulieferwesen or Zuliefervertrag, subappalto or subfornitura) {{refers to a}} widespread contractual practice of the modern construction industry, at {{the very core of}} the ‘self-made law of building industry’, which has so extensively contributed {{to the development of the}} lex mercatoria. As often described in literature, international <b>subcontracting</b> denotes an <b>agreement,</b> entered into by a contractor and a third party that undertakes to perform all or a part of the contractor’s obligations required by an employer under an actual or proposed cross-border construction contract. Reference hereby shall be made to private procurements only, since subcontracts related to public procurements almost exclusively involve administrative concerns, which deserve a separate appreciation. International subcontracts, because of the contractual connection to the construction contract, raise significant issues of private international law that require, subject to certain conditions, a deviation from the classic standard of neutrality and blindness of conflict rules in contracts. Indeed, only conflict rules likely to support the substantial private interests within the contractual connection can properly keep the focus on the functional unity that closely connects international subcontracts and construction contracts, which escape mechanical allocation by means of hard and fast conflict rules. To this purpose, a recent wave of scholarship should be taken into account, which suggests a functional approach to conflict rules, which focuses on the nature of the relationships between the parties, rather than on the territorial scope of the applicable rules, to achieve the application of the law ‘which is presumed to be most concerned with the party in need of protection’. ...|$|R
