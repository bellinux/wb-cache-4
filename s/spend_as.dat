5|$|After his {{marriage}} to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E

He was able to reveal his marriage following his commissioning.|$|E

5|$|During summer {{holidays}} {{with his family}} in Dublin he met {{and fell in love with}} Cherrie Matheson, a friend of one of his cousins and a member of the Plymouth Brethren. He proposed to her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> much time as possible outside Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} of an appropriation {{depends upon the}} city council's preferences; real-world appropriations can list hundreds of line item amounts. An appropriation is the legal authority for spending given by the city council to the various agencies of the city government. In the example above, the city can <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> much as $34 million, but smaller appropriation limits have also been established for individual programs and departments.|$|E
5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> much time as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Much of Suffolk's early {{activity}} in East Anglian local politics was probably at the instigation of his mother, Alice, {{and he would}} later <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> much {{of his adult life}} at her manor of Ewelme as he did at his own manors. Suffolk played a prominent role in Commissions of the Peace in Norfolk and Suffolk, and these became a permanent position from 1464. On at least two occasions, Suffolk attempted to affect the outcome of a local parliamentary election, and the appointment of the county sheriff. Furthermore, he was a justice of the peace in Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the later 1460s. He involved himself {{in some of the most}} controversial episodes in East Anglian society of the time, for instance, attempting to purchase part of the by-then somewhat infamous Fastolf inheritance in 1461. This was another occasion in fact where we may in fact see his mother's guiding hand at work, as she is known to have been canvassing for support at court for such an outcome, and even Margaret Paston believed her to be personally behind the attacks. Both of them were involved in a severe feud with the Paston family as a result of conflicting interests in the Fastolf inheritance. The duke also made other disputed (and in some cases outrightly illegal) claims to other properties in the region over the following decade, and in 1465, a group of his retainers destroyed the manor house of Hellesdon, ransacking its church. For these and other illegalities alleged by contemporaries, Suffolk escaped retribution, probably due to his royal connections. On the other hand, he was never able to use such connections to his advantage and persuade the king to intercede in any disputes on the duke's behalf.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{six months}} after filming began, Yuvan Shankar Raja left the project, {{because he could not}} <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> much time on this film as Selvaraghavan wanted. Subsequently, the role of the music {{director}} was handed to G. V. Prakash Kumar, for whom Aayirathil Oruvan became his biggest project to that point. Rambo Rajkumar, the film's stunt director, died in April 2009 and was posthumously praised for his action choreography. The film's music released two months later to much appraisal in a well-held audio release function. Soon after the filming finished, the lead actors moved onto other projects as did Selvaraghavan whilst post-production continued. In August 2009, Selvaraghavan divorced his wife, Sonia Agarwal with his close proximity to Andrea being a speculated cause. During the period, G. V. Prakash Kumar and Selva also worked on the music in Mumbai whilst re-recording was also held in Austria and London. Towards the end of the year, the film began to announce release date of Christmas which was later further delayed to coincide with the Pongal festival. A date clash occurred with Karthi's Paiyaa, with an eventual hearing leading to the Karthi's latter film being delayed. Throughout December 2009, release work began with a trailer and promotional songs being released on 13 December. The film was subsequently certified {{before the end of the}} year by the Central Board of Film Certification and settled with an adult rating, after Selvaraghavan refused to remove some gory scenes. On 31 December, it was announced that the film was sold worldwide for 350million rupees for theatrical, television and other rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies {{depending}} on the level of interest among investors, which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question. Firms can <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily, often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds, or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest. Other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer, with managers of less popular fund types (such as US and European venture fund managers in the current climate) finding the fundraising process more tough. It is not unheard of for funds to <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> long as two years on the road seeking capital, although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months.|$|E

50|$|About 3.8 {{million people}} in the United Kingdom have {{diabetes}} mellitus, but the charity Diabetes U.K. have made predictions that could become high as 6.2 million by 2035/2036. The NHS spent a daily average of £2.2m (€2.6m; $3.7m) in 2013 on prescriptions for managing diabetes in primary care, and about 10% of the primary care prescribing budget is spent on treating diabetes. Diabetes U.K. have also predicted that the National Health Service could be <b>spending</b> <b>as</b> much as 16.9 billion pounds on diabetes mellitus by 2035, a figure that means the NHS could be <b>spending</b> <b>as</b> much as 17% of its budget on diabetes treatment by 2035.|$|R

Soon after Genie's parents married, he prevented his wife from leaving home and beat her with increasing frequency and severity. Her eyesight steadily deteriorated due to lingering effects from the existing neurological damage, the onset of severe cataracts, and a detached retina in one eye, leaving her increasingly dependent on her husband.|$|E

25|$|Film {{companies}} will <b>spend</b> <b>as</b> much as {{several million dollars}} on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders. For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that {{was seen as the}} front-runner (The Hurt Locker eventually won).|$|E

25|$|The big offseason {{news for}} the team, however, did not involve players or the {{coaching}} staff. At the end of 2014, the team culminated years of searching for a site to construct a new stadium.

The team was prepared to build a stadium on the site for another $150 million. The bill was signed into law by the outgoing Mayor Vincent C. Gray, in his final days in office. D.C. United hoped to move into its new 'soccer-specific' stadium for the 2017 season, and prepared to play the team's final 2 seasons in RFK Stadium.|$|E
