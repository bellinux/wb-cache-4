25|$|Similar to {{many other}} countries, {{development}} of renewable electricity in Australia has been encouraged by government energy policy implemented in response to concerns about climate change, energy independence and economic stimulus. A key policy {{that has been in}} place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy development is a mandatory renewable energy target, which in 2010 was increased to 41,000gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations. This was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the Abbott Government with the agreement of the Labor opposition. Alongside this there is the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme, an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water and several <b>State</b> <b>schemes</b> providing feed-in tariffs to encourage photovoltaics. In 2012, these policies were supplemented by a carbon price and a 10billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects, although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the Federal Government.|$|E

2500|$|Feed-in tariffs {{have been}} enacted {{on a state}} by state basis in Australia to {{encourage}} investment in renewable energy by providing above commercial rates for electricity generated from sources such as rooftop photovoltaic panels or wind turbines. The schemes in place focus on residential scale infrastructure by having limits that effectively exclude larger scale developments such as wind farms. Feed-in tariffs schemes in Australia started at a premium, but have mechanisms by which the price paid for electricity decreases over time to be equivalent or below the commercial rate. All the schemes now in place in Australia are [...] "net" [...] schemes whereby the householder is only paid for surplus electricity over and above what is actually used. In the past, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory enacted [...] "gross" [...] schemes whereby householders were entitled {{to be paid for}} 100% of renewable electricity generated on the premises, however these programs have now expired. In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to harmonise the various <b>state</b> <b>schemes</b> and developed a set of national principles to apply to new schemes. Leader of the Australian Greens, Christine Milne, has advocated a uniform national [...] "gross" [...] feed-in tariff scheme, however this proposal has not been enacted.|$|E

50|$|As in {{the typical}} {{pre-emption}} case, the inquiry is whether there exists an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and <b>state</b> regulatory <b>schemes.</b> The existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant the pre-emption of the state statute. A <b>state</b> regulatory <b>scheme</b> is not pre-empted by the federal antitrust laws simply be-cause in a hypothetical situation a private party's compliance with the statute might cause him to violate the antitrust laws. A state statute is not pre-empted by the federal antitrust laws simply be-cause the <b>state</b> <b>scheme</b> might have an anti-competitive effect.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the fiscal {{impact of the}} pension reform adopted in Colombia in 1993, which established a fully funded, privately administered pension system alongside the existing pay-as-you-go <b>state</b> <b>scheme.</b> The reform increased the contribution rate and reduced {{the benefits of the}} <b>state</b> <b>scheme.</b> However, the fiscal cost of the reform was high, estimated at 1. 5 to 2. 3 percent of GDP annually over the next three decades. This reflects concessions made to special groups of public servants, the delay in making effective the new retirement conditions, and the minimum pension guarantee. A new generation of pension reforms needs to be adopted. ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{what sort}} of civil life will it be which awaits the soldier-workman? I suppose, if {{anything}} is certain, a plenitude, nay a plethora, of work is assured for some time after the war. Capital has piled up in hands which will control {{a vast amount of}} improved and convertible machinery. Purchasing power has piled up in the shape of savings out of the increased national income. Granted that income will at once begin to drop all round, shrinking perhaps fast to below the pre-war figures, still at first there must be a rolling river of demand and the wherewithal to satisfy it. For years no one has built houses, or had their houses done up; no one has bought furniture, clothes, or a thousand other articles which they propose buying the moment the war stops. Railways and rolling stock, roads, housing, public works of all sorts, private motor cars, and pleasure requirements of every kind have been let down and starved. Huge quantities of shipping must be replaced; vast renovations of destroyed country must be undertaken; numberless repairs to damaged property; the tremendous process of converting or re-converting machinery to civil uses must be put through; <b>State</b> <b>schemes</b> to deal with the land, housing, and other problems will be in full blast; a fierce industrial competition will commence; and, above all, we must positively grow our own food in the future. Besides all this we shall have lost at least a million workers through death, disablement, and emigration; indeed, unless we have some really attractive land scheme ready we may lose a million by emigration alone. In a word, the demand for labour, at the moment, will be overwhelming, and the vital question only one of readjustment. In numberless directions women, boys, and older men have replaced the soldier-workman. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, especially among the first three million, have been guaranteed reinstatement. Hundreds of thousands of substitutes will, therefore, be thrown out of work. With the exception of the skilled men who have had to be retained in their places all through, and the men who step back into places kept for them, the whole working population will have to be refitted with jobs. The question of women's labour will not be grave at first because there will be work for all and more than all, but the jigsaw puzzle which industry will have to put together will try the nerves and temper of the whole community. In the French army the peasant soldier is jealous and sore because he has had to bear the chief burden of the fighting, while the mechanic has to a great extent been kept for munition making, transport, and essential civil industry. With us it is if anything the other way. In the French army, too, the feeling runs high against the [...] "embusqué," [...] the man who--often unjustly--is supposed to have avoided service. I do not know to what extent the same feeling prevails in our army, but there is certainly an element of it, which will not make for content or quietude.|$|E

The Northern Territory offers only local feed-in tariff schemes. A uniform federal scheme to supersede all <b>State</b> <b>schemes</b> was proposed by Tasmanian Greens Senator Christine Milne, but not enacted. By mid-2011, Feed-in tariff in NSW and ACT had been closed to new generators, as the installed capacity cap had been reached. In NSW, both the Feed-in tariff and the cap were cut, due to the overly generous original settings. The new conservative Victorian government replaced the original Feed-in tariff with a less generous transitional Feed-in tariff of 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for any power generated excess to the generator's usage, pending the outcome of an inquiry by the Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission.
