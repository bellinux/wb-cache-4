25|$|A {{variety of}} sieve sizes are available. The {{boundary}} between {{sand and silt}} is arbitrary. According to the Unified <b>Soil</b> <b>Classification</b> System, a #4 sieve (4 openings per inch) having 4.75mm opening size separates sand from gravel and a #200 sieve with an 0.075mm opening separates sand from silt and clay. According to the British standard, 0.063mm is the boundary between sand and silt, and 2mm is the boundary between sand and gravel.|$|E
25|$|This article {{describes}} the genesis and composition of soil, the distinction between pore water pressure and inter-granular effective stress, capillary action of fluids in the soil pore spaces, <b>soil</b> <b>classification,</b> seepage and permeability, time dependent change of volume due to squeezing water out of tiny pore spaces, also known as consolidation, shear strength and stiffness of soils. The shear strength of soils is primarily derived from friction between the particles and interlocking, which {{are very sensitive to}} the effective stress. The article concludes with some examples of applications of the principles of soil mechanics such as slope stability, lateral earth pressure on retaining walls, and bearing capacity of foundations.|$|E

25|$|In Briggs' first {{professional}} position {{he was put}} in charge of the Physics Laboratory (later the Bureau of Soils) of the US Department of Agriculture. He was one of a new breed of multi-disciplinary scientists studying the biology and ecology of plant life. His research work was concentrated on water retention of soils and he was a founder of the science of soil physics. In 1906 he devised a <b>soil</b> <b>classification</b> technique called the moisture equivalent based on centrifuging, which is now thought of as the first Pedotransfer function. In the same year he also organized a biophysical laboratory that later became the Bureau of Plant Industry. Briggs worked with Homer Leroy Shantz on the effect of environment on the water uptake by plants, and was an early contributor to ecology.|$|E
500|$|Hagley sits on mostly flat {{land near}} the Meander River at an {{elevation}} of [...] above sea level. The land formation is largely alluvial with Lateritic podzolic soils, classified as dermosol under the Australian <b>Soil</b> <b>Classification</b> system. These soils date from the Tertiary Period, with some from the more recent Quaternary. Hagley was founded, and remains, an agricultural centre. Dairy and pea-farming prior to World War II {{have given way to}} poppies as the principal crop. These poppies are opium poppies grown for Tasmanian Alkaloids, in nearby Westbury.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Unified <b>Soil</b> <b>Classification</b> System (USCS), silts and clays are {{classified}} by plotting {{the values of}} their plasticity index and liquid limit on a plasticity chart. [...] The A-Line on the chart separates clays (given the USCS symbol C) from silts (given the symbol M). LL=50% separates high plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol H) from low plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol L). [...] A soil that plots above the A-line and has LL>50% would, for example, be classified as CH. Other possible classifications of silts and clays are ML, CL and MH. [...] If the Atterberg limits plot in the"hatched" [...] region on the graph near the origin, the soils are given the dual classification 'CL-ML'.|$|E

2500|$|Soils in {{the park}} are mostly coarse-textured and of poor quality, typical of the Canadian Shield. [...] The hilly western side (which {{includes}} all of the Highway 60 Corridor) has a stony fine sandy loam glacial till which holds water better than the very coarse outwash soils which dominate the eastern side. [...] The dominant <b>soil</b> <b>classification</b> on well drained forest soils is Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol. [...] The most common soil series on till upland is Monteagle, while Wendigo dominates the outwash area. [...] Classic podzol profile development with a well-defined eluvial (Ae) horizon is the rule; however, in some areas this horizon has been obliterated by disturbance such as earthworm activity. [...] Concerns about effects of non-native earthworms on park soil ecosystems have not yet led to the banning of worm bait, but anglers are urged to dispose of unused worms in garbage containers.|$|E

50|$|In 1860, in Mississippi, Eugene W. Hilgard {{studied the}} {{relationship}} among rock material, climate, and vegetation, {{and the type of}} soils that were developed. He realised that the soils were dynamic, and considered <b>soil</b> types <b>classification.</b> Unfortunately his work was not continued. At the same time Vasily Dokuchaev (about 1870) was leading a team of soil scientists in Russia who conducted an extensive survey of soils, finding that similar basic rocks, climate and vegetation types lead to similar soil layering and types, and established the concepts for <b>soil</b> <b>classifications.</b> Due to language barriers, the work of this team was not communicated to western Europe until 1914 through a publication in German by Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka, a member of the Russian team.|$|R
2500|$|The {{values of}} these limits {{are used in}} a number of ways. There is also a close {{relationship}} between the limits and properties of a soil such as compressibility, permeability, and strength.

Thus the Atterberg limits are not only used to identify the <b>soil's</b> <b>classification,</b> but it [...] allows for the use of empirical correlations for some other engineering properties.|$|R
50|$|Brown Earths are important, {{because they}} are {{permeable}} and usually easy to work throughout the year, so they are valued for agriculture. They also support a much wider range of forest trees than {{can be found on}} wetter land. They are freely drained soils with well-developed A and B horizons. They often develop over relatively permeable bedrock of some kind, but are also found over unconsolidated parent materials like river gravels. Some <b>soil</b> <b>classifications</b> include well-drained alluvial soils in the brown earths too.|$|R

[...] According to the USDA <b>soil</b> <b>classification</b> they belong to the Alfi sols, after the German <b>soil</b> <b>classification</b> if they were classified as Luvisols.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>classification</b> is {{a dynamic}} subject, from the {{structure}} of the system itself, to the definitions of classes, and finally in the application in the field. <b>Soil</b> <b>classification</b> can be approached from the perspective of soil as a material and soil as a resource.|$|E
