[...] The language of Sri Lanka Brahmi inscriptions has been mostly been Prakrit though some Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have also been found, such as the Annaicoddai seal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I say," [...] the boy broke out, [...] "don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it! I do {{hate being}} thanked, {{and there was}} nothing in {{swimming}} ten yards in a calm sea. Please don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it. I would rather you hit me, ever so much." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{that it was}} {{impossible}} to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about Mr. Shirley.|$|E
60|$|Alice {{was more}} and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> till the Pigeon had finished.|$|R
60|$|For {{these reasons}} {{if any one}} <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> than usually nasty about Mrs. Hauksbee, tell him {{the story of the}} Rescue of Pluffles.|$|R
50|$|The story's last paragraph:For these reasons, {{if anyone}} <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> than usually nasty about Mrs. Hauksbee, {{tell him the}} story of the Rescue of Pluffles.|$|R
60|$|But none of {{the others}} felt that they could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> {{definite}} than that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just that;--something {{peculiar}} to American ladies. They don't like--well; I don't want to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> {{that can be}} called fierce." ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{he could}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> the train steamed out, leaving the would-be young fakir {{staring at it}} in {{distress}} and consternation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Niver know'd its equal," [...] he continued, {{beginning}} to smoke, which operation, as the pipe did not [...] "draw" [...] well at first, {{prevented him from}} <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Please, do you mind," [...] she begged, [...] "not <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about Henry. You {{are only}} {{reminding}} me of things which I try {{all the time to}} forget." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{tears of}} {{gratitude}} that were gathering in Toby's eyes {{prevented him from}} <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more,</b> and then Mrs. Treat and Ella both kissed him, while Ben said, in a gruff tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{she could}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more,</b> they were {{interrupted}} by the entrance of Dr Lawrence. With a surprised look and smile he said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! Why, indeed!' said a very red-faced man, who {{had said}} nothing yet, and who looked {{extremely}} unlikely to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more.</b> 'Why shouldn't he?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear, {{those were}} your own words,' he replied, looking {{surprised}} in turn; 'but {{please do not}} let us <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's no use my <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it, but I {{think your}} father might have {{consulted}} me before {{he gave his}} consent to your going on such a hazardous journey as this." ...|$|R
60|$|With that reply, {{the doctor}} {{got up in}} a hurry to bring his visit to an end. He {{proposed}} to take to flight, he remarked facetiously, before Miss Henley wheedled him into <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt;--but they didn't, {{and it is}} no use <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it. Good-day, sir." [...] Then he flounced out of the room, {{impatient}} of {{that single}} word of rebuke which had been administered to him.|$|R
60|$|Milton {{was a great}} favorite, {{and he had no}} time to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> to Bettie as peace-maker. He reached Ed as soon as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] Thorne replied simply. [...] "Just now I can't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more,</b> {{except that}} in one way I'm sorry {{you were able to}} come." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more,</b> {{she turned}} away from him, {{and looked down at the}} pavement. He felt that his face was {{distorted}} with misery.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} them I'm flustrated," [...] said the old lady, [...] "and that is all that's the matter with me. But I'm not coming in to dinner, {{and there is no}} use of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it." ...|$|R
60|$|Tom obeyed, {{with some}} trembling; {{it was the}} first time his father had {{recognized}} him. But instead of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> to him, his father continued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at Mr. Glegg and the deeds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose there's no use in my <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> now; but I can't help {{pointing}} out that {{as head of the}} concern you have a certain duty to the shareholders which you seem inclined to disregard," [...] Carroll remarked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not in {{the habit}} of loafing," [...] Jet replied, just a trifle indignantly, and before he could <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> the short man added impatiently: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right!" [...] cried Phil Franklin. [...] "You've {{done enough}} for us already. You keep the things and don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose I {{know what}} you mean, Ada. Yes, it is quite true, and best for all parties; so we need not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Much {{comforted by}} this assurance, Brittles {{opened the door}} to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more,</b> and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.|$|R
60|$|Her lips trembled, {{but with}} an effort she {{commanded}} herself. They {{looked at one another}} steadily, it seemed for a very long time; in his eyes was the look of a hunted beast.... At last she turned away without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more,</b> and left him.|$|R
6000|$|Then Lynette {{lifted up}} her eyes toward Heaven. [...] "Alas," [...] quoth she, [...] "I see that never will I {{be rid of}} this kitchen knave until all the pride is beaten out of his body." [...] And after that they rode their way without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> at that time.|$|R
60|$|Billy Mink chuckled so that Longlegs heard him, {{and that}} didn't improve his temper a bit. But {{before he could}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more,</b> Little Joe Otter spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, please don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> about it!" [...] groaned {{the unfortunate}} bully. [...] "I -- that Frenchman put up this job all {{on his own}} hook." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Send him away," [...] John begged. [...] "We haven't {{finished}} yet. I won't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> {{to upset}} you. What I want now is some practical guidance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's done, Timothy, and I'm real thankful," [...] she said. [...] "I guess there'll {{be no need}} of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more.</b> Mr. Marshall is a {{fine young}} man, only a little thoughtless.

60|$|So {{in the end}} we {{established}} them in a pleasant little hollow by a spring just over the crest of the rise, where unless our flank were turned or we were rushed, they would be {{out of the reach of}} bullets. Moreover, without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> we gave to each of them a double-barrelled and loaded pistol.|$|R
5000|$|The Winslow is {{technically}} sentient {{and capable of}} speech, though rarely <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> than the informal, colloquial greeting [...] "Hi!", which it often enjoys repeating ad nauseam.
