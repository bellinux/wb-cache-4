5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done <b>something</b> <b>with</b> my life, you know? It meant something to someone.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At {{the time of its}} demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E

5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be <b>something</b> <b>with</b> a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS {{version was}} {{directed}} by Hironori Ishigami and planned and supervised by Tomie, while Hiroyoshi Umetani was the main planner and in charge of game balance, Shin-ichiro Tomie created the scenario and events, Tanaka worked on the presentation and assisted with the scenario, and Masayasu Yamamoto programmed the dungeons. In addition to Sugiyama, the Nintendo DS version's music was worked on by Hayato Matsuo. The idea of developing a Nintendo DS version started when Chunsoft was considering creating a series of Mystery Dungeon games for the Nintendo DS. Previous Mystery Dungeon titles came up in conversation: they considered doing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the Game Boy games, but decided against it {{as it would have}} required them to redraw all the art, leaving them to decide between working on the Super Famicom or the Nintendo 64 titles; they eventually settled on working on the Super Famicom title Shiren the Wanderer.|$|E

50|$|From a neurobiological perspective, {{there are}} three reasons that could cause a person to have hearing loss: either there is <b>something</b> wrong <b>with</b> the {{mechanical}} portion of the process, meaning the conductive portions of the ear (external and middle ear), or there is <b>something</b> wrong <b>with</b> the sensory portion of the process (inner ear or cochlea and related structures) or there is <b>something</b> wrong <b>with</b> the neural portion of the process, meaning the nerves or brain.|$|R

25|$|The {{reason this}} gives a stable {{distribution}} {{is that the}} characteristic function for the sum of two random variables equals {{the product of the}} two corresponding characteristic functions. Adding two random variables from a stable distribution gives <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the same values of α and β, but possibly different values of μ and c.|$|E
25|$|These {{functions}} are aggregated and then {{associated with a}} primary functional entity – for instance, nourishment of the tissues and maintenance of their moisture are seen as connected functions, and the entity postulated {{to be responsible for}} these functions is xuě (blood). These functional entities thus constitute concepts rather than <b>something</b> <b>with</b> biochemical or anatomical properties.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{not saying}} the whole {{audience}} {{gave us a}} standing ovation, but there was this sizable standing ovation there. And I thought: 'This is incredible, because no one's heard this number yet. This {{is the first time}} they're hearing it!' It obviously touched them, you know. And that was at the L.A. Forum, so I knew we were onto <b>something</b> <b>with</b> that one.|$|E

When one worked something on their computer and wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> their work, pressing the enter key would do the command they ordered. Another function is to create a space for next paragraph. When one typed and finished typing a paragraph and they wanted to have a second paragraph, they could press enter and it would do spacing.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the mere-exposure effect and {{decision}} making, Zajonc states {{that there has been}} no empirical proof that cognition precedes any form of decision making. While this is a common assumption, Zajonc argues that the opposite is more likely: decisions are made with little to no cognitive process. He equates deciding upon <b>something</b> <b>with</b> liking it, meaning that more often we cognize reasons to rationalize a decision instead of deciding upon it. Therefore, we make judgments first, and then seek to justify those judgments by rationalization.|$|E
25|$|The {{performances}} schedule {{consisted of}} three main parts, beginning with the supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger would play the final set of the night. The two bands united for only three performances onstage at the one time throughout the tour. The supporting artists varied from location to location. These artists included Epicure, Dan Kelly, Expatriate, Youth Group, The Scare, Nabarlek, Blue King Brown, The Beautiful Girls, <b>Something</b> <b>With</b> Numbers, Kev Carmody, Kisschasy, Andrew Morris, Wire MC and Street Warriors.|$|E

25|$|What {{the sale}} of these figures did {{was to make the}} bark paper a commodity. The paper was not sacred until and unless a shaman cut it as part of a ritual. The making of the paper and non ritualistic cutting did not {{interfere}} with the ritual aspects of paper in general. This allowed a product formerly reserved only for ritual to become <b>something</b> <b>with</b> market value as well. It also allowed the making of paper to become open to the population of San Pablito and not only to shamans.|$|E
25|$|All Time Low {{signed with}} Hopeless Records in March 2006 and {{released}} the Put Up or Shut Up EP in July of that year. The band's second album, So Wrong, It's Right, {{was released in}} September 2007. They began writing for their third album between tours. In February 2008, {{it was reported that}} All Time Low had collaborated on a song with Mark Hoppus of Blink-182/+44. The band connected with Hoppus after exchanging emails when a video of drummer Rian Dawson getting a Blink-182 tattoo was posted online. Hoppus' management contacted the band saying he wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the group, so they co-wrote a song with him.|$|E
25|$|Early {{correspondence}} {{shows that}} he always liked school, and was always seeking meaning—seeking to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> his life. In 1876, he {{had the chance to}} attend high school in Columbus, Wisconsin, which had opened that year. Like many youth, he struggled with what to do with his life. After attending a year of high school, he began to teach at a Hampden school, while continuing his studies. In 1879, he attended college at the Oshkosh Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh). He left there after only one year due to financial reasons, and took a job teaching in Columbus, Wisconsin. He hoped to earn enough money to go back to college.|$|E

50|$|Negative {{criticism}} means voicing {{an objection}} to <b>something,</b> only <b>with</b> {{the purpose of}} showing that it is wrong, false, mistaken, nonsensical, objectionable, or disreputable. Generally, it suggests disapproval of <b>something,</b> or disagreement <b>with</b> <b>something</b> - it emphasizes the downsides of something. Negative criticism is also often interpreted as an attack against a person (ad hominem). That {{may not have been}} the intention, but it can be interpreted that way.|$|R
50|$|The {{track is}} on the Exponents' 1992 studio album <b>Something</b> Beginning <b>with</b> C and also gives {{its name to the}} band's 2011 {{greatest}} hits album Why Does Love Do This to Me: The Exponents Greatest Hits. The 2013 deluxe edition of <b>Something</b> Beginning <b>with</b> C includes the original UK demo version of the song.|$|R
25|$|A loss of {{opportunity}} is {{another kind of}} loss that is represented in Albee’s play. Agnes has lost the opportunities of youth, of having another child. Agnes’s sister Claire has lost her opportunity at married life, having children, doing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> her life other than getting drunk. Julia, Agnes and Tobias’s daughter, has lost several marriages {{and the opportunity to}} have children. She has also lost her room, symbolic of having lost her childhood. Julia has also lost a brother, who died in his youth. This loss Agnes mourns as a loss of love. After the death of the child, Tobias and Agnes no longer attempted to have more children. This eventually led to the loss of their sexual life together.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} {{living with the}} Riglers, Genie's {{behavior}} and social skills improved {{to the point that}} she started going to first a nursery school and then a public school for mentally retarded children her age. The Riglers also taught her some basic self-help skills, including simple chores such as ironing, using a sewing machine, and preparing simple meals for herself. She made substantial progress with controlling herself both at home and in public, and although it was extremely hard to prevent her socially inappropriate masturbation she had almost entirely ceased it by the end of her stay. In February 1973 Curtiss recorded the first time Genie shared <b>something</b> <b>with</b> her, and while she continued to take things from other people her responses clearly indicated that she knew she was not supposed to.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} created in 1978 when Great American Recreation (GAR), the new owners of the {{recently}} combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>with</b> the ski area during the off season. Two years earlier, in 1976, they had followed the trend of many other ski areas {{at the time and}} opened a -long alpine slide down very steep ski trails. Gradually, Waterworld and Motorworld came together {{at the base of the}} mountain to form one of North America's earliest modern water parks, which was originally called the Vernon Valley Summer Park. They started out with two water slides and a LOLA race car track in the summer of 1978, and then more waterslides and a small deep-water swimming pool the next year, as well as tennis courts and a softball field. Finally, Motorworld was carved out of the swampy areas the ski area owned across Route 94. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides).|$|E
