The relevance of this method is conditioned by {{the results of the study}} of a repulsion phase in the performing of the standing jump by athletes of different qualifications. The conclusion about the importance of an optimal model of a jump based on biomechanical analysis is given, and the formation of athletes’ skills, using information technologies and the principle of urgent information, is discussed...|$|E

Experiments {{were carried out}} on <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> structures made of steel material, DH 36, which is used for outer shell of the vessels making transit through the polar region. A knife edge type striker was dropped down onto <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> structures. The temperatures of the <b>single</b> <b>frames</b> were set to- 30 °C,- 50 °C and room temperature. The deflection around the mid-point of the <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> was measured and numerically simulated using finite element model.

It consist of performing inpainting on input image using Enhanced Exemplar based algorithm and then converting it into high resolution using <b>Single</b> <b>frame</b> super resolution algorithm. Enhanced exemplar based algorithm fills selected target region with suitable patches from the surrounding image area. Once the input image is inpainted, it is then converted to high resolution using <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> super resolution algorithm. The <b>single</b> <b>frame</b> super resolution algorithm used in this approach {{does not require a}} predefined training set thus increasing its performance for its practical use...|$|R

In JPEG-LS environment, Edirisinghe’s line-based bit rate control (BRC) [29] and Jiang’s line-based BRC [30] have been proposed. However, these BRCs have insufficient image qualities in terms of consistency within one frame.|$|R

Had flat-topped non-pentaprism porroprism reflex and optical relay viewfinder, and rotary focal-plane shutter. Well-integrated compact design with excellent interchangeable lenses and large accessory system. The original non-SLR Olympus Pen (Japan) of 1959 helped give 35 mm still cameras that used the standard motion picture frame size of 35 mm film {{a burst of}} popularity. It ended by the late 1960s.
