40|$|The tundish {{working as}} a buffer and {{distributor}} of liquid steel between the ladle and continuous casting (CC) moulds. It plays {{a vital role in}} the performance of CC machine, Solidi fication of liquid steel and quality of productivity. Therefore it is necessary to control the flow pattern, heat transfer and inclusion particle movement of molten steel in the tundish [1]. Hence this paper targets to study the performance of tun dish by studying water volume fractions and validated against the Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) results obtained from available literature. The variation of time dependent concentration field is measured by PLIF. Due to special calibration procedure of the PLIF system the optical, geometrical and physical parameters {{do not have to be}} determined analytically, thus leading to reliable results. The experiments have shown that the mixing process correlates with th e quasi steady state flow pattern. Such information is important in steel production because the number of mixed slabs produced during <b>sequence</b> <b>casting</b> with a grade change is closely related to the mixing of the tundish melt. Hence in this paper PLIF measurements are used to validate numerical solutions of the mixing processes in water models of metallurgical reactor [2]...|$|E
40|$|Presence of {{non-metallic}} inclusions & macro-flaws (cracks, pin holes/blow holes, segregation etc.), {{in a large}} number, {{in first}} and last continuously cast (CC) slabs of a sequence of casting, makes the CC slabs inferior in quality. Due to this problem these slabs were being downgraded and a huge loss in net realization was observed due to {{the difference in the}} prices of downgraded and prime grade CC slabs of IF grade. A need was, therefore, felt to determine the optimum scarfing depth and optimum length of these slabs to upgrade them into prime quality. The paper highlights the effectiveness of ultrasonic techniques in detecting, measuring and analyzing macroflaws in these slabs. 6 MHz twin crystal (T/R) along with 2 MHz single crystal probes were used to study the number of high gain internally reflected signals (flaw echoes) to assess overall flaws / inhomogeneities. The study revealed that the optimum scarfing depth was 7 mm from both top as well as bottom in case of both first and last IF grade slabs of the <b>sequence</b> <b>casting.</b> This helped in converting the inferior slabs into the prime grade. The optimum useful slab length in first and last slabs of IF grade, that can be converted to prime grade, in 11 meters long slabs, will be 8 meters and 9 meters respectively...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the composition distribution that develops in continuously-cast steel during a grade change, an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly computational {{model has been}} developed. The model is fully transient and consists of three submodels, which account for mixing in the tundish, mixing in the liquid core of the strand, and solidification. The first submodel of mixing in the tundish consists of two plug flow zones, two back-mixing boxes, and two dead volumes. The second submodel solves a one-dimensional diffusion equation in series with two back mixing boxes to calculate concentration histories in the strand and the third submodel transforms these histories into slab compositions. The model has been calibrated using both concentration histories measured on tundish water models and calculations from a 3 -D model. It has then been verified with several sets of composition measurements along the surface and centerlines of slabs. The model is capable of tracking mixing phenomena for arbitrary tundish filling and casting speed histories. It {{has been used to}} compare the effects of different grade change procedures on the amount of intermixed steel, including standard <b>sequence</b> <b>casting,</b> flying tundish change, and insertion of grade separators. Mixing in the strand was found to be very important. Without a grade separator, a flying tundish change had very little benefit on reduced intermixing, for the typical conditions considered...|$|E

40|$|IMPF: 03. 39 RONO: 00 Microsporidia of {{the genus}} Dictyocoela are parasites of gammarid amphipod Crustacea. They {{typically}} exhibit low virulence and efficient vertical transmission and at least some strains are capable of feminising their hosts. Sequencing of a region of the 16 S rDNA of Dictyocoela spp. from various gammarid host species and localities in Europe and northern Asia indicates that Dictyocoela is genetically diverse and that different strains predominate in different host species. However, the presence of intermediate <b>sequences</b> <b>casts</b> doubt upon previous attempts to describe Dictyocoela spp. {{on the basis of}} rDNA divergence alone. Phylogenetic analysis provides little support for coevolution between gammarids and Dictyocoela. Furthermore, observations of heavily infected individuals, together with genetic evidence of recombination, suggest that some strains of Dictyocoela may be horizontally transmitted and are sexually reproducing. These findings suggest that Dictyocoela may be phenotypically, as well as genotypically, diverse, with the potential to exhibit a range of different interactions with its host populations.

Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment I would feel if my own daughter, Piper, were going through the same thing.|$|R

40|$|Background: In the post-genomic era, {{developing}} {{tools to}} decode biological information from genomic sequences is important. Inspired by affiliation network theory, we investigated gene sequences of {{two kinds of}} UniGene clusters (UCs) : narrowly expressed transcripts (NETs), whose expression is confined to a few tissues; and prevalently expressed transcripts (PETs) that are expressed in many tissues. Results: We explored the human and mouse UniGene databases to compare NETs and PETs from different perspectives. We found that NETs were associated with smaller cluster size, shorter sequence length, a lower likelihood of having LocusLink annotations, and lower and more sporadic levels of expression. Significantly, the dinucleotide frequencies of NETs {{are similar to those}} of intergenic sequences in the genome, and they differ from those of PETs. We used these differences in dinucleotide frequencies to develop a discriminant analysis model to distinguish PETs from intergenic sequences. Conclusions: Our results show that most NETs resemble intergenic <b>sequences,</b> <b>casting</b> doubts on the quality of such UniGene clusters. However, we also noted that a fraction of NETs resemble PETs in terms of dinucleotide frequencies and other features. Such NETs may have fewer quality problems. This work may be helpful in studies of noncoding RNAs and in validation of gene sequence databases...|$|R
40|$|The archaeal {{ancestor}} scenario (AAS) for {{the origin}} of eukaryotes implies {{the emergence of a}} new kind of organism from the fusion of ancestral archaeal and bacterial cells. Equipped with this “chimeric” molecular arsenal, the resulting cell would gradually accumulate unique genes and develop the complex molecular machineries and cellular compartments that are hallmarks of modern eukaryotes. In this regard, proteins related to phagocytosis and cell movement should be present in the archaeal ancestor, thus identifying the recently described candidate archaeal phylum “Lokiarchaeota” as resembling a possible candidate ancestor of eukaryotes. Despite its appeal, AAS seems incompatible with the genomic, molecular, and biochemical differences that exist between Archaea and Eukarya. In particular, the distribution of conserved protein domain structures in the proteomes of cellular organisms and viruses appears hard to reconcile with the AAS. In addition, concerns related to taxon and character sampling, presupposing bacterial outgroups in phylogenies, and nonuniform effects of protein domain structure rearrangement and gain/loss in concatenated alignments of protein <b>sequences</b> <b>cast</b> further doubt on AAS-supporting phylogenies. Here, we evaluate AAS against the traditional “three-domain” world of cellular organisms and propose that the discovery of Lokiarchaeota could be better reconciled under the latter view, especially in light of several additional biological and technical considerations...|$|R
