5000|$|This {{method is}} a based on rules and {{concepts}} adopted from the Selfhealing Network protocol. The {{idea behind the}} (DCPC) is as follows: each <b>spare</b> <b>link</b> has a state associated with it called a statelet {{with a number of}} states. The node sees each logical link with an incoming state and an outgoing state. The incoming state from the link to the node originates from an adjacent node that is connected by that link. Also each outbound state from a link has an incoming state which forms its precursor. Based on this idea, a number of statelets is sent throughout the network (broadcast) and forms a tree of states. [...] "Each node in the tree, is rooted at the precursor port from which the outgoing statelets are propagated." [...] This is called a state route. There are two node options in the algorithm namely Cycler and the Tandem, each having it specific role. The Cycler is a sender/chooser role, in this mode the Cycler sends and receives parts of a state it initiated. All of the nodes adopt this behavior and this is accomplished in a round-robin scheme. The other role is the Tandem, which works by mediating the state broadcasts competition with new rules and criteria not found in Selfhealing networks. Simply put, each node is allowed to explore the network and discover possible p-cycles. The Tandem role also dictates allowed discovery of p-cycles by the Cycler node type. Based on the DCPC, the p-cycles are self-organized in the spare capacity of the network and are found in a distributed way. The algorithm can be re-run each time a network change occurs to create an optimum use of spare capacity. For more information the reader is encouraged to read 9.|$|E

However {{it is possible}} for ABR to support real-time applications, such as multimedia applications, by taking advantage of the inherent traffic control capability of ABR and the adaptation ability of real-time applications. Using a proper switch traffic control algorithm, ABR queues in the switches can be kept within acceptable bounds and therefore a loose end-to-end delay bound can be guaranteed. FASTRAC is a simple, scalable, provably stable, explicit rate computation scheme for flow control in computer networks.

40|$|Various {{existing}} reconfiguration algorithms for {{array processors}} {{cannot be used}} efficiently for on-line reconfiguration of the array because they require a central processor to initiate and control the reconfiguration. In addition, most of the existing algorithms assume that the switching network is operationally fault-free. [...] This report presents an on-line reconfiguration scheme for array processors. The proposed algorithm can tolerate both processing element failure and switching network failure. The processing elements and switches are of a self-testing type and link failures are detected by the processing elements (by using parity bit checks). [...] The array is provided with a bottom row of spare cells and when a processing element detects either a self fault or a link failure, it invokes the reconfiguration. A downward global shift (for the particular column) is performed to accomplish the reconfiguration. A number of reconfiguration requests are generated by the processing elements and switch modules to facilitate the reconfiguration. The network is modified and links for propagation of reconfiguration request are added. This scheme makes full use of non-faulty partial results and it blocks the faulty partial results.

40|$|Structural fault {{tolerance}} (SFT) {{is the ability}} of a multiprocessor to reconfigure around faulty processors or links in order to preserve its original processor interconnection structure. In this paper, we focus on the design of SFT multiprocessors that have low switch and link overheads, but can tolerate {{a very large number of}} processor faults on the average. Most previous work has concentrated on deterministic k-fault-tolerant (k-FT) designs in which exactly k spare processors and some spare switches and links are added to construct multiprocessors that can tolerate any k processor faults. However, after k faults are reconfigured around, much of the extra links and switches can remain unutilized. It is possible within the basic node-covering framework, which was introduced by Dutt and Hayes as an efficient k-FT design method, to design FT multiprocessors that have the same amount of switches and links as, say, a two-FT deterministic design, but have s spare processors, where s @ 2, so that, on the average, k = Q(s) (k £ s) processor failures can be reconfigured around. Such designs utilize the <b>spare</b> <b>link</b> and switch capacity very efficiently, and are called probabilistic FT designs. An elegant and powerful method to construct covering graphs or CG’s, which are key to obtaining the probabilistic FT designs, is to use linear error-correcting codes (ECCs). We show how to construct probabilistic designs with very high average {{fault tolerance}} but low wiring and switch overhead using ECCs like the 2 D-parity, full-two, 3 D-parity, and full-three codes. This design methodology is applicable to any multiprocessor interconnection topology and the resulting FT designs have the same node degree as the non-FT target topology. We also analyze the deterministic fault tolerance for these designs and develop efficient layout strategies for them. Finally, we compare the proposed probabilistic designs to some of the bes...|$|E

While mounting sandbags around a tank had little effect against high-velocity anti-tank gunfire it was thought to provide standoff protection against HEAT weapons, primarily the German Panzerfaust anti-tank grenade launcher and the bazooka-derived Panzerschreck 88 mm calibre anti-tank rocket launcher. In the only study known to have been done to test the use of sandbags, on March 9, 1945, officers of the 1st Armored Group tested standard Panzerfaust 60s against sandbagged M4s; shots against the side blew away the sandbags and still penetrated the side armor, whereas shots fired at an angle against the front plate blew away some of the sandbags but failed to penetrate the armor. Earlier, in the summer of 1944, General Patton, informed by his ordnance officers that sandbags were useless and that the machines' chassis suffered from the extra weight, had forbidden the use of sandbags. Following the clamor for better armor and firepower after the losses of the Battle of the Bulge, Patton ordered extra armor plates salvaged from knocked-out American and German tanks welded to the turrets and hulls of tanks of his command.

Available bandwidth defined as a minimum <b>spare</b> capacity of <b>links</b> constituting a network path is an important QoS characteristic of the path. In this work we demonstrate {{a new approach to}} modeling available bandwidth behavior from a time-series analysis prospective. In particular, we introduce a notion of crossing probability - the probability that the available bandwidth drops below the QoS critical threshold for the period of time required for the real-time task execution. We estimate the "crossing probability" by an application of the ARCH 2 (AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model to the available bandwidth behavior. We characterize the network path by model coefficients β 0 and β 1, which may be evaluated and updated dynamically. We use these coefficients to quickly output the "crossing probability" for arbitrary values of the threshold and length of the real-time task.

We show how to construct k-FT g-SD hypercubes for values of k up to 16 and g = 0, 1, or 2. Many of these designs are shown to be link- or degree-optimal. We also propose a construction method that uses small k-FT g-SD designs as seeds to construct k-FT g-SD designs of larger sizes. This results in fault-tolerant hypercubes in which reconfiguration can be first done locally and then easily extended to the entire system. The small number of added links and nodes is shown to be useful not only in increasing the fault tolerance of the underlying hypercube, but also in reducing the average internode distance...|$|R
