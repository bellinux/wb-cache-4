40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of liquefaction is usually caused by dynamic factors {{where there is}} a mass of saturated soil sand. In order to prevent probable destruction of structures in such areas, prediction of liquefaction potential seems to be necessary. For the purpose of data collection, we need to sound boreholes and carry out many experiments, each of which requires expenditure of time and money. Therefore, prediction of liquefaction by using the existing data in <b>sounding</b> <b>leads</b> us to decreasing costs and efficiency programming and choosing sufficient area for our construction. Neural networks are intelligent systems that use specific processing characteristics of the brain such as: learning examples, ignoring errors in the data, and their parallel processing –these are not possible through current programming methods. The present study attempts to predict the potential of liquefaction through neural network approach by using data from sounding in the southeast part of Tehran. It is an area with 30 km 2 and a high level of underground water. The neural network in question, having one hidden layer, is trained and tested by some new data, based on standard penetration test, in order to ensure the efficiency operation of the network.

40|$|The {{underwater}} {{acoustic communication}} channel {{is regarded as}} a difficult channel, owing to its bandlimited character, long delay spread, and time variability. In order to characterize the delay-Doppler spread, in situ measurements of the time-varying impulse response are required. This can be realized by transmitting and recording dedicated probe signals such as a pseudorandom binary sequence or a chirp ping train. Unfortunately, when the channel is overspread, i. e., the product of delay spread and Doppler spread is greater than one, channel soundings are compromised. This paper investigates which parameters can still be extracted from an overspread channel, and what type of probe signal is preferred. To this end, at-sea channel soundings are used as well as synthetic data generated with a channel simulator. It appears that the Doppler spectrum can be measured properly in many environments, but not the power delay profile. As the extent of the delay-Doppler spread increases, binary-sequence and chirp <b>soundings</b> <b>lead</b> to markedly different channel estimates. ...|$|R
40|$|Navigational {{instruments}} {{from the}} bottom of the sea, 16 th to 19 th century In the last twenty years diving activities of private persons have increased considerably. This has lead to an increasing number of historical objects retrieved from ship-wrecks. Some wrecks have yielded navigational instruments. This article investigates the contribution diving has made to the knowledge of navigational equipment and what is still to be expected. The article concentrates on Dutch material dating from between the end of the 16 th century, marking the beginning of Dutch maritime expansion, and the beginning of the 19 th century. Among the objects from wrecks which gave considerable information are <b>sounding</b> <b>leads.</b> Especially interesting, both in number and variety, are the leads from the Dutch VOC ship Hollandia (sunk 1743). Compasses are among the instruments rarely found in wrecks. Probably this is mainly due to the materials of which they were made. Examples found are usually incomplete or disintegrated, due to seawater. Knowledge acquired from archives and printed sources indicates that several types of compasses, of which so far as known no copy survived on land, may still be found in wrecks. Many wrecks, both Dutch and foreign, have yielded dividers. By comparing those finds with our knowledge of what the Dutch East Indies Company ships were equipped with, we now have a fairly accurate insight in the types of dividers which were used on the ships of the Company. Much has been learned about instruments for the measurement of the altitude of heavenly bodies. The number of known mariner's astrolabes has, mainly through wreck excavation, increased from 21 in 1966 to 62 in the Spring of 1987. Among the recently found copies are several Dutch ones. They have taught us about the Dutch contribution to the development ofthese instruments. More finds could increase the still scanty information on Dutch makers. To a lesser extent, the same can be said about cross-staffs. Hardly more of these (73 known to the author in mid- 1987) than of mariner's astrolabes, have survived the ages. Many are kept in museums and are consequently in a reasonable condition. Nevertheless, staffs from wrecks have supplied additional information. E. g. from the wreck of the Dutch St. Michael (sunk 1747) in which a Dutch made cross-staff was found. It is the only staff presently known to be divided to a maximum accuracy of 2 '. The staff found in the wreck of the Spanish Nuestra Senora Atocha (sunk 1622) promises to be the missing link between existing cross-staffs from 1597 and 1677. Hardly spectacular but important are the parts of the oldest dated octant, found in the wreck of the Hollandia (1743). Among the miscellaneous instruments found in various wrecks are hour glasses, part of an 'astrolabium catholicum', a plane scale and parts of globes. These finds generally confirm existing knowledge from printed or archival sources. In conclusion it can be said that a close liaison between divers, historians and museum curators should be maintained. The aim should be to insure that divers keep up the search for historical objects, even if they represent little or no commercial value...|$|E
40|$|Water vapor in the {{atmosphere}} {{plays an important role}} in meteorological applications. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides accurate all-weather observations. The application of the existing GNSS infrastructure for atmosphere <b>sounding</b> <b>leads</b> to rather inexpensive and reliable measurements of the atmospheric water vapor. Observations from GNSS networks contain information about the spatial and temporal distribution of the water vapor. Therefore, the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) developed a water vapor tomography system to derive 3 -Dimensional (3 D) distributions of the tropospheric water vapor above Germany. The tomography makes use of the products provided by the GNSS processing center of the GFZ, where {{the atmosphere}} processing is currently limited to the Global Positioning System (GPS). Input data for the water vapor tomography are the GPS tropospheric products from about 300 ground stations. The GPS tropospheric products are Zenith Total Delay (ZTD), Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) and Slant Total Delay (STD). The accuracy of STDs is one of the important factors for the quality of the derived water vapor tomography. However, the Earth Parameter and Orbit System Software (EPOS), which is used to estimate the GPS-STDs at GFZ, provides only limited information about the accuracy of STDs. Three months of Water Vapor Radiometer (WVR) data are used to validate the GPS-STD and estimate its accuracy. By comparing the GPS-STD observations with systematic hemisphere scans of the WVR it could be shown that inhomogeneous atmospheric structures are reliably reproduced by the STDs. The validation has shown a high accuracy of the estimated STDs. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the water vapor tomography and to provide atmospheric water vapor products with good quality. A new tomographic algorithm based on a Kalman filter is added in the GFZ tomography system. The output is a 3 D humidity field with a temporal resolution of 2. 5 min and the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed states. The error covariance matrices for the observations and the covariance matrices for the uncertainty of the propagation are estimated in advance. The output has been validated with the Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (MART) tomography and radiosonde profiles. Besides the accuracy of STDs, the quality of the derived tomography is depending on many factors such as the spatial coverage of the atmosphere with slant paths and the spatial distribution of their intersections. This leads to temporal and spatial variations of the reconstruction quality. Independent observations are required to validate the generated water vapor tomography. One year of radiosonde data from the German Weather Service (DWD) have been used for the validation. The wet refractivity field of the tomography with about 50 km horizontal resolution and 500 m vertical resolution has been interpolated to the RS profiles. The validations have been carried out point-by-point and also for the whole profile. A new technique has been developed to quantify the differences between humidity profiles. By considering the shape of the whole profile much more reliable conclusions can be drawn than by comparing only point-by-point differences. This method can be applied to improve the algorithms of GPS tomography. Further attempts have been made to analyze the long-term IWV time series. Since the GPS data are available for more than 10 years, the GPS-IWV time series are used for climatological studies and they will become more important in future when long time series will be available. Trends have been calculated for the period 2002 - 2012 using the IWV from the German GPS ground-based network. Different methods (per station or per region) have been used to analyze the IWV time series. The methods will be helpful for meteorologists to analyze variations of the local or regional weather. The investigations demonstrated that the ZTD/IWV and STD/SIWV could describe the amount of water vapor and its distribution in the troposphere reliably. Especially the spatial and temporal variation of the water vapor distribution in the troposphere can be estimated with the tomographic technique. The quality of the derived 3 D humidity fields has been checked with the help of radiosonde data. In general the result of the validation is good but it shows a need to improve the quality of the water vapor tomography. With the development of GNSS (more satellites and more GNSS stations) and with improved algorithms (e. g., introduction of radiometer or radiosonde data), the tomography will in future provide a more complete view of the water vapor distribution {{in the atmosphere}}. In addition with increasing of GNSS time series, they can also be used for long-term studies. The GNSS meteorology can be widely applied in many fields, e. g., nowcasting, severe weather monitoring and data assimilation...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Studies on ancient navigation have traditionally derived their information from ancient geographers and the authors of various periploi ("sailings around"), a type of coast-pilot written in and after the fifth century B. C. The resultant paradigm portrays a scene in which ships voyage from headland to headland, never traversing the open sea, and rarely, if ever, sail intentionally past sunset. The investigation presented here, however, offers a different scenario, one which characterizes ancient seafarers as both naturalists and pragmatists, devoted to accurate wayfinding not only on coasting voyages, but also on the open sea. To this end they became students of their maritime environment, making a science of winds (dividing and subdividing them into a wind "compass") and wind prediction, and compiling a body of weather lore that still rings true today. At times, contrary to ancient conventions and modern interpretation of the sailing season, their confidence emboldened them to extend their activity into the winter months. They acquired wayfinding clues by observing the behavior of shore-sighting birds and birds in their natural environment. They also invented aids to navigation: the crow's nest, a Late Bronze Age innovation, extended the viewer's horizon by several miles and helped ships avoid dangerous reefs on approaches to land; the <b>sounding</b> <b>lead</b> indicated depth and type of bottom; man-made seamarks and landmarks (temples, shrines, funeral mounds, towers, and lighthouses) offered invaluable position-finding information. Sailing past sunset, a very-well documented practice in antiquity, presented a host of additional challenges and hazards. Their response, quite logically, was {{to make sense of the}} night sky. Systems of celestial navigation eventually evolved, facilitated by the Mediterranean's clear summer skies: the circumpolar constellations offered a convenient orientation; their height above the horizon provided rough positions north or south of predetermined reference points; and evidence suggests that ancient seafarers utilized guide-stars and "star paths" (a Polynesian practice) to point them in the direction of their destination. In addition to presenting the subject, there is also a case to be made that ancient seafarers invented wayfinding instruments and practices that allowed them to sail safely upon the open sea, day or night...|$|R

The team recovered a number of artefacts consistent with an early 16th-century shipwreck, including lead covered iron shot, stone cannonballs of varying sizes and a <b>sounding</b> <b>lead.</b> These expeditions were conducted under a permit from the Oman Government. No further investigation of the site was conducted {{primarily because of the}} considerable complexity and cost of supporting a full archaeological excavation in this remote location. These challenges were addressed in 2013 by David L. Mearns, owner and director of BWR, and an agreement was made with Oman's Ministry of Heritage and Culture (MHC) to jointly conduct and co-manage the project on a collaborative basis. The MHC is the official government body responsible for the protection of Oman's underwater cultural heritage and their management of this project represents the first government-led archaeological excavation of an historic wreck-site in Omani waters. Supplemental funding and support was provided by National Geographic's Expeditions Council and the Waitt Institute. Comprehensive geophysical surveys of Ghubatt ar Rahib bay and archaeological excavations of the near-shore wreck site took place in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The underwater archaeology was directed by Dave Parham, Associate Professor in Maritime Archaeology at Bournemouth University, while the investigation of possible burial sites on land was directed by Dr. Bruno Frohlich, Emeritus Scientist from the Smithsonian Institution. Over the 3 field seasons the expeditions teams of 12 to 18 persons spent a total of 50 days diving and working on site and accumulated 1,079 hours underwater. More than 2,800 artefacts have been recovered from the site including a ship's bell indicating a date of 1498, an important copper-alloy disc marked with the royal coat of arms of Portugal and the esfera armilar (armillary sphere) - a personal emblem of Dom Manuel I, and an ultra rare silver coin known as the INDIO first minted in 1499 by the Portuguese specifically for trade with India. The artefacts also included a large quantity of ordinance (stone, iron and lead shot, and 19 copper-alloy breech chambers), which underscores the military mission of the Sodré squadron. On 15 March 2016 the MHC formally announced the discovery of the wreck site at a press conference in Muscat in conjunction with publication of an interim report that same day in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology by Mearns, Parham and Frohlich. A project specific website was also launched. The IJNA article, which relies on extensive scientific testing of the artefacts and contributions from numerous other experts, also concludes that the probable source of the remaining, un-salvaged wreckage is from Vicente Sodré's nau Esmeralda.|$|R
40|$|Evidence for {{hydrothermal}} {{activity on the}} eastern SWIR has been reported previously {{in the form of}} optical-backscatter anomalies interpreted to indicate the presence of hydrothermal plumes. Here, I report on a brief reconnaissance analysis of the geochemical composition of core-top samples collected from sites both beneath and away from those previously-reported plume signals to determine whether evidence for fall-out of hydrothermal plume material is discernible. Samples used for this study were collected using the deep-diving submersible SHINKAI 6500 in 1998 and from the tallow-coatings applied to <b>lead</b> <b>sounding</b> lines, 111 years earlier, aboard HMS Egeria. The data indicate hydrothermal input to all but one of eight SHINKAI 6500 cores {{along the length of the}} eastern SWIR rift-valley, including the site of strongest previously reported plume anomalies. Comparison with a recent MAR study suggests that the cores analyzed here, however, may predominantly lie distant from any current or recently-active source of venting...|$|R
60|$|All {{truth is}} worth knowing and labouring after. No {{one can tell}} to what useful results the {{discovery}} of even the smallest portion of truth may lead. Some of the most serviceable and remarkable inventions of modern times {{have been the result}} of discoveries of truths which at first seemed to have no bearing whatever on those inventions. When James Watt sat with busy reflective mind staring at a boiling kettle, and discovered the expansive power of steam, no one could have for a moment imagined that in the course of years the inventions founded on the truth then discovered would result in the systematic driving of a fleet of floating palaces all round the world at the rate of from twelve to fifteen or twenty miles an hour! Instances of a similar kind might be multiplied without end. In like manner, deep-sea <b>sounding</b> may <b>lead</b> to great, as yet unimagined, results. Although yet in its infancy, it has already resulted in the discovery of a comparatively shallow plateau or ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean, rising between Ireland and Newfoundland; a discovery which has been turned to practical account, inasmuch as the plateau has been chosen to be the bed of our electric telegraph between Europe and America. The first Atlantic cable was laid on it; and although that cable suffered many vicissitudes at first, as most contrivances do in their beginnings, communication between the two continents was successfully established. Soundings taken elsewhere showed that somewhat similar plateaus existed {{in other parts of the}} Atlantic, and now the whole of Western Europe is being bound more firmly, by additional cables, to the eastern seaboard of America.|$|R
