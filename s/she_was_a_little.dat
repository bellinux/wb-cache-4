5|$|In August 1900, the {{commander}} of German forces at Victoria (present-day Limbe) appointed Atangana interpreter for 500 Bulu hostages, who were being pressed into labour. Atangana kept the post {{for six months and}} took up extra duties as a nurse. The colonisers next sent Atangana to Buea to work as an office clerk. At some point between the end of his schooling in Kribi and the end of his service in Victoria, Atangana met Marie Biloa, a woman from a village called Mekumba. Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older and living as a kept woman by a German functionary, Atangana married her. She would eventually bear him two children: Jean Ndengue and Katerina (or Catherine) Edzimbi.|$|E
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, a {{masquerade}} party ensues in {{the opera}} house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul. The event is interrupted once {{again by the}} Phantom, who is dressed as Red Death. The Phantom brings his own composition, Don Juan Triumphant, and orders the managers to stage the opera. Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. At {{the sight of the}} engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him the story of the Phantom's past. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.|$|E

25|$|Another {{account of}} this story was {{published}} in 1929. In this account the Marlborough was found adrift in January 1899 by the ship British Isles under Captain Hadrop. The British Isles was purportedly sailing from Lyttleton to England. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> north of Cape Horn by Staten Island when the Marlborough was sighted and boarded. This story was discounted {{because there were no}} reports of the British Isles visiting Lyttleton in the time period, and it was improbable that Hadrop would have waited so many years to report the sighting.|$|E
25|$|Katarina {{first met}} the Seventh Doctor when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. As the Doctors looked different, she was unaware {{that they were}} the same person. She spoke to him of her {{ambition}} to serve as a handmaid to a priestess because her poor family could not afford to feed her any longer. The Doctor gave her family a gold coin, which would feed them for a year. However, on learning Katarina's name, the Doctor realized that she would die young as he has already witnessed it in his personal timeline.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} romantic feelings, Bianca helps JR win Marissa back by {{suggesting}} romantic dates and gifts {{that he can}} give to Marissa. Bianca does all this because she realizes that Marissa may never reciprocate the same feelings for her. One of the gifts that Bianca gives to JR for Marissa is a music box. This music box plays a song that Marissa's adoptive father used to sing to her when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. JR gives the music box to Marissa while at the park with the kids. While Marissa is listening to the music box, Bianca watches from afar how much Marissa enjoys the gift and walks away.|$|E

25|$|Wagner {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Bensenville, Illinois, and began to play sandlot ball with the boys of her {{neighborhood}} when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. At age 15, she attended Bensenville Community High School, where she heard about Philip K. Wrigley and his remarkable experiment in creating a women professional baseball league during World War II. Wrigley, who was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, decided to found the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball. By then, the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. The league started its first season in 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox, and each team was made up of fifteen girls. Wagner was allocated to the Kenosha Comets, where she played her entire career in the circuit.|$|E
25|$|Expanding her oeuvre, in 2010 Russell {{placed in}} the top three at the Jamaican High School in the 100 metres hurdles as well as her long jump speciality. Taking in {{combined}} track and field events, she entered the pentathlon at the 2010 CARIFTA Games and won by a margin of nearly 400 points. She still entered the long jump individually, and placed fourth. The Jamaican junior championships saw her win a long jump/400 metres sprint double. International junior medals followed at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships, where the 16-year-old Russell took the 400m silver medal win a personal best of 53.68 seconds and helped the Jamaican 4Ã—400 metres relay team to the gold medals. She was selected for the same events at the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics. Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower in the 400m individual event, being eliminated in the semi-finals, she won a medal with the Jamaican team, which ran its fastest time of the year (3:32.24 minutes) to claim the bronze medals. She competed internationally in her fourth different event of the season, choosing the long jump for the 2010 Youth Olympics and placing seventh in the competition.|$|E

The crack, having first appeared in Amy's bedroom when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, has been a recurring theme; in [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] the Doctor discovers it has the power to erase things from existence, the reason Amy cannot remember the Daleks.|$|E
500|$|As part of Why Not? with Shania Twain, she {{arranged}} a session with music producer David Foster, hoping to collaborate on [...] "Today Is Your Day". Although she felt skeptical, Twain visited vocal coach Eric Vetro {{to prepare for}} her session with Foster. Twain and Vetro executed vocal exercises to loosen up the tension and tightness in her vocal chords. [...] "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has {{to take all of}} that tension and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it.

He also opined that Twain was ready to return to her music career. Twain learned beneficial vocal techniques and appreciated Vetro's understanding of her psyche.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Jo {{has been}} generally positive. Diana Steenbergen of IGN favored Jo from the beginning, deeming her [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't {{have a lot}} of in their lives right now". She also believed that Jo and Dean had a [...] "natural chemistry" [...] between them, which continues even with her reappearance in the fifth season. However, Steenbergen was confused by Jo's anger at Sam and Dean over John Winchester's involvement in her father's death, feeling that the show's producers may have added it to the story as an excuse for Jo's removal from the series. While Tina Charles of TV Guide was at first unsure about the character, she wrote that by the episode [...] "No Exit", [...] "Tal did step things up and kinda won me over". She believed that while Jo did not make a good love interest for Dean, she was good in a [...] "sisterly or friendly fellow-ghostbuster way", deeming her as [...] "someone they can count on in a pinch". Overall, Charles felt that Jo [...] "fit into that world, whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> overzealous or not".|$|E

500|$|Achieving Darla's {{look was}} a {{struggle}} for Benz. She said: [...] "Taking that makeup off, {{it was like having}} six layers of skin ripped off your face every time. It was miserable and the contact lenses were terrible. I donâ€™t wear contacts and I donâ€™t know how people do it, sticking things in their eyeballs all the time." [...] The character's sense of fashion is vital to understanding her past. Benz says Darla is [...] "dressed to the nines" [...] in every time period in which she lives, and [...] "she fully goes after a certain look. If sheâ€™s going to be living during the Boxer Rebellion time, sheâ€™s got the big Gibson Girl hair style and the beautiful kimono-style clothes." [...] Benz points out that in the Buffy pilot episode, Darlaâ€”attempting to dress like a high school studentâ€”exaggerates it with a [...] "little twist", wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform instead. [...] "I think I influenced Darla fashion-wise in the second season of Angel where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more classic-looking and tailored," [...] Benz says, explaining she collaborated with the costume designer to transition Darla into a [...] "hipper look" [...] when she became a vampire again. Darla shockingly becomes pregnant in the third season of Angel. In an interview with the BBC, Benz admitted: ...|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someoneâ€™s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'â€”I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submergedâ€”like her hospital colleaguesâ€”under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E
