5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger <b>social</b> <b>good.</b> Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} growing {{interest}} among economists {{on the effect of}} diversity on the provision of <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> and the stock of social capital. Indeed, in the workplace, cooperation, trust, and other <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> may be important elements of the smooth functioning of an office, but firm owners ultimately care about an office’s performance, as reflected in revenues, costs, and profits. We explore this next logical question: how does diversity affect ultimate performance? We have a unique data set from a firm which operates numerous small offices in the United States and abroad. They have provided us with eight years of individual-level employee survey data, which measure quantities such as level of cooperation, as well as office-level measures of diversity and performance over that period. We find some evidence that more homogeneous offices enjoy higher levels of <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> provision but that those offices do not perform any better and may actually perform worse. We speculate that one possible reason that the more homogeneous offices do not perform better despite higher levels of <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> provision is {{that they do not have}} as diverse a portfolio of skills, talents, and interests on which to draw. diversity, <b>social</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Marx’s {{conception}} of communism is {{interpreted as a}} theory of politics and historical transformation in which social actors are moved by a drive to freedom. In this view communism {{is a process of}} freedom expansion. By focusing on widely defined consumption choices, the extent of an individual’s freedom is identified in the opportunity set delimited by his budget and time constraints. <b>Social</b> <b>goods,</b> i. e., those provided without rivalry and without exclusion, are allocated {{on the basis of the}} criterion “to each according to his needs” and, if they are financed by nonregressive taxation, also on the basis of the criterion “from each according to his abilities. ” Thus a process of growth of <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> supply turns out to be a process of construction of communism and, since <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> remove some budget constraints to choice options, a process of expansion of individual freedom. <b>Social</b> <b>goods</b> are mostly provided by the state to allow people to fully enjoy constitutional liberties and social rights, but their provision is strongly affected by the evolution of class struggle. In fact the privileged classes tend to oppose a process that raises their tax burden, whilst the unprivileged ones tend to favor a development that extends their freedom. Since the majority of citizens in all capitalist systems have an income which is lower than the mean, communism tends to grow with the strength of democratic movements...|$|R

25|$|In the 1830s, at {{the height}} of the Chartist movement, there was a general {{tendency}} towards reformism in the United Kingdom. This prompted much new legislation to be passed, such as the Parliamentary Reform Act 1832, the Factory Act 1833, the first instance of a Government grant for education in the same year and the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The Capitalist economic model had created shift patterns which left workers with free time, in contrast to the agrarian model, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers’ free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.

25|$|The cost of {{insurance}} has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been {{the development of the}} medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a <b>social</b> <b>good,</b> one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care. The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it. Likewise, critiques {{of insurance}} markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the distribution of}} <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> within a political community relates to decisions on membership boundaries.

Departing from both accounts, the author concludes that actual changes in the pool of participants in practices of creation and exchange of <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> pressure a political community to redefine its distributive patterns and, accordingly, the boundaries of its formal political membership. This claim will be supported by the analysis of threshold cases decided by the EU Court of Justice, in which EU citizenship is invoked with the atypical purpose of granting rights to a specific group of non-formal members. The reason for extending the protection provided by EU citizenship to these non-formal members is that they are already deeply embedded in practices of creation and exchange of <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> that concur to realise the distributive plan to which the EU is committed...|$|R

Clan associations met all the physical and social needs of the Chinese majority, and the result was the creation of segmented Chinese immigrant communities separated by kinship ties and operating independently of the state, each conducting their own death rites and running their own cemeteries.

There were urgent demands on space in land-scarce Singapore in the name of national development. In the words of E. W.

Frank notes that [...] "the moral-psychological traits of his character incorporate this antinomy between instinctive kindness, sympathy, and pity {{on the one hand}} and, on the other, a proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into a contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd". Raskolnikov's inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in a utilitarian-altruistic justification for the proposed crime: why not kill a wretched and [...] "useless" [...] old moneylender to alleviate the human misery? Dostoyevsky wants to show that this utilitarian type of reasoning and its conclusions had become widespread and commonplace; they were by no means the solitary invention of Raskolnikov's tormented and disordered mind. Such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of Raskolnikov's character and, likewise, contempt for the lower qualities in Man and for His ideals. He even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of a Napoleonic personality who, in the interests of a higher <b>social</b> <b>good,</b> believes that he possesses a moral right to kill.

This is {{the journal}} {{version of a}} study of the {{worldwide}} used-clothes trade – with focus on Sweden’s participation in it – undertaken for Sida (the Swedish foreign aid agency). We looked at both theoretical and empirical effects of the commercial used-clothes trade, and at the effects of subsidizing it. We basically concluded that, while markets work, {{there was no need to}} subsidize them under normal conditions because – even given the goal of helping the poor – there might well be better uses of the money. There might be an argument for subsidized used-clothes exports in dealing with an emergency where supply had broken down, but even then most NGOs prefer to supply new clothes. Paper 2 : A Model of Dynamic Balance Among the Three Spheres of Society – Markets, Governments, and Communities – Applied to Understanding the Relative Importance of Social Capital and <b>Social</b> <b>Goods</b> This paper revisits old questions of the proper subject and bounds of economics: Does economics study “provisioning”? or markets? or a method of reasoning, self-interested rational optimization? A variety of scholars and others in many fields make use of a taxonomy of society consisting of three “spheres”: markets, governments, and communities. It is argued here that this tripartite taxonomy of society is fundamental and exhaustive. A variety of ways of understanding this taxonomy are explored, especially Fiske’s (1991, 2004) Relational Models theory. Then – after communities and their products, <b>social</b> <b>goods,</b> are defined more thoroughly – a visual model of interactions among the three spheres is presented. The model is first used briefly to understand the historical development of markets. The model is then applied to understanding how economic thinking and market ideology, including the notion of social capital, can be destructive of communities and their production of <b>social</b> <b>goods</b> (and their production of social capital as well). It’s not possible to measure these effects monetarily, so calculating precisely “how this affects results” in a standard economic model is impossible. Nevertheless we could better prepare students for real-world analysis, and better serve our clients, including the public, if – whenever relevant, such as in textbook introductions and in benefit/cost analyses – we made them aware of the limitations of economic analysis with respect to communities and <b>social</b> <b>goods.</b> The three-spheres model offered here, based on Fiske’s Relational Models theory, facilitates this awareness.
