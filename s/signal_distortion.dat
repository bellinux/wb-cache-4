25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or <b>signal</b> <b>distortion</b> in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E
2500|$|A {{loading coil}} or load coil is an {{inductor}} that is inserted into an electronic circuit {{to increase its}} inductance.

2500|$|RO is {{the first}} and the slowest opto-isolator: its {{switching}} time exceeds 1 ms, and for the lamp-based models can reach hundreds of milliseconds. Parasitic capacitance limits the frequency range of the photoresistor by ultrasonic frequencies. Cadmium-based photoresistors exhibit a [...] "memory effect": their resistance depends on the illumination history; it also drifts during the illumination and stabilizes within hours, or even weeks for high-sensitivity models. Heating induces irreversible degradation of ROs, whereas cooling to below −25°C dramatically increases the response time. Therefore, ROs were mostly replaced in the 1970s by the faster and more stable photodiodes and photoresistors. ROs are still used in some sound equipment, guitar amplifiers and analog synthesizers owing to their good electrical isolation, low <b>signal</b> <b>distortion</b> and ease of circuit design.|$|E

To meet stringent requirements defined for civil aviation GNSS receivers, the characterization of distortions which could affect a GNSS signal in a hazardous way is required. In particular, expected <b>signal</b> <b>distortions</b> generated at payload level are described by Threat Models (TMs). Distortions incorporated in the TM are also called Evil WaveForm (EWF).
