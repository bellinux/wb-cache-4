40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to produce base layer winter active sportswear fabrics using natural and synthetic fibres and their blends which will deliver good comfort properties. Polyester, wool and bamboo fibres were selected for this study. Polyester is the most common fibre used in sportswear, wool is increasingly being used in sportswear and bamboo is a relatively new fibre that offers properties suitable for base layer sportswear. Bamboo is also regarded as a "green" and eco-sustainable fibre. Preliminary experiments were carried out to find the liquid moisture transfer performance of knitted fabrics made from each selected 100 % fibre blend. Preliminary experimental <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics</b> were produced as single jerseys with different cover factors. It was concluded that cover factor was influenced by loop length; whereas cover factor, physical and structural fabrics properties influenced its performance, depending on the fibre type that was used. Experimental single jersey <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics</b> were also produced from different fibre blends including wool, polyester and bamboo. The physical and structural properties selected for testing were weight/m 2, thickness, stitch density (courses/cm and wales/cm), porosity and optical porosity. The comfort properties selected for testing and analysis were liquid moisture transfer and a fabric classification with respect to the following properties: thermal conductivity, warm/cool feeling, stiffness and number of contact points. These parameters were assessed to determine the comfort properties of commercial and a range of experimental <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics.</b> It was concluded that fibre blending influenced comfort properties of experimental <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics</b> and that the most suitable for base layer winter active sportswear <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics</b> are P 100, W 43 P 57, W 35 B 65, W 52 B 48, W 60 b 40 (experimental <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics</b> and MRWB (Commercial <b>sample</b> <b>fabric...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{unit cell}} of {{geometry}} model {{is applied to}} acquire the material matrix of the woven fabric in the study. The softness of woven fabric {{is related to the}} flexure modulus, which can be obtained from the acquired material matrix. Two <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics</b> are employed to verify the relationship between the softness and the flexure modulus. It reveals that the results are quite promising as expected. An intelligent support system for determining the softness of the fabric based on flexure modulus can thus be implemented in the future. Through the assistance of the system, the softness for different fabrics can be evaluated without any <b>sample</b> <b>fabrics</b> manufacturing in advance. A designer can determine the softness of a piece of fabric without proceeding with the traditionally essential procedure of sample manufacturing.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 People {{will spend}} {{a large amount}} of their {{lifetime}} indoors where the air is filled with both indoor and outdoor allergens. Exposure to allergens can have a range of effects on the health of building occupants. Textiles make up a vast majority of the surfaces, such as draperies, sofas, pillows, and carpeting that are found in an indoor space. Many of the textile surfaces are often covered by allergens due to their tendency to attract allergens which can exacerbate the symptoms of people suffering from allergies. The purposes of this study were to determine if there is a relationship between fabric parameters such as electrostatic charge and moisture regain on the attraction of timothy grass pollen and to determine if various fabric treatments affect their allergen attraction. Twelve fabrics were exposed to differing amounts of Timothy grass pollen and tested for electrostatic cling, and moisture regain. For the pollen exposure procedure, <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> were exposed to varying amounts of pollen by repeated turning of a glass cylinder. Fabric electrostatic cling was measured by following AATCC (115, 2005) Fabric to Metal cling test. Moisture regain for <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> was measured by following ASTM D 2495 - 07 (2009) and D 1576 - 90 (2008). Acidic acid (vinegar), basic (ammonia), and fabric softener, were used to determine if these treatments caused any changes of pollen counts on the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> tested. The results from this study showed that there was no consistent linear relationship between electrostatic charge or moisture regain with pollen count on any of the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> tested. Across all trials and treatments, the untreated group had the highest average pollen count followed by group that was treated with fabric softener, then basic (ammonia), and finally acidic acid (vinegar). When looking at individual fiber, wool <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> had the lowest pollen count across the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> while nylon <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> had the highest pollen counts in all the treatments with the exception of basic (ammonia) treated polyester <b>fabric</b> <b>samples.</b> As for the treatments, the acidic acid (vinegar) treatment on all <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> resulted in the least amount of pollen attached to the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R

The colors of fabric used were intense shades of red, blue, and yellow. Data were collected from unlaundered and from laundered and line-dried <b>fabric</b> <b>samples.</b> <b>Fabric</b> <b>samples</b> were exposed to zero, approximately 1, 349, 2, 836, 5, 551, and 11, 627 langley units of solar radiation and to varying amounts of other environmental elements. The tear strength, weight, and color retention of the fabric were studied. As the number of langley units to which the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> were exposed increased, the color retention of the fabric tendd to decrease. The combined effects of the other environmental elements appeared to be secondary to solar radiation in reducing the color retention of the fabric. There was also a decrease in the tear strength of the fabric. This appeared to be due to the combined effects of all of the environmental elements on the fabric.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignDiana SindicichWith {{continuing}} advancements in {{the area}} of electronics, there are more ways in which they are utilized in order {{to improve the lives of}} humans. These advancements have to led to the incorporation of electronic components into fabric structures, creating electronic textiles (e-textiles). As it has become possible to place small electrical components within clothing without the performance of the electronics being hampered, research has been conducted in the use of e-textiles in measuring aspects of the human body, such as the heart rate and perspiration rate. In the area of skin temperature, research has been conducted in the past using e-textiles for skin temperature measurement, but past efforts have been unsuccessful in incorporating useable temperature sensors into a fabric substrate. This study compared three types of sensors incorporated into woven and knitted fabrics, using insulated thermocouples, un-insulated thermocouples, and resistance temperature directors (RTDs). Three incorporation methods (weaving, interlacing into knit, and stitching) were used in six <b>fabric</b> <b>samples,</b> with the three sensor types woven and stitched into three woven <b>fabric</b> <b>samples,</b> while the sensors were interlaced into knitted fabric and stitched into the three knitted <b>samples.</b> <b>Fabric</b> hand washing and temperature measurement tests were conducted, and the temperature readings were analyzed statistically for comparison. The analysis conducted showed that the thermocouples that were interlaced or stitched onto the knitted <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> were best for temperature measurement due to their accuracy and durability, while the RTDs were unusable as a temperature sensor, as the removal of the electrical connectors during washing eliminated the calibration that was established before washing.
