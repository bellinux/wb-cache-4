Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve's proprietary anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature called Game Guides, where users can upload text and images detailing games and game <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner as GameFAQs was added. Starting in beta in December 2014 and publicly released in January 2015, the Steam client allows players to broadcast video streams to the public or Steam friends while playing video games.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{encourage}} selective {{use of a}} complex categorisation strategy. More specifically, participants will be trained to use a two dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> one region of category space and a more complex three-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> another region of category space. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2 – 3 conditions, participants will be presented with stimuli requiring <b>the</b> two-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first phase of training and <b>the</b> three-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second phase of training. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 3 - 2 conditions, participants will be presented with stimuli requiring <b>the</b> three-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first phase of training and <b>the</b> two-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second phase of training. The main dependent measure will be performance on exceptions to the two-dimensional strategy. If participants learn to selectively use the three-dimensional strategy, then {{we expect them to}} correctly classify novel exceptions that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional region of the category space and incorrectly classify novel exceptions that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-dimensional region of the category space...|$|R

25|$|The Brixton {{area was}} bombed during World War II, {{contributing}} to a severe housing crisis, which in turn led to urban decay. This was followed by slum clearances and the building of council housing. In the 1940s and 1950s, many immigrants, particularly from the West Indies, settled in Brixton. More recent immigrants include a large Portuguese community (see Little Portugal) and other European citizens. Brixton also has an increasingly ageing population, which affects housing <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian Government {{established}} the Guiding Office for the Recovery of Bam (GO), {{consisting of a}} panel of 11 members, with the Minister of Housing and Urban Development as the chairman. The GO {{played a key role}} in the reconstruction progress by appointing consulting architects to plan, analyse and review possible <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urban redesign for enhanced earthquake resistance in the future. However, the general community affected by the earthquake were given the liberty to actively participate in the planning, design and construction process, with householders often contributing in the reconstruction by selecting their own designs and cooperating with the architects and contractors to ensure a desirable and effective redevelopment.|$|E
25|$|In {{looking at}} the issue of {{antidepressant}} use, some academics have highlighted the need to examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, {{due to the fact}} that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations. These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of depression in these different cultures. In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.|$|E

25|$|In {{mainstream}} economic theory, a {{free market}} rations an increasingly scarce commodity by increasing its price. A higher price should stimulate producers to produce more, and consumers to consume less, while possibly shifting to substitutes. The first three mitigation <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> above list are, therefore, in keeping with mainstream economic theory, as government policies can affect the supply and demand for petroleum {{as well as the}} availability of substitutes. In contrast, the last type of strategy in the list (attempting to shield consumers from rising prices) would seem to work against classical economic theory, by encouraging consumers to overconsume the scarce quantity, thus making it even scarcer. To avoid creating outright shortages, attempts at price control may require some sort of rationing scheme.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} theory that {{suggests}} pastoralism evolved from hunting and gathering. Hunters of wild goats and sheep were knowledgeable about herd mobility {{and the needs}} of the animals. Such hunters were mobile and followed the herds on their seasonal rounds. Undomesticated herds were chosen to become more controllable for the proto-pastoralist nomadic hunter and gatherer groups by taming and domesticating them. Hunter-gatherers' <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past have been very diverse and contingent upon the local environment conditions, like those of mixed farmers. Foraging strategies have included hunting or trapping big game and smaller animals, fishing, collecting shellfish or insects, and gathering wild plant foods such as fruits, seeds, and nuts. These diverse strategies for survival amongst the migratory herds could also provide an evolutionary route towards nomadic pastoralism.|$|E

500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop song, with {{a length}} of four minutes and six seconds. According to the digital sheet music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, it is written in the key of B minor and is set in common time. The beat moves at 120 beats per minute. Cyrus' vocal range in the song spans from the low note of Bb2 to the high note of F#5. Heather Phares of Allmusic noted the use of [...] "bold synths and beats". She {{also said that the}} [...] "rapped verses" [...] that Cyrus delivers sound [...] "edgier" [...] than the singer's previous work. Cyrus opens the song by chanting [...] "Don’t live a lie, this is your one life". Punch Liwanag of Manila Bulletin described the song as [...] "swanky dance" [...] and characterised the synth sounds as [...] "ear filling". According to Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, Cyrus applies four different vocal <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song.|$|E
500|$|Lum's {{political}} philosophy was {{a fusion of}} individualist anarchist economics– [...] "a radicalized form of laissez-faire economics" [...] inspired by the Boston anarchists– with radical labor organization {{similar to that of}} the Chicago anarchists of the time. Lum's ideas have variously been described as individualist anarchist, syndicalist, mutualist, and anarcho-communist, as well as anarchist without adjectives. Herbert Spencer and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon influenced Lum strongly in his individualist tendency. He developed a [...] "mutualist" [...] theory of unions and as such was active within the Knights of Labor and later promoted anti-political <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American Federation of Labor. Frustration with abolitionism, spiritualism, and labor reform caused Lum to embrace anarchism and radicalize workers, as he came to believe that revolution would inevitably involve a violent struggle between the working class and the employing class. Convinced of the necessity of violence to enact social change he volunteered to fight in the American Civil War, hoping thereby to bring about the end of slavery. Kevin Carson has praised Lum's fusion of individualist laissez-faire economics with radical labor activism as [...] "creative" [...] and described him as [...] "more significant than any in the Boston group".|$|E
