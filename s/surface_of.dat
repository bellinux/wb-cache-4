5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop the}} local theory <b>of</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{immersed}} in the pseudo-Galilean space, a special type of Cayley-Klein spaces. We define principal, Gaussian, and mean curvatures. By this, the general setting for study <b>of</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> constant curvature in the pseudo-Galilean space is provided. We describe <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> revolution of constant curvature. We introduce special local coordinates for <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> constant curvature, so-called the Tchebyshev coordinates, and show that the angle between parametric curves satisfies the Klein-Gordon partial differential equation. We determine the Tchebyshev coordinates for <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> revolution and construct a surface with constant curvature from a particular solution of the Klein-Gordon equation...|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the planet is nearly {{the same as that}} of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the Galileo {{spacecraft}} entered {{orbit around}} Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys to explore Ganymede. These flybys are G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29.

During a G1 flyby in 1996, the Ganymedian magnetic field was discovered, while {{the discovery of}} the ocean was announced in 2001.
