25|$|In {{rural areas}} {{continued}} decline in childhood death means {{that at some}} point parents realize they need not require <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> to be born to ensure a comfortable old age. As childhood death continues to fall and incomes increase parents can become increasingly confident that fewer children will suffice to help in family business and care for them in old age.|$|E

The Home for Italian Children was later renamed the Italian Home for Children. Located in Jamaica Plain, it now provides residential and day treatment for children with emotional and learning difficulties.|$|E
25|$|John Jr. began {{attending}} school in 1839. Despite {{the financial burden}} of raising <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children,</b> the Mullans were able to finance secondary and higher education for John. He attended St. John's College in Annapolis, where he studied Greek, Latin, history, mathematics, philosophy, art, rhetoric, navigation, surveying, chemistry, and geology, among other subjects. Mullan graduated from St. John's in 1847 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was just 16 years old.|$|E

Herek, a {{psychology}} professor at the University of California at Davis, concluded: “The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children.

25|$|William had 12 {{children}} and 56 grandchildren. His two eldest sons alone (William and Henry) had 29 children between them. He {{was a strong}} supporter of overseas colonisation – he was wont to say that, with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children,</b> he could not be otherwise. Frederick and three of his brothers went to the United States while their elder brother, Henry, joined the first expedition of settlers to New Zealand. Henry's son, Francis Petre, was a leading architect who designed the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (Christchurch, New Zealand).|$|E
25|$|First as Shoshone, their conquest {{took them}} to the {{southern}} plains; in that region, they separated from the Shoshone and emerged as a distinct nation. They developed imperialist customs by which they became the strongest Indian nation in the region. They based their warfare on speed and calculated violence, developing superb light cavalry skill. In raids, they captured <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> and women of their opponent Indian tribes, keeping and adopting them, that they dramatically increased their population. Those tribes who submitted to Comanche power were given latitude but had to provide food, lodging, and women as tributaries.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer {{had been}} a {{respected}} artist in Delft, but he was almost unknown outside his hometown. A local patron named Pieter van Ruijven had purchased much of his output, which reduced the possibility of his fame spreading. Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, {{so there was no}} school of Vermeer. His family obligations with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.|$|E
2500|$|The Christian {{denominations}} that {{operated the}} schools {{on behalf of}} the federal government have expressed regret and issued apologies for their part in a system that harmed <b>so</b> <b>many</b> indigenous <b>children.</b> [...] In 2008, the government issued an official apology to the survivors of residential schools and their families.|$|R

25|$|Petipa and his wife, the Prima {{ballerina}} Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa {{separated in}} 1875, and in 1882 the ballerina died of virulent smallpox in Pyatigorsk. In 1876 Petipa married the ballerina Lyubov Savitskaya, who before she married Petipa {{had given birth}} to their first child. Together, they had six children: Nadezhda Mariusovna Petipa (1874–1945), Evgeniia Mariusovna Petipa (1877–1892), Victor Mariusovich Petipa (1879–1939), Lyubov Mariusovna Petipa (1880–1917), Mariy Mariusovich Petipa (1884–1922), and Vera Mariusovna Petipa (1885–1961). With <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children,</b> Petipa stood {{at the head of a}} large family by the time he had reached his 70s, having many grandchildren, in-laws, and god-children. Although he was well provided for at the expense of the Imperial treasury, he was not rich, and lived strictly within his means. He kept track of all of his living expenses in journals, as well as box-office receipts at the theatre. He was well known for his generosity, always lavishing presents upon his children and grandchildren, and was known to purchase tea or lunch for the dancers during a rehearsal.|$|E

500|$|In this episode, {{the sports}} {{announcer}} states {{he had not}} seen a [...] "beating like that since Rodney King", referencing to an incident in 1991 where King was beaten by six LAPD police officers. The incident sparked tensions in LA that eventually led to the 1992 LA Riots. When Pip is tackled later, the commentator states that he has not seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant. This references Grant's arrest in June 1995, when he was caught performing a lewd act in public with a Hollywood prostitute. Grant was fined $1,180, placed on probation for two years, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program. The announcer makes an incomplete remark about a tackle, [...] "I haven't seen <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> molested since...". This was rumored to have been followed by a line, [...] "since Michael Jackson came to town", which was supposedly censored after the broadcast premiere, but {{there is no evidence of}} this.|$|E

500|$|Stanton's mother, Margaret Livingston Cady, a {{descendant}} of early Dutch settlers, {{was the daughter of}} Colonel James Livingston, an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Having fought at Saratoga and Quebec, Livingston assisted in the capture of Major John Andre at West Point, New York where Andre and Benedict Arnold, who escaped aboard the HMS Vulture, were planning to turn West Point over to the English. Margaret Cady, an unusually tall woman for her time, had a commanding presence, and Stanton routinely described her mother as [...] "queenly." [...] While Stanton's daughter, Harriot Stanton Blatch, remembers her grandmother as being fun, affectionate, and lively, Stanton herself did not apparently share such memories. Emotionally devastated by the loss of <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children,</b> Margaret Cady fell into a depression, which kept her from being fully involved in the lives of her surviving children and left a maternal void in Stanton's childhood.|$|E
500|$|Mikoyan, in a {{description}} by Simon Sebag-Montefiore, was [...] "slim, circumspect, wily and industrious". He {{has been described}} as an intelligent man, understanding English, having learned German on his own by translating the German version of Karl Marx's Das Kapital into Russian. Unlike many others, Mikoyan was not afraid to get into a heated argument with Stalin. [...] "One was never bored with Mikoyan", Artyom Sergeev notes, while Khrushchev called him a true cavalier. However, Khrushchev warned of trusting [...] "that shrewd fox from the east." [...] In a close conversation with Vyacheslav Molotov and Nikolai Bukharin, Stalin referred to Mikoyan as a [...] "duckling in politics"; he noted, however, that if Mikoyan ever took a serious shot he would improve. Mikoyan had <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children,</b> five boys and the two sons of the late Bolshevik leader Stepan Shahumyan, {{that he and his wife}} faced economic problems. His wife Ashkhen would borrow money from Politburo wives who had fewer children. If Mikoyan had discovered this he would, according to his children, have become furious.|$|E
500|$|Barbara {{is shown}} {{wearing a red}} dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, {{indicating}} her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, {{the bridge of her}} nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been [...] "comely and of erect bearing". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the [...] imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.|$|E

2500|$|N.S.S. {{schools were}} very {{successful}} and encountered very high enrolment numbers. They {{were able to}} educate <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> because they adopted the Dr. Bell System of teaching. This system originated in Madras, India in 1787, and it allowed older pupils to teach the younger children the lessons they had already mastered; this was very efficient as more children could be taught by one teacher. [...] The Dr. Bell System provided tangible evidence that children were benefiting from this education as {{they were able to}} teach other children the lessons they had learnt. Therefore, parents were much more interested in supporting and sending their children to these schools because {{of the quality of the}} education. The high student enrolment proved that the N.S.S. enjoyed much success in its short existence on the island.|$|E
50|$|In The Making of The Goonies, {{director}} Richard Donner {{notes the}} difficulties and pleasures {{of working with}} <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>child</b> actors. Donner praises them for their energy and excitement, but says that they were unruly when brought together. The documentary frequently shows him coaching the young actors and reveals some techniques he used to get realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was actually a full-sized mock-up of a pirate ship created {{under the direction of}} production designer J. Michael Riva. Donner restricted the child actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters. The characters' first glimpse of the ship was thus also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, that particular scene in the movie is actually the second shot, as the cast was so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be re-shot. It was later noted that the entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it.|$|R
