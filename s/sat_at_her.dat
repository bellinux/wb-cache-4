500|$|A {{portion of}} the song was {{performed}} on Saturday Night Live on October 3, 2009. Gaga wore a complex outfit called [...] "The Orb", designed by Nasir Mazhar and her creative team Haus of Gaga. Described by Gaga as a [...] "fashion installation", it consisted of concentric metallic rings that revolved around her. After finishing her performance of [...] "LoveGame", Gaga <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> piano and played an acoustic version of the chorus of [...] "Bad Romance". She performed the song on the TV show Gossip Girl, during the episode called [...] "The Last Days of Disco Stick". The performance took place at a private show arranged by Blair Waldorf, {{one of the characters}} from Gossip Girl. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained that the decision to perform on the show was inspired by her sister. She stated that she did not want the performance to be out of tune with the storyline of the show, so she worked with the scriptwriters to incorporate it into the plot. The performance included many ladders, symbolizing bad luck, and featured Gaga wearing a [...] long dress. According to the show's executive producer Stephanie Savage, the song incorporated a few Gossip Girl-specific lyrics. The performance began with Gaga emerging from two giant doors wearing a large red gown. She climbed up a ladder, from where she sang parts of the song, and her male dancers danced around the ladder as she continued to sing.|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 2010, Gaga {{performed}} the song at the MAC AIDS Fund Pan-Asia Viva Glam launch in Tokyo where {{she wore a}} doily lace dress. She entered the stage in a procession inspired by a Japanese wedding, and as the lights dimmed, she <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> piano on the rotating stage and belted out [...] "Speechless", which {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Alejandro", where she was picked up by one of her dancers, who appeared to be covered in talcum powder. Gaga taped a medley of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Alejandro" [...] for the ninth season of American Idol on April 28, 2010. Her performance aired on the show's May 5, 2010 episode. The performance started with Gaga playing the piano for a slowed-down snippet of [...] "Bad Romance". She was dressed in a revealing-but-veiled black outfit, wielding a cape and was surrounded by shirtless dancers. Halfway through the performance, she shed her cape and began writhing on the floor. Over {{in one corner of the}} stage, a statue of the Virgin Mary had flames pouring out of the top of it, as Gaga sang the chorus. Fog filled the stage, as Gaga and her dancers performed an energetic dance routine. Luchina Fisher from ABC News called it a [...] "thinly-veiled performance dripping with sex and violins" [...] and [...] "Gaga doing her best Madonna impression." [...] On July 9, 2010, the song was performed on The Today Show, where she sang it on a stage, outside the studio. In May 2011, Gaga {{performed the}} song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the royal}} couple's favored {{craftsmen}} and artists were the cabinetmaker William Vile, silversmith Thomas Heming, the landscape designer Capability Brown, and the German painter Johann Zoffany, who frequently painted {{the king and}} queen and their children in charmingly informal scenes, such as a portrait of Queen Charlotte and her children as she <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dressing table. In 1788 the royal couple visited the Worcester Porcelain Factory (founded in 1751, and later to be known as Royal Worcester), where Queen Charlotte ordered a porcelain service that was later renamed [...] "Royal Lily" [...] in her honour. Another well-known porcelain service designed and named in her honour was the [...] "Queen Charlotte" [...] pattern.|$|E

2500|$|A popular anecdote {{was when}} the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, met President Vladimir Putin, Putin brought Konni to their meetings. On 21 January 2007, the two leaders met at Bocharov Ruchei, the President's summer {{residence}} in Sochi, and {{at the beginning of}} their meeting Konni wandered into the room, leading Putin to ask Merkel, who reportedly has a [...] "deep-seated fear of dogs", [...] "The dog does not bother you, does she? She's a friendly dog and I'm sure she will behave herself." [...] Merkel responded in Russian, a language in which she is fluent, [...] "She doesn't eat journalists, after all." [...] Konni then proceeded to sniff the German Chancellor, and <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet. Merkel was reported to have shown [...] "apparent discomfort". Putin later said that, after learning of Merkel's fear of dogs, he apologized to her.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Now, don’t you think, Ma dear,’ {{said the}} Minor Canon {{to his mother}} one day as she <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{knitting}} in his little book-room, ‘that you are rather hard on Mr. Neville?’ ...|$|E

6000|$|Cytherea's lips did not move, nor did {{any sound}} escape her; but could she help singing {{the words in}} the depths of her being, {{although}} the man to whom she applied them <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> rival's side? ...|$|E
