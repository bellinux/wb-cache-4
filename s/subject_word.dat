Syntax, semantics and lexicology have provided starting {{points for the}} study of word formation.

A book registered at dandelon.com typically is assigned between 20 and 500 <b>subject</b> <b>words</b> {{depending on the size}} of the book and the knowledge domain. Based on this extended set of terms representing each library item, queries can be more specific, and relevance ranking can be more efficient.

In addition, a detailed empirical study was made of two special types of English word: <b>subject</b> <b>words</b> and proper names. The data for the <b>subject</b> <b>words</b> and proper names was compared with previously reported data on <b>subject</b> <b>words,</b> proper names, and continuous text material.

The aim was at least partially contribute to the integration of terminology in there fields of pharmacy. Our task was to analyze the pharmacokinetics and bioelimination of drugs, find source materials regarding these areas in the scientific literature and make a list of possible subject words. Afterwards it was necessary to create an optimized form of particular subject words that {{could be used as a}} basis for dictionary. This dictionary will also include other areas of pharmacy and will be intended for wide range of professional pharmacists, medicine doctors and students of these disciplines, or even other readers and general public. Prestigious foreign and domestic publications, especially textbooks on pharmacology published by academically recognized world prestigious authors were the sources for particular preparation and processing of definitions. From these resources, several alternative resolutions were prepared.

Even though, not all of the <b>subject's</b> derivational <b>words</b> work as an adult's standard. The data of a three-year-old Indonesian child are recorded weekly for 1 - 2 hours for approximately one month. The data are transcribed and identified into the content words, the syntactic class of content words, the affixes the child used, and the function words. The study suggests that the child masters several affixes such as the suffix (-e) attached to nouns, prefix (tak-), and prefix (di-); and function words such as ini 'this', apa y what'r and mana x which'. While, others cannot be clearly explained. In addition, the result reveals that most of the <b>subject's</b> <b>words</b> are concrete things, which are available in his surrounding...|$|R

In order to better describe the semantic information, we use term frequency weight instead of Bool weight.

The result shows that the vocabulary co-occurrence feature not only achieves high accuracy in all the datasets, but also has a high training and predicting speed...|$|R
40|$|A handout of a {{presentation}} {{given at the}} Afranaph Project Development Workshop on December 11, 2010, at Rutgers University in New Jersey. This handout discusses how <b>subject</b> <b>words</b> function in various Bantu languages. Bantu languages are pro-drop, hence null subject languages (NSLs). Our initial findings are that preverbal subjects can, in fact, be non-specific indefinites (in at least Lubukusu and Kirundi). In Kirundi, expressions that are not licit in left-dislocated positions are fine as subjects. Person and tense/aspect influence the availability of inverse scope relations. Our preliminary conclusion is {{that at least some}} Bantu subjects are in Spec, TP; hence the nature of subject agreement in NSLs does not in general preclude subjects from occupying that position...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{syntactic}} relation patterns for opendomain factoid question answering. We propose a pattern extraction method {{to extract the}} various relations between the proper answers and different types of question words, including target <b>words,</b> head <b>words,</b> <b>subject</b> <b>words</b> and verbs, from syntactic trees. We further propose a QA-specific tree kernel to partially match the syntactic relation patterns. It makes the more tolerant matching between two patterns and helps to solve the data sparseness problem. Lastly, we incorporate the patterns into a Maximum Entropy Model to rank the answer candidates. The experiment on TREC questions shows that the syntactic relation patterns help to improve the performance by 6. 91 MRR based on the common features. ...|$|R

Nowadays, among the primary {{technologies}} of spam filtering, support vector machine (SVM) is applied widely, because it is efficient and has high separating accuracy. The main problem of support vector machine arithmetic is how to choose the kernel function. To solve this problem people propose spam filtering arithmetic of support vector machine based on Boolean kernel. The arithmetic uses filtering methods based on attributes, such as IP address, <b>subject</b> <b>words,</b> keywords in content, enclosure information, etc. These attributes compose the feature vectors, and the vectors are classified by SVM-MDNF based on Boolean kernel. The experiment results show that this arithmetic has high separating accuracy, high recall ratio and precision ratio. The arithmetic has its value in theory and application. </p...|$|R
