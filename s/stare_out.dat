500|$|Capitol Hill's other hauntings are {{associated}} with the two military installations {{in that part of the}} city. At the official residence of the Commandant of the Marine Corps Barracks and Parade Ground on 8th Street SE, there are stories which talk about rustling papers, the sound of a man pacing, and the appearance of the ghostly image of Samuel Nicholas, the first Commandant of the Marine Corps. At the nearby Washington Navy Yard at 8th Street SE and M Street SE, the ghost of Commodore Thomas Tingey is said to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the upper windows of the Tingey House (the traditional residence of the Commander of the Navy Yard). Local residents and press reports also tell stories about [...] "Old Howard," [...] a cantankerous former U.S. Marine who lived in the 1860s in a two-story house between G and I Streets SE who now haunts it, harassing the occupants and acting much like a poltergeist.|$|E
500|$|Remarking on the band's {{goals for}} the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] music video, Yorke said that, [...] "When {{it came time to}} make the video for that song, we had lots of people saying, 'Yeah, great, we can have another video like [...] "Street Spirit", all moody and black and dark. Well, no. We had really good fun doing this song, so the video should make you laugh. I mean, it should be sick, too." [...] Magnus Carlsson, Swedish creator of the {{animated}} series Robin, was commissioned by the band to make the video. Radiohead were fans of the show, and connected with the Robin character; Jonny Greenwood described him as [...] "affectionate" [...] and [...] "vulnerable", while Yorke admitted that he found Robin [...] "quite the vulnerable character, but he's also violently cynical and quite tough and would always get up again." [...] At first Carlsson sought to work on a video for [...] "No Surprises" [...] and was uncertain as to how to approach [...] "Paranoid Android". Eventually he devised a scenario to the band's liking after he locked himself in his office for over 12 hours to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the window, while listening to the song on repeat while jotting down visual ideas. As Carlsson did not have access to the lyrics at the time, the concept for the video was based entirely on the song's sound. According to Yorke, the band [...] "deliberately didn't send Magnus the lyrics" [...] because they [...] "didn't want [...] to be too literal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Don Gulbrandsen, {{the author}} of Edward Sheriff Curtis: Visions of the First Americans, {{put it this way}} in his {{introductory}} essay on Curtis’s life: “The faces <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> at you, images seemingly from an ancient time and from a place far, far away…Yet as you gaze at the faces the humanity becomes apparent, lives filled with dignity but also sadness and loss, representatives of a world that has all but disappeared from our planet.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Jacqueline Wilson {{was born}} in Bath, Somerset, in 1945. Her father was a civil servant; her mother was an {{antiques}} dealer. Jacqueline {{spent most of her}} childhood in Kingston upon Thames, where she went to Latchmere Primary School. She particularly enjoyed books by Noel Streatfeild, as well as American classics like Little Women and What Katy Did. At the age of seven, she filled Woolworths notebooks with stories of her imaginary games. At the age of nine she wrote her first [...] "novel" [...] which was 21 sides long. That story, Meet the Maggots, was about a family with seven children. Although she was good at English, she had no interest in mathematics; she would often <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the window and imagine rather than pay attention to the class, leading her final-year teacher at Latchmere to nickname her [...] "Jacky Daydream". Jacqueline Wilson later used the nickname as the title of the first stage of her autobiography.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, they do it, I don't. Now, if you----" [...] Tom {{brought his}} words {{to a sudden}} stop, and {{commenced}} to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the window. Far over the distant wood {{he had seen a}} strange light. Now it was increasing rapidly.|$|E
60|$|PROF. That's what I'm {{trying to}} say here. The Orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty!

6000|$|I {{could think}} of nothing else. I could not study, I could only sit and <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the window with tears running down my cheeks, until at last, the teacher observing my distress, inquired, [...] "What is the matter?" [...] And I, not knowing how to enter upon so terrible a tale, whined out, [...] "I'm sick, I want to go home." ...|$|E
60|$|The old man <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of the window. Surprise {{seemed to}} hold him. A {{completely}} unexpected situation had staggered him.|$|R

6000|$|Mr Powell drew a free breath. [...] "All right now," [...] said Captain Anthony {{in a quiet}} undertone. He {{gave the}} blazing flare to Powell and walked aft to watch the passing of that menace of {{destruction}} coming blindly with its parti-coloured <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of a blind night {{on the wings of}} a sweeping wind. Her very form could be distinguished now black and elongated amongst the hissing patches of foam bursting along her path.|$|E
60|$|In the {{limousine}} scarcely a word was spoken. Maggie {{leaned back in}} her seat, her face dazed and expressionless. Opposite to her, Nigel sat with set, grim face, looking with fixed <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the window at the deserted streets. Of the three, Naida seemed more on the point of giving way to emotion. They had passed Hyde Park Corner, however, before a word was spoken. Then it was she who broke the silence.|$|E
60|$|In {{the late}} afternoon, Jerry trotted aft, after having {{administered}} another lesson to the wild-dog, and found Skipper {{seated on the}} deck, back against the low rail, knees drawn up, and gazing absently off to leeward. Jerry sniffed his bare calf--not {{that he needed to}} identify it, but just because he liked to, and in a sort of friendly greeting. But Van Horn took no notice, continuing to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> across the sea. Nor was he aware of the puppy's presence.|$|E
60|$|But he put {{her hand}} away, and turning his face, <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of the window. And so they reached their home.|$|R

6000|$|... "Go," [...] she whispered, without glancing round. She {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the window. He {{stood looking at}} her for a moment, with a strange light in his eyes. He made a step towards her. [...] "I HAVE you,", he said. [...] "You are mine. Netted--caught. But mine." [...] He would have gone up to her and laid his hand upon her, but he did not dare to do that yet. [...] "I have you in my hand," [...] he said, [...] "in my power. Do you hear--POWER!" ...|$|E
60|$|The girl, a {{delicate}} fairy of six, barely accepted an embrace, and clung the faster to her father, {{with a gesture}} as though to repel all advance. The boy took a good <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> {{of a pair of}} resolute gray eyes, with one foot in advance, and offered both hands. Honora would have taken him on her knee, but he retreated, and both leant against their father as he sat, an arm round each, after shaking hands with Miss Wells, whom he recollected at once, and presenting his brother-in-law, whose broad, open, sailor countenance, hardy and weather-stained, was a great contrast to his pale, hollow, furrowed cheeks and heavy eyes.|$|E
6000|$|He is {{aroused by}} another altercation, between his aunt and the Duchess of Queensberry. When the royal {{favourite}} passed the Duchess, her Grace gave her Ladyship an awful <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of {{eyes that were}} not so bright now {{as they had been}} in the young days when they [...] "set the world on fire;" [...] turned round with an affected laugh to her neighbour, and shot at the jolly Hanoverian lady a ceaseless fire of giggles and sneers. The Countess pursued her game at cards, not knowing, or not choosing, perhaps, to know how her enemy was gibing at her. There had been a feud of many years' date between their Graces of Queensberry and the family on the throne.|$|E

6000|$|She looked long at {{her face}} in the mirror, {{studying}} with a fearful interest the little hard lines and markings there beneath their light coating of powder. She examined the cunning touches of colouring matter here and there in her front hair. Were they cunning enough? Did they deceive? They seemed to her suddenly to <b>stare</b> <b>out.</b> She fingered and smoothed the slight looseness and fulness of the skin below her chin. She stretched herself, and passed her hands down over her whole form, searching as it were for slackness, or thickness. And she had the bitter thought: 'I'm all out. I'm doing all I can.' The lines of a little poem Fort had showed her went thrumming through her head: ...|$|E
60|$|There was fascination, {{not at all}} surprising, {{about the}} great glass lights in the Dipsey, and {{whenever}} a man was off duty he was pretty sure to be {{at one of these}} windows if he could get there. At first Mrs. Block was afraid to look out of any of them. It made her blood creep, she said, to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> into all that solemn water. For the first two days, when she could get no one to talk to her, she passed most of her time sitting in the cabin, holding in one of her hands a dustbrush, and in the other a farmer's almanac. She did not use the brush, nor did she read the almanac, but they reminded her of home and the world which was real.|$|E
60|$|And {{all about}} him--in the rooms below, {{in the houses}} on each side and across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park {{district}} and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing their eyes, and opening windows to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It was {{the dawn of the}} great panic. London, which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger.|$|E
