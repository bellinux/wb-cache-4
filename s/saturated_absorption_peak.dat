40|$|An {{interferometric}} wavemeter {{with digital}} display is described. Fringes {{of an unknown}} and a reference wavelength are simultaneously generated through the motion of a moving double comer cube reflector in a Michelson-type interferometer. An electronic device compares the two wavelengths to within one hundredth of a fringe and numerically displays the result. Most of the systematic errors are eliminated by the total superposition of the optical paths of the reference and the measured beams, ensuring a high potential accuracy. As an illustration, we have remeasured with this device the wavelength of the λ = 612 nm radiation generated by a He-Ne laser stabilized on a <b>saturated</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>peak</b> of iodine. The results exhibit a statistical dispersion of ± 6 x 10 - 9 about a mean value which agrees to within 1. 6 x 10 - 9 with the more exact result obtained at BIPM...|$|E
40|$|We {{point out}} here an {{interesting}} property concerning Gaussian mode size evolution when a thin lens or induced lenslike effects are inserted in a laser cavity. When the distance d between mirrors of a half-symmetric Fabry-Perot with a lens at half-length is changed, the {{variations of the}} mode size at the curved mirror cancel for dc ≅ 4 R/ 5, and change sign when d ≧ dc (where R is the mirror curvature radius). This property explains simply opposite asymmetries observable on Lamb dips, <b>saturated</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks,</b> and intracavity <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy resonances.

50|$|A {{consequence}} of this method of counter-propagating beams on a system with more than two states {{is the presence of}} crossover lines. When two transitions are within a single Doppler-broadened feature and share a common ground state, a crossover peak at a frequency exactly between the two transitions can occur. This is the result of moving atoms seeing the pump and probe beams resonant with two separate transitions. The pump beam can cause the ground state to be depopulated, saturating one transition, while the probe beam finds much fewer atoms in the ground state because of this saturation and its absorption falls. These crossover peaks can be quite strong, often stronger than the main <b>saturated</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>peaks.</b>|$|R

40|$|The renewed {{interest}} in zinc oxide (ZnO) has provided {{a great number of}} details {{that could lead to a}} commercially viable alternative to gallium nitride (GaN) for use in high-efficiency, wide band-gap devices. The difficulty in obtaining such devices is that as-grown, large single crystals of ZnO are n type. Past research has shown that hydrogen plays an important role in the n-type conductivity of ZnO. However, other impurities cannot be eliminated as possible donors in as-grown ZnO. In an attempt to study the controlled doping of ZnO, we grew polycrystalline samples via the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method, using graphite as the transport agent.
