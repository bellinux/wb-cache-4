Public schools in the [...] "W Towns" [...] in eastern Massachusetts (Weston, Wayland, and Wellesley) did have school that day despite the fact that almost every other town in the state had the day off. Several schools' classes were {{canceled}} after years without a <b>snow</b> <b>day.</b> Dartmouth College shut down campus operations on February 14.

The University of Illinois canceled their classes for two consecutive days for the first time in at least 27 years. A blizzard warning forced Purdue University to suspend classes for the first time in 13 years. SUNY Oneonta closed its doors for the first time since the 1970s, and stayed closed for 3days for the first time in its 119-year history.

For the first time in six years, Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio canceled classes as a result of the snow. On February 14, for only the third time in school history, Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania canceled classes as a result of the snow. Susquehanna University in nearby Selinsgrove, however, remained open with no official cancellations.|$|E
5000|$|In some areas, schools include extra days {{in their}} {{calendar}} as [...] "built-in" [...] <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> which allow a school {{to get in}} the minimum amount of hours or days for instruction (in Wisconsin for instance, 180 minimum teaching days are mandated by law). Once the number of <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> taken exceeds the number of built-in <b>days,</b> the <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> must be made up. In other states, all <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> must be made up. For example, schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon, shorten spring break, or delay the start of summer vacation. However some schools are more forgiving, and do not mandate make-up days. In the event of heavy snow, tools have arisen to help students calculate the chance of a weather related cancellation, most commonly <b>snow</b> <b>days.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{school districts}} were {{forced by the}} storm to use up their {{remaining}} allotted <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> for the school year, after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee had required some be used {{near the beginning of}} the year. The Weston, Connecticut, public schools had already used nine <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> as of November 2, five more than its schedule allowed. Since more <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> would inevitably be used during the upcoming winter, they predicted that vacation periods planned for later in the year would have to be shortened or canceled, or the school year would have to be extended.|$|R

2500|$|A {{few months}} after it was {{released}}, Psyonix released an update that adds game modes known as [...] "mutators", modifying some aspects of gameplay, such as increased or decreased gravity, ball size, ball speed and bounciness. For the 2015 holiday season, another update replaced mutator matches with an ice hockey-inspired mode (called [...] "Snow Day"), played on an ice rink and the ball replaced with a hockey puck with different physics. Positive reception to the ice hockey mode led to it being extended {{for a few weeks}} after the holiday season. <b>Snow</b> <b>Day</b> was permanently added to the mutator settings for private matches and exhibition games on February 10, 2016. [...] "Hoops", a game mode based on basketball, was added on April 26, 2016.

5000|$|Over {{the past}} couple of years, the {{district}} has been criticized over the last day of school. Last year, the district used 4 [...] "snow days", or 4 days where school was cancelled due to weather, and the last day of school was June 27, 2005. This was the latest release date of any towns in the surrounding areas. The Worcester Public Schools, for example, were released on June 21, 2005, and they had used more <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> than Shrewsbury, using 5. The calendar has been revised for the 2006-2007 school year, where the last day of school will be June 13, 2007, if no <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> are used, and if all 5 are used, the last day would be June 20, 2007. The district used only 2 <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> during the 2005-2006 school year, yet under the old calendar, will still get out on June 23, 2006.|$|R
50|$|The snow {{dance is}} {{primarily}} performed {{in hope of}} a <b>snow</b> <b>day.</b> A <b>snow</b> <b>day</b> is when school districts deem roads too dangerous for teachers and students to drive to school, and school is cancelled. Adults may also take a personal <b>snow</b> <b>day</b> from work if they are unwilling to risk driving on the snow. Typical <b>snow</b> <b>day</b> activities include sledding, building snowmen, making snow igloos, leaving footprint trails, making snow angels, and shoveling the driveway and sidewalks. Those who stay inside on a <b>snow</b> <b>day</b> may instead choose to do {{any number of things}} to stave off boredom, including craft-making, drinking hot chocolate, and baking cookies.|$|E

The scene was inspired by Scully, who as a child loved to sit and listen by the radio {{waiting to see if}} there was going to be a school <b>snow</b> <b>day.</b> Scully thought, because of his experience as a child, that there was nothing more disappointing than to wake up expecting a <b>snow</b> <b>day,</b> only to find out there was no snow.

5000|$|On {{the system}} level, {{several studies have}} {{examined}} whether changes to instructional time {{have any effect on}} academic outcomes. An analysis of Maryland school over several years looked at the effect of <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> on test scores —in particular, lost school days due to inclement weather in school in {{the weeks leading up to}} the administration of state assessments—revealed that in those years when there were fewer <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> students performed better than in those years that had more than five <b>snow</b> <b>days.</b> [...] A study of schools in Israel found that an increase in instructional time from one year to the next—the result of a re-financing plan that provided schools more resources—“positively impacts” test scores in English, science, and math tests, with some variation by subject and student socioeconomic status. [...] In both these cases, then, adding more time to an otherwise fixed system equates with more learning.|$|R

Furthermore a positive trend was detected. This temporal pattern is consistent with studies of the variability of global surface temperature, indicating a strong relationship between temperature and snow occurrence in the climate system and the potential for using snow occurrence as an indicator of climate change...|$|R

40|$|Snow cover plays a {{vital role}} in the Swiss Alps and {{therefore}} it is of major interest to determine and understand its variability on different spatiotemporal scales. Within the activities of the National Climate Observing System (GCOS Switzerland) inter-annual variations of <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> over Switzerland were derived from 2000 to 2010 based on data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite. To minimize the impact of cloud cover on the MODIS snow product MOD 10 C 1, we implemented a post-processing technique based on a forward and backward gap-filling approach. Using the proposed methodology it was possible to determine the total number of annual <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> over Switzerland from 2000 to 2010 (SCD MODIS). The accuracy of the calculated <b>snow</b> <b>days</b> per year were quantitatively evaluated against three in situ snow observation sites representing different climatological regimes (SCD in_situ). Various statistical indices were computed and analysed over the entire period. The overall accuracy between SCD MODIS and SCD in_situ on a daily basis over 10 yr is 88 % to 94 %, depending on the regional characteristics of each validation site. Differences between SCD MODIS and SCD in_situ vary during the snow accumulation period in autumn and smaller differences after spring, in particularly for the Central Alps...|$|R
