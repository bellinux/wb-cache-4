40|$|A {{woven fabric}} {{structure}} {{is defined by}} mutual threads interlacing in <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> as well as <b>the</b> basic parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric.</b> <b>The</b> interrelation among <b>fabric</b> parameters {{can be obtained by}} considering a geometrical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> and specific experimental methods. The geometrical model is mainly concerned with the shape taken up by the yarn in the warp or weft cross-section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric.</b> This article provides a possible methodology for evaluation of geometric parameters <b>of</b> threads in <b>the</b> real longitudinal and transverse cross-sections of fabric. From an individual cross-section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> using image analysis it is possible to define <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> threads, their deformation, thread spacing, the maximum displace-ment (height of binding wave) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thread axis, <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thread axis (interlacing angle), <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thread axis in <b>the</b> cross-section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric,</b> <b>the</b> crimp <b>of</b> threads in <b>the</b> <b>fabric,</b> and <b>the</b> real shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binding wave through wave coordinates.

40|$|Extremely {{fine steel}} fibres (12 mm diameter) are spun into yarns and then knitted into fabric, which is used, among other applications, as a mould cover in <b>the</b> {{formation}} <b>of</b> automotive glass.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{proposes a}} {{simplified}} two-dimensional representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unit cell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> that involves three bodies in contact. Design/methodology/approach - <b>The</b> <b>fabrics</b> are not simple homogenous structures. They have a discrete structural character {{and this is}} essential for their complex mechanical behaviour. Low stress micro-mechanics is mainly used for <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> hand. Modelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> microstructure is a powerful toot for <b>the</b> in-depth study <b>of</b> their performance. Based on <b>the</b> geometrical models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabrics,</b> finite element analysis (FEA) is a very useful method for <b>the</b> mechanical analysis <b>of</b> their complex shape structures. Especially FEA can be applied on a system of bodies in contact by {{taking into account the}} interactions between the individual bodies. The parametric FEA analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unit cell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> provides interesting results about its mechanical behaviour. Findings - The present work states that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite element method is a friendly and convenient method for an in-depth study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact phenomena, which are dominating on the total mechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Originality/value - This paper provides a simplified two-dimensional representation of a unit cell of a fabric that involves three bodies in contact.
