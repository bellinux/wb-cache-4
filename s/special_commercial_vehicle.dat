LCV market is not well known and yet to {{be considered as a}} potential business, especially for <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicles</b> Business Unit which belongs to the Interior division of Continental Automotive. Some neighboring segments within Interior division have some participation in the market; however, it is not considered as a main priority for either of them. There is no proper focus on analyzing its potential and find the right strategy to tackle it. Due to some sort of pressure to grow Continental’s businesses, <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicles</b> BU, represented by Vehicle Electronics segment, has come up with the intention of finding how to approach this new business opportunity in the face of other neighboring segments of the same division also getting into this broad opportunity. There is also a need to establish a right internal communication process and its impact upon a concrete choice of product to enter this new business. Finally, to establish if LCV market is a promising opportunity, in particular for <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Business Unit. This research is highly beneficial for Continental Automotive, in <b>special</b> for <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Business Unit since it helps to understand its current situation in the market at different regions levels. Business Unit is able to find right approach for the LCV market together with a suitable sales strategy for each region and a concrete choice of products at a competitive price level with the results, discussion and recommendation of this research. In other words, to get new businesses for future sales growth. Continental Automotive was founded in Hannover in 1871. Nowadays, {{it is one of the}} German Automotive Supplier leaders of the automotive market worldwide. The company has presence in 50 countries and sales of € 34. 5 billion and mainly supplies tires, brake systems, chassis components, vehicle electronics and powertrain controls. Vehicle Electronics segment, part of <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicles</b> segment, is the direct responsible for this LCV market. The segment specialist in electronic solutions in six fields of applications such as <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> Bus, Agriculture, Construction, 2 -Wheeler and Marine business. The Light <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> is consider as an important part of the fleet of vehicles and for a number of years now have been taking a constantly increasing share of the transport services, both in Germany and Europe” (BASt, DEKRA, UDV, & VDA, 2013, p. 5). The potential market for this kind of vehicle stands on BRIC countries, mainly India and China. Although Brazil is considered as the most mature and stable of the BRIC by (Barclay, 2010), still is hard to forecast due to economic volatility and changing regulation, indicates (Roland Berger, 2014). The market development in Russia is hard to anticipates, points out (Barclay, 2010) due to its crisis and political issues. “India is expected to return stronger growth” (Roland Berger, 2014) owning the fastest production growth from the other three. For (Roland Berger, 2014) China will be the global volume driver in automotive, remaining by far the largest of the market. The methodology held in this study is based on an exploratory research; using qualitative data which has been collected thought secondary and primary data. This research work starts with the introduction, following by chapter one which includes the problem background, problem statement, research questions and objectives, purpose and significance of the study and finally limitations. The second chapter continues with the review of related literature and studies. It explains the Light <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> characteristics, segmentation production and demand. Besides, it describes the company’s history, SWOT analysis, structure segments and portfolio. It also gives an overview of the trends in the automotive industry, OEMs, suppliers and BRIC opportunities. Chapter three informs about the methodology used together with the data collection and target group. Chapter four focus on developing all findings.

40|$|An easily {{moving and}} safe {{transportation}} is an indicator {{in any country}} in the world of economic growth and well-being. For the past 100 years, innovation within the automotive sector has brought major technological advances leading to safer, cleaner and more affordable vehicles. But for the most time since the inception of the moving assembly line for vehicle production by Henry Ford, the changes have been incremental / evolutionary. Thanks to the new possibilities due to the IT / wireless revolution, the automotive industry appears to be on the cusp of revolutionary change with potential to dramatically reshape not just the competitive landscape but also the way we interact with vehicles, and indeed the future design of our roads and cities. Apart from connected personal mobility, vehicles are also envisioned to provide Value Added Services (VAS) such as autonomous driving via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) and Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I), electric load balancing via Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) solutions, communication solutions using Visible Light Communications (VLC) etc. The development and evaluation of vehicular VAS requires a modular and scalable multidisciplinary simulation platform. In this paper we propose a novel simulation platform named Cyber-Automotive Simulation & Evaluation Platform (CASEP). The purpose of CASEP is to evaluate and visualize the gains of various vehicular VAS with <b>special</b> emphasis on <b>commercial</b> <b>vehicle</b> VAS. The use cases are evaluated with respect to the mission-specific performance indicators, thereby providing usable metrics for optimization. The visualization platform is being developed using the UNITY 3 D engine, thereby enabling intuitive interaction as in real physics-based gamesComment: published in the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Technology Symposium 201...|$|R
