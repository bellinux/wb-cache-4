2500|$|According to the report, Iran also {{continued}} {{to refuse to}} provide design information or access to verify design information for its IR-40 heavy water research reactor. Iran and the IAEA in February 2003 agreed to modify {{a provision in the}} <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>Arrangement</b> to its safeguards agreement (Code 3.1) to require such access. Iran told the Agency in March 2007 that it [...] "suspended" [...] the implementation of the modified Code 3.1, which had been [...] "accepted in 2003, but not yet ratified by the parliament", and that it would [...] "revert" [...] to the implementation of the 1976 version of Code 3.1. The <b>subsidiary</b> <b>arrangement</b> may only be modified by mutual agreement. Iran says that since the reactor is {{not in a position to}} receive nuclear material the IAEA's request for access was not justified, and requested that the IAEA not schedule an inspection to verify design information. The Agency says its right to verify design information provided to it is a [...] "continuing right, which is not dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material at, a facility." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{his final}} November 2009 {{statement}} to the IAEA Board of Governors, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei said the Agency continued to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, but that other issues of concern had reached a [...] "dead end" [...] unless Iran were to fully cooperate with the agency. ElBaradei stated {{it would be helpful}} if [...] "we were able to share with Iran more of the material that is at the centre of these concerns", and also said it would be helpful if Iran fully implemented the <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>Arrangements</b> to its Safeguards Agreement and fully implemented the Additional Protocol. ElBaradei said Iran's failure to report the existence of a new fuel enrichment facility until September 2009 was inconsistent with its obligations under the <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>Arrangements</b> to its Safeguards Agreement. ElBaradei closed by saying international negotiations represented a [...] "unique opportunity to address a humanitarian need and create space for negotiations".|$|R

50|$|Resident Macaulay {{attributed}} the government's {{refusal to pay}} the subsidy by making military cuts to Dalawa Velu Thampi, {{and said that the}} king was satisfied with the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>arrangements.</b> After the dalawa received a letter from Governor George Barlow of Madras, he appeared happy, apologised to the resident for delaying the payment of the subsidy, and arranged for the payment to be made in installments. However, when the payments stopped after 60,000 rupees, with over 800,000 still unpaid, the resident suggested to the king that Velu Thampi be replaced as the Dalawa of Travancore. The king in turn requested the Madras Presidency to replace Macaulay as the Resident of Travancore.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{controls}} on the production and distribution of content {{and the provision of}} telecommunications services through licensing or other <b>subsidiary</b> <b>arrangements,</b> or by standards and codes (whether co-regulatory or self-regulatory) are subject to revision and adaptation to the networked society and information economy. Moreover, there are new platforms, applications, business models, value chains and forms of social interaction available with more to come in what is a dynamic, innovative environment. Other challenges for regulators include cross-jurisdictional issues and the need for engagement and collaboration with stakeholders locally, regionally and internationally. The ACMA's response to these pressures is to remain constantly relevant by delivering on its mandated outcomes and its statutory obligations, and by transforming itself into a resilient, e-facing, learning organisation, responsive to the numerous pressures for change that confront it.|$|R
5000|$|... Natanz is a {{hardened}} Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) covering 100,000 square meters that {{is built}} 8 meters underground and {{protected by a}} concrete wall 2.5 meters thick, itself protected by another concrete wall. It is located at Natanz, {{the capital city of}} Natanz County, Isfahan Province, Iran. In 2004, the roof was hardened with reinforced concrete and covered with 22 meters of earth. The complex consists of two 25,000 square meter halls and a number of administrative buildings. This once secret site was one of the two exposed by Alireza Jafarzadeh in August, 2002. IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei visited the site on 21 February 2003 and reported that 160 centrifuges were complete and ready for operation, with 1,000 more under construction at the site. In accordance with Code 3.1 of the <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>Arrangements</b> to Iran's safeguards agreement that were in force up to that time, Iran was not obligated to declare the Natanz enrichment facility until six months before nuclear material was introduced into the facility. According to the IAEA, in 2009 there were approximately 7,000 centrifuges installed at Natanz, of which 5,000 were producing low enriched uranium.|$|R

60|$|As {{a general}} rule, the {{expenses}} of a business do not increase by any means proportionally to the quantity of business. Let us take as an example a set of operations which we are accustomed to see carried on by one great establishment, that of the Post-Office. Suppose that the business, let us say only of the letter-post, instead of being centralized in a single concern, were divided among five or six competing companies. Each of these would be obliged to maintain almost as large an establishment as is now sufficient for the whole. Since each must arrange for receiving and delivering letters {{in all parts of}} the town, each must send letter-carriers into every street, and almost every alley, and this, too, as many times in the day as is now done by the Post-Office, if the service is to be as well performed. Each must have an office for receiving letters in every neighborhood, with all <b>subsidiary</b> <b>arrangements</b> for collecting the letters from the different offices and redistributing them. To this must be added the much greater number of superior officers who would be required to check and control the subordinates, implying not only a greater cost in salaries for such responsible officers, but the necessity, perhaps, of being satisfied in many instances with an inferior standard of qualification, and so failing in the object.|$|R
40|$|The leaf cuticular {{morphology}} of extant {{species of}} Platanus was investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy. All species are shown to possess trichome bases {{of the same}} type as those commonly found in Proteaceae.

40|$|Tax {{planning}} with intangibles {{has become}} one of the most popular and most vividly debated topics in international taxation. We incorporate various intellectual property (IP) tax planning models into forward-looking measures of effective tax rates, namely the disposal of intangibles to low-tax <b>subsidiaries,</b> intra-group licensing <b>arrangements,</b> and intra-group contract R&D. In doing so, we draw upon the methodology put forward by Devereux and Griffith and amend this model by considering a research & development (R&D) investment which is carried out by a parent company, whereby the resulting intangible is exploited by a foreign subsidiary. We point out analytically under which conditions IP tax planning achieves the objective of reducing the effective average tax rate of the group. We find that the disposal of intangibles to low-tax subsidiaries does not achieve this tax planning objective, if the true value of the asset is subject to tax upon the disposal. We show to what extent the parent must understate the value of the intangible in order to reduce the group’s tax burden. We furthermore point out that contract R&D may generally achieve a significant lower effective tax burden. We present cost of capital and effect average tax rates to illustrate these findings. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Animal dietary {{preferences}} {{have been}} studied by feeding-site examinations, animal observation, and stomach and esophageal collections. Analysis of fecal material for undigested plant cuticle is another means for obtaining the same information. This study was conducted to: (1) prepare a microscope slide series depicting the surface features of leaves and current annual growth of stems of selected plants, (2) evaluate methods for preparing plant and fecal material for cuticle examination, and (3) develop a key for identification of these plant surfaces. Plants were collected and identified by personnel of the PNW Forest and Range Experiment Station. All other work was conducted at Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. Reference slides were prepared by three techniques: scraping, maceration and replication. All were appropriate for fresh or herbarium plant material. Scraping was a tedious method which provided pieces of cuticle representing the surface where other methods were unsuitable. Maceration yielded cuticle fragments strong enough to withstand the acid treatment, but was not adaptable to some plant surfaces. Replication techniques were easiest, but {{only half of the}} plant surfaces were acceptably represented in this manner and these caused additional problems during photomicrography. Fecal material was prepared for analysis by a macerating technique. Photomicrographs of reference slides were prepared for use in subsequent key development. Pictures were taken with a Makam camera mounted on a Wild M 20 binocular microscope equipped with photo tube, using Kodak Contrast Process Panchromatic 3 - 1 / 4 x 4 - 1 / 4 sheet film. The key was developed using epidermal cell arrangement, trichome characteristics, stomata <b>subsidiary</b> cell <b>arrangement,</b> and silica bodies as dependable characters. Secondary characters included hair lengths, stomata size and cell outline. Differential digestion attributable to plant and (or) animal differences is a variable in analyzing cuticle fragments in fecal material not tested in this study. However, the key, a first approximation to cuticular identification of these selected plants, appears to handle this variability for most species studied. Successful use of the key is dependent upon a comprehensive assessment of the vegetation in the study area and the biology of the animal under study. This perspective is necessary to restrict the variables which would otherwise decrease the effectiveness of identification of cuticular fragments in fecal material...|$|R
