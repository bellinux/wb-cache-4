5|$|Following the bird's extinction, {{remains of}} the great auk {{increased}} dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created intense interest in Victorian Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, {{the largest number of}} any country. A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for £9000, which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold. The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> in a year. The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown. Several other eggs have been destroyed accidentally.

25|$|The <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> {{shortage}} {{was much}} more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly {{say that in the}} heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> or a hoplite was one drachma, and for a heliast (juror) half a drachma since 425BC.|$|E
25|$|In 1807, a <b>skilled</b> <b>worker,</b> {{such as a}} jeweler, perfumer, tailor or {{furniture}} maker, {{could earn}} 4-6 francs a day; a baker earned 8-12 francs a week; a stonemason earned 2-4 francs a day; an unskilled worker, such as construction laborer, earned 1.50 to 2.5 francs a day. Much of the work was seasonal; most construction work stopped during the winter. Women's salaries were lower; a worker in a tobacco factory earned one franc a day, while women making embroidery or seamstresses earned 50-60 centimes a day, government salaries in 1800 were fixed {{on a scale of}} 8000 francs a year for a chief of a division of a Ministry down to 2500 francs a year for a messenger.|$|E

He later recalled that during national strikes, only 30 or 40 workers at LIP {{out of a total of}} 1200 would go on strike.

40|$|The wage {{progression}} of less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> {{is of particular}} policy interest in light of evidence of skill-biased technology changes. There exist two conflicting views regarding the wage {{progression of}} less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> One view believes that work experience {{is the driving force}} for wage growth of less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> so effective policies should encourage workers to participate in the labour market and accumulate work experience. The other view stresses that less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are usually locked into dead-end jobs in which wages are stagnant and policies that facilitate job shopping (changing jobs and employers) would be desirable. Job tenure is a key factor in testing the hypothesis that less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are locked into dead-end jobs. If the return to tenure is zero, the hypothesis cannot be rejected. An extended human capital model of wage growth for less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> is estimated using data from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) 1993 to 1998. In order to compare the wage growth mechanisms for workers with different skill endowments, the model is also estimated for workers with higher skill levels. The result implies that the return to job tenure for less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> is significantly different from zero. This is inconsistent with the view that less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are locked into dead-end jobs. The return to job tenure is also found to be greater than the return to total labour market experience for less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> This finding supports the notion that firm-specific human capital acquired by less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> substitutes for their generally low human capital endowments and the accumulation of firm-specific human capital by less <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> greatly improves their earnings prospect.

The reasons for this were unclear. Some people believed that immigrants were responsible, because more uneducated immigrant families lived in western than in eastern Germany. This assumption however could not be confirmed. The difference between east and west was even stronger when only ethnic German children were studied.|$|E

25|$|The vaquero, the Spanish or Mexican cowboy {{who worked}} with young, untrained horses, arrived in the 18th century and flourished in California and {{bordering}} territories during the Spanish Colonial period. Settlers from the United States did not enter California until after the Mexican-American War, and most early settlers were miners rather than livestock ranchers, leaving livestock-raising largely to the Spanish and Mexican people who chose to remain in California. The California vaquero or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly <b>skilled</b> <b>worker,</b> who usually stayed on the same ranch {{where he was born}} or had grown up and raised his own family there. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more intensive grazing with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Spanish influence than that of Texas. The modern distinction between vaquero and buckaroo within American English may also reflect the parallel differences between the California and Texas traditions of western horsemanship.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evolution}} of the demand for <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> relative to unskilled workers in the Chilean manufacturing sector following Chile’s liberalization of trade in the late 1970 ’s. Following such trade reforms, the standard Heckscher-Olin model predicts that a low labor-cost country like Chile should experience an increased demand for low <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> relative to high <b>skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> Alternatively, if trade liberalization is associated with the adoption of new technologies, and technology is skill-biased, the relative demand for <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> may rise. Using a newly available plant-level data set that spans the sixteen year period 1979 - 1995, we find that the relative demand for <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> rose sharply during the 1979 - 1986 period and then stabilized. The sharp increase in demand for <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> coincided with an increased propensity to adopt new technologies as measured by patent usage.
