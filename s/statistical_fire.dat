However, it has not been possible to use Landsat to discriminate among vegetation layers (e.g., understory, midstory, and canopy) in fire effects because the reflectance from a given pixel is integrated across all vegetation layers; thus, the only possible target for validation is some composite effect (Kremens et al. 2010).|$|E

40|$|Fire {{provides}} an impulsive and stochastic pathway for carbon from the terrestrial biosphere {{to enter the}} atmosphere. Despite fire emissions being of similar magnitude to net ecosystem exchange in many biomes, even the most complex dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) embedded in general circulation models contain poor representations of fire behaviour and dynamics, such as propagation and distribution of fire sizes. A model-independent methodology is developed which addresses this issue. Its {{focus is on the}} Arctic where fire is linked to permafrost dynamics and on occasion can release great amounts of carbon from carbon-rich organic soils. Connected-component labelling is used to identify individual fire events across Canada and Russia from daily, low-resolution burned area satellite products, and the obtained fire size probability distributions are validated against historical data. This allows the creation of a fire database holding information on area burned and temporal evolution of fires in space and time. A method of assimilating the <b>statistical</b> distribution of <b>fire</b> area into a DVM whilst maintaining its fire return interval is then described. The algorithm imposes a regional scale spatially dependent fire regime on a sub-scale spatially independent model; the fire regime is described by large-scale <b>statistical</b> distributions of <b>fire</b> intensity and spatial extent, and the temporal dynamics (fire return intervals) are determined locally. This permits DVMs to estimate many aspects of post-fire dynamics that cannot occur under their current representations of fire, as is illustrated by considering the modelled evolution of land cover, biomass and net ecosystem exchange after a fire...|$|R

Considering the over-dispersion parameter of the negative binomial, the Western Region is the riskiest region for which death through fire varies widely within months. Although some regions, such as Central, Brong Ahafo and Eastern regions recorded high fatality through fire, the over-dispersed parameter indicates less riskiness in the monthly death rate through fire compared to the Western Region. Again, {{in terms of the}} variations of fire fatality amongst regions, Brong Ahafo is the riskiest region, followed by the Central and Ashanti regions. Variations amongst the fitted distribution are less communicated. Therefore, we used various goodness of fit tests to select the best model for fire fatality in order to arrive at better decisions.|$|R

30|$|This section {{presents}} the distribution fitting procedure {{that is used}} to select a base <b>statistical</b> distribution for <b>fire</b> count dataset identified in Ghana. The distribution fitting method is preferred because of the desire in this work to find the best distribution type, especially in cases where {{there is little or no}} information about the base distribution pattern in the data (Mehrannia and Pakgohar 2014). However, to our knowledge, no base distribution for predicting fire occurrences has been used in Ghana. Using the steps in modelling count data, this study fits statistical distributions with the past events of fire disaster data. In order to appropriately fit the base distribution to the fire count data, the study judiciously considered a number of distributions that possibly fit the data and estimated the model parameters, based on the goodness of fit test (Log-likelihood statistics, AIC, BIC) and subsequently selected the best fit model for the data set.|$|R

A series of 80 experimental fire plots were set in deciduous forests in the Northern Thailand during the forest fire seasons from 2008 – 2009. The factors influencing the fire spread rate, i. e., weather, fuel, and topography conditions, were measured to model the fire spread. According to the burning experiments, the fire spread rate was 0. 51 – 2. 55 m/min. Multiple nonlinear regression analyses of slope terrain, fuel load, and moisture content of fuels were found to be able to accurately predict the fire spread rate at a confidence level of 25 – 88 %. The developed model can be applied to deciduous forest fuels in other regions of Thailand. However, its use should be restricted to typical weather conditions...|$|R

The latter pattern can be also described typically as the case that a person who has normal physical function was killed in a fire mainly due to delay of detection while he was drunk or asleep at night. For the purpose of fire deaths reduction, the "Disaster-Vulnerable People and Daytime Fire " pattern should be noticed, because the fire death rate of this fire death pattern is much higher than the another fire death pattern and further the population of those disaster-vulnerable people like aged people 65 or older is increasing rapidly in the recent years and the near future in Japan...|$|R

We develop a Bayesian point process model to estimate probability of fire associated with charcoal counts from individual-lake sediments and estimate mean fire return intervals.

The univariate and multivariate models are applied to 13 lakes in the Yukon Flats region of Alaska. Both models resulted in similar mean fire return intervals (100 - 350 years) with reduced uncertainty under the multivariate model due to improved estimation of regional charcoal deposition. The point process model offers an integrated statistical framework for paleo-fire reconstruction and extends existing methods to infer regional fire history from multiple lake records with uncertainty following directly from posterior distributions.

How domestic smoke alarms affect the safety is chosen as a term of reference. Results from <b>statistical</b> surveys of <b>fire</b> deaths in Norway compared with other countries are used to describe who dies in fires. The use of and requirements for domestic smoke alarms {{in different parts of the}} world is briefly presented. The sensibility of ionic and optical smoke detectors in smouldering and flaming fires are analyzed, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the two detector principles is made based on the test results and expected frequencies of these types of fires. Available time for evacuation is discussed based on expected time to untenable conditions, expected time to flashover, expected time to intervention from fire brigades, and the expected response time for smoke alarms. Different needs to evacuate different groups of occupants (children, elderly people, disabled) are also discussed. An analysis shows that the Norwegian requirement of domestic smoke alarms is highly cost effective.

50|$|Data {{assimilation}} periodically {{adjusts the}} model state to incorporate new data using <b>statistical</b> methods. Because <b>fire</b> is highly nonlinear and irreversible, data assimilation for fire models poses special challenges, and standard methods, {{such as the}} ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) do not work well. Statistical variability of corrections and especially large corrections may result in nonphysical states, {{which tend to be}} preceded or accompanied by large spatial gradients. In order to ease this problem, the regularized EnKF penalizes large changes of spatial gradients in the Bayesian update in EnKF. The regularization technique has a stabilizing effect on the simulations in the ensemble but it does not improve much the ability of the EnKF to track the data: The posterior ensemble is made out of linear combinations of the prior ensemble, and if a reasonably close location and shape of the fire cannot be found between the linear combinations, the data assimilation is simply out of luck, and the ensemble cannot approach the data. From that point on, the ensemble evolves essentially without regard to the data. This is called filter divergence. So, there is clearly a need to adjust the simulation state by a position change rather than an additive correction only. The morphing EnKF combines the ideas of data assimilation with image registration and morphing to provide both additive and position correction in a natural manner, and can be used to change a model state reliably in response to data.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh-casualty fires (HCFs) {{involving}} ≥ 3 fatalities {{derived from}} the <b>Fire</b> <b>Statistical</b> Year Book of China and Chinese Fire Services from 2002 - 2010 were analyzed. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the time-scaling properties of HCFs. The time-scaling properties were detected by means of Fano Factor (FF), Allan Factor (AF) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The results of FF and AF show that the HCF sequences with death ≥ 3 and death ≥ 4 exhibit obvious time scaling behavior after the fractal onset times. The scaling exponents of FF and AF decrease significantly with increasing fatality, which reflects that HCF sequences with more fatalities tend to behave as Poisson process. The sequence of HCFs with death ≥ 6 can be considered as a Poisson process according to the comparison of FF (AF) curve and Poissonian 95 % confidence curve. The DFA scaling exponent of HCF sequence involving fatality ≥ 3 is approximate 0. 551 ± 0. 005, indicating that this sequence exhibits long-range correlations. With the increase of fatality threshold the DFA scaling exponent gradually decreases to about 0. 5, which reflects that the HCFs with high fatality levels are likely to be uncorrelated. Furthermore, the sequence of HCFs with death ≥ 6 can be regarded as uncorrelated because its DFA scaling exponent is 0. 496 ± 0. 003. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Important elements in our numerical methods are (i) a neurophysiologically inspired integrating factor which casts the solution as a numerically tractable integral equation, and {{allows us to}} obtain stable and accurate individual neuronal trajectories (i. e., voltage and conductance time-courses) even when the I&F neuronal equations are stiff, such as in strongly fluctuating, high-conductance states; (ii) an iterated process of spike-spike corrections within groups of strongly coupled neurons to account for spike-spike interactions within a single large numerical time-step; and (iii) a clustering procedure of firing events in the network {{to take advantage of}} localized architectures, such as spatial scales of strong local interactions, which are often present in large-scale computational models—for example, those of the primary visual cortex. (We note that the spike-spike corrections in our methods are more involved than the correction of single neuron spike-time via a polynomial interpolation as in the modified Runge-Kutta methods commonly used in simulations of I&F neuronal networks.) Our methods can evolve networks with relatively strong local interactions in an asymptotically optimal way such that each neuron fires approximately once in O(N) operations, where N is the number of neurons in the system. We note that quantifications used in computational modeling are often statistical, since measurements in a real experiment to characterize physiological systems are typically <b>statistical,</b> such as <b>firing</b> rate, interspike interva...|$|R
40|$|Forensic {{examination}} of fire debris is a notoriously difficult analytical task {{due to the}} complexity and variability of samples encountered. The development of increasingly sophisticated analytical instrumentation facilitates greater sensitivity while drastically increasing the abundance of data produced in a single analytical run. Hybrid methods combining chemometrics and forensic statistics have been developed {{in order to make}} optimal use of the complex analytical results. This dissertation addresses the interpretation of such measurements by considering competing hypotheses and using appropriate forensic reference data. Both detection and classification tasks for ignitable liquid residue in fire debris samples are explored as valuable contributions to the investigative process and potential use in a judicial context. Assessing the evidential value of the measurements requires understanding of the analytical signal in addition to extensive comprehension of the many sources of variation within and between samples. Preliminary data processing of chromatographic samples is explored including a discussion of both common practices and an exposition of novel techniques. The statistical modelling of chemically distinctive classes of ignitable liquids and the identification of their potentially discriminative characteristics is also presented. The methods and results presented herein emphasize the importance of a deep understanding of the data produced by analytical methods and a rigorous assessment of the statistical and computational assumptions made when articulating their evidential value. <b>Statistical</b> interpretation of <b>fire</b> debris analyses is based on a general probabilistic (likelihood ratio) framework for interpretation and evaluation of evidence...|$|R
