Originally, Raimi's longtime friend and collaborator Bruce Campbell was set to play Darkman, but the studio balked at the idea {{because they did not}} think Campbell could carry the role. Gary Oldman and Bill Paxton were also considered before Liam Neeson was cast. For the role, Raimi was looking for someone who could suggest [...] "a monster with the soul of a man, and I needed an actor who could do that beneath a lot of makeup" [...] and liked Neeson's [...] "old Gary Cooper charisma." [...] The actor was drawn to the operatic nature of the story and the inner turmoil of his character. To research for the role, Neeson contacted the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors, an organization that supports the emotional and <b>social</b> <b>healing</b> of burn survivors.|$|E

I identify <b>social</b> justice <b>healing</b> practitioners as community educators who center <b>healing</b> and <b>social</b> justice when engaging youth in transformative social change. As a methodological tool, testimonios provide great insights into the life experiences and reflexivity of these community educators. By explicitly making a commitment to restoring and renewing young people’s social well-being, as well as their own, these practitioners promote more holistic practices that are inclusive of young people’s mind, body, and spirit. <b>Social</b> justice <b>healing</b> practitioners seek to facilitate healing spaces that provide a context for young people to reconceptualize individual challenges as a politicized collective struggle, and through this process create a platform for both youth and educators to collectively engage in healing and transformative praxis. The findings from these testimonios suggest that <b>social</b> justice <b>healing</b> practitioners strive to create community healing practices to support young people in their individual and collective processes of healing with the goal of cultivating their resilience, hope, and capacity to see themselves as agents of change...|$|R

40|$|The {{delivery}} of formal apologies for harm done to generations of citizens by government {{policies and practices}} has provided a spectacular focus for processes of <b>social</b> <b>healing</b> and sustainability to potentially develop and take root.

One possible way is through formal educative means; that is, through the enfleshment of reconciliation plans with genuinely transformative educational work.
