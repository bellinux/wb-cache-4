5|$|In August 1998, <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> {{installed}} {{along the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway dedicating {{the road in}} honor of State Senator Norman J. Levy, who died in February 1998 after brain surgery. Levy had served on the State Senate Transportation Committee since 1982 and sponsored the first seat belt law in the United States, and had also {{been part of the}} negotiations that helped work resume on the Meadowbrook–Northern State interchange. The new <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> unveiled in a ceremony in the median of the parkway just south of Merrick Road. Dignitaries at the honoring ceremony included then-Governor George Pataki, Senator Charles Fuschillo and Levy's widow, Joy Levy. <b>Signs</b> <b>were</b> erected {{at both ends of the}} Meadowbrook Parkway and at a point near the Babylon Turnpike interchange.|$|E
5|$|Six {{additional}} <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> also installed {{along the}} length of the route.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} on August 24, {{the provincial government}} and MTO set out to design new signs. The <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> erected and unveiled on September 7, and include a smaller reassurance marker (shield), {{as well as a}} larger billboard version.|$|E
50|$|A white {{background}} signifies the <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> permanent, while a yellow background signifies that the <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> temporary. Warning <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> an upwards-pointing red triangle and black pictogram describing the danger or obstruction. Speed limit <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> a red circle with the limitation in black. Botswana drives on the left.|$|R
50|$|Western astrology {{uses the}} four {{classical}} elements {{in connection with}} astrological charts and horoscopes. The twelve signs of the zodiac are divided into the four elements: Fire <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, Earth <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, Air <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, and Water <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.|$|R
50|$|WABE's call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> WPBA-FM {{for much}} of April 1984, {{at the same time}} WETV's call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> changed to WPBA. The radio station's call <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> changed back in May because of confusion.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1912, the Ohio section {{of what is}} now US223 was shown on maps as SR54, however the road was not signed with the number at the time. The Michigan section carried two numbers when the <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> erected by July 1, 1919. The segment from Somerset to Adrian was M-80, and the {{remainder}} in Michigan was M-34. Ohio signed its highways, including SR54, by July 1923.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
25|$|In September 2015, a 'Welcome' <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in Iğdır and written in four languages, Turkish, Kurdish, English, and Armenian. The Armenian {{portion of the}} <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> protested by ASIMDER who demanded its removal. In October 2015, the Armenian writing on the 'Welcome' <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> heavily vandalized. The Armenian portion of the <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> ultimately removed in June 2016.|$|R
50|$|To {{note that}} Fire and Air (light elements) <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> {{opposite}}d between them, like happens for Earth and Water ones (heavy elements). Spring <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> opposite to autumn ones, and winter <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> related to summer ones.|$|R
25|$|In modern Western astrology {{the signs}} of the zodiac are {{believed}} to represent twelve basic personality types or characteristic modes of expression. The twelve <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> divided into four elements fire, earth, air and water. Fire and air <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> considered masculine, while water and earth <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> considered feminine. The twelve <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> also divided into three qualities, Cardinal, fixed and mutable.|$|R
5|$|In 1908 the UERL and {{the other}} {{underground}} railway companies in London came to a joint marketing arrangement that included maps, joint publicity and combined ticketing. UNDERGROUND <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> used outside stations in Central London. The UERL eventually controlled all underground railways in London except the Waterloo & City Railway, the Metropolitan Railway and its subsidiary the Great Northern & City Railway, and introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar.|$|E
5|$|In Miami, hoteliers and Dolphins Stadium had {{to quickly}} {{prepare for the}} arrival of Oklahoma and Florida, the two teams that played in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game one week after the Orange Bowl. <b>Signs</b> <b>were</b> changed, the playing field was repainted, and {{accommodations}} were prepared for the thousands of expected spectators. In total, South Florida's economy received an estimated $220million boost from visitors who arrived to watch the two games.|$|E
5|$|M-3 {{returned}} to existence in 1973, when US25, now concurrent with I-94 and I-75 {{for most of}} its length through Michigan and Ohio, was truncated at Cincinnati. The former US25 section of Gratiot Avenue was redesignated M-3, along with a southwestern extension down Fort Street to Clark Avenue (I-75 exit47A). This also provided an international connection via the Ambassador Bridge to Ontario's Highway 3. The <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> changed over in February 1974 to complete the change.|$|E
5000|$|The stop <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> a red, downward-pointing triangle, {{with the}} text [...] (tomare) in white. Prohibition <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> round with white backgrounds, red borders, and blue pictograms. Mandatory {{instruction}} <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> round with blue backgrounds and white pictograms.|$|R
50|$|Peabody's <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> a {{clinical}} <b>sign</b> which may <b>be</b> found {{in patients with}} deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> positive when calf muscle spasm occurs on raising the affected leg with the foot extended. The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> neither sensitive nor specific {{for the presence of}} DVT.|$|R
25|$|Direction of {{movement}} is indicated via an operator symbol. A plus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate forward movement. A minus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate backwards movement. A dot or period or equal <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used to indicate horizontal or lateral movement. For {{a piece that}} moves diagonally (such as the horse or elephant), the plus or minus <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> used rather than the period.|$|R
5|$|News {{sources have}} {{referred}} to the George Washington Memorial Bridge as a suicide bridge and, in December 2006, six emergency phones and 18 <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> installed on the bridge {{to encourage people to}} seek help instead of jumping. In late 2006 a group of community activists and political leaders living near the bridge created the Fremont Individuals and Employees Nonprofit to Decrease Suicides (FRIENDS), their primary focus being the installation of a suicide barrier on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|One mine-awareness {{campaign}} involving {{billboard advertising}} attracted {{criticism from the}} Ministry of Tourism and the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB) because the <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> placed in tourist areas, far from any mine-suspected areas. The Ministry of Tourism and the CNTB welcomed the effort's humanitarian aspect, but considered the signs a potential source of unwarranted negative reaction from tourists. Tourist guidebooks of Croatia include warnings about the danger posed by mines in the country, and provide general information about their location.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{refurbished}} (as of 2015) and work began on 2 January 2007. Additional CCTV cameras and Help Points were installed, {{bringing the total}} to 77 cameras in the station and nine Help Points, the latter upgraded with new induction loops to better aid hearing-impaired passengers. In addition, new communications equipment was introduced and damaged <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> replaced with new ones.|$|E
50|$|Road <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{placed on}} the right side next to the road or above the road. Sometimes <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> also placed on both sides, in some exceptional cases <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> only place on the left or on one side (particularly town signs).|$|R
50|$|Supplementary <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> {{rectangular}} {{with white}} backgrounds and black text. Most of <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> only written in Korean.|$|R
50|$|The Commerce Drive-In <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> {{a famous}} {{historic}} site for local residents. Currently the <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> under restoration.|$|R
5|$|To promote {{travel by}} the {{underground}} railways in London a joint marketing arrangement was agreed. In 1908, the Met joined this scheme, which included maps, joint publicity and through ticketing. UD <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> used outside stations in Central London. Eventually the UERL controlled all the underground railways except the Met and the Waterloo & City and introduced station name boards {{with a red}} disc and a blue bar. The Met responded with station boards with a red diamond and a blue bar.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} {{that focused on the}} possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Signs</b> <b>are</b> {{of course}} not {{required}} for just one state, diagrammatically one arrow at a vertex. Sometimes curved arrows with the <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> included to show explicitly the sense of tensor multiplication, but usually just the <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> shown with the arrows left out.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{version of}} the <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> put on the {{hillside}} in 1923 and the current, permanent <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> created in 1929. The <b>sign</b> <b>is</b> cited as {{a prime example of}} [...] "civic boosterism"; the intention was to advertise the city's welcoming attitude toward industry. Its location was chosen so as to be visible from the main north-south highways El Camino Real and the Bayshore Highway, {{as well as from the}} train and the nearby Mills Field airfield (now San Francisco International Airport). The <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> originally proposed, and the first <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> placed, by the South San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. The $5,000 cost of the second, permanent <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> funded by a special property tax assessment approved by the voters.|$|R
5000|$|Thai {{information}} <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> blue. Thailand {{failed to}} resolve the traffic <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> in English except where otherwise solved! ...|$|R
5|$|Eleven {{interchanges}} {{were built}} along the turnpike, {{most of which}} were trumpet interchanges where all ramps merge at the toll booths; only the New Stanton, Carlisle and Middlesex interchanges did not follow this design. Lighting was installed approaching interchanges, along with acceleration and deceleration lanes. The road also featured guardrails, consisting of steel panels attached to I-beams. Large exit <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> used, and road signs had cat's-eye reflectors to increase visibility at night; billboards were prohibited. In September 1940, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that trucks and buses would be allowed to use the highway.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse {{was officially}} {{canceled}} {{as a state}} trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern M-38. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> added to existing highway signs westward {{from the end of}} the southern segment at Negaunee along US41/M-28 and US41 to Baraga, to connect with the northern segment westward to Ontonagon.|$|E
5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, <b>signs</b> <b>were</b> installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E
5000|$|Road {{construction}} and maintenance. Traffic <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> mixed: both German and Swiss traffic <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> {{found in the}} Tägermoos ...|$|R
25|$|The use of Irish on the country's traffic <b>signs</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} visible {{illustration}} of the state's policy regarding the official languages. It is a statutory requirement that placenames on <b>signs</b> <b>be</b> in both Irish and English except in the Gaeltacht, where <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> in Irish only.|$|R
50|$|In the People's Republic of China, bilingual <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> {{mandated}} {{by the government in}} autonomous regions where a minority language share official status with Chinese. In Xinjiang, <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> in Uyghur and Chinese; in Tibet, <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> in Tibetan and Chinese, in Inner Mongolia, <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> in Mongolian (written in the classical alphabet) and Chinese. In Guangxi, the majority of <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> in Chinese, even though the Zhuang language is official in the region. Smaller autonomous areas also have similar policies. Signs in Yanji, which borders North Korea, are in Korean and Chinese. Many areas of Qinghai province mandate bilingual signs in Tibetan and Chinese. In Beijing and Shanghai, due to international exposure of the 2008 Summer Olympics and Expo 2010, almost all city traffic <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> now bilingual with Chinese and English (during the Olympics, signs on Olympic venues were also in French). English use in <b>signs</b> <b>is</b> growing in other major cities as well.|$|R
