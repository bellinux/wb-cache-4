40|$|An {{analysis}} of a trouser trawl experiment with multiple subsampled hauls is presented. The standard method of analysis involves scaling catches by subsampling fractions and combining the catches for each haul to obtain {{an estimate of the}} size selectivity of the test gear. This procedure results in invalid statistical inferences and is not appropriate if the split of fish is not the same in all hauls or if subsampling fractions have measurement error. Modifications of the <b>selectivity</b> <b>model</b> are proposed that significantly improve the {{analysis of}} this type of data (e. g. to estimate selectivity without subsampling fractions). Likelihood ratio tests are developed to test which modified <b>selectivity</b> <b>model</b> best fits the data. Confi-dence bounds are developed as diagnostic tools.

By way of obtaining these values, we test {{the viability of the}} contingent valuation method (CVM) and econometric techniques, respectively, as means of eliciting and analysing values from the general public. WTP responses from a Danish national sample survey, which was designed in accordance with existing guidelines, are analysed in terms of consistency and validity checks. Large numbers of zero responses are common in WTP studies, and are found here; therefore, the Heckman <b>selectivity</b> <b>model</b> and log-transformed OLS are employed.

Nowadays, converting biomass into liquid by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis {{is a major}} concern for alternative fuels (gasoline, diesel etc.). Selectivity of Fischer–Tropsch hydrocarbon product (green fuel) is an important issue. In this study, the experimental data has been obtained from three factors; temperature, H 2 /CO ratio and pressure in the fixed bed micro reactor. T[*]=[*] 543 – 618 (K), P[*]=[*] 3 – 10 (bar), H 2 /CO[*]=[*] 1 – 2 and space velocity[*]=[*] 4500 (1 /h) were the reactor conditions. The results of product modeling for methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2 H 6), ethylene (C 2 H 4) and CO conversion with experimental data were compared.

40|$|The {{first section}} {{looks at the}} {{implications}} of conflict for aid effectiveness and selectivity. We argue that, while aid is generally effective in promoting growth and by implication reducing poverty, it is more effective in promoting growth in post-conflict countries. We then consider {{the implications of these}} findings for donor <b>selectivity</b> <b>models</b> and for assessment of donor performance in allocating development aid among recipient countries. We argue that, while further research on aid effectiveness in post-conflict scenarios is needed, existing <b>selectivity</b> <b>models</b> should be augmented with, inter alia, post-conflict variables, and donors should be evaluated on the basis, inter alia, of the share of their aid budgets allocated to countries experiencing post-conflict episodes. We also argue for aid delivered in the form of projects to countries with weak institutions in early post-conflict years. The second section focuses on policies for donors operating in conflict-affected countries. We set out five of the most important principles: (1) focus on broad-based recovery from war; (2) to achieve a broad-based recovery, get involved before the conflict ends; (3) focus on poverty, but avoid ‘wish lists’; (4) help to reduce insecurity so aid can contribute more effectively to growth and poverty reduction; and (5) in economic reform, focus on improving public expenditure management and revenue mobilisation. The third section concludes by emphasising {{the fact that there is}} no hard or fast dividing line between ‘war’ and ‘peace’ and that it may take many years for a society to become truly ‘post’-conflict’. Donors, therefore, need to prepare for the long haul. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Age-based fishery {{selectivity}} {{represents the}} relative vulnerability of specific ages of fish to a fishery, whereby age classes {{that are highly}} selected tend to be overrepresented in the catch compared with their relative abundance in the population. Statistical catch-at-age analysis (SCAA) results can be sensitive to misspecification of selectivity, which can occur when changes in selectivity over time are not accounted for properly in the assessment model. Four approaches for modelling time-varying selectivity were evaluated within SCAA using Monte Carlo simulations: double-logistic functions with one, two, and {{all four of the}} function parameters varying over time, and age-specific selectivity parameters that all varied over time. None of these estimation approaches outperformed the others always. In addition, methods of model selection were compared to identify good estimation models, i. e. those accurately matching the true fish population. The degree of retrospectivity, the best selection method, was based on a retrospective analysis of errors in model estimates as the data time-series for estimation is sequentially shortened. This selection method performed about as well as knowing the correct <b>selectivity</b> <b>model</b> and led to substantial benefits over misspecifying the <b>selectivity</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E

40|$|By a theorem due to Sklar, {{a multivariate}} {{distribution}} {{can be represented}} {{in terms of its}} underlying margins by binding them together using a copula function. By exploiting this representation, the "copula approach" to modelling proceeds by specifying distributions for each margin and a copula function. In this paper, a number of families of copula functions are given, with attention focusing on those that fall within the Archimedean class. Members of this class of copulas are shown to be rich in various distributional attributes that are desired when modelling. The paper then proceeds by applying the copula approach to construct models for data that may suffer from <b>selectivity</b> bias. The <b>models</b> examined are the self-selection model, the switching regime model and the double-selection model. It is shown that when models are constructed using copulas from the Archimedean class, the resulting expressions for the log-likelihood and score facilitate maximum likelihood estimation. The literature on <b>selectivity</b> <b>modelling</b> is almost exclusively based on multivariate normal specifications.

Second, we propose algorithms that process spatial joins and selections simultaneously and are typically more efficient than combinations of simple operators.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt at {{simultaneously}} estimating participation and choice of market. Thus, our contribution to the existing literature is that, instead of ignoring farmers who do not sell, we model a first-stage equation of factors determining the decision of farmers to sell either maize or groundnut. We then, in a second stage, model the decision to sell either at farmgate or market centre. This implies that what we model in the second stage is what is modelled in the first stages of Fafchamps and Hill (2005) and Muamba (2011). Since the first and second stages are discrete outcomes, none of the two-step approaches explored earlier is applicable. We adopt the sample <b>selectivity</b> probit <b>model</b> to deal with the situation at hand. The sample <b>selectivity</b> probit <b>model</b> assumes that the error terms in the participation and market choice stages are correlated and normally distributed, and this is also its weakness as there is no formal procedure for verifying this. Despite this weakness, it is still useful when modelling two discrete outcomes in a single process.|$|R
