40|$|The use of {{parenteral}} nutritional supplementation of phosphorus {{may lead}} to exhibit higher plasma phosphate concentrations and less radiological features in premature neonates susceptible to osteopenia. The present study aimed to assess the beneficial effects of adding intravenous phosphorus to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on calcium and phosphorus metabolism in preterm neonates by measuring bone mineral content. This open-labeled randomized clinical trial was conducted on premature neonates who were hospitalized at NICU. The neonates {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups received TPN with intravenous <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate</b> or Glycophos (1. 5 mmol/kg/day) or TPN without <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate.</b> At the end of the four weeks of treatment, the presence of osteopenia was examined using DEXA Scan. After completing treatment protocols, the group received TPN with intravenous Glycophos had significantly lower serum alkaline phosphatase (360 ± 60 versus 762 ± 71, P < 0. 001), as well as higher serum calcium to creatinine ratio (1. 6 ± 0. 3 versus 0. 44 ± 0. 13, P < 0. 001) compared to the control group received TPN without Glycophos. Those who received TPN with intravenous Glycophos experienced more increase in bone mineral density than those in control group (0. 13 ± 0. 01 versus 0. 10 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} serum calcium and serum vitamin D between the case and control groups. Adding intravenous <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate</b> to TPN in premature neonates can compensate the lack of bone mineral content and help to prevent osteopenia...|$|E

40|$|Optimization of {{the medium}} for biosurfactants {{production}} by probiotic bacteria (Lactococcus lactis 53 and Streptococcus thermophilus A) was carried out using response surface methodology. Both biosurfactants were proved to be growth-associated, thus the desired response selected for the optimization was the biomass concentration. The selected factors based on MRS medium for L. lactis 53 growth were peptone, meat extract, yeast extract, lactose, ammonium citrate and KH 2 PO 4. For S. thermophilus A based on the M 17 medium, the selected factors were peptone, meat extract, yeast extract, lactose, soya peptone and <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate.</b> The optimum MRS composition {{was found to be}} 38. 6 g/l peptone, 43. 0 g/l lactose, 10 g/l meat extract, 5 g/l yeast extract, 1. 08 g/l Tween- 80 ®, 2 g/l KH 2 PO 4, 2 g/l CH 3 COONa, 2 g/l ammonium citrate, 0. 2 g/l MgSO 4 • 7 H 2 O and 0. 05 g/l MnSO 4 • 4 H 2 O. The optimized medium allowed a mass of produced biosurfactant (milligram per gram cell dry weight) 1. 6 times higher compared to MRS standard medium. The optimum medium composition for growing S. thermophilus A consists of 5. 0 g/l peptone, 5. 7 g/l lactose, 5. 0 g/l meat extract, 2. 5 g/l yeast extract, 5. 0 g/l soya peptone, 26. 4 g/l <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate,</b> 0. 5 g/l ascorbic acid and 0. 25 g/l MgSO 4 • 7 H 2 O.

40|$|RCJ 3. 1, a clonally derived cell {{population}} isolated from 21 -d fetal rat calvaria, expresses the osteoblast-associated characteristics of polygonal morphology, a cAMP response to parathyroid hormone, synthesis of predominantly type I collagen, {{and the presence}} of 1, 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -regulated alkaline phosphatase activity. When cultured in the presence of ascorbic acid, <b>sodium</b> beta- <b>glycerophosphate,</b> and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, this clone differentiated in a time-dependent manner into four morphologically distinct phenotypes of known mesenchymal origin. Multinucleated muscle cells were observed as early as 9 - 10 d in culture, lipid-containing adipocytes formed after 12 d, chondrocyte nodules were observed after 16 d, and mineralized bone nodules formed after 21 d in culture. The differentiated cell types were characterized morphologically, histochemically, and immunohistochemically. The formation of adipocytes and chondrocytes was dependent upon the addition of dexamethasone; the muscle and bone phenotypes were also expressed at low frequency in the absence of dexamethasone. The sex steroid hormones progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol had no effect on differentiation in this system, suggesting that the effects of dexamethasone represent effects specific for glucocorticosteroids. Increasing concentrations of dexamethasone (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 6) M) increased the numbers of myotubes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes; however, when present continuously for 35 d, the lower concentrations appeared to better maintain the muscle and adipocyte phenotypes. Bone nodules were not quantitated because the frequency of bone nodule formation was too low. Single cells obtained by plating RCJ 3. 1 cells at limiting dilutions in the presence of dexamethasone, were shown to give rise to subclones that could differentiate into either single or multiple phenotypes. Thus, the data suggest that this clonal cell line contains subpopulations of mesenchymal progenitor cells which can, under the influence of glucocorticoid hormones, differentiate in vitro into four distinct cell types. It is, therefore, a unique cell line which will be of great use {{in the study of the}} regulation of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantitative}} identification of organic compounds in seawater has been developed. When auxotrophic mutants of Serratia marinorubra were incubated at 21 to 24 C for 72 hr with constant agitation, standard bioassay reference curves were obtained. <b>Sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate</b> (400 mg per liter), ammonium dibasic citrate (5 g per liter), and glycerol (25 ml per liter) supplied the needed nutrients for maximal growth {{with a limited}} concentration of the required metabolite. Data are presented for the microbiological assay for biotin in waters of the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent bays. The range of sensitivity for the biotin mutant A 101 V is 5 to 12 mμg per liter in seawater, with a growth response from 2 to 16 mμg per liter of seawater.

40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} {{requirements of a}} chain-forming diatom, Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve, collected from Yatsushiro Sea, Japan, were investigated in a laboratory culture experiment. Sodium nitrate and <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate</b> were used as nitrogen {{and phosphorus}} sources, respectively. Cultures were grown in modified Provasoli's ASP 2 NTA medium (Provasoli et al. 1957) at 25 ± 1 °C, light intensity 60 µE mˉ² secˉ¹ and photoperiod 12 : 12 -h, L:D cycle. Optimum growth was observed at nitrate concentrations of 3 - 10 mglˉ¹ and phosphate concentrations of 1. 5 - 15 mglˉ¹. Adequate growth was also found at the nitrate concentration of up to as high as 300 mglˉ¹. Significantly poorer growth was found at lower nitrate (15 mglˉ¹) concentrations. From the present study, it is concluded that S. costatum can grow well at wide ranges of nitrate concentrations but is sensitive to higher phosphate concentrations...|$|E

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour {{of steel}} rods {{embedded in a}} chloride polluted mortar containing <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate</b> (GPH) -sodium nitrite (SN) admixtures was studied by EIS technique and polarization curve recording. As a reference, {{the severity of the}} corrosion attacks on steel rods exposed to either a chloride-polluted mortar inhibited or not by SN as well as to a chloride-free uninhibited mortar was also tested. The resistance of steel rods to pitting corrosion is excellent in the presence of SN alone. However, good corrosion resistance was also achieved in the presence of GPH + SN. The lower nitrite amount in the latter mortar can reduce the toxicity problems caused by this anion. GPH is known to protect passive conditions by chemisorptio on the oxide surface film. The synergism in the inhibition process achieved by the admixtures is due to the nitrite oxydizing properties, which allow the oxide film forming and repairing on defects...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructural {{characteristics}} of freeze-dried human blood platelets were investigated. Extensive ice crystal formation {{was found in}} platelets frozen {{in the absence of}} cryoprotective agents. Platelet preservation was much improved by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, or dimethyl acetamide, with glucose or 0. 25 M <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate,</b> to platelet-rich plasma prior to the freeze drying process. Platelet membranes and organelles were generally well preserved, and many granules demonstrated eccentric areas of electron density. Microtubules were not clearly identified, but some platelets showed tubule-like structures within platelet hyaloplasm. Pseudopods were often observed at the platelet surface, and often contained membrane-bound granule-like structures. Some pseudopods contained electrondense material which extended between adjacent platelets in interplatelet bridges and which was released to the surrounding medium. Interplatelet bridge formation was not prevented by chelation of calcium by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that contractile protein is present in interplatelet bridges and serves as a basis for clot retraction...|$|E

In the epidermis, phosphatase was present in the nucleoli of the cells of the barbs and in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cylinder cells. The pattern of activity was the same with all substrates except yeast adenylic acid, although the intensity of the reaction varied with the various substrates. With yeast adenylic acid, epidermal activity was confined primarily to the nucleoli of the cells;To determine whether the differences in reactivity were due to different phosphatases, the activating or inhibiting effects of Mg++, Mn++, Be++, Zn++, Fe+++, HAsO 4 =, HAsO 3 =, CN-, semicarbazide, iodoacetate, Versene, glycine, alanine, cysteine, histidine, methionine, proline, valine, serine, lysine, and arginine were studied in conjunction with several of the substrates;Mg++ was necessary for activity with muscle adenylic acid, hexose diphosphate, and fructose- 6 -phosphate. At high concentrations, Zn ++ inhibited activity with all substrates except fructose- 6 -phosphate, and in low concentration stimulated activity with yeast adenylic acid. Yeast adenylic acid showed strong nucleolar activity at concentrations of arsenate which inhibited activity with all other substrates. Versene, iodoacetate, semicarbazide, Be++, and CN- in high concentrations inhibited phosphatase activity. Mn++, Fe+++, and HAsO 3 = had no apparent effect on phosphatase. Cysteine and histidine had a greater inhibitory effect on phosphatase than the other amino acids. At low concentrations, glycine promoted activity with muscle adenylic acid. Valine, proline, and methionine in low concentrations gave some indication of possible stimulation of activity with sodium glycerophosphate;The activity of phosphatase with yeast adenylic acid differs from that with muscle adenylic acid in its response to some of the inhibitors and activators. The activity with both of the adenylic acids differs from that obtained with <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate.</b> The fructose sugars were inhibited by lower concentrations of the chemicals than inhibited activity with sodium glycerophosphate;Epidermal phosphatase shows a greater sensitivity to the inhibiting agents than the phosphatase in the pulp. Cytoplasmic phosphatase is more easily inhibited than that in the nucleoli;These data indicate that the nucleolus is the source of {{at least part of the}} phosphatase.

40|$|Hamsters {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of calcium glycerophosphate on dental caries. Within the 60 -day experimental period, cal-cium glycerophosphate significantly reduced caries when fed in the diet at levels of 1 %g and higher, and when applied topically at levels of 2 % and higher. The importance of dietary supplements of inorganic phosphorus compounds as cario-static agents was first suggested by Osborne, Noriskin, and Stazl in 1937. They observed that human tooth enamel was decalcified in vitro when incubated in the presence of re-fined flour and sucrose; however, decalcifica-tion did not occur when the incubation me-dium had been supplemented with organic phosphorus compounds. Based on chemical analyses, Osborne postulated that a protec-tive agent had been removed during the refining process of flour and sugar. The pro-tective agent was later identified as a phos-phate ion esterified to organic molecules. 2 Calcium glycerophosphate, an organic phos-phorus compound, seems to be especially well suited for supplementing diets with ad-ditional phosphorus; it is nontoxic, has a lengthy history for systemic administration in calcium and phosphorus deficiencies, and {{has been shown to be}} an effective anticaries agent when fed to laboratory animals. Many separate investigations have since demonstrated that increased levels of phos-phate in the diet reduce the severity of den-tal caries in laboratory animals.

40|$|Premature {{degradation}} of concrete structures {{is one of}} the most important causes contributing to the wastage of non-renewable resources in the construction industry and in most cases it is due to corrosion of steel reinforcement. The aim of this research is to identify new inhibiting formulations, useful to hinder the corrosion of steel reinforcement, in the concomitant presence of chlorides and carbonation and to investigate their mechanism of inhibition. With this purpose, exposures of steel samples to solutions simulating the composition of the pore electrolyte in carbonated concrete containing chlorides (pH 7, 0. 1 M NaCl) have been carried out. The inhibitors studied are <b>sodium</b> <b>glycerophosphate</b> (GPH), sodium salts of benzoic acid derivatives, that is 2 -aminobenzoate (2 AMB), 3 -aminobenzoate (3 AMB), 4 -aminobenzoate (4 AMB) and N-phenyl- 2 -amino-benzoate (PhAMB) sodium salts. Both the single additives and GPH / amino-benzoates mixtures have been tested, at the additive concentration of 0. 05 M (with the exception of PhAMB used under saturated condition, that is about 0. 025 M). The evolution of the corrosion process has been monitored during three days exposures by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization curve recording. It has been shown that, among the substances used as single additives, only 3 AMB has a good inhibiting efficiency, while GPH induces synergistic corrosion inhibition when mixed with 2 AMB, 4 AMB and PhAMB, but not 3 AMB. At the end of the exposure period, surface analysis techniques (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy - FESEM, Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy – EDS, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy - XPS, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy - FTIR) have been applied to investigate the inhibition mechanism of the different formulations and in particular of the mixture 0. 05 M GPH + 0. 05 M 2 AMB. In this case, the FESEM observations have shown the growth of a rather thick protective film onto the steel surface. XPS analysis performed during continuous sputtering of the sample surface by means of an in situ 3 KeV Ar-ion beam (depth profile mode) reveals that this film consists of an organic salt of Fe(II), containing a low percentage of phosphorous (0. 8 - 1. 7 wt...|$|E
