25|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology and neuroscience, <b>spatial</b> memory {{is the part}} of memory responsible for recording information about one's environment and <b>spatial</b> orientation. For example, a person's <b>spatial</b> memory is required in order to navigate around a familiar city, just as a rat's <b>spatial</b> memory is needed to learn the location of food {{at the end of a}} maze. It is often argued that in both humans and animals, <b>spatial</b> memories are summarized as a cognitive map. <b>Spatial</b> memory has representations within working, short-term memory and long-term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with <b>spatial</b> memory. Many methods are used for measuring <b>spatial</b> memory in children, adults, and animals.|$|E
25|$|In the Morris water maze task rats {{are used}} to test their <b>spatial</b> {{learning}} in two kinds of conditions: <b>spatial</b> and nonspatial. In the <b>spatial</b> condition, a platform is hidden by using murky water and in the nonspatial condition, the platform is visible. The <b>spatial</b> condition the rat must rely on their <b>spatial</b> memory to find the platform whereas the nonspatial condition is used for comparison purposes.|$|E
25|$|Hemisphere {{specialization}} {{is found}} in this brain region. The left prefrontal cortex preferentially processes categorical <b>spatial</b> memory including source memory (reference to <b>spatial</b> relationships between a place or event), while the right prefrontal cortex preferentially processes coordinate <b>spatial</b> memory including item memory (reference to <b>spatial</b> relationships between features of an item).|$|E
25|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>spatial</b> ecology are fundamental {{to understanding the}} <b>spatial</b> dynamics of population and community ecology. The <b>spatial</b> heterogeneity of populations and communities plays {{a central role in}} such ecological theories such as succession, adaptation, community stability, competition, predator-prey interactions, parasitism, and epidemics. The rapidly expanding field of landscape ecology utilizes the basic aspects of <b>spatial</b> ecology in its research.|$|E
25|$|The medial {{prefrontal cortex}} {{processes}} egocentric <b>spatial</b> information. It {{participates in the}} processing of short-term <b>spatial</b> memory used to guide planned search behavior and is believed to join <b>spatial</b> information with its motivational significance. The identification of neurons that anticipate expected rewards in a <b>spatial</b> task support this hypothesis. The medial prefrontal cortex is also implicated in the temporal organization of information.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatial</b> file {{managers}} use a <b>spatial</b> metaphor {{to represent}} files and directories {{as if they}} were actual physical objects. A <b>spatial</b> file manager imitates the way people interact with physical objects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatial</b> {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In <b>spatial</b> multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different <b>spatial</b> signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. <b>Spatial</b> multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of <b>spatial</b> streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. <b>Spatial</b> multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. <b>Spatial</b> multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different <b>spatial</b> signatures allows good separability.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have argued}} whether neglect is a {{disorder}} of <b>spatial</b> attention or <b>spatial</b> representation.|$|E
25|$|Induced <b>spatial</b> {{autocorrelation}} (or 'induced <b>spatial</b> dependence') {{arises from}} the species response to the <b>spatial</b> structure of exogenous (external) factors, which are themselves spatially autocorrelated. An example {{of this would be}} the winter habitat range of deer, which use conifers for heat retention and forage.|$|E
25|$|There is less {{interference}} between {{visual and}} <b>spatial</b> tasks than between two visual tasks or two <b>spatial</b> tasks.|$|E
25|$|Blocking {{plasticity}} in {{this region}} results in problems in goal-directed navigation and impairs the ability to remember precise locations. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus cannot learn or remember <b>spatial</b> layouts and patients having undergone hippocampal removal are severely impaired in <b>spatial</b> navigation. Monkeys with lesions to this area cannot learn object-place associations and rats also display <b>spatial</b> deficits by not reacting to <b>spatial</b> change. In addition, rats with hippocampal lesions were shown to have temporally ungraded (time-independent) retrograde amnesia that is resistant to recognition of a learned platform task only when the entire hippocampus is lesioned, but not when it is partially lesioned. Deficits in <b>spatial</b> memory are also found in <b>spatial</b> discrimination tasks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatial</b> {{learning}} requires both NMDA and AMPA receptors, consolidation requires NMDA receptors, and the {{retrieval of}} <b>spatial</b> memories requires AMPA receptors. In rodents, <b>spatial</b> memory {{has been shown}} to covary with the size of a part of the hippocampal mossy fiber projection.|$|E
25|$|Support for the {{division}} of visual and <b>spatial</b> memory components is found through experiments using the dual-task paradigm. A {{number of studies have}} shown that the retention of visual shapes or colours (i.e., visual information) is disrupted by the presentation of irrelevant pictures or dynamic visual noise. Conversely, the retention of location (i.e., <b>spatial</b> information) is disrupted only by <b>spatial</b> tracking tasks, <b>spatial</b> tapping tasks, and eye movements. For example, participants completed both the VPT and the Corsi Blocks Task in a selective interference experiment. During the retention interval of the VPT, the subject viewed irrelevant pictures (e.g., avant-garde paintings). The <b>spatial</b> interference task required participants to follow, by touching the stimuli, an arrangement of small wooden pegs which were concealed behind a screen. Both the visual and <b>spatial</b> spans were shortened by their respective interference tasks, confirming that the Corsi Blocks Task relates primarily to <b>spatial</b> working memory.|$|E
25|$|The {{perirhinal cortex}} is {{associated}} with both <b>spatial</b> reference and <b>spatial</b> working memory. It processes relational information of environmental cues and locations.|$|E
25|$|Apple's Finder in macOS was {{designed}} {{with a similar}} integration of <b>spatial</b> and navigational modes, meaning that the <b>spatial</b> mode did not actually work.|$|E
25|$|Surface pattern {{analysis}} deals with spatially continuous phenomena. After the <b>spatial</b> {{distribution of the}} variables is determined through discrete sampling, statistical methods are used to quantify the magnitude, intensity, and extent of <b>spatial</b> autocorrelation present in the data (such as correlograms, variograms, and peridograms), {{as well as to}} map the amount of <b>spatial</b> variation.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} {{that patients with}} amusia also have difficulty {{when it comes to}} <b>spatial</b> processing. Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both <b>spatial</b> and musical processing tasks, which is most likely due to their deficit. Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and <b>spatial</b> tasks, while amusics do not. Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process <b>spatial</b> representations.|$|E
25|$|The {{hippocampus}} provides {{animals with}} a <b>spatial</b> map of their environment. It stores information regarding non-egocentric space (egocentric means {{in reference to}} one's body position in space) and therefore supports viewpoint independence in <b>spatial</b> memory. This means that it allows for viewpoint manipulation from memory. It is however, important for long-term <b>spatial</b> memory of allocentric space (reference to external cues in space). Maintenance and retrieval of memories are thus relational or context dependent. The hippocampus makes use of reference and working memory and has {{the important role of}} processing information about <b>spatial</b> locations.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that women tend to rely more on visual {{information}} than men in a number of <b>spatial</b> tasks related to perceived orientation. However, 'visual dependence' {{has been found to be}} task specific and not a general characteristic of <b>spatial</b> processing that differs between the sexes. Here an alternative hypothesis suggests that heightened visual dependence in females does not generalize to all aspects of <b>spatial</b> processing but is probably attributable to task-specific differences in how male and females brains process multisensory <b>spatial</b> information.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{evidence}} for the <b>spatial</b> memory of some species of animals, such as rats, indicates that they do use <b>spatial</b> memory to locate and retrieve hidden food stores.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatial</b> ecology {{represents}} the ultimate distributional or <b>spatial</b> unit {{occupied by a}} species. In a particular habitat shared by several species, each of the species is usually confined to its own micro habitat or <b>spatial</b> niche because two species in the same general territory cannot usually occupy the same ecological niche for any significant length of time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatial,</b> {{represents}} a grouping of components of modelling and 3D visualisation. This brand {{resulted from the}} acquisition in 2000 of <b>Spatial</b> Technology who owned the modelling software ACIS.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{investigated}} {{the role of}} <b>spatial</b> memory and visual memory {{in the ability to}} complete arithmetic word problems. Children in the study completed the Corsi Block Task (forward and backward series) and a <b>spatial</b> matrix task, as well as a visual memory task called the house recognition test. Poor problem-solvers were impaired on the Corsi Block Tasks and the <b>spatial</b> matrix task, but performed normally on the house recognition test when compared to normally achieving children. The experiment demonstrated that poor problem solving is related specifically to deficient processing of <b>spatial</b> information.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{memory is}} {{responsible}} for retaining visual shapes and colours (i.e., what), whereas <b>spatial</b> memory {{is responsible for}} information about locations and movement (i.e., where). This distinction is not always straightforward since part of visual memory involves <b>spatial</b> information and vice versa. For example, memory for object shapes usually involves maintaining information about the <b>spatial</b> arrangement of the features which define the object in question.|$|E
25|$|In nature, {{organisms are}} neither {{distributed}} uniformly nor at random, forming instead {{some sort of}} <b>spatial</b> pattern. This is due to various energy inputs, disturbances, and species interactions that result in spatially patchy structures or gradients. This <b>spatial</b> variance in the environment creates diversity in communities of organisms, {{as well as in}} the variety of the observed biological and ecological events. The type of <b>spatial</b> arrangement present may suggest certain interactions within and between species, such as competition, predation, and reproduction. On the other hand, certain <b>spatial</b> patterns may also rule out specific ecological theories previously thought to be true.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} {{fundamental}} tradeoff between transmit diversity and <b>spatial</b> multiplexing gains in a MIMO system (Zheng and Tse, 2003). In particular, achieving high <b>spatial</b> multiplexing gains is of profound importance in modern wireless systems.|$|E
25|$|BiFC allows {{measurement}} of <b>spatial</b> and temporal changes in protein complexes, even {{in response to}} activating and inhibiting drugs and subcellularly, providing the highest <b>spatial</b> resolution of in vivo protein–protein interaction assays.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and sleep {{has also been}} a researched association. Sleep deprivation actually hinders memory performance improvement due to an active disruption of <b>spatial</b> memory consolidation. Therefore, <b>spatial</b> memory is enhanced by a period of sleep.|$|E
25|$|Smoothing, or <b>spatial</b> filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth <b>spatial</b> map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every <b>spatial</b> point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true <b>spatial</b> extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed <b>spatial</b> extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have explained agoraphobia as an attachment deficit, i.e., the temporary {{loss of the}} ability to tolerate <b>spatial</b> separations from a secure base. Recent empirical research has also linked attachment and <b>spatial</b> theories of agoraphobia.|$|E
25|$|Relationals are quasi-nouns expressing some {{relationship}} (often <b>spatial)</b> {{to their}} possessor complement. Many of the relationals perceivably originate in locatives (in -ra) of nouns designating {{parts of the}} body employed metaphorically to convey <b>spatial</b> or other relations.|$|E
25|$|Varying {{vestibular}} system stimulation has {{an effect}} on place cells. The vestibular system, part of the labyrinth of the inner ear, {{plays an important role in}} <b>spatial</b> memory by tuning into self-motion such as acceleration. Bilateral lesions of the vestibular system in patients cause abnormal firing of hippocampal place cells as evidenced, in part, by difficulties with aforementioned <b>spatial</b> tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task. The dysfunction in <b>spatial</b> memory seen with damage to the vestibular system is lasting and possibly permanent, particularly if there is bilateral damage. For example, <b>spatial</b> memory deficits of patients with chronic vestibular loss is seen 5–10 years after a complete loss of the bilateral vestibular labyrinths.|$|E
25|$|Each HTM region learns by {{identifying}} and memorizing <b>spatial</b> patterns - {{combinations of input}} bits that often occur at the same time. It then identifies temporal sequences of <b>spatial</b> patterns {{that are likely to}} occur one after another.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} {{the two systems}} work together in some capacity but different tasks {{have been developed to}} highlight the unique abilities involved in either visual or <b>spatial</b> memory. For example, the visual patterns test (VPT) measures visual span whereas the Corsi Blocks Task measures <b>spatial</b> span. Correlational studies of the two measures suggest a separation between visual and <b>spatial</b> abilities, {{due to a lack of}} correlation found between them in both healthy and brain damaged patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{practical}} use of <b>spatial</b> ecology concepts {{is essential to}} understanding the consequences of fragmentation and habitat loss for wildlife. Understanding the response of a species' to a <b>spatial</b> structure provides useful information in regards to biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of <b>spatial</b> trends {{has been}} used to {{research}} wildlife management, fire ecology, population ecology, disease ecology, invasive species, marine ecology, and carbon sequestration modeling using the <b>spatial</b> relationships and patterns to determine ecological processes and their effects on the environment.|$|E
