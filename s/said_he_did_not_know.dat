25|$|In October 1935 District Attorney William E. Parke {{requested}} that {{a grand jury}} investigate the fatal shooting of Evelyn Hoey. The prosecutor asked that the shooting be studied {{as well as the}} conduct of members of the coroner's jury, and people with whom they had been in contact. Particularly he wanted to identify their association with certain newspaper men who covered the inquest. Parke believed the jury's verdict indicated they felt a homicide had been committed.

25|$|On 8 May 1985, Reyat {{bought a}} Micronta digital {{automobile}} clock at the Radio Shack store in Duncan. Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, {{it could also}} be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer, but he returned a week later for an electrical relay after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls between Parmar's residence in Vancouver and Reyat from either his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island that month, which got Reyat added to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities. The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003 when at first he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what three clocks he had bought could be used for. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. In that case, the relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a blasting cap which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives such as dynamite.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E

500|$|MalcolmX {{was equally}} {{critical}} {{of the civil rights}} movement.

500|$|After a leak by Mehdi Hashemi, {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, the Lebanese magazine Ash-Shiraa exposed the arrangement on November 3, 1986. This was the first public reporting of the weapons-for-hostages deal. The operation was discovered only after an airlift of guns (Corporate Air Services HPF821) was downed over Nicaragua. Eugene Hasenfus, who was captured by Nicaraguan authorities after surviving the plane crash, initially alleged {{in a press conference}} on Nicaraguan soil that two of his coworkers, Max Gomez and Ramon Medina, worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. He later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> whether they did or not.

500|$|Tensions also {{developed}} between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Jones {{soon after the}} election. During the campaign, Jones {{was quoted as saying}} that he had talked with Wilkinson about being more open with the press and said that, if elected, he would not be a [...] "yes man" [...] for Wilkinson. At a press conference shortly after the election, Wilkinson <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what role Jones would play in his administration and that much of it would depend on what Jones had meant when {{he said he did not}} agree with all of Wilkinson's positions. In late November 1987, Wilkinson announced that Jones would spearhead the promotion of the administration's agricultural agenda. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that this would not be Jones' primary role in the administration but that no other specifics had been provided.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} was behind only [...] {{as the most}} watched new show of the week, albeit in a week with fewer new shows because of the presidential debate coverage. Fox chose to debut Dark Angel instead of airing the first presidential debate, a move which TV analyst Marc Berman praised, saying: [...] "The people who watch the debates aren't the people who'll tune into Dark Angel anyway", though he {{predicted}} that the premiere's high ratings would not hold up as the show competed against more varied competition in subsequent weeks. It was the tenth most popular show overall that week, attracting 17.4 million viewers. Cameron <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if the broadcast time change for the second season would have a positive or {{negative effect on the}} show's ratings, though R. D. Heldenfels of the Sun Journal noted the poor ratings of Friday night television, especially the low viewing rates among 18 to 24-year-olds, the age-group that Dark Angel was most popular with. The new time slot saw a ratings drop; for the 2001–02 season Dark Angel averaged 6 million viewers, ranking number 114 in the Nielsen ratings.|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, {{the writers}} told GameSpot that God of War will [...] "improve on films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals {{by taking a}} step in a bolder direction." [...] Melton said that Sony has [...] "encouraged" [...] them to make it {{different}} from other films in the same genre. It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{the status of the}} film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think {{it will be hard to}} get that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done. As of [...] , , the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, a release date has not been set, but the script has been [...] "turned in". It has a budget of $150 million USD.|$|E

He also revealed that on three occasions during the race, {{he believed that the}} possibility of him securing the victory had ended. Vergne, who finished in second, had mixed emotions, feeling that the victory was in his grasp but was happy that he secured a place on the podium and was in contention for the championship: [...] "We started very far away but I know I’m in the right team with the right car to win the championship. I think we’re coming back a little bit better and we’re getting stronger every race as a team." [...] Third-place finisher Bird said that it was [...] "a good race" [...] for everyone who watched the event on television and the sport.

He visits her {{late at night and}} tells him about an affair he had with a married woman at age 16, among other secrets. Although initially confused, Ann is ultimately flattered by the gesture.
