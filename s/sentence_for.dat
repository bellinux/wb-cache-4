5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> this crime is six or seven years, while the <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E

He also hired those associated with collaboration for his Studios; his new colourist, Josette Baujot, was the wife of a recently assassinated member of the Walloon Legion, and his new secretary, Baudouin van der Branden de Reeth, had served a prison <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> working at Le Nouveau Journal during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|Gordimer's {{homage to}} Fischer extends to using {{excerpts}} from his writings and public {{statements in the}} book.

5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a <b>sentence</b> <b>for</b> the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders.

The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
