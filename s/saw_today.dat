2500|$|On September 21, 2007, {{numerous}} news agencies {{reported on}} Giuliani's interruption by, presumably, {{a phone call}} from his wife during a publicized National Rifle Association speech. Shortly thereafter a vast array of Internet blogs criticized the call as being a phony political gimmick. A source from within Giuliani's camp said, [...] "what you <b>saw</b> <b>today</b> was a candidate in a spontaneous moment on the campaign trail." [...] While Jeff Barker, a campaign spokesman confirmed, [...] "the call was not planned."

2500|$|In {{a heated}} Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling [...] "a {{flat-out}} lie" [...] over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. [...] "What we just <b>saw</b> <b>today</b> {{was an absolute}} demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press {{over and over and}} over again was a simple lie", Cruz said of Senate Republican Leader McConnell. Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority in both houses of Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with John McCain saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie." [...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill, whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E

50|$|Two-stroke {{chainsaws}} require about 2 - 5% {{of oil in}} {{the fuel}} to lubricate the engine, while the motor in electrical chain-saws is normally lubricated for life. Most modern gas operated <b>saws</b> <b>today</b> require a fuel mix of 2% (1:50). Regular gas from most gas stations contain 5 to 10% ethanol which can result in problems of the equipment. Ethanol dissolves plastic, rubber and other material. This leads to problems especially on older equipment. A workaround of this problem is to run fresh fuel only and run the saw dry {{at the end of the}} work.|$|R
