50|$|Corrigiola litoralis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant known by the common name <b>strapwort.</b> It can be found as a native species in Europe and Africa, and has been introduced to Australia and North America. In Europe it is a plant of shingly pool margins where water levels fluctuate. In Africa it is found {{in a variety of}} habitats.|$|E
50|$|An area on {{the east}} side of Loe Pool has been cleared for the re-introduction of <b>strapwort</b> (Corrigiola litoralis), a plant {{identified}} by Natural England as a plant at high risk of going extinct by 2020. The plant was first recorded on the beach near the tin mine at Helston (which is on Loe Pool) by F Borone in 1800. By 1908 it was becoming rarer and was last recorded here in 1915, its loss was believed to have been caused by a lack of fluctuating water levels following work to the adit (outflow from the lake). By the 20th-century <b>strapwort</b> was only growing, within the UK, at Slapton Ley in south Devon. Seed was grown in a greenhouse at Paignton Zoo, Devon by the Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT), and in May 2015 over 1,000 seedlings were planted {{on the east side}} of Loe Pool.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{population}} of Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti) at the site, and Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris) are resident. Slapton Ley is the only UK site for <b>strapwort</b> (Corrigiola litoralis), a plant identified by Natural England as being {{at high risk of}} going extinct by 2020. Seed taken from the site, and grown at Paignton Zoo are due to be planted at Loe Pool, Cornwall in May 2015; where it has not been recorded since 1915.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the ponds over many centuries with constantly changing levels of water has also created a habitat for some extremely rare plant communities. On the soils of many ponds coral necklace (Ilecebrum verticillatum), <b>strapwort</b> (Corrigiola litoralis) or shoreweed (Littorella uniflora) may be found growing. They are dependent on this constant fluctuation of water levels in the reservoir and so the nature conservation authorities have agreed with the pond operators an operating regime that will secure {{the existence of these}} plants in the waterbodies concerned. By other ponds there are meadow bogs (Kleinseggenried), which are rich in sedges, rushes and cottongrass and moss communities.|$|E
