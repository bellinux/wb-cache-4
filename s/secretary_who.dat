5|$|Despite Leider's efforts, {{all seven}} Torah scrolls were unsalvageable, {{and had to}} be buried. They had {{initially}} been buried in her backyard by Rebecca Heggelund, Beth Israel's non-Jewish <b>secretary,</b> <b>who</b> first received them after their rescue, and were subsequently re-buried next to the grave of Beth Israel's gabbai Meyer Lachoff. Lachoff had died just after Katrina, but could not be buried in New Orleans until months later.|$|E

The mayor is Ge Honglin, and the CPC Committee <b>Secretary</b> (<b>who</b> {{is considered to be}} more powerful than the mayor) is Huang Xingchu.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the committee's {{members have}} {{represented}} seven political parties, including the Liberal Party, the Centre Party and the Christian Democratic Party. The awards in 1935 (to Carl von Ossietzky), 1973 (to Henry Kissinger) and 1994 (to Yasser Arafat) caused {{members of the}} committee to withdraw due to disagreement with the committee decision. Six people have sat as the committee's <b>secretary,</b> <b>who</b> is also director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute. Since 1990, this has been Geir Lundestad, {{professor of history at the}} University of Oslo.|$|E

5|$|John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's <b>secretary,</b> <b>who</b> he {{regarded}} like a son, drew {{a sketch of}} the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1926 under Wyatt's supervision. The drawing placed participants and selected witnesses on Fremont Street in Tombstone, and Earp annotated it with lines indicating how the participants moved during the 30-second shootout. It was sold at auction by Alexander Autographs in early October 2010, for $380,000.|$|E
5|$|Justinian {{selected}} one of {{his most}} trusted and talented generals, Belisarius, who had recently distinguished himself against the Persians and in the suppression of the Nika riots, to lead the expedition. As Ian Hughes points out, Belisarius was also eminently suited for this appointment for two other reasons: he was a native Latin-speaker, and was solicitous of the welfare of the local population, keeping a tight leash on his troops. Both these qualities would be crucial in winning support from the Latin-speaking African population. Belisarius was accompanied by his wife, Antonina, and by Procopius, his <b>secretary,</b> <b>who</b> wrote the history of the war.|$|E
5|$|Professional {{services}} {{for members of}} the Senate and the House of Delegates are provided by the Department of Legislative Services, which is non-partisan. Individual members are also assisted by partisan staff members, and those in leadership positions have additional partisan staff.

Each Senator has one year-round administrative assistant, as well as a <b>secretary</b> <b>who</b> assists them during the legislative session. There is also an allowance given to help pay for district offices.|$|E

5|$|Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was an {{able and}} {{hard-working}} man, but {{difficult to deal}} with. Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War <b>Secretary,</b> <b>who,</b> in combination with General of the Army Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Youth League of China, {{also known}} as the Young Communist League of China or simply the Communist Youth League, is a youth {{movement}} of the People's Republic of China for youth between the ages of fourteen and twenty-eight, run by the Communist Party of China (CPC). The league is organized on the party pattern. Its leader is its First <b>Secretary,</b> <b>who</b> {{is also a member of}} the CPC Central Committee. The current First Secretary is Qin Yizhi. The Communist Youth League is responsible also for guiding the activities of the Young Pioneers (for children below the age of fourteen).|$|E
5|$|The {{ascendancy}} of Li Yuanhong to Chinese Presidency in 1916, {{led to the}} negotiations reopening through his former private <b>secretary</b> <b>who</b> resided in the United States at the time. In exchange for allowing arms shipments to India via China's borders, China was offered German military assistance and the rights to 10% of any material shipped to India via China. The negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful due to Sun Yat Sen's opposition to an alliance with Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, the Central Secretariat {{contained}} only 7 Joint <b>Secretaries</b> <b>who</b> {{were all}} members of the Imperial Civil Service. However, until 1946, there were only 25 Joint Secretaries in Government of India.|$|R

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home <b>Secretary,</b> <b>who</b> had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway {{over most of}} the capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home <b>Secretary,</b> <b>who</b> in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent <b>Secretary</b> <b>who</b> was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E

50|$|Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico {{establishes}} {{that the}} Governor shall be assisted by <b>Secretaries</b> <b>who</b> shall collectively constitute the Governor's advisory council and be {{designated as the}} Council of Secretaries although it's mostly {{referred to as the}} Cabinet.|$|R
5|$|Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) {{ultimately}} {{gives in}} and joins Michael; she stops in to invite her husband Bob Vance (Robert R. Shafer) but his <b>secretary,</b> <b>who</b> resembles Phyllis, tells her Bob is not available, making Phyllis jealous. In Cafe Disco, Phyllis throws out her back after dancing too hard. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) brings {{her into the}} conference room and starts giving her a kind of massage he usually gives injured horses. The two spend a long amount of time together and she eventually confides in Dwight that she fears her husband is {{having an affair with}} his new secretary, but the two laugh together when Phyllis realizes how ridiculous the idea sounds.|$|E
5|$|The Chancellor was {{effectively}} the first {{minister of the}} kingdom. His department, the chancery, {{was responsible for the}} Great Seal, which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. His key responsibility was to preside at meetings of the privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session. The second most prestigious office was the <b>Secretary,</b> <b>who</b> was responsible for the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603. The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} Register {{has been held}} by the Dean of Windsor since 1558. The Garter Principal King of Arms is ex officio the senior officer of the College of Arms (the heraldic {{authority}} of England), and is usually appointed from among the other officers of arms at the College. As the title suggests, Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order's officer of arms, attending to the companions' crests and banners of arms, which are exhibited in the chapel. The <b>Secretary,</b> <b>who</b> acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order, has since 1952 also been selected from the other officers of the College of Arms. The office of Usher is held by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, {{who is also the}} Serjeant-at-Arms of the United Kingdom House of Lords (although his functions are more often performed there by his deputy, the Yeoman Usher).|$|E
