25|$|The primary {{resistance}} {{element of a}} foil resistor is a <b>special</b> <b>alloy</b> foil several micrometers thick. Since their introduction in the 1960s, foil resistors have had the best precision and stability of any resistor available. One of the important parameters influencing stability is the {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR).

The added corrosion resistance in titanium alloys {{led to the}} development of a <b>special</b> <b>alloy</b> with 0.1% ruthenium. Ruthenium is also used in some advanced high-temperature single-crystal superalloys, with applications that include the turbines in jet engines. Several nickel based superalloy compositions are described, such as EPM-102 (with 3% Ru), TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), TMS-138, and TMS-174, the latter two containing 6% rhenium. Fountain pen nibs are frequently tipped with ruthenium alloy.
