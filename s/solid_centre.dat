60|$|Roberts had {{prepared}} the way by clearing out the south-eastern {{corner of the}} State, {{and at the moment}} of his advance his forces covered a semicircular front of about forty miles, the right under Ian Hamilton near Thabanchu, and the left at Karee. This was the broad net which was to be swept from south to north across the Free State, gradually narrowing as it went. The conception was admirable, and appears to have been an adoption of the Boers' own strategy, which had in turn been borrowed from the Zulus. The <b>solid</b> <b>centre</b> could hold any force which faced it, while the mobile flanks, Hutton upon the left and Hamilton upon the right, could lap round and pin it, as Cronje was pinned at Paardeberg. It seems admirably simple when done upon a small scale. But when the scale is one of forty miles, since your front must be broad enough to envelop the front which is opposed to it, and when the scattered wings have to be fed with no railway line to help, it takes such a master of administrative detail as Lord Kitchener to bring the operations to complete success.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. The City of Johannesburg {{is facing}} the {{simultaneous}} challenges of an increased generation of solid waste in the City, unemployment and the running out of land to dispose the waste. Of the solid waste that is generated, 50 % is recyclable while only 10 % is recycled (SOER, 2003 : 69). Solid waste recycling is mainly performed through private sector initiatives in the City of Johannesburg. Consequently, there is no proper coordination with government initiatives. In order for South Africa to increase and sustain economic growth that would decrease unemployment, {{there should be a}} culture of entrepreneurship (Mass, G & Herrington M, 2006 : 7). <b>Solid</b> waste buy-back <b>centres</b> assist in addressing the challenges of dealing with the increased generation of solid waste and the scarcity of land for disposal. These centres also reduce the challenges of unemployment through promoting entrepreneurs to operate solid waste recycling businesses. Developed economies have managed to increase the rate of solid waste recycling to 60 %. The problems associated with solid waste have been reduced by promoting recycling through a combination of legislation and setting-up of agencies to deal with solid waste recycling. South Africa has legislation and stated programmes to deal with solid waste recycling. Nevertheless, there has been complexity with implementing recycling. This {{is the result of a}} lack of co-ordination between the role-players involved in the value chain of solid waste recycling. In order for the City of Johannesburg to increase the recycling of solid waste from 10 % to optimal rates of between 50 % and 60 %, there should be co-ordination of programmes amongst all the role players. In addition, there should also be skills provision to existing and potential entrepreneurs operating the <b>solid</b> waste buy-back <b>centres.</b> All spheres of government should promote solid waste recycling business to potential entrepreneurs and the public in order to recycle 40 % of the recyclable solid waste that is not being recycled. The establishment of a <b>solid</b> waste buy-back <b>centre</b> in the City of Johannesburg is economically viable with some buy-back centre realising a net-profit of least R 5 000 and some more than R 30 000 per month. In order for the <b>solid</b> waste buy-back <b>centre</b> to realise a net-profit of more than R 30 000 per month, there must be more than 40 tons of recyclable solid waste received by the buy-back centre per month. This study has indicated that <b>solid</b> waste buy-back <b>centres</b> rely on the economies of scale. This means that the more recyclable solid waste is received and sold by the <b>solid</b> waste buy-back <b>centres,</b> the more profitable it becomes. Master...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mode of {{a motion}} of the {{satellite}} about its centre of mass, named Two-Axis Rotation in a plane of an orbit is considered. In this mode the satellite, close to dynamically symmetric, rotates around a longitudinal axis, which in turn rotates around normal to {{the plane of the}} orbit; the angular speed of rotation of the longitudinal axis of the satellite in some times exceeds its orbital angular speed, the deviations of the longitudinal axis from the plane of the orbit are small. Two-Axis Rotations are applied, for example, when it is required to ensure rather uniform illumination of a surface of a satellite by the Sun. The analysis of Two-Axis Rotations is carried out with the assumption that the satellite represents a <b>solid,</b> <b>centre</b> of mass of which moves in a constant circular orbit and on which gravitational moment affect.

40|$|Justin Ronald Beatty {{was driving}} on the Trans-Canada Highway on July 23, 2003 when, for no {{apparent}} reason, his truck suddenly crossed the <b>solid</b> <b>centre</b> line and collided with an oncoming car, killing three people. Beatty was charged with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death. He was acquitted at trial {{on the grounds that}} his momentary lapse of attention was not enough to establish fault. The Crown appealed, and the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial after concluding that the trial judge had misapplied the fault standard. Beatty appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which undertook to clarify the test for penal negligence. Writing for the majority, Charron J. expounded that test and restored Beatty’s acquittal. Her judgment offers cogent guidance on a thorny question in criminal law: when is a person criminally liable for causing harm he or she neither intends nor foresees? A core principle of Canadian criminal law is that a wrongful act does not suffice to establish criminal culpability; the accused must also possess a guilty mind. This principle is often expressed via the maxim actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea: the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty. Although this maxim is ubiquitous, it is hardly instructive, for it immediately begs the question what is a guilty mind? This question is so deeply contested and morally freighted as to seem intractable. Nevertheless, it remains critically important we address it. The guilty mind requirement is a key means by which we seek to ensure that only blameworthy people are held criminally liable. Our insistence that criminal liability be reserved for the blameworthy {{is at the core of}} our criminal justice culture. We believe criminal punishment is justified, and justifiably stigmatizing, because we take it to accord with our broader moral judgments. Our beliefs about blameworthiness thus animate and validate the criminal justice system even as we continue to debate them...|$|E

5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of records used a standard small spindle hole slightly more than [...] " [...] in diameter. The only common exception to this is the 7-inch 45 RPM record, which was designed with a center hole slightly more than 1.5" [...] in diameter both for convenience in handling and to accommodate a very fast record-changing mechanism contained inside a correspondingly large spindle, as implemented in RCA Victor's early stand-alone [...] "45" [...] players. The spindle and any records stacked on it rotated with the turntable, so that each waiting disc was already up to speed before it dropped. Large mechanized spindle adaptors were supplied with most multi-speed automatic record changers sold in the 1950s and 1960s, {{but they were not}} as fast and efficient. The large hole also facilitates use in jukeboxes, which mechanically place the [...] "45" [...] onto a turntable with a conical spindle having a matching diameter at its base, making the placement operation easier, safer, and surer than it was with the small-diameter holes and spindles in 78 RPM jukeboxes. Most 7-inch records in the USA continue to be pressed with a large hole, requiring an adaptor to be used on standard turntables. In other territories such as Europe, 7-inch records intended for home use have standard-sized holes. Many such 7-inch records had a center which could be easily snapped out, yielding a record with a larger hole to be used in jukeboxes or certain record-stacking players; this approach was common in the United Kingdom from the 1950s until the early 1980s, with standard, <b>solid</b> <b>centres</b> becoming gradually more common. Some 7-inch singles in the early-mid-1990s had large holes also, but this was a rarity.|$|R
