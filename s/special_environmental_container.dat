50|$|Almost all lunar {{rocks are}} {{depleted}} in volatiles and are completely lacking in hydrated minerals common in Earth rocks. In some regards, lunar rocks {{are closely related}} to Earth's rocks in their isotopic composition of the element oxygen. The Apollo moon rocks were collected using a variety of tools, including hammers, rakes, scoops, tongs, and core tubes. Most were photographed prior to collection to record the condition in which they were found. They were placed inside sample bags and then a <b>Special</b> <b>Environmental</b> Sample <b>Container</b> for return to the Earth to protect them from contamination. In contrast to the Earth, large portions of the lunar crust appear to be composed of rocks with high concentrations of the mineral anorthite. The mare basalts have relatively high iron values. Furthermore, some of the mare basalts have very high levels of titanium (in the form of ilmenite).|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is increasingly promulgated in international and national legal contexts, {{but there is}} {{a long way to go}} in terms of implementation. The role of the judiciary is thus of the greatest importance. The judiciary, at a national level, is faced with the task of explicating the law of sustainable development, case by case. Incrementally a body of environmental jurisprudence is emerging. In performing this task, national judiciaries will be assisted by the exchange of judicial decisions, information and experience between jurisdictions. In this way, national judiciaries may benefit from each other’s knowledge, experience and expertise. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this information-sharing goal. The author's argument is that, prerequisites for establishing <b>special</b> <b>environmental</b> court in India are not available, and a full review for the Indian environmental legislations and judicial structure is needed before deciding the issue of establishing <b>special</b> <b>environmental</b> court. </p...|$|R
