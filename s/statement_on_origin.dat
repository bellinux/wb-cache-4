30|$|In {{addition}} to supporting that consumers {{have the right}} to accurate information <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of food, 15 participating experts agree that COOL of primary materials can increase consumers’ awareness of the world we live in, while one does not think so. Three experts expressed their opinions only on the right to accurate information. Generally, the COOL of primary materials can increase consumers’ awareness of the world, in particular, sensitise them to the producing countries. Moreover, a clear <b>statement</b> <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of main ingredients can help build consumer confidence in today’s global food system.|$|R
50|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{takes no}} {{official}} position {{on whether or}} not biological evolution has occurred, or on the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis as a scientific theory. In the 20th century, the First Presidency of the LDS Church published doctrinal <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of man and creation (see below). In addition, individual leaders of the LDS Church have expressed a variety of personal opinions on evolution, many of which have affected the beliefs and perceptions of Latter-day Saints.|$|R
40|$|We explain {{reasons of}} {{oscillations}} frequently observed in total losses spectra (1 −R−T) calculated {{on the basis}} of measurement spectral photometric data of thin film samples. The first reason of oscillations is related to difference in angles of incidence at which spectral transmittance and reflectance are measured. The second reason is an absorption in a thin film. The third reason is a slight thickness non-uniformity of the film. We observe a good agreement between theoretical models and corresponding measurements, which proves above <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> the <b>origins</b> of oscillations in total losses...|$|R

The couple, moving frequently to complicate investigations, concealed violence on Marina by systematic untrue <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of the girl's injuries, and were even helped by Marina, who, like many abused children, continued despite everything to love her parents and never denounced them.|$|R
3000|$|The experts {{discussed}} {{whether or}} not the <b>statement</b> <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of primary ingredient produced in country A would lower the image of the finished product made in country B. Some experts answered “No”, while some said “Yes” or “possible”. One expert made a general affirmation: “It could either lower or increase it - depends on the products and the countries involved”. Moreover, three experts respectively said: “The quality of ingredient may be more important than the processing”; “COOL of main ingredients would just provide accurate information about where ingredients come from”; when a producing country of main ingredients has a poor reputation, “such labeling would encourage countries with weaker food safety regulations to step up and change their regulations for the better.” [...]...|$|R

Copies were sold as souvenirs, and a copy was also displayed {{in the library of}} Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo (the only high school named after the explorer). On several ceremonial occasions, copies of the plate were presented to Queen Elizabeth II. Yet rumors of E Clampus Vitus involvement in the plate continued to circulate.|$|R
5000|$|On May 13, 2013, the {{governor}} of Tennessee signed House Bill 1084, requiring maple charcoal filtering {{to be used for}} products produced in the state labeling themselves as [...] "Tennessee Whiskey" [...] (with a particular exception tailored to exempt Benjamin Prichard's) and included the existing requirements for bourbon. As federal law requires <b>statements</b> of <b>origin</b> <b>on</b> labels to be accurate, the Tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to Tennessee whiskey.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the European Union, labels (Summaries of Product Characteristics, SmPCs) of biosimilars {{and their}} {{reference}} products {{are in many}} instances almost identical (following a generic approach) despite different data requirements for the authorization of biosimilars and generics. To understand physicians' preferences on type and detail of information in the biosimilar label and their use of information sources when prescribing biologics including biosimilars, EuropaBio surveyed 210 physicians across seven European countries. Among surveyed physicians, 90. 5 % use the label frequently or occasionally as an information source and 87. 2 % deemed a clear <b>statement</b> <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of data helpful or very helpful. When comparing excerpts from the label of an authorized biosimilar and modified texts with additional information, 78. 1 – 82. 9 % preferred the samples with additional information. This survey shows that the label is an appropriate vehicle for providing physicians with information about biologics and that physicians prefer more product-specific information in the biosimilar label...|$|R
25|$|Initially, German {{officials}} made incorrect <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> {{the likely}} <b>origin</b> and strain of Escherichia coli. The German health authorities, without results of ongoing tests, incorrectly linked the O104 serotype to cucumbers imported from Spain. Later, they recognised that Spanish greenhouses {{were not the}} source of the E. coli and cucumber samples did not contain the specific E. coli variant causing the outbreak. Spain consequently expressed anger about having its produce linked with the deadly E. coli outbreak, which cost Spanish exporters US$200 million per week. Russia banned the import of all fresh vegetables from the European Union from early June until 22 June 2011.|$|R
5000|$|On May 13, 2013, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam signed House Bill 1084, {{requiring}} the Lincoln County process {{to be used}} for products produced in the state labeling themselves as [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", with a particular exception tailored to exempt Benjamin Prichard's, and including the existing requirements for bourbon. As federal law requires <b>statements</b> of <b>origin</b> <b>on</b> labels to be accurate, the Tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to Tennessee whiskey, requiring Tennessee origin, maple charcoal filtering by the Lincoln County process prior to aging, and the basic requirements of bourbon (at least 51% corn, new oak barrels, charring of the barrels, and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation, aging, and bottling).|$|R
2500|$|Coleridge's <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of {{the poem}} were {{considered}} again by various critics with an emphasis <b>on</b> how the <b>origins</b> affected the merits {{of the poem}}. In an anonymous review for the July 1816 Literary Panorama, the reviewer claimed, [...] "'Kubla Khan' is merely a few stanzas which owe their origin to a circumstance by no means uncommon to persons of a poetical imagination ... It should however be recollected, that in sleep the judgment is the first faculty of the mind which ceases to act, therefore, the opinion of the sleeper respecting his performance is not to be trusted, even in his waking moments." [...] The review does praise the work as it continues, [...] "Still if Mr. Coleridge's two hundred lines were all of equal merit with the following which he has preserved, we are ready to admit that he has reason to be grieved at their loss." [...] Another July 1816 anonymous review, for the Anti-Jacobin, discussed the origin of the poem but dismissed the poem with lukewarm praise: [...] "These have none of the wildness or deformity, of 'Christabel'; and though they are not marked by any striking beauties, they are not wholly discreditable to the author's talents." [...] Another July 1816 anonymous review, in the Augustan Review, claimed that the poem's descriptions [...] "have much of the Oriental richness and harmony" [...] but also said, in response to the preface, [...] "There seems to be no great harm in dreaming while one sleeps; but an author really should not thus dream while he is awake, and writing too." ...|$|R

5000|$|On a state level, the State of Tennessee {{has imposed}} {{stringent}} requirements. It {{is not enough}} under state law that the whiskey be produced in Tennessee; it must meet quality and production standards. [...] On May 13, 2013, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam signed House Bill 1084, requiring the Lincoln County process (which involves maple charcoal filtering) {{to be used for}} products produced in the state labeling themselves as [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", along with the existing requirements for bourbon (namely, mash consisting of at least 51% corn, aging in new charred oak barrels, and limits on alcohol by volume concentration for distillation, aging, and bottling). The law contained a specific exception for Benjamin Prichard's, which doesn't use the Lincoln County process. As federal law requires <b>statements</b> of <b>origin</b> <b>on</b> labels to be accurate, the Tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to Tennessee whiskey.|$|R
30|$|Developing and {{emerging}} countries (except South Africa) formulate food laws {{focusing on the}} issue of safety, but the information <b>on</b> the <b>origin</b> of food ingredients is not yet considered important for consumers.

Empirical studies that analyze the contents of privacy <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> commercial websites are profuse, while privacy <b>statements</b> posted <b>on</b> the websites of non-commercial organizations have been largely ignored by researchers. In this study, the contents of privacy <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> Dutch municipal websites are analyzed.

Three important findings resulted from this study: first, not all municipal websites bother to post privacy <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> their websites; second, most municipalities do not ensure that their online privacy statements are findable; and third, privacy <b>statements</b> <b>on</b> Dutch municipal websites emphasize diverging assurances and promises—with some privacy policies containing all the important provisions of the WBP, and others offering only general, and sometimes rather vague, guarantees...|$|R
