25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E

This peculiar cleverness given to the fair sex is a very equitable compensation for their lesser share of strength, a compensation without which women would be not man’s companion but his slave. It is by means of this superiority in talent that she keeps herself his equal and that she governs him while obeying him... She has in her favor only her art and her beauty.|$|E

500|$|The {{situation}} in Rio Grande do Sul was chaotic, {{and the local}} military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the Paraguayan army. PedroII, aware of the danger, {{decided to go to}} the front to shore up operations. As the Emperor's military aide-de-camp, Caxias followed him into the combat zone. The marquis had warned the Progressive cabinet that Brazil was unprepared to intervene in Uruguay and even less prepared to resist a foreign invasion. His warnings were ignored, and he complained, with a bit of irony, to his friend João Maurício Vanderlei, Baron of Cotejipe, a former colleague in the Conciliation cabinet: [...] "I am almost mad with the mistakes that I am seeing being made, but <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a red [...] I am not listened to, since everything is progress in our country." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|Caxias {{tried to}} secure {{support from the}} {{traditional}} saquarema leadership. They attempted, however, to use him as a figurehead and to further their own agendas. He commented to Paranhos: [...] "I see what you meant, {{with respect to the}} bizarre behavior of these gentlemen, who do not wish to govern the country, when they are invited to do so, because they prefer to govern the Government. They are completely mistaken about me, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not disposed to serve them as a hobbyhorse." [...] Lacking support in parliament, Caxias' cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house). PedroII asked members of the Liga Progressista (Progressive League)—a new party consisting of moderate Conservatives and Liberals—to form a new cabinet. Barely a month later, Caxias' only son died at age 14 of unknown causes. There was a small consolation at the end of 1862 when, on 2 December, he was made brevet marechal de exército (army marshal), the highest rank in the Brazilian army.|$|E

2500|$|One {{example of}} his outspoken {{political}} action came when he concluded an old-time radio episode of The Saint, entitled [...] "Author of Murder," [...] which aired on NBC Radio on July 30th, 1950.

2500|$|To assist Woolf and {{her husband}} Leonard with the {{struggling}} Hogarth Press, Sackville-West chose the Hogarth Press to be her publisher. Seducers in Ecuador, the first Sackville-West novel {{to be published by}} Hogarth did not sell well, selling only 1, 500 copies in its first year, but the next Sackville-West novel to be published by Hogarth, The Edwardians, was a huge success that sold 30, 000 copies in its first six months. Sackville-West's novels helped to put Hogarth into the black, though Woolf did not always appreciate this, writing dismissively in 1933 of Sackville-West's [...] "servant girl" [...] novels. In turn, the financial security provided by Sackville-West's books allowed Woolf to write more experimental novels like The Waves, as before Woolf had to be cautious when Hogarth depended solely upon her own writings for its income. Though Woolf is generally considered today to be the better writer, in the 1920s Sackville-West was viewed by the critics as the more accomplished author and her books outsold Woolf's by a large margin. The extent to which Hogarth depended upon Sackville-West to stay in business was reflected in a letter Woolf sent her on 7 September 1930 saying: [...] "What about your novel and your poems? I ask in no idle curiosity; I look upon you now as the Woolf bread-winner <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> more and more certain that my next novel won't win us even the penny bun".|$|E
