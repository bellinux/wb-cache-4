50|$|In 2007, the inventors, Danielle Batchelor and Cookie Centracco {{created the}} only product {{that covers the}} {{standard}} restaurant style high chair and extends onto the table like a place mat to prevent food and toys from falling to the floor. The product was also {{designed to provide a}} germ barrier by covering every thing within baby's reach such as the high chair itself and table surfaces. It will function with some home high chair models as well. The Neatnik Saucer consists of a waterproof tray portion attached to a <b>seat</b> <b>portion,</b> with a flexible rim to catch spills and food. Suction cups {{on the underside of the}} place mat section provide stability on smooth surfaces and straps secure toys, pacifiers and cups with handles. It is produced using child-safe fabrics that wipe clean easily. The Neatnik Saucer is collapsible and folds up quickly into a small, useful bag. The Neatnik Saucer is currently manufactured and distributed by Coulson's Crib, LLC, a Houston, TX based company.|$|E

5000|$|Winter Beach was {{originally}} established {{as the town}} of Woodley, in the late 1890s. In 1902, the community's name was changed to Quay, in honor of Senator Matthew S.

Senator Quay was a winter resident of St. Lucie Village, just north of Fort Pierce, where his old home still stands.

5|$|Post-war Kentucky Democrats {{had split}} into two factions—the more {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and the more progressive New Departure Democrats. Stevenson governed moderately, giving concessions to both sides. He urged the immediate restoration of all rights to ex-Confederates and denounced Congress for failing to <b>seat</b> a <b>portion</b> of the Kentucky delegation because they had sided with the Confederacy. A champion of states' rights, he resisted federal measures he saw as violating {{the sovereignty of the}} states and vehemently denounced the proposed Fifteenth Amendment. Following Stevenson's lead, the General Assembly refused to pass either the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, but after their passage by a constitutional majority of the states Stevenson generally insisted that blacks' newly granted rights not be infringed upon. He was silent, however, when state legislators and officials from various cities used lengthy residency restrictions and redrawn district and municipal boundaries to exclude black voters from specific elections. His 1867 plea for legislators to call a constitutional convention to revise the state's pro-slavery constitution to better conform to post-war reality was completely ignored.|$|R

5000|$|While the Oregon Trail {{crossed the}} Snake River in Elmore County, at Three Island Crossing near Glenns Ferry, the {{significant}} early settlements of Elmore County were mining settlements located primarily in northern Elmore County surrounding the ghost town of Rocky Bar.

[...] Elmore County {{north of the}} Snake River was originally part of Alturas County when it was created in 1864 and Rocky Bar became its county <b>seat.</b> The <b>portion</b> of Elmore County south of the Snake River was within Owyhee County until 1930. A small portion of Ada County was also annexed in 1948, bringing Elmore to its present boundary. The settlement at Rocky Bar was impacted by poor management by mining companies, mining lawsuits, and its geographic remoteness between 1869 and 1880. The Wood River experienced a surge in settlement at Hailey starting in 1880 that led to Rocky Bar's loss of the county seat to Hailey in 1882. [...] Rocky Bar would briefly become a county seat upon the creation of Elmore County in 1889.|$|R

5000|$|The average {{district}} magnitude (the {{average number}} of seats per constituency) {{is one of the}} lowest in Europe, owing to the large number of constituencies. The low district magnitude tends {{to increase the number of}} wasted votes (the votes that could not affect the election results because they have been cast for the small parties which could not pass the effective threshold), and in turn increase the disproportionality (so the number of <b>seats</b> and the <b>portion</b> of votes got by a party becomes less proportional). It is often regarded as the most important factor that limits the number of parties in Spain. This point is advanced when Baldini and Pappalardo compare it with the case of Netherlands, where the parliament is elected using proportional representation in a single national constituency. There, the parliament is much more fragmented and the number of parties is much higher than in Spain.|$|R

John Woodson split the purchase with Joseph Dabbs, but Woodson and Dabbs failed “to make such cultivation and improvements” to the land as required and the land reverted to the crown. In 1745, the land was sold again for 13 pounds to Philip Webber. Philip Webber likewise could not fulfill his obligations and again the land reverted and resold, this time for 11 pounds 15 shillings, to Arthur Hopkins in 1753. Hopkins apparently did better than his predecessors: under his ownership only a portion reverted to the Crown.|$|R
