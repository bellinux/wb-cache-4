50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{elevation}} has a centrally located doorway housed in an arched recess flanked by pairs of rectangular windows housed in rectangular recesses. The window openings are fitted with double <b>hung</b> <b>casements.</b> The upper floor has {{a series of}} half glazed French doors providing access from the internal rooms to the verandah.|$|R
25|$|Openings in {{the station}} {{building}} are fitted with timber framed doors and double hung windows. The ticket windows between the booking lobby and the office are of double <b>hung</b> <b>casements</b> with decorative steel grilles. A crafted timber World War I Roll of Honour commemorating Kuranda School Past Pupils is located between the ticket windows. Entrances into the booking lobby, waiting shed and passage are ornamented with timber valances which form arches. Internal finishes {{in the station}} building are generally painted concrete walls, concrete floors and timber boarded ceilings. The building is enhanced by potted palms, ferns and hanging baskets of tropical rainforest plants.|$|R

60|$|The {{windows were}} glazed in lattice panes of leadwork, <b>hung</b> in <b>{{casement}}s.</b> He broke {{one of the}} panes with a stone, thrust his hand through the hole, unfastened the latch which held the casement close, and began opening the window.|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{cold climate}} regions, where natural {{ventilation}} is not preferred during winter, natural ventilation is always preferred in Hong Kong for cooling {{because of the}} subtropical climate. It also provides better indoor environment quality and energy conservation. Natural ventilation performance of a residential unit is affected by internal as well as external factors. External factors are often subject to constraints {{beyond the control of}} site planners and architects. Internal factors include opening configurations and window types, which site planners and architects are free to design the way they deem proper. However, little information is available about their precise impact. An earlier study by the authors on opening configurations identified the best and the worst out of twelve configurations. The best was with cross ventilation and the worst was with single-sided ventilation. In this study, {{the focus is on the}} influence of window types. CFD simulations were performed based on the best and worst opening configurations, different building orientations, and varying wind conditions, to evaluate the influence of different window types on natural ventilation performance using the mean age of air (MAA) as the criteria. Four window types were studied: <b>side</b> <b>hung,</b> top hung, full end-slider, and half end-slider windows. Evaluation results indicate that for cross-opening configurations natural ventilation performance was better with full end slider and <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> type windows. For single-sided opening configurations, <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> windows performed much better than the other three types. It can be concluded that better natural ventilation performance can be achieved by the use of <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> windows. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|The hall is {{constructed}} from dressed stone with a hipped slate roof. The main frontage {{of the building}} faces south and is composed of three storeys and a seven window range, the windows are mostly 20th century top <b>hung</b> <b>casements</b> with moulded surrounds and keystones. The front also has a central pediment and the main entrance has an open Doric three bay colonnade. The main colonnade leads off {{the west side of}} the building and is composed of eight bays with Doric columns. The colonnade leads on to the taller orangerey which has three tall round arched openings with keystones, all the openings in the orangerey and the colonnade have now been filled in as they have been converted to apartments. The stables stand 200 metres to the north east and are built of ashlars and coursed rubble with a hipped stone slate roof.|$|R
5000|$|A tilt {{and turn}} window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This {{is the most common}} type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also {{widespread}} in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the [...] "turn first" [...] type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be [...] "tilt first" [...] i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.|$|R
5000|$|The song narrates {{the crucifixion}} of Jesus Christ, {{detailing}} {{how he was}} nailed to the cross, [...] "whooped up the hill", speared in the <b>side,</b> <b>hung</b> his head and died, all the while keeping a dignified silence. Like all traditional music, the lyrics vary from version to version, but maintain the same story.|$|R
60|$|At his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> a long, rawhide rope--a {{natural and}} more {{dependable}} evolution {{from the grass}} rope of his childhood. Loosening this, he spread the noose upon the ground behind him, and with a quick movement of his wrist tossed the coils {{over one of the}} sharpened projections of the summit of the palisade.|$|R
5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|R
60|$|He was a man-at-arms, {{and at his}} <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> a sword. That {{was enough}} for the Devil of Torn--it was a sword he craved most; and, ere the fellow could assure his slow wits that the cot was empty, steel fingers closed upon his throat, and he went down beneath the giant form of the outlaw.|$|R

60|$|At his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> {{a pocket}} pouch {{taken from the}} body of one of the {{numerous}} black warriors he had slain. Into this pouch he put a handful of the new playthings, thinking to polish them at his leisure; then he replaced the box beneath the bed, and finding nothing more to amuse him, left the cabin and started back {{in the direction of the}} tribe.|$|R
60|$|On {{either side}} of the {{ammunition}} pouch, behind, was strapped a new boot; so placed that it in no way interfered with the bearer getting at the pouch. Next was fastened the tin box; the lid of which forms a plate, the bottom a saucepan or frying pan. On one <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> the bayonet; upon the other a hatchet, a pick, or a short-handled shovel--each company having ten of each implement.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{he did not}} {{cease to}} paddle frantically toward the steamer, and at last, after what seemed an eternity, {{the bow of the}} dugout bumped against the timbers of the Kincaid. Over the ship's <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> a monkey-ladder, but as the Russian grasped it to ascend to the deck he heard a warning {{challenge}} from above, and, looking up, gazed into the cold, relentless muzzle of a rifle.|$|R
5000|$|The Salón de Reinos is {{rectangular}} in plan, {{with narrow}} {{doors on the}} two longer sides. On its north and south <b>sides</b> <b>hung</b> twelve paintings (one now lost) {{on the theme of}} the major battles won by the armies of Philip IV {{in the early years of}} his reign. Between these paintings, and above the Salón's windows, were ten paintings by Zurbarán showing the labours of Hercules, comparing the exploits of the demi-god Hercules (then considered as the ancestor of the House of Habsburg) with those of the king.|$|R
6000|$|Now it {{happened}} {{about this time}} that Robin Hood {{was going through the}} forest to Fosse Way, to see what was to be seen there, for the moon was full and the night gave promise of being bright. In his hand he carried his stout oaken staff, and at his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> his bugle horn. As thus he walked up a forest path, whistling, down another path came the Tinker, muttering to himself and shaking his head like an angry bull; and so, at a sudden bend, they met sharply face to face. Each stood still for a time, and then Robin spoke: ...|$|R
60|$|Now Hokosa {{stepped forward}} {{from where he}} stood {{at the head of the}} company of wizards. His dress, like that of his companions, was simple, but in its way striking. On his {{shoulders}} he wore a cloak of shining snakeskin; about his loins was a short kilt of the same material; and round his forehead, arms and knees were fillets of snakeskin. At his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> his pouch of medicines, and in his hand he held no spear, but a wand of ivory, whereof the top was roughly carved so as to resemble the head of a cobra reared up to strike.|$|R

60|$|Upon the {{threshold}} stood Mr. Cullen, {{and by his}} side a lady {{who might have been}} anywhere between fifty and sixty years old. She was dressed in a particularly unattractive checked traveling suit, with a little satchel suspended from a shiny black leather band round her waist. She wore a small hat that was much too juvenile for her; and from the back of it a blue veil, which she had pushed on one <b>side,</b> <b>hung</b> nearly to the floor. Her complexion was very yellow; she had a square jaw; and through her spectacles her eyes glittered in a most unpleasant fashion. Her greeting was scarcely conciliatory.|$|R
60|$|Then, lo and behold! {{who should}} she see, gliding {{here and there}} among the crowd of other people, but the little man in green whom she had seen a year ago. She opened her eyes mightily wide, for she {{saw that he was}} doing a strange thing. By his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> a little {{earthenware}} pot, and in his hand he held a little wooden scraper, which he passed over the rolls of butter, afterwards putting that which he scraped from the rolls into the pot that hung beside him. Dame Margery peeped into the pot, {{and saw that it was}} half full; then she could contain herself no longer.|$|R
50|$|The gable is a {{projecting}} one extending further east {{than the}} wall below and the finish {{is also one}} of tile-hanging (matching that of the adjacent cottage). The tiles are clay and are decorative fish-scale type of probable 19th century origin. At the gable the cladding is embellished by pierced white painted timber barge-boards. A single two light casement window lights the interior of the garrets. The window has a moulded timber frame with a central mullion that is hollow-chamfered on the exterior and plain chamfered on the interior. The leaded lights have diamond quarrels and each light is <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> on pintles fixed to the timber frame.|$|R
60|$|I was {{slightly}} staggered at this, more especially as I saw {{the hands of}} some of the men steal down to their <b>sides,</b> where <b>hung</b> on each what looked to me like a large and heavy knife.|$|R
60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived a poor widow who had one little boy. At first sight {{you would not have}} thought that he was {{different}} from a thousand other little boys; but then you noticed that by his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> the scabbard of a sword, and as the boy grew bigger the scabbard grew bigger too. The sword which belonged to the scabbard was found by the little boy sticking out of the ground in the garden, and every day he pulled it up to see if it would go into the scabbard. But though it was plainly becoming longer and longer, it was some time before the two would fit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo! {{stop your}} jokes," [...] cried the smith; [...] "if you treat us to any more o' that sort o' thing we'll have ye dipped over the <b>side,</b> and <b>hung</b> up to dry {{at the end}} o' the mainyard. Fire away, Ruby, my tulip!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a curtain}} at her <b>side,</b> behind which <b>hung</b> certain suits of Sir Thomas'. She stepped noiselessly behind this.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} she shaved {{his head on}} both <b>sides,</b> and <b>hung</b> the white beads round his neck, and said to him: 'I am going to the fields to work, but you must stay at home. Be sure you do not go outside, or some wild beast may eat you.' ...|$|R
50|$|The Station Main Building's {{northern}} wing comprises three {{rooms and}} a semi-enclosed, west-facing verandah. It is supported on low concrete stumps, and timber and steel posts. Tongue-and-groove jointed boarding lines the ceilings of each {{room and the}} floors are covered in vinyl or carpet. The walls of the central room are sheeted while {{the walls of the}} other two rooms have vertically-jointed boards with moulded belt rails. The rooms contain some solid timber furniture, wall-hung cupboards, and workbenches that appear original to the 1932 construction date. One original timber-boarded door remains in the southern-most room. The original windows are timber-framed and double- <b>hung</b> or <b>casements</b> with fanlights. Air conditioning units have replaced some windows however those remaining retain original brass hardware.|$|R
60|$|It was Randy who {{uttered the}} words, as he danced {{around the floor}} of the living-room, almost on top of the stove. The fire had burned low during the night, and he had just shoved in some fresh wood and opened the draughts. Going to the little window of the sleeping-apartment, he looked through the single pane of glass at the thermometer, which <b>hung</b> on the <b>casement</b> outside. The mercury {{registered}} twenty-two degrees below zero.|$|R
50|$|The {{full length}} of the lead engine telescoped into the rear car (car 210) and drove it two thirds of its length into the next car (car 204); which was in turn pushed into the third. Only two excursionists, John Curran of Pleasant Valley and James Jennings of Minooka, survived in the rear car 'on all <b>sides</b> <b>hung</b> mangled bodies and limbs' whilst the second was {{described}} as 'crowded with maimed and bleeding bodies'. An {{attempt was made to}} withdraw the engine from the third car but brought 'such awful cries of distress that it was abandoned'. In all 64 were killed and scores injured; 32 of the dead were from the small village of Pleasant Valley (recently renamed Avoca) or Moosic and attended St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, many were teenage members of the Drum and Bugle Corps of the St. Aloysius Society.|$|R
2500|$|The second {{category}} is the bocuses (sing. bocú alt. pl. bocúes), also called fondos ("bottoms").“The bokú is a single-headed drum, skin {{nailed to the}} shell, shell open at one end, long, shaped like a conic section and made of staves with iron hoops that circle them and hold them together. [...] They are heated with fire and played {{with both hands and}} no sticks. [...] The musician or bokusero carries the drum on his left <b>side,</b> <b>hung</b> over the shoulder with a strap.” (Ortíz II 1952-5:34) [...] Nowadays, the skin is usually held on by a metal hardware system {{similar to that of the}} commercial conga drum. [...] Anywhere from four to 16 bocuses are used in one conga (Brea and Millet 1993:179). [...] The bocuses play simple interlocking parts with few variations (however, the sum of the parts results in quite a complex drum melody). [...] A smaller bocú, called a quinto or bocusito, plays complex off-beat figures and improvisations.|$|R

'I was {{the only}} son of my father and mother, and much store they set by me, but I was not content to stay with them at home, for I thought no deed {{in all the world}} was too mighty for me. None could hold me back, and after I had won many adventures in my own land, I bade {{farewell}} to my parents and set out to see the world. Over mountains, through deserts, across rivers I went, till I reached a fair valley full of trees, with a path running by the side of a stream. I walked along that path all the day, and in the evening I came to a castle in front of which stood two youths clothed in yellow, each grasping an ivory bow, with arrows made of the bones of the whale, and winged with peacock's feathers. By their <b>sides</b> <b>hung</b> golden daggers with hilts of the bones of the whale.|$|R
