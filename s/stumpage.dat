50|$|<b>Stumpage</b> value method. A {{simplified}} net {{present value}} method where {{the value of the}} stock is obtained by multiplying the current volume of standing timber by its <b>stumpage</b> price, assuming the rate of discount is equal to the natural growth rate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stumpage</b> is {{the price}} a private firm pays {{for the right to}} harvest timber from a given land base. It is paid to the current owner of the land. Historically, the price was {{determined}} on a basis of the number of trees harvested, or “per stump”. Currently it is dictated by more standard measurements such as cubic metres, board feet, or tons. To determine <b>stumpage,</b> any stand that will be harvested by the firm is first assessed and appraised through processes aimed at finding the volume of timber that is to be harvested. A given <b>stumpage</b> rate, measured in $/volume, is then applied to the amount of timber to be harvested. The firm will then pay this price to the landowner.|$|E
50|$|Circa 1913, Long-Bell {{acquired}} the Ludington Lumber Company and transferred 3000 acres (for $157,000) {{to shore up}} the <b>stumpage</b> (uncut lumber) reserve. When the mill burned in 1920, there were an estimated 2500 residents in the town meaning it rivaled Fullerton. With the <b>stumpage</b> reserve dwindled the mill was not rebuilt so the town began to disappear. The planer was converted to a hardwood flooring mill, which was moved to DeRidder in 1927, when all operation at Longville ceased.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, much of {{the land}} used for {{harvesting}} timber is private wherein, “stumpage prices {{are determined by the}} market”. Competitive auctions determine the <b>stumpage</b> fees to be paid. The difference between the cost of acquisition of harvested timber between the United States and Canada is the cause of the ongoing Canada-United States softwood lumber dispute. The United States’ representatives claim the Canadian system of determining <b>stumpage</b> fees amounts to a subsidy. Canadian representatives deny this.|$|E

5000|$|In 1937, the CIP, {{which already}} {{operated}} softwoods {{in the valley}} of [...] "Rivière du Diable" [...] (Devil river), gives expanded its activities to cut forest in watersheds of the Rouge River and the Macaza. Then, the large forestry companies establish their facilities across the territories, according to logging concessions obtained. In 1926, the EB Eddy (Hull) has acquired the rights to logging in the watershed of the Rouge River (Quebec). While the Consolidated Paper Ltd, acquired the <b>stumpage</b> basin of the Matawin River, at north of Saint-Donat, Lanaudière, Quebec using <b>stumpage</b> obtained in 1932. Thus the main roads of the park was developed initially by logging companies. Between 1948 and 1950 the company Consolidated Bathurst set up a road linking Saint-Donat, Lanaudière, Quebec to Saint-Guillaume-Nord and Saint-Michel-des-Saints via the lake Caribou. Then deposit Cypress arranged by Consolidated Bathurst, with fifty buildings {{that will be used}} from 1948 to 1969, will become the largest site of the park.|$|E
50|$|Until the Natural Resources Acts of 1930 {{the prairie}} provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, {{and to a}} limited extent British Columbia, did not control Crown Lands or subsoil rights within their boundaries, which instead rested with the federal government.

5000|$|Canadian forests exist {{mainly on}} what is {{considered}} to be crown land, under the provincial governments' control. Legislation dictates the fees that Canadian firms will pay for <b>stumpage,</b> and long-term agreements are reached regarding the management and harvesting performed on crown land.

50|$|Small clearcuts {{scattered}} throughout the forest provide openings and young, brushy growth that serve as food and cover for many wildlife species. Each year, the Service awards timber units to local harvesters according to the refuge forest management plan. The harvesters pay for the timber based on a fixed <b>stumpage</b> schedule. Much of this revenue is returned to the community in lieu of property taxes. This management has produced significant an increases in woodcock, grouse, bear, and moose populations.|$|E
5000|$|On April 1, 1969, Bob Williams (a Member of the Legislative Assembly or M.L.A.) {{told the}} Legislature, [...] "It seems {{questionable}} that a licence should be granted {{for the company}} to run at will through Wells Gray Park at bargain basement prices." [...] Former Kamloops M.L.A., Phil Gaglardi, was accused of using his position as Highways Minister to interfere with the Department of Recreation and Conservation in the land swap and thus secure approval for the deal. Williams summarized the loss to the government by pointing out that 204,000 cubic metres (7.2 million cubic feet) of timber had already been cut, yielding $88,000 in <b>stumpage</b> fees applied to the Rathtrevor purchase. The logging company was nearly halfway through the deal in 1969. Up to that year, the government could have collected a total of $670,613 on <b>stumpage</b> fees, or $l.6 million if the deal had been completed, instead of the $186,000 park site it did acquire. Williams called the arrangement “a glaring example of park mismanagement mixed with outside interference. What we are looking at is between 50 and 60 Stanley Parks. What British Columbia, the public, is being left with is stumps.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of the softwood lumber dispute, {{commonly referred to as}} Lumber I, were in 1982, when the U.S. lumber industry petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) to impose a countervailing duty. Ultimately, the DoC found that Canada's <b>stumpage</b> system was not specific to any single industry and thus not countervailable. While the DoC made this claim, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) believed that these Canadian imports did in fact hinder U.S. producers. The U.S. lumber industry chose not to appeal.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that larches drop their needles {{in the winter and}} refoliate in the spring, the repeated, {{seasonal}} mining behavior performed by the larvae and the pupae of C. laricella is extremely damaging to the host tree. After five years of infestation in most species of Larix the annual growth rate is reduced by 97%. New growth is limited by 50%, which makes for a $3 million yearly loss of <b>stumpage</b> value. Infested trees are also extremely susceptible to other infestations and diseases, such as armillarial root disease, caused by Armillaria sinapina.|$|E
50|$|There are {{management}} decision {{conflicts between}} conservationists and environmentalists, {{and natural resource}} extraction companies and lobbies (e.g. logging & mining), over the protection and/or use of National Forest lands. These conflicts center on endangered species protection, logging of old-growth forests, intensive clear cut logging, undervalued <b>stumpage</b> fees, mining operations and mining claim laws, and logging/mining access road-building within National Forests. Additional conflicts arise from concerns that the grasslands, shrublands, and forest understory are grazed by sheep, cattle, and, more recently, rising numbers of elk and mule deer due to loss of predators.|$|E

50|$|The {{heart of}} the dispute is {{the claim that the}} Canadian lumber {{industry}} is unfairly subsidized by federal and provincial governments, as most timber in Canada is owned by the provincial governments. The prices charged to harvest the timber (<b>stumpage</b> fee) are set administratively, rather than through the competitive marketplace, the norm in the United States. In the United States, softwood lumber lots are privately owned, and the owners form an effective political lobby. The United States claims that the Canadian arrangement constitutes an unfair subsidy, and is thus subject to U.S. trade remedy laws, where foreign trade benefiting from subsidies can be subject to a countervailing duty tariff, to offset the subsidy and bring the price of the commodity back up to market rates.|$|E

50|$|A {{timber cruise}} is a sample {{measurement}} of a stand {{used to estimate}} the amount of standing timber that the forest contains. These measurements are collected at sample locations called plots, quadrants, or strips. Each of these individual sample areas is one observation {{in a series of}} observations called a sample. These sample areas are generally laid out in some random fashion usually {{in the form of a}} line plot survey. Depending on the size of the plot and the number of plots measured, the data gathered from these plots can then be manipulated to achieve varying levels of certainty for an estimate that can be applied to the entire timber stand. This estimate of stand conditions, species composition, volume and other measured attributes of a forest system can then be used for various purposes. For example, in British Columbia the sale of Crown timber is a business proposition and both the buyer and the Ministry of Forests and Range (seller) must know the quantity and the quality of timber being sold. Our satellite provides the essential data and information for determining <b>stumpage</b> rates, for establishing conditions of sale and for planning of the logging operations by the licensee. Generally a timber cruise includes measurements or estimates of timber volume by forest product sort (and sometimes grade), log defect, and log lengths, whether the estimates are made in the field or using computer software.|$|E
50|$|Financial {{stress on}} his family forced West to leave school in 1884 {{at the age of}} 13 to work as a water boy at the Trinity County Lumber Company in Groveton, TX, owned by Peter Josserand Jr. West saved money from this position, using the funds to later buy a drug store in Groveton where he would work after {{spending}} the day at the lumber mill. The store would later burn to the ground, but the experience left in him the desire to run his own company. He eventually went into business with Josserand and subsequently bought the mill outright. Shortly thereafter he began raising longhorn cattle on the side, a business he would also later grow into a veritable empire. From this beginning, West Lumber would grow to more than a two dozen mills across Texas and Louisiana including sites in Saron in Trinity County, the communities of Dayton and Milvid in Liberty County, the towns of Latexo and Lovelady in Houston County, Connell in Jefferson County, the Benford, Corrigan, Onalaska, and Stanley communities in Polk County, and Houston in Harris County. His interests in these mills led him to become a millionaire many times over. A notable business acquisition saw West acquire the competing William Carlisle & Company of Onalaska which included over one billion feet of <b>stumpage,</b> a number of associated saw mills, and a railroad. He acquired the South Texas Lumber Company from Jesse Jones in 1910. Shortly after World War I, West Lumber sawed over 400,000 feet of lumber daily in some 24 mills, while employing over 1,500 people (some 6% of the lumber workforce in Texas at the time).|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 To {{abstract}} {{the fundamental}} market structures of <b>stumpage</b> sold from the Siuslaw National Forest, a three-equation structural model with different assumptions on private cut was empirically derived. Under the private cut price-fixed assumption, the structural {{model can be}} simplified as a single-equation model with <b>stumpage</b> price as dependent variable and ordinary least squares (OLS) methods can be employed. If private cut is price responsive, two-stage least square (2 SLS) methods must be applied. In both models, annual <b>stumpage</b> price can be predicted and forecasted into the future. With a private cut price responsive assumption, the <b>stumpage</b> price, private cut and total <b>stumpage</b> traded within the marketing area were determined simultaneously by systems of equations. For both models, classical negatively-sloping demand curves were obtained with <b>stumpage</b> price as the dependent variable. Also, final product prices and lumber production costs {{were found to be}} significant factors in the demand for <b>stumpage.</b> On the supply side for private cut, classical positively-sloping supply curves were obtained with private cut volume as a dependent variable, and growing stock inventory as an important factor that influences the private cut. The estimates of the short-run price elasticities of <b>stumpage</b> demand and private supply within the specified marketing area were both highly inelastic, while the demand for Siuslaw timber was highly elastic. It is felt that the overall results of the analysis compelled tentative acceptance of the hypothesis that the economic models for the <b>stumpage</b> market, developed in this thesis, are generally consistent with the true market structure of <b>stumpage</b> demand and supply and are useful for economic analysis and forecasting. Finally, the effects of alternative schedules for timber harvest from the Siuslaw National Forest on <b>stumpage</b> price, private cut, and total <b>stumpage</b> traded are examined.
