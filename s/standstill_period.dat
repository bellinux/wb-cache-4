40|$|There is a {{scarcity}} of data on which decisions can be based regarding the limitation of idling during <b>standstill</b> <b>periods.</b> There is also {{reason to believe that}} the significance of engine management during standstill may vary between different propulsion systems and technical standards etc, which will increase the need for a decision base. The need for data that describe exhaust emissions during crawling speed is particularly great in the case of tunnels. Ventilation plants in tunnels are designed on the basis of relationships between emissions and mean speed. Up till now, for speeds below 30 km/h, these relationships have not been satisfactorily based on measured data. The primary objective has been to fill the gaps in knowledge by exhaust measurements. The methodology has comprised a survey of the literature, measurements and analyses. Different objectives result in different limiting times for idling during <b>standstill</b> <b>periods.</b> For the vehicle fleet as a whole, different limits have been estimated for different objectives: for private economy, 12 seconds; for macro economy overall, 23 seconds; for energy policy, 12 seconds, and for air quality, 36 seconds. There are also time limits per compound, per technical standard and per vehicle type. The time for diesel is shorter than for petrol engine. According to measurements, emission of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) at crawling speed varies over the range - 51 and 171 % for different engine types when speed drops from 25 to 10 km/h. There are considerable differences in the speed dependence of fuel consumption both between and within studies.

40|$|This study aims at {{evaluating}} {{the costs of}} the movement restriction policy (MRP) during the 2006 BTV- 8 epidemic in France for the producers of 6 – 9 month old Charolais beef weaned calves (BWC), an important sector that was severely affected by the restrictions imposed. This study estimates the change in the number of BWC sold that was due to the movement restrictions, and evaluates the economic effect of the MRP. The change in BWC sold by producers located inside the restriction zone (RZ) was analyzed for 2006 by using a multivariate matching approach to control for any internal validity threat. The economic evaluation of the MRP was based on several scenarios that describe farms’ capacity constraints, feeding prices, and the animal’s selling price. Results show that the average farmer experienced a 21 % decrease in animals sold due to the MRP. The economic evaluation of the MRP shows a potential gain during the movement <b>standstill</b> <b>period</b> in the case of no capacity constraint faced by the farm and food self-sufficiency. This gain remains limited and close to zero in case of a low selling price and when animals are held until they no longer fit the BWC market so that they cannot be sold as an intermediate product. Capacity constraints represent a tremendous challenge to farmers facing movement restrictions and the fattening profit becomes negative under such conditions. The timing and length of the movement stand-still period significantly affect the profitability of the strategy employed by the farmer: for a 5. 5 month-long <b>standstill</b> <b>period</b> with 3. 5 months of cold weather, farmers with capacity constraints have stronger incentives to leave their animals outside during the whole period and face higher mortality and morbidity rates than paying for a boarding facility for the cold months. This is not necessarily true for a shorter <b>standstill</b> <b>period.</b> Strategies are also sensitive to the feed costs and to the food self-sufficiency of the farm. Altogether, the present work shows the farmer’s vulnerability to animal movement restrictions and quantifies {{the costs of the}} standstill. These results should assist decision-makers who seek to calculate adequate subsidies/aid or to efficiently allocate resources to prevent future outbreaks...|$|E

40|$|The {{period from}} 2000 to 2016 shows a modest warming trend that {{the advocates of}} the {{anthropogenic}} global warming theory have labeled as the "pause" or “hiatus. ” These labels were chosen {{to indicate that the}} observed temperature <b>standstill</b> <b>period</b> results from an unforced internal fluctuation of the climate (e. g. by heat uptake of the deep ocean) that the computer climate models are claimed to occasionally reproduce without contradicting the anthropogenic global warming theory (AGWT) paradigm. In part 1 of this work, it was shown that the statistical analysis rejects such labels with a 95 % confidence because the <b>standstill</b> <b>period</b> has lasted more than the 15 year period limit provided by the AGWT advocates themselves. Anyhow, the strong warming peak observed in 2015 - 2016, the "hottest year on record," gave the impression that the temperature standstill stopped in 2014. Herein, the authors show that such a temperature peak is unrelated to anthropogenic forcing: it simply emerged from the natural fast fluctuations of the climate associated to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. By removing the ENSO signature, the authors show that the temperature trend from 2000 to 2016 clearly diverges from the general circulation model (GCM) simulations. Thus, the GCMs models used to support the AGWT are very likely flawed. By contrast, the semi-empirical climate models proposed in 2011 and 2013 by Scafetta, which are based on a specific set of natural climatic oscillations believed to be astronomically induced plus a significantly reduced anthropogenic contribution, agree far better with the latest observations...|$|E

Regarding sampling depth, a rapid decline in soil seed content is demonstrated from example studies. The use of soil cores with 5 cm or 10 cm depth is suggested to ensure comparability of results. For determination of optimal sample volumes for various communities, the species saturation model is suggested such that “minimal volume” can be defined for soil seed banks {{in the same way that}} “minimal area” can be defined in phytosociological studies. Although sampling time may depend on research goals for vegetation types with a winter <b>standstill</b> <b>period,</b> late autumn sampling is suggested for detecting the entire soil seed bank, whilst late spring sampling is recommended for the examination of its persistent part.

40|$|In the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman marl {{forms the}} primary {{sediment}} cover, {{particularly on the}} Iranian side. A detailed quantitative description of the sediment components > 63 µ has been attempted {{in order to establish}} the regional distribution of the most important constituents as well as the criteria governing marl sedimentation in general. During the course of the analysis, the sand fraction from about 160 bottom-surface samples was split into 5 phi° fractions and 500 to 800 grains were counted in each individual fraction. The grains were cataloged in up to 40 grain type catagories. The gravel fraction was counted separately and the values calculated as weight percent. Basic for understanding the mode of formation of the marl sediment is the "rule" of independent availability of component groups. It states that the sedimentation of different component groups takes place independently, and that variation in the quantity of one component is independent of {{the presence or absence of}} other components. This means, for example, that different grain size spectrums are not necessarily developed through transport sorting. In the Persian Gulf they are more likely the result of differences in the amount of clay-rich fine sediment brought in to the restricted mouth areas of the Iranian rivers. These local increases in clayey sediment dilute the autochthonous, for the most part carbonate, coarse fraction. This also explains the frequent facies changes from carbonate to clayey marl. The main constituent groups of the coarse fraction are faecal pellets and lumps, the non carbonate mineral components, the Pleistocene relict sediment, the benthonic biogene components and the plankton. Faecal pellets and lumps are formed through grain size transformation of fine sediment. Higher percentages of these components can be correlated to large amounts of fine sediment and organic C. No discernable change takes place in carbonate minerals as a result of digestion and faecal pellet formation. The non-carbonate sand components originate from several unrelated sources and can be distinguished by their different grain size spectrum; as well as by other characteristics. The Iranian rivers supply the greatest amounts (well sorted fine sand). Their quantitative variations can be used to trace fine sediment transport directions. Similar mineral maxima in the sediment of the Gulf of Oman mark the path of the Persian Gulf outflow water. Far out from the coast, the basin bottoms in places contain abundant relict minerals (poorly sorted medium sand) and localized areas of reworked salt dome material (medium sand to gravel). Wind transport produces only a minimal "background value" of mineral components (very fine sand). Biogenic and non-biogenic relict sediments can be placed in separate component groups with the help of several petrographic criteria. Part of the relict sediment (well sorted fine sand) is allochthonous and was derived from the terrigenous sediment of river mouths. The main part (coarse, poorly sorted sediment), however, was derived from the late Pleistocene and forms a quasi-autochthonous cover over wide areas which receive little recent sedimentation. Bioturbation results in a mixing of the relict sediment with the overlying younger sediment. Resulting vertical sediment displacement of more than 2. 5 m has been observed. This vertical mixing of relict sediment is also partially responsible for the present day grain size anomalies (coarse sediment in deep water) found in the Persian Gulf. The mainly aragonitic components forming the relict sediment show a finely subdivided facies pattern reflecting the paleogeography of carbonate tidal flats dating from the post Pleistocene transgression. <b>Standstill</b> <b>periods</b> are reflected at 110 - 125 m (shelf break), 64 - 61 m and 53 - 41 m (e. g. coare grained quartz and oolite concentrations), and at 25 - 30 m. Comparing these depths to similar occurrences on other shelf regions (e. g. Timor Sea) leads to the conclusion that at this time minimal tectonic activity was taking place in the Persian Gulf. The Pleistocene climate, as evidenced by the absence of Iranian river sediment, was probably drier than the present day Persian Gulf climate. Foremost among the benthonic biogene components are the foraminifera and mollusks. When a ratio is set up between the two, it can be seen that each group is very sensitive to bottom type, i. e., the production of benthonic mollusca increases when a stable (hard) bottom is present whereas the foraminifera favour a soft bottom. In this way, regardless of the grain size, areas with high and low rates of recent sedimentation can be sharply defined. The almost complete absence of mollusks in water deeper than 200 to 300 m gives a rough sedimentologic water depth indicator. The sum of the benthonic foraminifera and mollusca was used as a relative constant reference value for the investigation of many other sediment components. The ratio between arenaceous foraminifera and those with carbonate shells shows a direct relationship to the amount of coarse grained material in the sediment as the frequence of arenaceous foraminifera depends heavily on the availability of sand grains. The nearness of "open" coasts (Iranian river mouths) is directly reflected in the high percentage of plant remains, and indirectly by the increased numbers of ostracods and vertebrates. Plant fragments do not reach their ultimate point of deposition in a free swimming state, but are transported along with the remainder of the terrigenous fine sediment. The echinoderms (mainly echinoids in the West Basin and ophiuroids in the Central Basin) attain their maximum development at the greatest depth reached by the action of the largest waves. This depth varies, depending on the exposure of the slope to the waves, between 12 to 14 and 30 to 35 m. Corals and bryozoans have proved to be good indicators of stable unchanging bottom conditions. Although bryozoans and alcyonarian spiculae are independent of water depth, scleractinians thrive only above 25 to 30 m. The beginning of recent reef growth (restricted by low winter temperatures) was seen only in one single area - on a shoal under 16 m of water. The coarse plankton fraction was studied primarily through the use of a plankton-benthos ratio. The increase in planktonic foraminifera with increasing water depth is here heavily masked by the "Adjacent sea effect" of the Persian Gulf: for the most part the foraminifera have drifted in from the Gulf of Oman. In contrast, the planktonic mollusks are able to colonize the entire Persian Gulf water body. Their amount in the plankton-benthos ratio always increases with water depth and thereby gives a reliable picture of local water depth variations. This holds true to a depth of around 400 m (corresponding to 80 - 90 % plankton). This water depth effect can be removed by graphical analysis, allowing the percentage of planktonic mollusks per total sample to be used as a reference base for relative sedimentation rate (sedimentation index). These values vary between 1 and > 1000 and thereby agree well with all the other lines of evidence. The "pteropod ooze" facies is then markedly dependent on the sedimentation rate and can theoretically develop at any depth greater than 65 m (proven at 80 m). It should certainly no longer be thought of as "deep sea" sediment. Based on the component distribution diagrams, grain size and carbonate content, the sediments of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman can be grouped into 5 provisional facies divisions (Chapt. 19). Particularly noteworthy among these are first, the fine grained clayey marl facies occupying the 9 narrow outflow areas of rivers, and second, the coarse grained, high-carbonate marl facies rich in relict sediment which covers wide sediment-poor areas of the basin bottoms. Sediment transport is for the most part restricted to grain sizes < 150 µ and in shallow water is largely coast-parallel due to wave action at times supplemented by tidal currents. Below the wave base gravity transport prevails. The only current capable of moving sediment is the Persian Gulf outflow water in the Gulf of Oman...|$|R
40|$|Speech by Dr James Reilly TD, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014 Dáil Éireann - Second Stage I would firstly like {{to thank}} all the TDs who {{have contributed to the}} second stage debate on this Bill. While Deputies have raised issues about the Bill, I am pleased that the {{overwhelming}} majority support this initiative. The objective of this measure and many other tobacco control measures is of course to dissuade people from starting to smoke, encourage current smokers to quit – and ultimately save lives. Notification to the EU During the debate the issue of the notification of this Bill to the EU was referred to. I want to clear up any misunderstanding regarding this matter. Directive 98 / 34 /EC, commonly known as the Technical Standards Directive imposes an obligation to inform the Commission and other Member States, of technical regulations in draft format. This Bill falls into the categories for notification set out in that Directive, as did the recent Sunbeds legislation. Ireland notified this Bill to the EU on the 17 th June thereby fulfilling our obligations under European Law. The Commission and Member States had until 18 th September to comment or provide detailed opinions on the proposed measures. As detailed opinions have been received, the <b>standstill</b> <b>period</b> has increased by another three months, i. e. until 18 th December 2014. The legislative process cannot, therefore, continue past Second Stage until after this <b>standstill</b> <b>period.</b> We welcome the recent decision of the French government to introduce standardised packaging. I want to take the opportunity to refer to the inclusion of cigars and pipe tobacco in the Bill. As Deputy Ó Caoláin stated back in July, the UK in their draft standardised packaging regulations do not include cigars and pipe tobacco. If the UK decides to go ahead with this initiative the resulting regulations will be made under the Children and Families Act 2014. The consultation document released by the UK refers to the low prevalence rate among young people in relation to cigars and pipe tobacco. This Bill being discussed today is not confined to any specific age group. While the core aim is to prevent young people from starting to smoke, we also want to assist current smokers to stop. All tobacco products have been shown to negatively affect health and as such all tobacco products should be treated equally under this Bill. Evidence shows that standardised packaging encourages existing smokers to quit. It also encourages those who have given up to remain as non-smokers. With this in mind the Bill covers all tobacco products similar to the Australian legislation I would like to respond to those Deputies who have stated that they remained unconvinced that this measure alone would stop people smoking. Standardised packaging is the latest strand to the comprehensive range of tobacco control legislation already in place in Ireland which aim to denormalise the practice of smoking. It is the combination of past, present and future tobacco control measures that will reduce tobacco consumption in Ireland and not one measure in isolation. All of the measures outlined in our Tobacco policy, Tobacco Free Ireland will have a role in reducing the prevalence of smoking in Ireland. However, standardised packaging is important as it is the next step in tackling tobacco advertising and promotion specifically. Ireland is adopting an approach recommended by the World Health Organisation. Guidelines devised under the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ask countries to consider introducing standardised packaging for tobacco. Standardised packaging is not, therefore, a new concept. As we know Australia acted upon this WHO recommendation. Twenty two months on from the introduction of standardised packaging in Australia the latest figures show that the total consumption of tobacco products in Australia was the lowest ever recorded. In relation to the illicit trade of tobacco, the Tobacco Industry’s estimates of the size of that market are not considered to be accurate. Recent industry reports identify an Australian illicit trade market of 13. 3...|$|E

The public procurement directives were developed from earlier legislation and incorporate further important principles established by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) relating to the integration of horizontal policies such as the achievement of social and environmental objectives into the public procurement process. Currently the process of modernising EU public procurement policy is underway {{in the form of a}} consultation process commencing with a green paper which seeks to invite views from all those who have a stake in public procurement with legislative proposals expected in 2012. The focus is upon the most effective ways of improving processes in order to achieve Europe 2020 objectives which set out to promote business innovation, a low-carbon economy and the participation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Before and since the implementation of the directives in national Public Contract Regulations (PCR) there has been a series of developments in EU and member state case law which have been instrumental in establishing legal principles to address the multitude of grievances put forward by unsuccessful tenderers participating in the public procurement process. Many of the claims are focused upon the lack of equality and transparency in the bidding process and a number of cases have dealt with the problems associated with selection and award criteria. This paper examines specific aspects of the selection process which have been a cause for concern including the time limits for notification of infringement of the PCR, the discretion exercised by Contracting Authorities (CAs) in this process and the impact of Uniplex and other cases upon these issues...|$|E

Com o objetivo de avaliar a eficiência dos {{wetlands}} construídos para o tratamento de lodo (WCL) foi realizada a operação e monitoramento de um experimento com dois wetlands piloto: um plantado com Cyperus papyrus (WP) e outro com Typha domingensis (WT). O tratamento foi baseado nos processos de desaguamento e estabilização de lodo proveniente de um tanque séptico. Os WCL foram operados com a aplicação de alta taxa de alimentação, intercalada com a recirculação do líquido percolado na própria unidade. A operação e monitoramento foram divididos em duas fases. Na Fase 1 (Outubro a Dezembro/ 2013) foram avaliadas as características físico-químicas do lodo do tanque séptico, do líquido percolado 1 (LP 1) de cada wetland, bem como do líquido percolado 2 (proveniente da recirculação do LP 1). Na Fase 2 (Janeiro a Novembro/ 2014), a alimentação dos WCL foi cessada e o lodo acumulado permaneceu em repouso durante onze meses. Amostras do lodo acumulado foram coletadas e foram analisados parâmetros físico-químicos, microbiológicos e seu potencial agronômico (este último ao final da Fase 2). De acordo com os resultados o teor de água do lodo foi reduzido, em média, 80 % durante o desaguamento na Fase 1. Entre os parâmetros monitorados no LP 1 destacam-se a remoção de 99 % da carga de DQO e sólidos e de 96 e 97 % da carga de amônia em WT e WP, respectivamente. Quanto à recirculação, WT e WP alcançaram, em média, 71 e 33 % de remoção de água no LP 1, e ainda tiveram um bom percentual de redução da carga poluidora, destacando-se 80 % de remoção da carga de DQO e fósforo e 72 % de remoção da carga de amônia em WT. Em WP houve remoção de 64 % da carga de fósforo e de 31 % na carga de amônia. Verificou-se que a maior redução das frações voláteis se deu durante o desaguamento do lodo (22 % em média), enquanto nos onze meses de repouso houve redução de apenas 5 e 9 % para WT e WP. As concentrações de compostos inorgânicos no lodo acumulado foram pequenas e estavam bem abaixo do limite máximo permitido pela Resolução CONAMA 375 / 2006. Houve, também, uma redução significativa quanto aos indicadores/patógenos, sendo que Salmonella e Adenovírus estavam ausentes em todas as amostras, e a concentração de E. coli foi Abstract : In {{order to}} evaluate the efficiency of constructed wetlands for sludge treatment (WCL) two pilot wetlands were operated: one with Cyperus papyrus (WP) {{and the other with}} Typha domingensis (WT). The treatment was based on dewatering and stabilizing the sludge from a septic tank. The WCL were operated at high feeding rate, alternating with recirculation of the leachate liquid. The operation and monitoring of the system was divided in two phases. In Phase 1 (from October to December/ 2013) the physicochemical characteristics of the sludge from the septic tank, the leachate liquid (LP 1) of each wetland, and the leachate liquid 2 (from the recirculation of LP 1) were evaluated. In Phase 2 (from January to November/ 2014), the feeding of the WCL was stopped and the accumulated sludge was at a standstill for eleven months. Samples of the accumulated sludge were collected and analyzed for physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters {{as well as for the}} agronomic potential (the latter at the end of Phase 2). The results showed that the sludge water content was reduced by around 80 % during the dewatering in Phase 1. Among the monitored parameters in LP 1, the removal of 99 % for COD and solids loads; and of 96 and 97 % for ammonia load in WT and WP, respectively, can be highlighted. Regarding the recirculation, the average water removal in LP 1 reached 71 and 33 % for WT and WP, respectively. Furthermore, the systems were able to reduce the polluting load, with removal of 80 % for COD and phosphorus, and of 72 % for ammonia in WT. In WP 64 % of the phosphorus load and 31 % of the ammonia load were removed. It was found that further reduction of volatile fractions occurred during sludge dewatering (22 % on average); while during the eleven months of <b>standstill</b> <b>period</b> the reduction was only of 5 and 9 % for WT and WP, respectively. The concentrations of inorganic compounds in the accumulated sludge were small and below the maximum values permitted by the Resolution 375 / 2006 of CONAMA. A significant reduction of pathogens was also observed. Salmonella and Adenovirus were absent in all samples, and the concentration of E. coli was of < 10 ² NMP. g- 1. The organic matter content found in the accumulated sludge was of 17 %. This value is higher than the limit permitted by the Ministry of Agriculture Normative Instruction, Livestock, and Food Supply nº 25 / 2009. The total nitrogen content found in the accumulated sludge at the end of the experiment was almost the triple than the minimum recommended by the aforementioned Instruction. NPK rates of the accumulated sludge were 1. 83 / 1. 25 / 0. 02 %. The WCL associated to local climatic conditions were, therefore, an effective treatment of sludge and its by-products...|$|E
