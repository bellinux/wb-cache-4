5|$|William A. Foote was a 30-year-old grist mill {{operator}} in Adrian, Michigan, in 1884 when, {{in what was}} then a common occurrence, he provided space and <b>shaft</b> <b>power</b> from his mill wheel to Thomson - Houston, a local electric utility startup, to light 12 streetlights. Fascinated by the potential, within a year he enlisted his then 17-year-old brother James and moved to Jackson, Michigan, and in 1886 they jointly founded Jackson Electric Light Works (a predecessor company to Consumers Energy), which began by lighting downtown Jackson electrically. The Foote brothers set up similar city specific companies in Battle Creek and Adrian within a few years. In many cases dams already built for grist mills, sawmills and the like were refit for electric generators, but in some cases, new dams were constructed. As the familiarity with the technology, and the technology itself, improved, the scope of projects became more ambitious.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{the concept}} was further {{developed}} by MARC and its successor, Aker Arctic, together with ABB and the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes). In addition to icebreaking, the oblique vessel could also be utilized for oil spill response operations in both open and ice-infested waters by using the flat side to guide the oil to a recovery unit. However, {{there have also been}} doubts about the ability of the relatively small vessel to break a wide channel in ice without the much greater displacement and <b>shaft</b> <b>power</b> of a traditional icebreaker.|$|E
25|$|Initially, two {{propulsion}} alternatives were proposed {{during the}} preliminary design: a traditional three-shaft configuration with a centerline rudder and a hybrid propulsion system {{consisting of two}} wing shafts and an azimuth thruster in the middle for improved maneuverability. Of these, the Canadian Coast Guard selected the latter with two 11MW wing shafts and a 12MW azimuth thruster. The combined <b>shaft</b> <b>power,</b> 34MW, is almost {{the same as that}} of the Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers Taymyr and Vaygach. This makes John G. Diefenbaker the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world and the third most powerful non-nuclear icebreaker after the two gas turbine-powered Polar-class icebreakers operated by the United States Coast Guard. The icebreaker is also fitted with an air bubbling system that provides hull lubrication and reduces ice friction during icebreaking operations.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the refit, the {{propulsion}} power was fed to four direct current electric motors located in separate engine rooms, {{two in the}} stern and two in the bow, through an applied Ward Leonard drive system. The propulsion motors, rated at [...] each, were also produced by Strömberg and were the largest electric motors ever manufactured in Finland at the time. The main engines limited the combined <b>shaft</b> <b>power</b> of Voima to , of which {{two thirds of the}} available {{propulsion power}} was diverted to the bow propellers in severe ice conditions. In weak ice and mild ice conditions, the power ratio between the bow and stern propellers could be reversed as the latter have higher propulsion efficiency. The original propulsion motors were thoroughly refurbished in the refit and the diesel-electric powertrain was changed from DC/DC to AC/DC like in the newer Finnish icebreakers. Furthermore, the increased output of the main engines allowed full utilization of the available propulsion power, increasing the available <b>shaft</b> <b>power</b> to , thus making Voima the third most powerful state-owned icebreaker in Finland at the time.
