5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a <b>shut-in.</b>|$|E

25|$|Kazuma is a 16-year-old game-obsessed <b>shut-in,</b> {{becoming}} one after having his heart broken by his childhood friend in middle school. While {{returning home from}} buying a video game, he attempted to save a classmate from being hit by what he believed was a truck (which {{turned out to be}} a tractor that was going to stop beforehand), but went through acute stress reaction and died. As a result, he is sent to the parallel reality and becomes a role-playing game character. He has average stats in crucial categories, but above average intelligence and extremely high luck, neither of which are important for adventurers. Regardless, he becomes one and learns basic skills such as stealing, archery, monster detection, and magic.|$|E

Despite being offered a superpowered item or ability to use in this new world, Kazuma, following some provocation, chooses Aqua herself to accompany him {{to the town of}} Axel, quickly finding her absent-mindedness to be less than beneficial. With Aqua unable to return to the afterlife until the Devil King is defeated, the two form a party and recruit two other members; an explosion-obsessed magician named Megumin and a masochistic crusader named Darkness. Due to the party's dysfunctional abilities, Kazuma quickly gives up on the idea of defeating the Devil King and tries to live a luxurious lifestyle, only to find the circumstances of his daily life are forcing him and his party to encounter and battle the Devil King's generals.|$|E

500|$|Give Up was {{generally}} well received by music critics. It holds {{a score of}} 79 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Matt LeMay of online music magazine Pitchfork called the album [...] "a pretty damned strong record, and one with enough transcendent moments to forgive it its few substandard tracks and ungodly lyrical blunders". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Ben Gibbard radiates claustrophobia, so the <b>shut-in</b> synth-pop of this side project fits him like a leotard", calling Give Up [...] "the near-perfect pop record that's eluded his main group."

500|$|The plot of {{the game}} was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who praised it as horrifying, compelling, and [...] "dark". 1UP.com praised the titular room as constantly maintaining a sense of unease for the player. Game Revolution enjoyed the relatively normal appearance of the environment outside Henry's room at the game's beginning, writing: [...] "Are these strange otherworlds real, or are they just the nightmares of some lunatic <b>shut-in</b> who chained up his own door? It effectively blurs the line between reality and delusion, leading to a singularly creepy game." [...] In contrast, IGN's Douglass C. Perry felt that the familiarity of the story {{as compared with the}} other Silent Hill storylines detracted from its horror appeal, although he cared about its characters more than in previous games. Critics were, for the most part, pleased with the voice acting in the game, although it did receive criticism for the characters' calmness.

He consults his cousin and 765 Pro idol Ritsuko Akizuki about it, who introduces him to 876 Pro's manager Manami Okamoto. At 876 Pro, Ryō ends up covering for a female idol, and he does so well that the agency decides to hires him, but only if he debuts as a female idol. Ishikawa assures him that once he proves himself as a female idol, that she will help him make the transition into being a male idol. Manami is the manager for both Ai and Ryō in their respective scenarios. The rest of the story deals with the training Ai, Eri and Ryō go through on their way to stardom.|$|E

[...] GamesRadar ranked Meta Knight twelfth on its list of [...] "Most Misunderstood Videogame Villains", saying that he is [...] "the standard good-guy folderol , except that Meta Knight is invariably the bad guy"; it said of the Meta Knight-versus-Kirby battles that [...] "t's like if Batman picked a fight with a morbidly obese <b>shut-in,</b> and {{you were supposed to}} root for the shut-in." [...] It listed him on [...] "The Top 7 Unlikeliest Badasses in Gaming" [...] list, saying [...] "Thanks to his brooding, serious attitude and his lavish taste in imposing capes, Meta Knight has created a beautiful illusion of something incredibly threatening, despite being a spherical bundle of delight." [...] He is the 18th-best Nintendo character of all time, according to GameDaily; that also placed him third on their list of Nintendo characters which deserve their own game. Complex stated that he developed from [...] "a nameless villain" [...] in Kirby's Adventure into [...] "Kirby's rival" [...] and stating that his popularity has surpassed that of King Dedede, ranking Meta Knight eighth on its list of [...] "25 Video Game Characters That Deserve a Spinoff".

2500|$|A {{critical}} {{evaluation of}} Sămănătorism {{and its impact}} was still {{an important factor in}} cultural and political developments after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 succeeded in toppling communism. During the cultural debates of the early 1990s, literary historian and social critic Adrian Marino argued that the European integration of post-Revolution Romania was being held back by issues relating to its [...] "fundamental social structure" [...] and [...] "the psychology specific to all <b>shut-in</b> traditional communities", since: [...] "A rural and inescapably ethnicist, conservative, isolationist, traditionalist, Sămănătorist, populist Romania will never feel the need for 'Europe'. On the contrary, it will perceive in it a grave danger for the preservation of the 'national being'." [...] In contrast to this situation, he placed his hopes for change with the young, educated and urban middle class familiarizing itself directly with Western culture or pre-communist cultural alternatives to Sămănătorism. Similarly, writer and critic Gheorghe Crăciun negatively assessed that Sămănătorul, alongside other defunct traditionalist publications, continued to dominate the standard reception of Romanian culture, particularly in matters of the Romanian curriculum after the year 2000. State-sponsored education, he assessed, rated Coșbuc and Goga higher than their modernist counterparts Ion Barbu and George Bacovia, and, overall, favored the [...] "parochial, peasant, epic, ethnographic and dazed-metaphysical" [...] elements in Romanian literature. In contrast, Valeriu Râpeanu listed Sămănătorul and Gândirea among the magazines with [...] "essential contributions to asserting Romanian thought", and argued: [...] "Speaking disparagingly about Sămănătorism, and in particular by deeming Sămănătorism an obsolete, backward vision lacking any literary value, has even become an act by means of which one invokes one's own aesthetic high ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} {{companies in}} the US {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain system integrity. The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price arbitrage opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based pricing, unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as [...] "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying pricing structure for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural gas price volatility. Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher observed: [...] "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of price volatility. This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be <b>shut-in.</b> Our final rule should help reduce price volatility and expand storage capacity." ...|$|E
