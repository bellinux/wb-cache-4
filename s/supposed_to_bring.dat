Eventually at around 8.00pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down the rope hand-over-hand, and coaxed the others to follow him down in the same manner. The angry group then set out in search of the worker who had been <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them down.|$|E
5|$|According to Ludvík Mucha, {{author of}} Webster's Concise Encyclopedia of Flags & Coats of Arms, the white disk {{located in the}} center of the flag {{represents}} the sun. The red crescent and the five-pointed star, two ancient symbols of Islam, were most notably used on Ottoman flag and have since appeared on many flags of Islamic countries. The crescent is, from the viewpoint of an Arabic observer, <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> good luck. The color red is a symbol of resistance against Turkish supremacy. Whitney Smith states that the crescent was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as symbols of Islam, when in fact, they may be cultural symbols. Likewise, the sun is often represented with the crescent on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with Tanit symbol.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{international}} affairs intervened. Louis XI {{declared war on}} Burgundy, and Duke Charles responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14March Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, who were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> reinforcements from France, but were kept on the continent by bad weather. At this point Edward received {{the support of his}} brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians. Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field, but was struck off his horse and killed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} impact of poverty {{alleviation}} programmes of government on the ruraldwellers in Nigeria from 1999 to 2009. It argues that the various poverty alleviation programmes put in placeby government have not made any meaningful impact {{on the lives of}} majority of rural people who are livingbelow poverty line. A lthough poverty is a universal phenomenon that affect the socio-economic and politicalwell being of its victims whether in a developed or underdeveloped country, however, available statistics showsthat poverty in poor countries is absolute and more pronounced in rural areas. Under the present democraticdispensation, the rural folks that constitutes significant segment of the Nigerian society live in abject povertyand are neglected in terms of socio-economic and political well being. The poverty alleviation programmes ofgovernment that <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> succor <b>to</b> rural folks are urban-biased. The paper concludes that democracycannot thrive in an impoverished society where people live below one dollar ($ 1) per day, and where stressesof disease, famine and climatic shock are pervasive. Finally, the research suggests the way forward towardspoverty reduction in rural Nigeria...|$|R

Polish pączki are made of yeast, flour and eggs, and fried in oil or smalec only briefly, until they rise up, so that the fat would not soak inside. Some people fill a few of them with almond or nut instead of marmalade; a chance {{encounter}} is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> good luck.

25|$|On January 1, the {{commander}} of the XI Corps pressed a frontal attack on Sarikamish that lasted for the next four days; after that the fighting began to lose momentum. Snow hindered advancing forces which were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> relief. The IX Corps melted away on the way to Sarikamish. One of the divisions lost 40% of its strength in a snowstorm. The X Corps never came to the rescue. 90% of X Corps was left on the slopes of the Allahüekber Mountains. The XI Corps was fighting in the Aras region. A regiment entered Çerkezköy, only to be taken prisoner. While the Stange regiment entered Ardahan on schedule, the troops were exhausted. The Russians were poised to encircle the remaining forces.|$|E
25|$|The first mosques had no minarets, {{and even}} {{nowadays}} {{the most conservative}} Islamic movements, like Wahhabis, avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and hazardous in case of collapse. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in Basra {{during the reign of}} the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> mosques on par with Christian churches with their bell towers. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose—calling the faithful to prayer. The oldest standing minaret in the world is the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, built between the 8th and the 9th century, it is a massive square tower consisting of three superimposed tiers of gradual size and decor.|$|E

500|$|The most {{long-term}} and long-lasting {{result of}} the fall of Amorium, however, was in the religious rather than in the military sphere. Iconoclasm was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> divine favour and assure military victory, but neither the army's weaknesses nor the reported treachery of Boiditzes could detract from {{the fact that this was}} [...] "a humiliating disaster to match the worst defeats of any iconophile emperor" [...] (Whittow), comparable in recent memory only to the crushing defeat suffered by Nikephoros I (r. 802–811) at Pliska. As Warren Treadgold writes, [...] "the outcome did not exactly prove that Iconoclasm was wrong... but it did rob the iconoclasts for all time of their most persuasive argument to the undecided, that Iconoclasm won battles". A little over a year after Theophilos's death, on 11 March 843, a synod restored the veneration of icons, and iconoclasm was declared heretical.|$|E
500|$|Albatrosses {{have been}} {{described}} as [...] "the most legendary of all birds". An albatross is a central emblem in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge; a captive albatross is also a metaphor for the poète maudit in a poem by Charles Baudelaire. It is from the Coleridge poem that the albatross metaphor is derived; someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have [...] "an albatross around his neck", the punishment given in the poem to the mariner who killed the albatross. There is a widespread myth that sailors believe it disastrous to shoot or harm an albatross, {{due in part to the}} poem; in truth, sailors regularly killed and ate them, as reported by James Cook in 1772. On the other hand, it has been reported that sailors caught the birds but let them free again; the possible reason is that albatrosses were often regarded as the souls of lost sailors, so killing them was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> bad luck. The head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the Cape Horners, i.e. sailors who have rounded Cape Horn on freighters under sail; captains of such ships even received themselves the title [...] "albatrosses" [...] in the Cape Horners' organisation.|$|E

40|$|Liberalization is <b>supposed</b> usually <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> {{in large}} amounts of direct foreign investment. What has come into the Indian economy after {{liberalization}} however {{is not so much}} direct foreign investment as 'hot money' interested in speculation. This is hardly surprising: what we have witnessed of late is a 'globalization of finance' rather than a 'globalization of production'. Liberalization in these circumstances causes economic stagnation, rather than growth, as the economy gets tied to the caprices of international rentiers. It also reduces domestic food availability in the pursuit of agri-exports. The Indian experience confirms this, but with one exception: an increase in the fiscal deficit after an initial phase of deflation (contrary to what liberalization entails) stimulated a brief industrial recovery, but this too has started petering out.
