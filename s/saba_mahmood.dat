40|$|The {{controversy}} over Shirin Neshat’s representations of Muslim women {{has been dominated}} by interpretations that use an unexamined liberatory model of agency to understand the artist and her subjects. Consequently, criticism of Neshat has become polarized by readings of Islam and women’s agency as fundamentally incompatible, and the possibility of female subjects whose agency is grounded in and who aspire to Islamic values has been ignored. Using <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood’s</b> theory of non-liberatory agency as a way to approach women’s embodiment in Islamic culture, this article provides re-readings of the films Turbulent, Rapture and Fervor that suggest how Neshat’s art can be read as depicting pious Islamic modes of embodiment...|$|R

I use <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood’s</b> Politics of Piety to aid in this critique. Her project uses the Muslim rituals performed by women of the mosque movement in Egypt to demonstrate the need for a more nuanced conception of agency in academics.

Engaging first with <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood’s</b> account of religious subjectivities in Politics of Piety (2005), the author argues that feminist research requires a social conception of agency that addresses dialogical dynamics of representation and identity. Drawing on research concerning veiling and identity among Muslim women in the UK and Denmark, the author shows how a social conception of agency may be elaborated through the analysis of how competing representations of gender are negotiated in the self–other encounter. The author argues that a dialogical approach to researching identity in context defies blunt political judgement while shedding light on the intersecting socio-cultural forces and relations of power that engage processes of resistance and re-presentation...|$|R

By {{explaining}} the theoretical framework of the ‘middle’ Foucault (governmentality and agency) and the ‘later’ Foucault (ethics and agency) and then comparing Mahmood and Heyes’ use of Foucault’s work, it is argued that Mahmood and Heyes’ analyses, though thought-provoking and incisive, overlook aspects of Foucault’s later work, ultimately preventing them from offering productive ‘feminist strategies’. The author seeks to link this discussion to contemporary debates and analyses of agency, freedom and Muslim women in the media. The article concludes with an assessment of how Foucauldian feminist perspectives might be drawn on to establish effective ‘cross-cultural feminist strategies’, and closes by presenting a case of a cross-cultural media strategy aimed at countering the stereotypical images of Muslim women in the media...|$|R
40|$|Randa Abdel-Fattah’s 2006 novel, Does My Head Look Big in This?, {{is about}} a teenage Australian Muslim protagonist who voluntarily chooses to wear the hijab to her elite private school in Melbourne, and the {{personal}} and social challenges that she faces after making this decision. In this paper, I suggest that the novel portrays the action of wearing the hijab as mainly apolitical, {{and that it is}} instead a spiritual and religious act which demonstrates aspects of the hijab as empowering to an individual’s life. This subverts the stereotypical understanding of the hijab, particularly by the West, as either a tool of control and subjugation of Muslim women, or as a stand against Western society and ideology. By using <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood’s</b> (2005) study of Muslim women piety, which argues that Islam and its practices {{can be used as a}} tool for women’s empowerment, particularly for achieving selfimprovement and self-actualization, this paper pays attention to the representation of the hijab in the novel. The decision to wear the hijab opens a path for the protagonist to become more adherent to her religion, as well as improving her attributes and individuality as a whole. This creates a wholesome young woman who is not only committed to her religion, but is also mindful of her character...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the sexualization of a {{specific}} type of ‘good girl’ femininity as portrayed by the character Anette in the movie Cruel Intentions. Starting at the discourses of sexualization that have been taking shape since the 1980 ’s, I work towards a cohesive understanding of sexualization. This leads me to consider sexualization in a multitude of ways; as a process, a representational concept, and a theory. Thinking of sexualization as a theory, encoding the social world and creating meaning, it becomes a tool to address sexism. By focusing on adult femininity instead of Girls Studies, agency takes a central place in analyses of sexualization. Along with <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood’s</b> work on agency, Giddens’ Structuration Theory provides insight into the way agency and performances of gender and normative heterosexuality, that function as structures, converge. This is then applied to the characters Anette and Sebastian from the movie Cruel Intentions in the analysis. This analysis moves from the agency expressed by both Anette and Sebastian, to the ways gender and normative heterosexuality collide and influence their agency. Anette and Sebastian show a very specific dynamic between femininity and masculinity in their interactions throughout the movie. Finally, I look into the way sexualization discourse constantly recodes sexualization itself and the way this makes an analysis of sexualization an dual one, in which both the meanings encoded by sexualization and the recoding of sexualization itself are focal points. This then led to the conclusion that current dominant understandings of sexualization are limited in their engagement with agency...|$|R

50|$|Post-modern thought marks {{a feminist}} group {{shift away from}} dominant, positivistic ideals of {{objectivity}} and universal understanding. Instead, it acknowledges a diversity of unique human perspectives, none of which can claim absolute knowledge authority. Post-Modern feminism has thus been critiqued for having a relativist-stance, where ongoing power relations between key identities have been often neglected attention. It is possible to see this political stance in direct opposition to the “emancipatory aspirations” of women. However, <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood</b> would argue this critique {{is in some ways}} oppositional to global understandings of female desire, where the idea of ‘freedom’ is an essential, conditionally oppressive component to western feminism which may wrongly assume that women of eastern countries dominated by male power are victims needing to be liberated.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore how {{religious}} beliefs, rituals and practices shape the personal growth of the leading female characters in three novels written by Muslim women authors writing in the Western diaspora. The novels are Randa Abdel-Fattah’s 'Does My Head Look Big in This?' (2005), Mohja Kahf’s 'The Girl in the Tangerine Scarf' (2006) and Leila Aboulela’s 'The Translator' (1999). These novels span the experiences of the protagonists in Australia, the USA and Scotland. I focused on authors who avoided the negative stereotypes typically associated with Muslim women. I found that these novels showed Islam to be an integrated and empowering part of the women’s lives. Such empowerment is only achieved after long struggles within the women themselves. Emerging at the end of that process are three women who have a firm idea of who they are, are strongly committed to Islam, are tolerant of differences within the Islamic and non-Islamic communities, and are also committed to participating in and enjoying the non-Muslim societies in which they live. In order to understand these aspects of the novels in question, I seek to build on <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood’s</b> (2005) study of Muslim women’s piety, which argues that, contrary to the general understanding of Islam as a restrictive religion, particularly for women, its rituals and practices can more properly be understood as tools for achieving self-actualization and self-improvement. At the core of Mahmood’s arguments is Talal Asad’s (1986) conceptualization of Islam as a discursive tradition which allows for varied understanding of its core doctrines and practices. Irfan Ahmad’s (2011) concept of “immanent critique in Islam” further shows how Islam is able to develop criticism within its own tradition. The concepts of discursive tradition and immanent critique together explain how the protagonists can actively engage with different understandings of Islam in order to extend and implement their own satisfactory position within the doctrines and practices of Islam. Finally, the thesis extends Mahmood’s arguments by arguing that the characters’ religiosity is also based on an individual consciousness of God at the centre of their lives. Driven by the recognition of a Higher Power, the protagonists work towards the improvement of their spirituality and morality through changes in their inner being as well as performing what might otherwise be perceived as influential external rituals and practices...|$|R
40|$|My study {{focuses on}} the culinary {{practices}} of Moroccan women living in Milan hinterland in Italy. By adopting a praxeological approach (Warnier 2001), I study female subjectivation processes realized through food. My attention is given to (micro) practices (De Certeau 1980, Foucault in Martin 1993, Mahmood 2005, Mauss 1936) performed daily, by means of which the women considered shape their self and affirm their religious belonging in private and in public contexts. Islamic normativity concerning food issues is at matter here, thus being analyzed in its multifaceted complexity. As a matter of fact, the actors involved need to face the constraints imposed by the migration context while trying to comply with religious rules, in their turns intertwined with remembered embodied practices. This implies some negotiations to be made, in particular concerning a different articulation of time, but also the mobilization of tactics and strategies (De Certeau 1980) to guarantee a reassuring proper self-definition. In the private space, food practices keep on being influenced {{not only by the}} Islamic dietary prescriptions affirming what is not possible to eat, but also by the indications stressing what to eat – and eventually when and how to prepare it. A private consumption, reflecting a specific belief, materially informs a spiritual definition of the self. Furthermore, such dynamics go out the domestic context and perform in the public space. Everyday practices, and in particular those related to food, let an expression of Muslim migrants’ identity be realized in overdetermined backgrounds such as that which is under study. As a matter of fact, by preparing and sharing food, Moroccan women participate to local events - and consequently to the city social life - and thus they are allowed to affirm in public their religious belonging and some related claims. The so called “ethnic food” is protagonist of numerous intercultural events, aimed at letting an encounter with religious diversity take place in the perspective of a culture to taste. In those occasions, once a relationship is set up, other important issues can be approached, such as that of the freedom to practice religion. My presentation will try to highlight such complex dynamics, stressing on the materiality of religious subjectivation.

40|$|This paper investigates {{representations}} of gender {{in the material}} culture of the ancient synagogue. The pertinent data are numerous dedicatory and funerary inscriptions linking individual Jews, men and women, with titles seemingly associated with leadership in Late Antique synagogues (ca. 200 – 600 CE). Bernadette Brooten’s influential 1982 monograph argued against the prevailing tendency to characterize these titles as indications of power, authority, and responsibility when associated with men but as meaningless flattery when applied to women. She suggests that synagogue titles denote power, authority and responsibility on all title bearers equally, both men and women. I question the continued utility of proffering female title-holders as enumerable examples of powerful women rescued from their forgotten place in history. Using theoretical insights developed by historians Elizabeth Clark and Gabrielle Spiegel, this paper will engage a comparative analysis {{with the work of}} Riet van Bremen and <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood</b> to develop new methods of conceptualizing women’s authority in early Jewish communities.

40|$|PhDThe {{history of}} art and {{religion}} is intricately linked in Western culture. This thesis focuses on one strand of this relationship and {{is concerned with the}} role of performance practices in relation to spirituality in the West. Contemporary performance practice and theory are at the centre of this research. Case studies on the Roman Catholic Liturgy and the performance artist Marina Abramovi! are used to show how traditional analyses of spiritual performance have not accounted for the effects and affects of metaphysics in how we understand belief. I argue that examinations of spiritual performance are needed which do not try to understand such performances in terms of their representative meaning, but rather, seek to account for their performative qualities as practices that both instantiate and manifest belief. Performative theory has been used extensively to analyse language and human action, specifically the performance of gender. Here belief is taken as the subject of performative action and rituals are examined as performance practices which perform belief. Starting with Jacques Derrida, I begin a discussion of metaphysics and representation, tracing the nature of Western understandings of belief from Plato, to Friedrich Nietzsche, to Derrida, and to contemporary theological investigations into the nature of the human soul. This establishes the metaphysical history of the treatment of belief as well as various theoretical attempts to move past this model. The work of J. L. Austin, John R. Searle, Judith Butler and <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood</b> is employed to examine belief through speech act theory as a verb and finally through performative theory as an action.

One aspect of this discussion is the issue of a Muslim woman 2 ̆ 7 s consent in getting married and in sexual relations. The scholarship of Kecia Ali focuses on this issue of consent, and when she finds the Islamic legal tradition lacking in allowing for a woman 2 ̆ 7 s consent in marriage, she calls for Muslim women to engage in acts of 2 ̆ 2 personal reflection. 2 ̆ 2 This creates a binary concerning agency, wherein external norms (The Islamic Legal tradition) suppress agency, while true agency is only found in acting in accordance with internally felt desires. This thesis investigates the reasons why Ali folds into ideas of personal reflection to reconcile Islamic understandings of marriage with contemporary Western views. In order to do this, I explore Ali 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to the Islamic Tradition 2 ̆ 7 s ability to change to incorporate consent in marriage, and how she fails to substantiate such flexibility and adaptability. Secondly, I argue that calling for 2 ̆ 2 personal reflection 2 ̆ 2 depends on notions of the authentic self, wherein the self holds inner depths and wisdom. In the second part of this thesis, I explore how the combined scholarship of <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood</b> and Ludwig Wittgenstein can provide enriched ways to understand agency. Through Mahmood 2 ̆ 7 s scholarship on the women 2 ̆ 7 s mosque movement in Egypt, she argues for a view of the self and desires as malleable through discipline.

40|$|This paper critiques what {{it calls}} the parochial {{conception}} of agency animating the narrative of the Malayalam writer Khadija Mumthas' novel Barsa (2007) that is anchored in the notion that acts of resistance to relations of domination exhaust the field of human action. Following contemporary cultural anthropologists Talal Asad (1993), <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood</b> (2005) and Charles Hirschkind (2006), I argue that if unveiling of a Muslim woman {{in the spirit of}} liberatory endeavour constitutes one modality of action, the religiously-inspired programme of moral formation, including adopting the veil, practiced by many Muslim women in Kerala, as elsewhere, often decried for their patriarchal proclivities is also a speech act that makes up agency, no less. I find particularly useful here the idea of 'docility' that Mahmood (2005) develops out of Foucault (1990) : rather than being a synonym for passivity, 'docility' in this line of thought takes on a meaning of 'teachability' that demands will, effort and perseverance. This understanding brings to sharp relief the Foucauldian insight that specific relations of subordination enable and enact modes of human agency. Lost in Khadija Mumthas' monologue of agency is the fact that divergent conceptual understandings of a practice create divergent subjectivities and social and political life worlds {{and it would be a}} mistake to privilege one over the other. The novel, I argue, betrays the author's dis-ease with the modalities of agency other than subverting norms and belies the burden of proving Islam's compatibility with the ideals of liberalism-a burden she shares with many contemporary Muslim reformers who fit the bill 'liberal Islam. ' Finally, by way of comparison and contrast, I call attention to the anglophone Sudanese writer Leila Aboulela's two novels The Translator (1999) and Minaret (2005) which, even as they exploit as one of their key thematic concerns the role of religion in the protagonists' identity formation and personal development, do not however, unlike Barsa, commit the mistake of reducing the agency of the female Muslim subject to disrupting relations of domination...|$|E

As part of these developments, the Moroccan society has undergone several political and juridical reforms, where the most significant is the reform of the Moroccan Family Code in 2004. With this historical and political context in mind, the thesis explores the challenges for and opportunities of young Moroccan women who have witnessed these changes through their childhood and young adulthood. The thesis is based on one month of fieldwork in Morocco in April 2014. The empirical data consists of participant observation and 15 individual interviews with young Moroccan women and two experts on Islamic/Muslim feminism. The thesis has a special focus on six of the young Moroccan women who are defined as the thesis’ key informants. These six women live in urban areas in Morocco, are between 22 and 29 years of age, and have all accessed education on different levels. The thesis explores their personal stories about religious practices, career, gender roles, and dreams for the future. The overall scientific approach is inspired by social constructionism, while the methodological approach is inspired by anthropological methods and phenomenology. The theoretical framework is constituted of both poststructuralist and postcolonial approaches to gender, religion and identity, and the main theoretical focus is on <b>Saba</b> <b>Mahmood,</b> Judith Butler, and Dorthe-Marie Søndergaard. The analytical focus is on how femininity and religiosity is negotiated in various ways, and how this creates shifts between different subject positions as well as contradictions and ambivalences i these positions. The analysis explores notions of competences and leadership, bodily performance, ethical practices, the practice of veiling, and different understandings of gender roles and gender equality. It is concluded that the physical self-performance is a central aspect in the young women’s negotiations of femininity and religiosity. The biological gender is essential in the understandings of their own potentials in relation to their personal and professional lives, and femininity is thereby constructed as a double and ambivalent notion when it comes to career and family ambitions. At the same time the body is understood as a means to the self’s potentiality in their negotiations of religiosity as an ethical practice. It is concluded that two figures are setting the limits of the young women’s negotiations of femininity and religiosity. The Saudi Arabian is representing an extreme form of religiosity, while the Feminist is representing an extreme form of femininity. It is also concluded that the young women are opposing dominant representations of Muslim women as subordinate, and that liberal freedom ideals are influential in their negotiations of femininity and religiosity...|$|E
