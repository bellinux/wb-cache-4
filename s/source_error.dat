40|$|Discriminative {{learning}} {{methods for}} classification perform well when {{training and test}} data are drawn from the same distribution. Often, however, we have plentiful labeled training data from a source domain but wish to learn a classifier which performs well on a target domain with a different distribution and little or no labeled training data. In this work we investigate two questions. First, under what conditions can a classifier trained from source data be expected to perform well on target data? Second, given {{a small amount of}} labeled target data, how should we combine it during training with the large amount of labeled source data to achieve the lowest target error at test time? We address the first question by bounding a classifier’s target error in terms of its <b>source</b> <b>error</b> and the divergence between the two domains. We give a classifier-induced divergence measure that can be estimated from finite, unlabeled samples from the domains. Under the assumption that there exists some hypothesis that performs well in both domains, we show that this quantity together with the empirical <b>source</b> <b>error</b> characterize the target error of a source-trained classifier. We answer the second question by bounding the target error of a model which minimizes a convex combination of the empirical source and target errors. Previous theoretical work has considered minimizing just the <b>source</b> <b>error,</b> just the target error, or weighting instances from the two domains equally. We show how to choose the optimal combination of source and target error {{as a function of the}} divergence, the sample sizes of both domains, and the complexity of the hypothesis class. The resulting bound generalizes the previously studied cases and is always at least as tight as a bound which considers minimizing only the target error or an equal weighting of source and target errors...|$|E

40|$|Background. In {{the last}} 10 - 15 years many devices have been {{developed}} for objectively quantifying the clinical examination. Nevertheless to date the source and size of potential errors in patients examined in standing position (orthostatic posture) has not been established. Therefore the aim of this work is to assess the variability of the parameters usually collected in orthostatic posture during clinical assessment of scoliotic patients. Methods. In a consecutive group of patients affected by adolescential idiopathic scoliosis, we made repeated measurements of various clinical parameters using an optoelectronic device. The adoption of an optoelectronic measurement device (AUtomatic SColiosis ANalyzer, AUSCAN) allowed the replication of the clinical process for obtaining data in orthostatic posture from some surface anatomical landmarks. The <b>source</b> <b>error</b> due to the measurement device was quantified by assessing 4 dummies, with 50 measurements each. Two consecutive groups of patients were examined after a first acquisition: group A (N= 86) after 24 sec, group B (N= 31) after 6 sec and 167 sec (the last measurement after performing some movements of the trunk). Results. The weight of the measuring system errors is less than 1 mm. Two in vivo <b>source</b> <b>error</b> due to posture have been identified: postural adjustments (between 2. 59 and 20. 14 mm, according to the considered parameter) and postural positioning (between 4. 38 and 22. 95 mm). Conclusions. The findings of this study sustain the hypothesis that posture is the major source of variability in repeated clinical measures on the human being. These variations are inherent the clinical evaluation, but presumably they are involved in any other measure collected in orthostatic posture...|$|E

For symmetric two fissile component systems with DR close to unity, the extinction of fission source sites can occur in one of the components even when the initial source is symmetric and the number of histories per cycle is larger than one thousand. When such a system is made slightly asymmetric, the neutron effective multiplication factor (kern) at the inactive cycles does not reflect the convergence to stationary source distribution. To overcome this problem, relative entropy (Kullback Leibler distance) is applied to a slightly asymmetric two fissile component problem with a dominance ratio of 0. 9925. Numerical results show that relative entropy is effective as a posterior diagnostic tool...|$|E
