The recent development of stable, single frequency, single-mode laser local oscillators and nearly quantum-noise-limited heterodyne receivers have permitted the development of infrared heterodyne radiometers (IHR's) which provide good sensitivity and excellent specificity for the remote examination of individual atmospheric constituent <b>signature</b> <b>lines.</b> A 9 to 11 μm IHR employing a CO₂ laser local oscillator has been developed {{and can be used}} to resolve the spectral signature of atmospheric constituents such as SO₂, O₃ C₂H₄, and NH₃.
