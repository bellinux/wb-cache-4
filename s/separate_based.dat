5|$|Apart {{from being}} a close {{relative}} to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have sometimes been united as species of Aphanapteryx. Günther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities. In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept <b>separate.</b> <b>Based</b> on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they {{were related to the}} genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus. Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera. Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.|$|E

50|$|Ultrafiltration (UF) is {{a variety}} of {{membrane}} filtration in which forces like pressure or concentration gradients lead to a separation through a semipermeable membrane. Suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight are retained in the so-called retentate, while water and low molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane in the permeate (filtrate). This separation process is used in industry and research for purifying and concentrating macromolecular (103 - 106 Da) solutions, especially protein solutions. Ultrafiltration is not fundamentally different from microfiltration. Both of these <b>separate</b> <b>based</b> on size exclusion or particle capture. It is fundamentally different from membrane gas separation, which <b>separate</b> <b>based</b> on different amounts of absorption and different rates of diffusion. Ultrafiltration membranes are defined by the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane used. Ultrafiltration is applied in cross-flow or dead-end mode.|$|E

50|$|Such {{equipment}} allows {{researchers to}} learn more about both the structures and the conformational dynamics of systems.Clemmer has identified fundamental relationships between charge states and structures, and has shown that a single charge state can exist in more than one conformation in gaseous states. Such techniques can be used for the study of both proteins and peptides.In early work, Clemmer showed that multiple conformations of the hemeprotein cytochrome c could be differentiated based on their mobilities. In addition, the mobility of different chiral isomers was related to their protein folding. More recent techniques enable researchers to track transitions in the conformations of macromolecular ions during the gas phase. A short pulse of ions is introduced into a drift tube by electrospray ionization. Structures <b>separate</b> <b>based</b> on differences in their mobilities. By exposing specific states to energizing collisions, new structures can be established and tracked through different conformational changes. Changes in conformation during the gas-phase data can then be mapped back to the original populations of structures. In this way, researchers can understand the possible pathways between structures.|$|E
50|$|In this method, the gel {{is divided}} into two parts, resolving and {{stacking}} gel, both have different concentrations of polyacrylamide. The one with lower concentration is stacked on top of the one with higher concentration. Discontinuity is based on four parameters: gel structure, pH value of the buffer, ionic strength of the buffer, {{and the nature of the}} ions in the gel and electrode buffer. The electrode buffer contains glycine. Glycine has very low net charge at pH 6.8 of stacking gel, so it has low mobility. The proteins are separated according to the principle of isotachophoresis and form stacks in the order of mobility (stacking effect). Mobility depends on net charge, not on the size of the molecule. Proteins move towards anode slowly at constant speed till they reach limit of separation gel. Suddenly, frictional resistance increases but glycine is not affected and it passes the proteins and becomes highly charged in resolving zone. Proteins present in homogeneous buffer start to <b>separate</b> <b>based</b> on principles of zone electrophoresis. Now their mobility depends on size as well as charge. pH value rises to 9.5 and net charge increases.|$|E

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, an IMS system measures {{how long}} a given ion takes to traverse a given length in a uniform electric field through a given atmosphere. In specified intervals, {{a sample of the}} ions is let into the drift chamber; the gating mechanism is based on a charged electrode working in a similar way as the control grid in triodes works for electrons. For precise control of the ion pulse width admitted to the drift tube, more complex gating systems such as a Bradbury-Nielsen or a Field Switching Shutter are employed. Once in the drift tube, ions are subjected to a homogeneous electric field ranging from a few volts per centimeter up to many hundreds of volts per centimeter. This electric field then drives the ions through the drift tube where they interact with the neutral drift molecules contained within the system and <b>separate</b> <b>based</b> on the ion mobility, arriving at the detector for measurement. Ions are recorded at the detector in order from the fastest to the slowest, generating a response signal characteristic for the chemical composition of the measured sample.|$|E
5000|$|Aerosol mass {{spectrometry}} is {{the application of}} {{mass spectrometry}} to aerosol particles. Aerosol particles are defined as suspended solid and liquid particles with size range of 3 nm to 100 μm in diameter. Aerosol particles are produced from natural and anthropogenic sources, {{through a variety of}} different process that include; wind-blown suspension, and combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Analysis of aerosol particles is important because of their major impacts on the global climate change, visibility, regional air pollution and human health. [...] Aerosol particles are very complex in structure and can contain thousand of different chemical compounds within a single particle. Due to this complexity the instrumentation used to analysis these particles must have the ability to <b>separate</b> <b>based</b> on size and in real-time provide information on their chemical composition. To meet these requirements for analysis, mass spectrometry instrumentation is used and they provide high sensitivity and the ability to detect a wide molecular mass range. Aerosol mass spectrometry can be divided into two categorizes; off-line and on-line. Off-line mass spectrometry is performed on collected particles. On-line mass spectrometry is performed on particles introduced in real time.|$|E
