5000|$|A story recounted to {{this author}} by the gentleman in {{question}} shows his good natured sense of humour. While he was Governor or the Seychelles Central Bank {{he was on}} a visit to Singapore. At that time his signature was on the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>rupee</b> notes. He was asked for further proof of his signature for a credit card transaction and not having his passport with him he pulled out a sheaf of Rupee notes of different denominations all with his signature on and asked [...] "will this be sufficient proof".|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 the hryvnia dropped 38% {{against the}} US dollar, eclipsed {{only by the}} Icelandic krona and the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>rupee.</b> Since many loans and {{mortgages}} were issued in dollars and most Ukrainians are paid in hryvnyas (Ukraine's currency), they had to buy dollars with the weak hryvnya, {{and so they were}} paying back much more on the loans than they had expected. [...] From December 2008 till mid-May 2009 Ukrainian banks were not allowed to grant requests for early withdrawals of bank deposits. As of September 2009 financial analysts predict a recovery of the hryvnia.|$|E
