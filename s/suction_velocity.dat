Without suction, the boundary-layer displacement thickness at a station ahead of the model varied from about 1. 6 mm to 1. 3 mm over a Reynolds number range of 20 million to 200 million per m at Mach numbers from 0. 30 to 0. 76.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} enhancement in permeable tubes {{subjected to}} transverse suction flow is investigated in this work. Both momentum and energy equations are solved analytically and numerically. Both solutions based on negligible entry regions are well matched. Two different <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> distributions are considered. A parametric study including {{the influence of}} the average <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> and the <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> profile is conducted for various Peclet numbers. It is found that enhancement of heat transfer over that in impermeable tubes is only possible with large Peclet numbers. This enhancement increases as suction velocities towards the tube outlet increase and as those towards the tube inlet decrease simultaneously. The identified enhancement mechanisms are expanding the entry regions, increasing the transverse advection, and increasing the downstream excess temperatures under same transverse advection. The average <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> that produces maximum enhancement increases as the Peclet number increases until it reaches asymptotically its uppermost value at large Peclet numbers. The maximum reported enhancement ratios for the exponential and linear <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> distributions are 17. 62 -fold and 14. 67 -fold above those for impermeable tubes, respectively. This work demonstrates that significant heat transfer enhancement is attainable when the suction flow inside the permeable tubes is distributed properly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{flow and}} leakage {{characteristics}} of the air-curtain fume hood under high temperature operation (between 100 °C and 250 °C) were studied. Laser-assisted flow visualization technique was used to reveal the hot plume movements in the cabinet and the critical conditions for the hoodtop leakage. The sulfur hexafluoride tracer-gas concentration test method {{was employed to examine}} the containment spillages from the sash opening and the hood top. It was found that the primary parameters dominating the behavior of the flow field and hood performance are the sash height and the <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> as an air-curtain hood is operated at high temperatures. At large sash height and low <b>suction</b> <b>velocity,</b> the air curtain broke down and accompanied with three-dimensional flow in the cabinet. Since the <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> was low and the sash opening was large, the makeup air drawn down from the hood top became insufficient to counter act the rising hot plume. Under this situation, containment leakage from the sash opening and the hood top was observed. At small sash opening and high <b>suction</b> <b>velocity,</b> the air curtain presented robust characteristics and the makeup air flow from the hood top was sufficiently large. Therefore the containment leakages from the sash opening and the hood top were not observed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} suction on the {{stability}} of compressible flows over backward-facing steps is investigated. Mach numbers up to 0. 8 are considered. The results show that continuous suction stabilizes the flow outside the separation bubble, but it destabilizes the flow inside it. Nevertheless, the overall N factor decreases as the suction level increases due to the considerable reduction of the separation bubble. For the same suction flow rate, properly distributed suction strips stabilize the flow more than continuous suction.

50|$|Sailboats {{often have}} a jib that {{overlaps}} the mainsail—called a genoa. Arvel Gentry demonstrated in 1981 that the genoa and the mainsail interact in a symbiotic manner, owing to the circulation of air between them slowing down in {{the gap between the}} two sails (contrary to traditional explanations), which prevents separation of flow along the mainsail. The presence of a jib causes the stagnation line on the mainsail to move forward, which reduces the <b>suction</b> <b>velocities</b> on the main and reduces the potential for boundary layer separation and stalling. This allows higher angles of attack. Likewise, the presence of the mainsail causes the stagnation line on the jib to be shifted forward and allows the boat to point closer to the wind, owing to higher leeward velocities of the air over both sails.|$|R

The air curtain was generated by a narrow planar jet issued from the double-layered sash and a suction slot-flow arranged {{on the floor of the}} hood just behind the doorsill. The conventional fume hood used for comparison had the major dimensions identical to the air-curtain hood.

Experimental results showed that operating the air-curtain hood at the <b>suction</b> <b>velocity</b> above about 6 m/s and jet velocity about 1 m/s could provide drastically high containment performance when compared with the corresponding conventional fume hood operated at the face velocity of 0. 5 m/s.

40|$|Approximate {{integral}} equations {{are derived}} for the compressible {{laminar boundary layer}} with arbitrary pressure gradient and arbitrary <b>suction</b> or injection <b>velocity</b> through a porous wall, Reasonable agreement is obtained when particular solutions to the integral equations are compared with solutions by previous authors. Experiments in an incompressible turbulent boundary layer over a porous surface reveal two laws for the inner and cuter regions; laws which correlate previous experimental results. The lams are used to calculate shear distributions and variations of skin friction with Reynolds number and enable Preston tubes {{to be used to}} estimate skin friction over a porous surface. The outer region theory is extended to boundary layers in small pressure gradients and at separation. The only universal functions required are obtained from zero pressure gradient flow. No other constants are used to calculate the mean velocity profiles for boundary layers in small pressure gradients, with suction or injection and at separation or reattachment. The theory agrees with the available experimental results for turbulent boundary layers in energy equilibrium. Experiments in folly developed pipe flow show haw the mean flow is altered when there is suction through a porous section of the pipe. An approximate theory for the inner region compares reasonably well with the experiments for small <b>suction</b> <b>velocities...</b>|$|R

For several different <b>suction</b> <b>velocities,</b> and for different entry conditions, boundary-layer measurements were made on the perforated surface and on a porous surface formed by covering the perforated sheet with calendered nylon fabric. For certain conditions it was found that both the thickness and the velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer remained constant over virtually the full length of the suction surface, thus establishing the existence of a turbulent asymptotic layer. At sufficiently high rates of suction it was found that an initially turbulent layer reverted to the laminar asymptotic form...|$|R

The flow structure was observed by a laser-assisted flow visualization technique and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). Leakage characteristics were measured by the tracer gas (sulfur hexafluoride) detection method. By arranging a narrow suction slot on the bottom face of the hood and two side plates hanging under lateral faces of the hood, a flow field featuring four backwards-inclined vortical flow structures was formed at <b>suction</b> <b>velocities</b> of larger than about 10 m s− 1 (suction flow rate 7. 2 m 3 min− 1).
