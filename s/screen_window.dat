50|$|In addition, table- and grid-based layouts were {{replaced}} by fluid layouts {{in an attempt to}} respond to the growing use of mobile devices to access web content. These design methodologies abandoned the attempt to control two-dimensional layout between elements. Instead the elements would be offered to the reader's browser and the browser would place them as best it could, according {{to the size of the}} reader's browsing window. Fluid design layouts made the setting of page element sizes on the user's browser less important. This was particularly evident where it removed the need to set sizes in absolute units such as pixels. As the web designer had never been able to control the size of the reader's <b>screen</b> <b>window,</b> the attempt to set sizes rigidly had always been a mistake.|$|E
5000|$|Task {{switcher}} is {{a feature}} present in Windows 3.0 and all subsequent versions of Windows.
