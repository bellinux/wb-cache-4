50|$|It is more {{important}} to understand this rhythm aspect of swing timing, then to focus on its individual components. And regardless of which sports specific skill, this concept remains constant.

And this movement sequence is common for tennis, golf, baseball and similar hitting skills. First the knees, which initiate rotation and forward movement of hips, which in turn initiate upper trunk and shoulder rotation, before progressively bringing upper and lower arms into play, followed by wrist and fingers which impart the final control and speed to the club, racket or stick. For ultimate success it is equally important that perfect swing timing occurs in the correct Swing Plane as determined by anticipated ball contact point, intended direction of ball flight, and the desired spin effect to be imparted to ball.|$|E

To avoid this difficulty, a new model is proposed.

30|$|According to the <b>swinging</b> <b>lever</b> arm hypothesis, myosin must {{alternate}} between association and dissociation with the F-actin {{to fulfill its}} function. On the one hand, the strong binding between the myosin and F-actin indicates a large release of free energy, ∆G L(A)/RT ≪  0 (where the letter “A” and subscript “L” stand for actin and its loading, respectively), during the F-actin loading. In the present work, we follow the convention that a thermodynamically favorable step {{is associated with a}} negative free-energy term. On the other hand, dissociation from the strong binding state [with a free-energy term ∆G R(A), i.e., −∆G L(A), where the subscript “R” stands for actin release] requires a large free-energy input, and general ATP hydrolysis is the only energy source for this dissociation process. Thereafter, we introduce the term “general ATP hydrolysis” to describe the entire multi-step ATP hydrolysis process, to distinguish this process from the specific, chemical reaction step of ATP hydrolysis (i.e., break of the Oβγ–Pγ bond).|$|R
40|$|AbstractMyosin crystal {{structures}} have {{given rise to}} the <b>swinging</b> <b>lever</b> arm hypothesis, which predicts a large axial tilt of the lever arm domain during the actin-attached working stroke. Previous work imaging the working stroke in actively contracting, fast-frozen Lethocerus muscle confirmed the axial tilt; but strongly bound myosin heads also showed an unexpected azimuthal slew of the lever arm around the thin filament axis, which was not predicted from known {{crystal structures}}. We hypothesized that an azimuthal reorientation of the myosin motor domain on actin during the weak-binding to strong-binding transition could explain the lever arm slew provided that myosin’s α-helical coiled-coil subfragment 2 (S 2) domain emerged from the thick filament backbone at a particular location. However, previous studies did not adequately resolve the S 2 domain. Here we used electron tomography of rigor muscle swollen by low ionic strength to pull S 2 clear of the thick filament backbone, thereby revealing the azimuth of its point of origin. The results show that the azimuth of S 2 origins of those rigor myosin heads, bound to the actin target zone of actively contracting muscle, originate from a restricted region of the thick filament. This requires an azimuthal reorientation of the motor domain on actin during the weak to strong transition...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the above}} {{discussion}} {{and on the}} expansion of the widely accepted <b>swinging</b> <b>lever</b> arm hypothesis, we propose the following energy-coupling mechanism common to the functional cycle of various, if not all, actomyosin complexes. First, the tight ATP binding to actin+ myosin generates a considerable amount of free energy that is sufficient to break the actin–myosin interaction. Second, in the subsequent actin− state, the lever arm of myosin is released from a high-energy (i.e., unstable in the absence of actin) “up” conformation, and the associated head domain is free to search for the next binding site on the F-actin in the proceeding direction, supported by a biased Brownian mechanism (Sweeney and Houdusse 2010). As observed in earlier studies, a heavy load slows down ADP release from actomyosin, thus increasing the duty ratio (Sweeney and Houdusse 2010). Furthermore, a heavy-load cargo restricts the search radius of the head domain to a more limited space, thus slowing down the speed of cargo movement. In contrast, a light-load cargo allows the head domain to search with longer step sizes and faster movement. It is in this step that ATP hydrolysis occurs. Third, once the head domain finds a proper binding site on the actin filament, it initiates weak binding which may further progress into a strong binding between the F-actin and the head domain of myosin. The energy released during the tight myosin–actin binding (which is made available by the previous ATP loading) not only induces ADP·Pi release, but also drives the conformational <b>swinging</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm, thus generating the powerstroke for the movement of the cargo. The main conceptual advance offered by our framework based on thermodynamic mechanisms described above is the following: it renders obsolete the requirement of the illusive intramolecular structural deformation commonly used to explain the high-capacity energy storage expected for driving the complete functional cycle of actomyosin. This newly proposed energy partition of ATP hydrolysis should enable the field of actin–myosin complexes to take into account thermodynamic considerations in future discussions of energy-coupling mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} motor myosin V exhibits a wide repertoire of pathways during the stepping process, which is intimately connected to its biological function. The best understood {{of these is}} hand-over-hand stepping by a <b>swinging</b> <b>lever</b> arm movement toward the plus-end of actin filaments, essential to {{its role as a}} cellular transporter. However, single-molecule experiments have also shown that the motor "foot stomps", with one hand detaching and rebinding to the same site, and backsteps under sufficient load. Explaining the complete taxonomy of myosin V's load-dependent stepping pathways, {{and the extent to which}} these are constrained by motor structure and mechanochemistry, are still open questions. Starting from a polymer model, we develop an analytical theory to understand the minimal physical properties that govern motor dynamics. In particular, we solve the first-passage problem of the head reaching the target binding site, investigating the competing effects of load pulling back at the motor, strain in the leading head that biases the diffusion in the direction of the target, and the possibility of preferential binding to the forward site due to the recovery stroke. The theory reproduces a variety of experimental data, including the power stroke and slow diffusive search regimes in the mean trajectory of the detached head, and the force dependence of the forward-to-backward step ratio, run length, and velocity. The analytical approach yields a formula for the stall force, identifying the relative contributions of the chemical cycle rates and mechanical features like the bending rigidities of the lever arms. Most importantly, by fully exploring the design space of the motor, we predict that myosin V is a robust motor whose dynamical behavior is not compromised by reasonable perturbations to the reaction cycle, and changes in the architecture of the lever arm.

40|$|Resonance energy {{transfer}} {{was employed to}} study the conformational changes of actomyosin during ATP hydrolysis. To calibrate the technique, the parameters for resonance {{energy transfer}} were defined. With conformational searching algorithms to predict probe orientation, the distances measured by resonance energy transfer are highly consistent with the atomic models, which verified the accuracy and feasibility of resonance energy transfer for structural studies of proteins and oligonucleotides. To study intramyosin distances, resonance energy transfer probes were attached to skeletal myosin's nucleotide site, subfragment- 2, and regulatory light chain to examine nucleotide analog-induced structural transitions. The distances between the three positions were measured {{in the presence of}} different nucleotide analogs. No distance change was considered to be statistically significant. The measured distance between the regulatory light chain and nucleotide site was consistent with either the atomic model of skeletal myosin subfragment- 1 or an average of the three models claimed for different ATP hydrolysis states, which suggested that the neck region was flexible in solution. To examine the participation of actin in the powerstroke process, resonance energy transfer between different sites on actin and myosin was measured in the presence of nucleotide analogs. The efficiencies of energy transfer between myosin catalytic domain and actin were consistent with the actoS 1 docking model. However, the neck region was much closer to the actin filament than predicted by static atomic models. The efficiency of energy transfer between Cys 374 and the regulatory light chain was much greater in the presence of ADP-AlF 4, ADP-BeFx, and ADP-vanadate than in the presence of ADP or no nucleotide. These data detect profound differences in the conformations of the weakly and strongly attached crossbridges which appear to result from a conformational selection that occurs during the weak binding of the myosin head to actin. The resonance energy transfer data exclude a number of versions of the <b>swinging</b> <b>lever</b> arm model, and indicate that actin participation is indispensable for conformational changes leading to force generation. The conformational selection during weak binding at the actomyosin interface may precock the myosin head for the ensuing powerstroke...|$|R

It was on display and a picture taken of it at the University of Minnesota just prior to going to the Chicago's World's Fair in the middle of April. The younger Austin then was a student of engineering at the University.

30|$|Currently, the {{hypothesis}} of the so-called “swinging lever arm” mechanism (Holmes 1997) {{is supported by a}} large amount of experimental data.

The energy released during ATP hydrolysis is thought to be stored in subtle conformational changes inside the head domain; however, the nature of the changes remains unknown. In the next step of F-actin binding, the stored energy is released, causing the lever arm to switch (SW) from its up conformation back to the down one. Because the cargo is pulled by the lever arm against dragging force, this step is commonly called powerstroke.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the shape of myosin VI, the actin minus-end {{directed}} motor, by negative stain and metal shadow electron microscopy. Single particle processing was used to make two-dimensional averages of the stain images, which greatly increases the clarity and allows detailed comparisons with crystal structures. A total of 169, 964 particle images were obtained from two different constructs in six different states (four nucleotide states and with and without Ca 2 +). The shape of truncated apo myosin VI was {{very similar to the}} apo crystal structure, with the lever arm bent strongly backward and around the motor domain. In the full-length molecule, the C-terminal part of the tail has an additional bend taking it back across the motor domain, which may reflect a regulated state. Addition of ATP, ADP, or ATP-γS resulted in a large change, straightening the molecule from the bent shape and <b>swinging</b> the <b>lever</b> by ∼ 140 °. Although these nucleotides would not be expected to produce the pre-powerstroke state, myosin VI in their presence was most similar to the truncated crystal structure with bound ADP-VO 4, which is thought to show the pre-powerstroke shape. The nucleotide data were therefore substantially different from expectation based on crystal structures. The full-length molecule was almost completely monomeric; only ∼ 1 % were dimers, joined through the ends of the tail.

40|$|If {{one could}} attach a {{fluorescent}} tag to a macromolecule and then measure its orientation in a cellular environment, then {{one would have}} a powerful tool by which to study conformational changes under physiological conditions. Apply this approach {{to the study of}} myosin and {{it should be possible to}} measure the movement that is thought to drive muscle contraction. This method is not new but until now it has yielded rather ambiguous results because the fluorophores themselves could move independently of the protein to which they were attached. By dint of much hard chemistry, Corrie et al. (Nature 430, 425 ? 430, 1999) have managed to fix both ends of the bifunctional fluorophore rhodamine to the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), thereby uniquely defining its orientation. They have then used the rhodamine-labeled RLC, in suitable muscle preparations that allow exchange of endogenous RLCs, to measure changes in the orientation of the myosin lever arm during contraction. Conformational changes in the myosin head regions (catalytic domain in red, heavy chain in blue, regulatory light chain in magenta and essential light chain in yellow) that bridge myosin and actin filaments (brown, gray, green) are thought to drive force generation and the relative sliding between these two filaments. Atomic resolution structural data, together with biochemical and physiological studies of the interaction between myosin, actin and ATP have led to the lever arm model for the force-generating conformational change in the myosin head. According to this model, the light chain binding domain changes orientation relative to the actin-bound catalytic domain during the ATPase cycle. Corrie et al. fixed rhodamine through iodoacetate groups to different locations on the regulatory light chain so as to measure changes in orientation of the lever arm during a contraction. In each case, the rhodamine has been fastened to pairs of cysteine groups engineered into the regulatory light chain at an appropriate distance apart, based on the known crystal structure, to provide a fixed attachment. The average orientpation of the fluorescence dipole is expected to be parallel to a line connecting the two cysteines. The three dimensional orientation of the RLC can be deduced from orientations of the bifunctional rhodamine dipoles, knowing the crystal structure coordinates of the residues where each rhodamine probe was attached. Shortening of a contracting muscle fiber results in a decrease in force, followed by a very rapid recovery that is thought to be due to the movement of the lever arms. Corrie and coworkers measured changes in orientation of the RLC region upon a muscle shortening of 3. 6 nm per crossbridge with a 50 mus time resolution. Measurement of the tilt and twist angle of the RLC with respect to the actin filament showed a rotation corresponding to a 3. 6 m average movement of the lever arm. Thus, the rotation of the lever arm was closely linked to the tension recovery. This result strongly favors the <b>swinging</b> <b>lever</b> arm model for muscle contraction. However, there are two caveats. The magnitude of the force recovery after the muscle shortening was modest, although this could be readily explained by the fact that the muscle fibers had been through a number of manipulations. Furthermore, the number of myosin crossbridges taking part in the contraction was small. A number of other experiments suggest that the number of attached crossbridges is small even in normal contracting muscle, but this issue is still rather contentious. Nevertheless, this recent study demonstrates a highly sensitive method for measuring the most basic movement in muscle in a physiological environment. This method should find wider applicability in many different areas of biology, where it will complement high-resolution structure...|$|R

40|$|Myosin II, the myosin {{which has}} {{provided}} the most biochemical and structural data, is dimeric consisting of a long coiled-coil region with the motor domain flexibly attached to the N-terminal end of the coiled-coil. The motor domain (subfragment 1, S 1, or cross-bridge) is obtained by proteolytic cleavage of myosin. S 1 is a minimal model for the transport of actin filaments by myosin. S 1 contains the ATPase, the actin-binding site which is regulated by ATP binding, and a long lever arm, which moves actin past myosin by a <b>swinging</b> motion. The <b>lever</b> arm is buttressed by two calmodulin-like light chains. X-ray crystallography of S 1 and S 1 prepared without the lever arm shows that {{the backbone of the}} molecule is a seven-stranded β-sheet. The active site is very similar to the G-proteins and contains a P-loop and switch 1 and switch 2 elements. Moreover,the motor domain can be found in three conformations that correspond with three of the four states predicted by the Lymn-Taylor cross-bridge cycle. The rotation of the lever arm (power stroke) is coupled to changes in the relative positions of switch 2 and the P-loop after ATP binding. This rotation is reversed on products release (the power stroke). The movement of switch 1, which accompanies ATP binding, is coupled with an opening or closing of a cleft in the actin-binding site, which leads to large changes in the actin affinity. Myosin V yields crystallographic data on the strong actin-binding form of the cross-bridge. Strong binding to actin is accompanied by a bending of the central β-sheet, which enables products release and hence induces the power stroke. All myosins probably use the same mechanism...|$|R
