30|$|When in {{our case}} nodes with {{different}} sinks want to exchange messages, the messages will firstly be sent to <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sender via the different preferred parents. The sink has no routing entry in its table, which indicates that the destination node is not situated in <b>the</b> subtree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> Then the sink will send the message to registrar, which will send the message to <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destination node. Thereafter, this sink will send {{the message to the}} destination node.|$|R
25|$|Captain Edward Smith {{was still}} in command <b>of</b> Olympic at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. Two crew members, {{stewardess}} Violet Jessop and stoker Arthur John Priest, survived not only the collision with Hawke but also <b>the</b> later <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> Titanic and <b>the</b> 1916 <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> Britannic, <b>the</b> third ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class.|$|R
30|$|The {{disadvantage}} is {{that the}} packet {{should be sent to}} and handled by each <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network instead <b>of</b> only <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> which can reach the destination node. Another disadvantage is that this solution still requires that the different sinks know which sinks exist in the network.|$|R
5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{publicize}} the N-3PB operations, the British Air Ministry circulated a report that two Norwegian-flown aircraft {{had been involved in}} the attack on the German battleship Bismarck on 21–22 May 1941, but it was merely an example of wartime propaganda. Despite many aviation historians disputing the claim, it still appears in current accounts of the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bismarck.|$|E
30|$|Scenario C: Sensors-to-actuator {{communications}} (S 2 A). In this scenario, {{the source}} nodes are the sensors, while the destination nodes are the actuators. Multiple connections {{can be established}} with one actuator, so the actuators act as <b>the</b> <b>sinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communications. This scenario is represented in Figure 13.|$|R
30|$|The outage {{probability}} limit is {{the probability that}} the instantaneous mutual information between <b>the</b> sources and <b>sinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network is less than the transmitted rate.

40|$|We {{show that}} any linear program (LP) in n nonnegative {{variables}} and m equality constraints defines {{in a natural}} way a unique <b>sink</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> n-dimensional cube. From <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cube, we can either read off an optimal solution to the LP, or we obtain certificates for infeasibility or unboundedness. This reduction complements the implicit local neighborhoods induced by <b>the</b> vertex-edge structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feasible region with an explicit neighborhood structure that allows random access to all 2 n candidate solutions. Using the currently best sink-finding algorithm for general unique sink orientations, we obtain the fastest deterministic LP algorithm in the RAM model, for the central case n = 2 m. ...|$|R

30|$|These results tell us {{that the}} method {{correctly}} identifies phenomena of geographical segregation. This phenomenon is typical for islands, where it is not easy for species to genetically mix with far away populations. Then we can see that all the islands in the studied sample are identified as <b>sinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic flow. Also the main east toward west spread trend has been identified by this methodology.|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Caldera Bay, or the <b>Sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blanco Encalada, was an {{engagement}} {{fought in the}} port of Caldera Bay during the 1891 Chilean Civil War between Balmacedist and Congressional naval forces on 23 April 1891.

40|$|A {{group of}} caves {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> One Eye River in St. Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica, have been <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> numerous important palaeontological investigations beginning 1919. Unfortunately, considerable confusion has arisen {{in the literature}} through inadequate documentation <b>of</b> different sites. <b>The</b> caves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immediate area are described and located, and their palaeontological significance is summarised in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> recent taxonomic review and relevant geochronological evidence...|$|R
40|$|In the {{firefighting}} and {{the graph}} searching problems, a contaminate spreads relatively quickly. We {{introduce a new}} model, on directed acyclic graphs, in which the contamination spreads slowly. The model {{was inspired by the}} efforts to stem the lava flow from the Eldfell volcano in Partially supported by grants from NSERC. 92 N. E. CLARKE ET AL. Iceland. The contamination starts at a source, only one vertex at a time is contaminated and for some fixed k, k vertices are protected. The slowness is indicated by the name ‘seepage’. The object is to protect <b>the</b> <b>sinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graph. We show that if a <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graph can be contaminated then at most one directed path need be contaminated. We also investigate <b>the</b> Cartesian product <b>of</b> directed paths. We show that for <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> 3 directed paths that is truncated to only vertices up to adistanceofdfrom the source, if d ≥ 9, then only one vertex need be protected on each turn to protect the sinks. We also present bounds for <b>the</b> Cartesian product <b>of</b> more than 3 paths. ...|$|R
5|$|Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance-disaster film directed, written, co-produced and co-edited by James Cameron.

5|$|UB-47s next success came a week later, on 11 October, {{when the}} 5,002-ton British steamer Crosshill was sunk west of Malta {{with the loss}} of four men. A German {{military}} announcement of 20 October proclaiming Steinbauer's <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship reported that Crosshills cargo included horses and Serbian grooms. The following day, Sebek, a British ship headed to Alexandria, was torpedoed southeast of Gozo. Although the German Admiralty reported her sunk, Sebeks captain was able to ground his ship and prevent it from sinking. On 14 October, UB-47 sank five small Italian sailing vessels—ranging in size from 32 to 80 tons—near Syracuse, Sicily. The next day, UB-47 closed out the month of October with the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek steamer Avis. UB-47s tally of sunken ships for the month of October came to 24,776 gross register tons, which accounted for nearly 20% of the total sunk by all German U-boats in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|A Night to Remember is a 1955 non-fiction book by Walter Lord {{about the}} <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912. The book was hugely successful, {{and is still}} {{considered}} a definitive resource about the Titanic. Lord interviewed many survivors of the disaster as well as drawing on books, memoirs and articles that they had written. He authored a follow-up book, The Night Lives On, in 1986 following renewed interest in the story after the wreck of Titanic was found.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{soil erosion}} {{is thought to}} perturb the global carbon cycle, but {{estimates}} of its effect range from a source of 1 petagram per year− 1 to a <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same magnitude. By using caesium- 137 and carbon inventory measurements from a large-scale survey, we found consistent evidence for an erosion-induced <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric carbon equivalent to approximately 26 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carbon transported by erosion. Based on this relationship, we estimated a global carbon <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> 0. 12 (range 0. 06 to 0. 27) petagrams of carbon per year− 1 resulting from erosion in the world’s agricultural landscapes. Our analysis directly challenges the view that agricultural erosion represents an important source or sink for atmospheric CO 2...|$|R

5|$|Ark Royal and {{the ships}} of Force H {{returned}} to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from the <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battleship Bismarck, {{the war in}} the Mediterranean was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer be supplied from the east since the fall of Crete.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
