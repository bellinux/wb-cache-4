30|$|Human {{exposure}} to low doses of airborne isocyanates can for instance occur during spray painting cars using paints containing isocyanates. Reeb-Whitaker et al. (Reeb-Whitaker et al. 2012) reports of {{sampling of the}} airborne isocyanates HDI and IPDI in auto body shops in the US using two PTFE filters in series impregnated with 1 -(2 -pyridyl)piperazine (2 -PP) and 9 -(methyl- aminomethyl)anthracene (MAMA) respectively. The results from the study indicates a high occupational exposure for the two isocyanates, as eighty per cent of the samples contained concentrations above the OSHA <b>STEL</b> <b>value</b> (Reeb-Whitaker et al. 2012). As a comparison, 98 Â % of the samples were above the UK HSE STEL (Reeb-Whitaker et al. 2012). When analysing urine samples from workers in in vehicle repair shops, Williams et al. (Williams et al. 1999) found the metabolite of HDI, hexamethylene diamine (HDA), in four out of 22 spray workers and one by-stander, even {{with the use of}} personal protective equipment among the workers. HDA was not found in individuals not exposed to HDI (Williams et al. 1999). Although the metabolism of HDI and oligomers of HDI is not well understood, there is seemingly a good correlation between the amount of airborne HDI and the amount of HDA excreted via urine (Brorson & Skarping 1990). Several other studies have reported a similar correlation between TDI (Rosenberg & Savolainen 1986; Brorson et al. 1991; Persson et al. 1993) and IPDI (Tinnerberg et al. 1995) with their respective amines after human exposure and excretion via the urine.|$|E
40|$|Background This {{descriptive}} {{cross-sectional study}} aimed {{to assess the}} exposure to formaldehyde associated with the tasks in a pathology laboratory unit. The study objectives were to describe the tasks involving the use of formaldehyde in the unit and assess exposure to formaldehyde as well as assess the effectiveness of existing engineering/ventilation system control methods. Methods The study involved observation and description of all tasks {{carried out in the}} laboratory, assessing exposure to formaldehyde and physical measurements of laboratory parameters such as area and volume. Exposure assessment involved three levels: task-based exposure assessment; personal exposure assessment and area exposure assessment. Formaldehyde measurements, by means of shadow sampling (personal breathing zone sampling by another person shadowing person being sampled) were taken using the formaldehyde meter. Data were summarised using means, medians and proportions and results were presented in figures and tables. For significance testing, an analysis of variance was carried out on the log-transformed data and p-value less than 0. 05 were interpreted as statistically significant. Results Not all tasks in the laboratory were done according to the standard operating procedures. In general, exposure to formaldehyde was highest among the assistants group who were mostly responsible for high-exposure tasks. Mean <b>STEL</b> <b>values</b> for assistants, technologists and pathologist were 2. 37 ppm, 1. 21 ppm and 1. 59 ppm respectively, while for TWA, the figures were 0. 60 ppm, 0. 36 ppm and 0. 21 ppm. For short term exposures (<b>STEL</b> and peak <b>values)</b> pathologist exposure levels were higher than those of technologists while technologists were higher for long term exposures (daily exposure and 8 -hour TWA). Daily exposure varied significantly for assistants and technologists but not for pathologist. Despite the use of engineering exposure controls for formaldehyde, 27 / 28 of all tasks were higher than the ACGIH threshold ceiling limit of 0. 3 ppm, 0. 008 ppm MRL value and 0. 002 ppm RELTWAConclusion The results have shown exposures among the employees of all job categories in this study, with laboratory assistants being the most exposed. Currently installed local ventilation system requires to be upgraded in accordance with best practices of 3. 5 m/s for air speed. Training, on PPE usage together with the medical surveillance should also be implemented. value...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{principal}} {{aim of the}} study was to estimate the level of exposure to organic solvents of graffiti removers, and to identify the chemicals used in different cleaning agents. A secondary objective was to inform about the toxicity of various products and to optimise working procedures. METHODS: Exposure to organic solvents was determined by active air sampling and biological monitoring among 38 graffiti removers during an 8 -h work shift in the Stockholm underground system. The air samples and biological samples were analysed by gas chromatography. Exposure to organic solvents was also assessed by a questionnaire and interviews. RESULTS: Solvents identified were N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether (DPGME), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE), toluene, xylene, pseudocumene, hemimellitine, mesitylene, ethylbenzene, limonene, nonane, decane, undecane, hexandecane and gamma-butyrolactone. The 8 -h average exposures [time-weighted average (TWA) ] were below 20 % of the Swedish permissible exposure limit value (PEL) for all solvents identified. In poorly ventilated spaces, e. g. in elevators etc., the short-term exposures exceeded occasionally the Swedish short-term exposure limit <b>values</b> (<b>STEL).</b> The blood and urine concentrations of NMP and its metabolites were low. Glycol ethers and their metabolites (2 -methoxypropionic acid (MPA), ethoxy acetic acid (EAA), butoxy acetic acid (BAA), and 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) acetic acid (MEAA)) were found in low concentrations in urine. There were significant correlation between the concentrations of NMP in air and levels of NMP and its metabolites in blood and urine. The use of personal protective equipment, i. e. gloves and respirators, was generally high. CONCLUSIONS: Many different cleaning agents were used. The average exposure to solvents was low, but some working tasks included relatively high short-term exposure. To prevent adverse health effects, it is important to inform workers about the health risks and to restrict the use of the most toxic chemicals. Furthermore, it is important to develop good working procedures and to encourage the use of personal protection equipment...|$|R
