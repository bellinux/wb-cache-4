40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the Hungarian unemployment insurance (UI) benefit system on the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> from unemployment to regular employment. The duration analysis relies on unemployment spells from two inflow cohorts, which are administered under distinct UI rules. Thus, it exploits a natural experiment to identify disincentive effects. Kaplan-Meier estimates suggest that the benefit reform did not significantly change the transition rates. Moreover, a semi-parametric analysis cannot find remarkable disincentive effects but an entitlement effect. The hazards of men and women rise somewhat {{in the last two months}} before they run out of UI benefit. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{first period}} of the {{transition}} to a market economy was characterised by a high rate of job-change in many transition countries. This was no different for East Germany. This paper analyses the consequences of the transition process for East German workers in their old job. We quantify the speed at which they change their jobs for a new one or enter unemployment by studying a sample of job spells drawn form the German Socio-Economic Panel-East. The study focuses the period from July 1990 to December 1993, thus a period after the introduction of the German Economic, Monetary, and Social Union. We estimate the effects of important covariates on the transition rates from the old job into a new and into unemployment by a standard competing-risks duration model. Our results suggest that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> into new jobs rises with skills. We also find that old firms managed to keep workers with relatively good job matches. The special short-time allowances, a labour market program that was in force until the end of 1991, slowed down the exit rate into unemployment prior to its end. We find that workers increased their rate of job-change temporarily at around the period in which this program ended. ...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University of LutonThe current literature indicates that research concerning the area of industrial interorganisational relationships (lORs) and relationship marketing (RM) in an international context is growing in size as well as importance, and is regarded by many as constituting a paradigmatic shift in contemporary marketing thought. The study of lORs, however, has suffered from empirical neglect, particularly in an international context. The extant literature is unclear concerning the development process of relationships. In particular, the antecedents of commitment in affectively committed relationships (positive attachment) and calculatively committed relationships (negative attachment) and their performance outcomes, the causes of dissolution in previously committed relationships and the impact national culture has on the process when it traverses national borders is not well understood. Therefore, the primary objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the stages of the development process of international lORs, and to determine the level of influence national culture exerted on this process. Two stages of empirical research using a mixed methodology were conducted. The first stage of fieldwork -an exploratory case study approach -used seven in-depth interviews with UK. import/export executives in charge of relationship development within their respective companies. The first stage of fieldwork was used to examine the stages of international lOR development and the influence national culture exerts on it in order to develop a set of hypotheses for subsequent testing. Stage two -a mail survey approach was mailed to 3000 UK import/export executives and used data from 322 questionnaires to test a set of hypotheses developed from the first stage of fieldwork. The study had significant findings in three key areas. Firstly, the research identified that the antecedents of commitment in affectively and caculatively committed relationships differed significantly and furthermore, relationships based on affective commitment enjoyed relatively greater levels of performance outcomes in comparison to relationships based on calculative commitment. Secondly, the study identified the causes of dissolution in previously committed relationships in four categories: buyer factors, supplier factors, competitor factors, and environmental factors. The findings also indicated that relationship dissolution could be classified in three ways: full exit, partial exit and temporary exit, and that dissolution was influenced by the motive for commitment prior to dissolution. The period of time spent in dissolving relationships was often found to be lengthy and was influenced by five categories of factors that impede partners' <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit.</b> Finally, the study applied the assumptions of Hofstede (1980; 1991) to examine the extent to which national culture affects relationship development when it crosses national borders. The findings revealed little concrete evidence to suggest that national culture has a strong influence on international business relationships. International business relationships were, however, susceptible to factors such as infrastructure barriers and political barriers that were obstacles to foreign market success. The thesis contributes to current knowledge by offering the first empirically supported model of lOR development from pre-formation to dissolution in the extant literature; principally, identifying the antecedents of effective and ineffective relationships and also the stages of dissolution when relationships dissolve. The national culture literature within the domain of Marketing, and in particular, the literature concerning lORs, is advanced by suggesting that Hofstede's (1980; 1991) cross-cultural assumptions may not impact significantly on international lORs in a manner prescribed by Hofstede. In order to achieve the primary research objectives a number of scales were operationalised including scales to measure the influence of national culture on lORs, and aspects of relationship development including a multi-dimensional scale to measure trust. The study offers a number of recommendations for practitioners, and presents a number of future research directions. These are principally, to identify the antecedents of calculative commitment (that are hitherto unknown), and incorporate variables that may legitimately act as antecedents of commitment not examined in this study...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of two common methods of {{internal}} restructuring, layoffs and divestitures on the survival of a sample of UK firms. Using a Poisson regression model, we find that divestitures improve survival likelihood by reducing the probability and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> market <b>exit</b> via takeover or bankruptcy, whereas layoffs increase the probability and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> market <b>exit</b> via bankruptcy. Surprisingly, classifying firms into financially distressed and healthy groups, we find that distressed firms are less likely to restructure. Furthermore, while divestitures improve survival likelihood in both groups, layoff firms are less likely to survive, irrespective of whether they are distressed or healthy. Our findings are consistent with event studies that examine the market reaction to layoffs and divestiture decisions, and so provide some support for the view that the market correctly values the consequences of these restructuring actions on firm survival. The results are robust to several econometric and modeling issues, including controlling for potential self-selection bias. Ronan Powell and Alfred Yawso...|$|R

Structural policies are incentives and regulations that are maintained for long periods, contrasting with policy responses to shocks, the analysis of which has dominated the literature. We show that some previously neglected structural policies have large effects that are specific to particular types of shock. In particular, regulations which reduce the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> firm <b>exit</b> substantially increase the short-term growth loss from adverse non-agricultural export price shocks and so are particularly ill-suited to mineral exporting economies.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model capable of evaluating {{the effect of}} large purchases of treasuries by central banks. The model exhibits imperfect asset substitutability between government bonds of different maturities and a feedback from the term structure to the macroeconomy. Both are generated through the introduction of portfolio adjustment frictions. As a result, the model is able to isolate the portfolio rebalancing channel of Quantitative Easing (QE). This theoretical framework is employed to evaluate the impact on yields and the macroeconomy of large purchases of medium- and long-term treasuries recently {{carried out in the}} US and UK. The results from the calibrated model suggest that large asset purchases of government assets had stimulating effects in terms of lower long-term yields, and higher output and inflation. The size of the effects is nevertheless sensitive to the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exit</b> strategy chosen by monetary authorities. ...|$|R

Rumble strips are one of the appropriate available measures that help prevent run-off-road accidents. When driving on the near right side of the road, it is possible to drive over the rumble strips unintentionally. Studies have shown that one percent even drive on the emergency lane or hard shoulder. With an average daily traffic of 33, 000 vehicles, this causes unnecessary additional noise pollution. The study at hand describes a method that introduces a different positioning of rumble strips as a means of reducing unintentional crossing and run-off-road accidents. Based on <b>speed</b> and angle <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> as well as the friction between tyre and traffic lane and an assumed reaction time, the lateral distance needed could be determined. The assumption is that the driver's reaction is a sole steering movement back onto the traffic lane, where the vehicle traverses a circular path at the maximum possible speed.

40|$|Contagion {{from the}} global crisis necessitated use of fiscal {{stimulus}} measures in India during 2008 - 10 in order to contain a major slowdown in economic growth. Given the usual downward inflexibility of fiscal deficit once it reaches a high level, as has been experienced by India in the past, there could be medium-term implications for the future inflation path, which must be recognised while designing the timing and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>exit.</b> Inflation, at times, may become effectively a fiscal phenomenon, since the fiscal stance could influence significantly the overall monetary conditions. As highlighted in this paper, fiscal deficit could be seen to influence the inflation process either through growth of base money created by the RBI (i. e. net RBI credit to the Government) or through higher aggregate demand associated with an expansionary fiscal stance (which could increase growth in broad money). Empirical estimates of this paper conducted over the sample period 1953 - 2009 suggest that one percentage point {{increase in the level}} of the fiscal deficit could cause {{about a quarter of a}} percentage point increase in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The paper emphasises that the potential inflation risk should work as an important motivating factor to ensure a faster return to the fiscal consolidation path in India, driven by quality of adjustment with appropriate rationalisation of expenditure, rather than waiting for revenue buoyancy associated with sustained robust growth to do the job automatically. The importance of fiscal space in the India specific context needs to be seen in terms of not only the usual output stabilisation role of fiscal policy but also the occasional need for use of fiscal measures to contain such inflationary pressures that may arise from temporary but large supply shocks. ...|$|R

The next searching direction and searching range of variables are determined by variance ratio after the robust optimization model is firstly calculated by design parameters on orthogonal array.

The intelligent orthogonal optimization is performed until error value of each variable is equal to zero or is equivalent, which is the optimal robust solution. Correspondingly, the variable range corresponding to the minimum variance ratio in the orthogonal array in preceding step is the tolerance of the optimal robust solution, which means that {{there is no need for}} special tolerance design.
