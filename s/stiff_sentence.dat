40|$|Friday, December 5, 2008 Media Advisory UGA law {{professor}} says O. J. Simpson sentence is fair According to nationally recognized trial law expert and University of Georgia {{law professor}} Ronald L. Carlson, after today 2 ̆ 7 s sentencing in Las Vegas, many {{will say that}} O. J. 2 ̆ 7 s punishment was excessive, as a make-up for his earlier homicide acquittal. 2 ̆ 2 Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s defense team says the justice system is punishing him for the Los Angeles murders. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. 2 ̆ 2 Judge Glass undercut the recommendation which had been made by the court 2 ̆ 7 s parole service, a recommendation of 18 years. Doubtless, those parole officials were moved to advocate a <b>stiff</b> <b>sentence</b> by what Judge Glass described as O. J. 2 ̆ 7 s arrogance. The lack of remorse for an armed attack on hotel room occupants understandably undermines a plea for leniency. 2 ̆ 2 O. J. 2 ̆ 7 s professed sorrow apparently first surfaced at the sentencing hearing earlier today. 2 ̆ 2 Appeals will be next but, for the moment, it appears justice was done. 2 ̆ 2 When O. J. maintained there were no guns displayed in the retrieval of property at the Palace Station Hotel, a denial which was rebutted when several witnesses saw the weapons, his credibility was hopelessly comprised. 2 ̆ 2 For further commentary, Carlson can be reached at 706 - 542 - 5186 (law school) or 706 - 548 - 6771 (home, after 4 p. m.).
