40|$|This study {{examined}} whether genes {{that are less}} conserved than the 16 S rRNA gene can distinguish Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense strains that are identical based on their 16 S rRNA genes, {{with a view to}} providing insight into their origins and distribution, and any patterns of association with particular plant hosts. Sequence analysis of the tuf gene and rp operon showed that Ca. P. australiense strains could be differentiated into four subgroups, named 16 SrXII-B (tuf-Australia I; rp-A), 16 SrXII-B (tuf-New Zealand I; rp-B), 16 SrXII-B (tuf-New Zealand II) and 16 SrXII-B (rp-C). Strawberry lethal yellows 1, <b>strawberry</b> <b>green</b> <b>petal,</b> Australian grapevine yellows, pumpkin yellow leaf curl and cottonbush witches 2 ̆ 7 broom phytoplasmas were designated members of the 16 SrXII-B (tuf-Australia I; rp-A) subgroup. The strawberry lethal yellows 2 and cottonbush reduced yellow leaves phytoplasmas were assigned to the 16 SrXII (tuf-New Zealand II; rp-B) subgroup. No relationship was observed between these phytoplasma subgroups and collection date, location or host plant. However, the study revealed evolutionary divergence in the 16 SrXII group...|$|R

40|$|Strawberry lethal yellows (SLY) {{disease in}} Australia is {{associated}} with the phytoplasmas Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense and tomato big bud, and a rickettsia-like-organism (RLO). Ca. P. australiense is also associated with <b>strawberry</b> <b>green</b> <b>petal</b> (SGP) disease. This study investigated the strength of the association of the different agents with SLY disease. We also documented the location of SLY or SGP plants, and measured whether they were RLO or phytoplasma positive. Symptomatic strawberry plants collected from south-east Queensland (Australia) between January 2000 and October 2002 were screened by PCR for both phytoplasmas and the RLO. Two previously unreported disease symptoms termed severe fruit distortion (SFD) and strawberry leaves from fruit (SLF) were observed during this study but there was no clear association between these symptoms and phytoplasmas or the RLO. Only two SGP diseased plants were observed and collected, compared with 363 plants with SLY disease symptoms. Of the 363 SLY samples, 117 tested positive for the RLO, 67 tested positive for Ca. P. australiense AGY strain and 11 plants tested positive for Ca. P. australiense PYL variant strain. On runner production farms at Stanthorpe, Queensland the RLO was detected in SLY diseased plants more frequently than for the phytoplasmas. On fruit production farms on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Ca. P. australiense was detected in SLY disease plants more frequently than the RLO...|$|R
40|$|Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense (Ca. P. australiense) is {{associated}} with the plant diseases strawberry lethal yellows (SLY), <b>strawberry</b> <b>green</b> <b>petal</b> (SGP), papaya dieback (PDB), Australian grapevine yellows (AGY) and Phormium yellow leaf (PYL; New Zealand). Strawberry lethal yellows disease is also associated with a rickettsia-like-organism (RLO) or infrequently with the tomato big bud (TBB) phytoplasma, the latter being associated {{with a wide range of}} plant diseases throughout Australia. In contrast, the RLO has been identified only in association with SLY disease, and Ca. P. australiense has been detected only in a limited number of plant host species. The aim of this study was to identify plant hosts that are possible reservoirs of Ca. P. australiense and the SLY RLO. Thirty-one plant species from south-east Queensland were observed with disease between 2001 and 2003 and, of these, 18 species tested positive using phytoplasma-specific primers. The RLO was detected in diseased Jacksonia scoparia and Modiola caroliniana samples collected at Stanthorpe. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in 16 different plant species and Ca. P. australiense Australian grapevine yellows strain was detected in six species. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Warwick and Brisbane. Ca. P. australiense was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Gatton and Allora. All four phytoplasmas were detected in diseased Gomphocarpus physocarpus plants collected at Toowoomba, Allora, Nambour and Gatton. These results indicated that the vector(s) of Ca. P. australiense are distributed throughout south-east Queensland and the diversity of phytoplasmas detected in G. physocarpus suggests it is a feeding source for phytoplasma insect vectors or it has a broad susceptibility to a range of phytoplasmas...|$|R
40|$|In Australia the {{strawberry}} diseases, lethal yellows and <b>green</b> <b>petal,</b> {{are associated with}} Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense (Ca. P. australiense). In addition, a rickettsia-like-organism (RLO) is associated with Australian strawberry lethal yellows (SLY) disease. Ca. P. australiense is also associated with the plant diseases, papaya dieback (PDB), Australian grapevine yellows (AGY) and Phormium yellow leaf (PYL; New Zealand). The tomato big bud (TBB) phytoplasma {{is associated with a}} wider range of plant diseases throughout Australia. In contrast, the RLO has only been identified in association with SLY disease, and Ca. P. australiense has only been detected in a limited number of plant host species. Diversity studies of phytoplasmas have shown that the conserved 16 S rRNA gene may not distinguish closely related phytoplasmas within the Ca. P. australiense group. Identification of more variable genes may facilitate the differentiation of these closely related phytoplasmas. The aims of this study were to; 1) develop a peR based diagnostic test for the SLY RLO, 2) use this and existing tests to examine the phloem limited organisms associated with <b>strawberry</b> <b>green</b> <b>petal</b> (SGP) and lethal yellows diseases, 3) measure the level of association between the RLOs and phytoplasmas, and strawberry diseases, 4) identify plant species that are possible reservoirs for the phytoplasmas and RLOs associated with SLY and SOP diseases, 5) identify new genes that may be suitable for differentiating closely related phytoplasmas, 6) use these genes and previously identified phytoplasma genes to investigate genetic variation among Ca. P. australiense strains and determine whether there is a relationship between strains and a particular host plant species. Two plants with SLY disease were subjected to PCR using papaya bunchy top (PBT) RLO primers and the amplicons were sequenced. Both amplicons shared 96 % sequence identity with the sdhA gene of the PBT RLO and this provided the first molecular evidence that an RLO is associated with strawberry lethal yellows. Only two plants with <b>strawberry</b> <b>green</b> <b>petal</b> disease were observed and collected between January 2000 and October 2002, compared with 363 plants with SLY disease symptoms. Of the 363 SLY samples, 117 tested positive for the RLO, 67 tested positive for Ca. P. australiense AGY strain and 11 plants tested positive for Ca. P. australiense Phormium yellow leaf variant strain. On runner production farms at Stanthorpe, the RLO was detected in SLY diseased plants more frequently than phytoplasmas. On fruit production farms at the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Ca. P. australiense was detected in SLY disease plants more frequently than the RLO. Thirty one other plant species from south-east Queensland were observed with disease between 2001 and 2003 and of these, 18 species tested positive using phytoplasma specific primers. The RLO was detected III diseased lacksonia scoparia and Modiola caroliniana samples collected at Stanthorpe. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in 16 different plant species and Ca. P. australiense AGY strain was detected in six species. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Warwick and Brisbane. Ca. P. australiense was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Gatton and AHora. A TBB phytoplasma random clone genomic library was analysed as part of a search for new genes {{that could be used to}} distinguish closely related phytoplasmas. Twenty clones were analysed and these contained 26 genes comprising 19. 0 kbp of TBB phytoplasma genomic DNA. Half of the TBB phytoplasma genes identified were involved in DNA replication, transcription and translation. The remaining TBB phytoplasma genes were involved in protein secretion, cellular processes, transport and energy metabolism. Most primers designed based on the newly identified phytoplasma genes amplified a product from TBB and sweet potato little leaf strain V 4 (SPLL-V 4) phytoplasma samples. When amplified products were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, the restriction patterns were the same as the respective clones. These primers did not amplify Ca. P. australiense DNA but sequence analysis of the tuf gene and rp gene operon showed that Ca. P. australiense strains could be differentiated into four subgroups. These subgroups were named 16 SrXII-BUuf-Australia I) (rp-A), 16 SrXII-BCtuf-New Zealand I; rp-B), 16 SrXII-B(tuf-New Zealand II) and 16 SrXII-B (rp-C). While no relationship was observed between these phytoplasma subgroups and collection date, location or host plant, the existence of subgroups indicated distinct inoculation events and possibly different alternative hosts and different vectors. PCR results and sequence analysis indicated the PBT RLO PCR primers are suitable for screening SLY disease samples for the presence of an RLO. peR screening of diseased strawberry plants showed RLOs and phytoplasmas are equally associated with SLY disease and the RLO is more prevalent at runner production areas while Ca. P. australiense is more frequently detected at fruit production farms. These findings suggest that RLO SLY disease management is required in the runner production areas while Ca. P. australiense control strategies should be implemented in fruit production areas. The TBB phytoplasma was most frequently detected in the other plant species collected during the study so there is a plentiful supply of TBB phytoplasma inoculum. Despite this, the TBB phytoplasma was infrequently detected in diseased strawberry plants. Six plant species were identified as possible sources of Ca. P. australiense inoculum for SLY disease while only two species are possible reservoirs for the SLY RLO. For SLY disease control strategies to be effective they will have to address the supply of inoculum in the areas surrounding strawberry farms...|$|R
40|$|The {{identity}} of phytoplasmas detected in <b>strawberry</b> plants with <b>green</b> <b>petal</b> (SGP) and lethal yellows (SLY) diseases {{was determined by}} RFLP analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene and adjacent spacer region (SR). RFLP and sequence comparisons indicated that the phytoplasmas associated with SGP and SLY were indistinguishable and were most closely related to 2 ̆ 7 Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense 2 ̆ 7, the phytoplasma associated with Australian grapevine yellows, papaya dieback and Phormium yellow leaf diseases. This taxon lies within the aster yellows strain cluster. Primers based on the phytoplasma tuf gene, which amplify only members of the AY strain cluster, amplified a DNA product from the SGP and SLY phytoplasmas. Primers deduced from the 16 S rRNA/SR of P. australiense that amplify only members of this taxon amplified rDNA sequences from the SGP and SLY phytoplasmas. Primers that selectively amplify members of the faba bean phyllody (FBP) phytoplasma group, the most commonly occurring phytoplasma group in Australia, did not amplify rDNA from the SGP and SLY phytoplasmas...|$|R

40|$|We {{isolated}} and characterized two flower-specific genes from petunia. The protein products of these genes, designated floral binding protein 1 (FBP 1) and 2 (FBP 2), are putative transcription factors with the MADS box DNA binding domain. RNA gel blot {{analysis showed that}} the fbp 1 gene is exclusively expressed in petals and stamen of petunia flowers. In contrast, the FBP 1 protein was only detectable in petals and not in stamens, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of the fbp 1 gene in these tissues. The fbp 2 gene is expressed in petals, stamen, carpels, and at a very low level in sepals but not in vegetative tissues. We analyzed the spatial expression of these fbp genes in floral organs of two homeotic flower mutants. In the blind mutant, whose flower limbs are transformed into antheroid structures on top of normal tubes, identical expression levels of both genes were observed in the antheroid structures as in normal anthers. In the homeotic mutant <b>green</b> <b>petals,</b> the petals are replaced by sepaloid organs in which the expression of fbp 1 is strongly reduced but not completely abolished. Our results suggest a regulation of the fbp 1 gene expression by the <b>green</b> <b>petals</b> (gp) gene. Expression of the fbp 2 gene was not affected in the <b>green</b> <b>petals</b> mutant. In contrast to the proposed models describing floral morphogenesis, our data indicated that homeotic genes can be functional in one whorl only...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel strategy for the introduction of durable insect resistance in crops. This strategy was based on intervention in the natural relationship between plants and insects. For many insects, including pests such as thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), the flower {{is an important factor}} in their life cycle, serving either as a food source or as a place for mating. The insects are attracted to the flower by scent, which is mainly produced by the petals, and by the bright colour of these floral organs. We therefore anticipated that removal or changing the identity of the petals would significantly reduce the attractiveness of the flower to thrips. To test this hypothesis, we used cucumber as a model species because most modern varieties are parthenocarpic, in which the fruit develops without fertilization. The cucumber mutant <b>green</b> <b>petals,</b> in which the petals are homeotically transformed into green sepals, was particularly useful for this study. The susceptibility of the cucumber plants to damage by thrips was determined by recording thrip numbers and by measuring leaf damage. Large differences were observed when greenhouse compartments with either wild-type or <b>green</b> <b>petal</b> mutant plants were compared. The rate of population growth of the insects on the mutant plants was significantly reduced and the leaves were almost undamaged. These results demonstrate that alterations in the structure of flowers may interfere with the life cycle of insects, providing the means for a novel and natural strategy for obtaining insect resistance...|$|R
