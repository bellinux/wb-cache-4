5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing.</b> Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> caught on fire.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: New Tempest Mk.IIs of {{the first}} {{production}} batch at Hawker Aircraft. Note the closely cowled engine and the carburettor and oil-cooler intakes in the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing's</b> inner leading edge.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} {{was badly}} damaged in a landing accident on 4 April 1938 with its undercarriage and <b>starboard</b> <b>wings</b> destroyed. Although the aircraft was repaired, {{it was not}} flown again, and no production was undertaken. The GR.8 was scrapped after the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940.|$|R
25|$|Night fighter version, {{equipped}} with an AN/APS-4 radar in a fairing on the <b>starboard</b> outer <b>wing.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 22 December 2013, British Airways Flight 34, a Boeing 747–436 G-BNLL, hit a {{building}} at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg after missing a turning on a taxiway. The <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> was severely damaged {{but there were}} no injuries amongst the crew or 189 passengers, however four members of ground staff were injured when the wing smashed into the building. The aircraft was officially withdrawn from service in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1939, {{test pilot}} Kapetan Milan Pokorni put the {{prototype}} into a steep dive. When he reached , the windscreen {{detached from the}} aircraft; Pokorni pulled up hard and the strain broke off half of the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing.</b> The aircraft crashed, and Pokorni was killed. An inquiry determined that modifications to the windscreen had contributed to the accident but the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the highly sensitive controls. Engineers recalculated the stress factors on the airframe and they {{were found to be}} safe; the crash was attributed to pilot error and the sensitivity of the controls.|$|E
25|$|Another night fighter version, {{equipped}} with a newer AN/APS-6 radar in a fairing on the <b>starboard</b> outer <b>wing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Progress {{has been}} made on the design {{fabrication}} and installation of a tension carry-through linkage between the aft parts of the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>wings</b> to resist forward bending deflection on the RP- 2 sailplane. In addition, towhook/release mechanisms, landing gear and wheel brake assembly, compound curved sandwich composite fuselage shells and an enclosed trailer to house and transport the complete disassembled aircraft, have all undergone various stages of design, fabrication, installation and testing...|$|R
50|$|The Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne was an {{experimental}} British rotorcraft that used single lifting rotor and a tractor propeller {{mounted on the}} tip of the <b>starboard</b> stub <b>wing</b> to provide both propulsion and anti-torque reaction.|$|R
5|$|Soon after Flight 825 took off, a {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air {{infrared}} homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because {{they had gone to}} look for water before the guerrillas arrived.|$|E
5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E
5|$|He {{claimed his}} {{first of two}} aerial {{victories}} in the Battle of France on 20May 1940. Ostermann had been entrusted with leading a Rotte, an element of two aircraft, with Unteroffizier (non-commissioned officer) Fritz Marcks as his wingman. The Schwarm (flight) led by Oberleutnant (Senior Lieutenant or First Lieutenant) Günther Scholz engaged eight French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406's fighters near Amiens with Ostermann, Marcks and Scholz claiming one each. His second aerial victory was achieved over a Curtiss Hawk-75 on 26May 1940. In a head on firing pass two 20mm shells tore off {{large parts of the}} aircraft's tail fin, which then collided with Osterrmann's <b>starboard</b> <b>wing.</b> The French pilot was observed to bail out with Ostermann managing to make a safe landing.|$|E
25|$|On 30 November 1961, Ansett-ANA Flight 325, a Vickers Viscount, {{crashed into}} Botany Bay shortly after take-off. The <b>starboard</b> (right) <b>wing</b> failed after the {{aircraft}} flew into a thunderstorm. All 15 {{people on board}} were killed.|$|R
500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprised}} two fuel tanks between the main (forward) and rear spars of the (inner) anhedral wing {{section of the}} port and <b>starboard</b> <b>wings,</b> each with [...] capacity. The tanks also had a predetermined limit which, if passed, would warn the pilot via a red warning light in the cockpit. The fuel was injected via a pump from the tanks to the power plant. Should this shut down, it could be pumped manually using a hand-pump on the fuel cock armature. The powerplant was cooled by a , ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. A further container of [...] was positioned under the engine.|$|R
500|$|The ship's master manoeuvred {{the ship}} {{into the wind}} and raised a blue flag above his head to {{authorise}} the launch. (The ship's master stood on the <b>starboard</b> bridge <b>wing</b> to avoid the catapult rocket blast which sometimes damaged the port side of the bridge.) ...|$|R
5|$|Intrepid steamed from Ulithi {{back to the}} Philippines {{with orders}} to strike Nichols and Nielsen airfields, destroy {{shipping}} in Manila Bay and to attack concentrations of enemy aircraft encountered between Manila and Batangas. This effort began on November 19. The first strike of the day ran into token resistance {{from a handful of}} Zeros, but the enemies did not press home attacks on the bomber squadrons. Instead, VF-18 fighters initiated combat, chasing down and destroying two enemy aircraft. A solitary Zero flying at higher altitude was spotted by Harris, who led his division in pursuit. Harris put holes in the enemy fighter's <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> root firing from long range. The Japanese pilot bailed out, but his plane continued flying for four or five minutes with curious Hellcats following in its wake. They eventually shot down the unmanned aircraft. Intrepid went to general quarters a number of times throughout the day's strikes and into the evening as enemy planes tested the perimeter of the task group.|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as {{to come up and}} underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's <b>starboard</b> <b>wing.</b> Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and did not make a claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E
25|$|The Vulcan flew along runway 07 {{then started}} a rolling climb to starboard. During this {{manoeuvre}} the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> disintegrated, {{resulting in a}} collapse of the main spar and wing structure. The Vulcan went into a dive with the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> on fire and struck the ground. Three occupants of a controllers' caravan were killed by debris, {{all four of the}} Vulcan crew were also killed. Three servicemen who were in an ambulance were also injured by debris from the crash.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{aeronautical}} convention defines the roll as acting about the longitudinal axis, positive with the <b>starboard</b> (right) <b>wing</b> down. The yaw {{is about the}} vertical body axis, positive with the nose to starboard. Pitch is about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of symmetry, positive nose up.|$|R
50|$|The {{number and}} shape of the wings varies widely on {{different}} types. A given wing plane may be full-span or divided by a central fuselage into port (left) and <b>starboard</b> (right) <b>wings.</b> Occasionally even more wings have been used, with the three-winged triplane achieving some fame in WWI. The four-winged quadruplane and other multiplane designs have had little success.|$|R
5000|$|The LDA-01 was a single-seat tandem-wing monoplane, fabric {{covered with}} metal construction. The {{foreplane}} had a common design to the separately-made port and <b>starboard</b> <b>wings</b> {{of the main}} plane, giving it half the area. The intention was {{to reduce the number}} of spare parts needed by re-using the same wing component interchangeably in each location. The main wings were mounted at the rear-end of the box structure fuselage and the fore wing was attached underneath the front. The fuselage was fitted with a four-wheeled landing gear [...] and was designed to be fitted with a detachable payload container to allow easy conversion between roles. It was powered by a rear-mounted pusher engine. The LDA-01 G-AVOR first flew on 24 August 1971 at Wisley in Surrey, under the power of an 85 hp (63 kW) Continental C85 piston engine, but was later refitted with a more powerful Lycoming O-320 engine.|$|R
25|$|On 27 November 1950 a P2V-2 crashed while {{conducting}} a test run with rockets near Kaena Point in Hawaii. The <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> {{separated from the}} aircraft. The crew of five died on impact.|$|E
25|$|Having {{failed to}} gain height {{following}} a power increase to go around, the aircraft struck {{the ground with}} its <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> and cartwheeled due to a malfunctioning automatic pitch coarsening unit of the starboard propeller.|$|E
25|$|The Be-103 is a mid-wing monoplane, {{making use}} of the {{modified}} wing roots as water-displacing sponsons. It features an all-moving slab tail and retractable tricycle landing gear for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing design feature is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three aquaplaning implements (planing step, port and <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on-the-water stability and seaworthiness.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam Campaign Medal was {{an award}} of South Vietnam for those {{individuals}} who served in Vietnam {{for a period of}} at least six months. Although it was a personal award, Coast Guard regulations permitted its display on a cutter's port and <b>starboard</b> bridge <b>wings</b> since Squadron One's cutters served during the eligibility period of 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973.|$|R
50|$|The {{number and}} shape of the wings varies widely on {{different}} types. A given wing plane may be full-span or divided by a central fuselage into port (left) and <b>starboard</b> (right) <b>wings.</b> Occasionally even more wings have been used, with the three-winged triplane achieving some fame in WWI. The four-winged quadruplane and other Multiplane (aeronautics) designs have had little success.|$|R
50|$|In January 1941, the Navy at St. Louis's Lambert Field began full primary training. Since Lambert was a {{very busy}} airport, also {{being used by the}} Army and the manufacturers, inexperienced student pilots were not allowed to solo. The Navy {{traveled}} 11 miles north and eventually purchased several hundred acres from Ruth Neubeiser. An initial $250,000 was spent building a 2,000 ft. octagonal mat, a hangar, and barracks. Navy flight training students were organized into two units - the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>wings.</b> In the morning, one wing would fly while the other attended classes and other activities. In the afternoon, it was the opposite. Students were bused to and from Neubeiser for their solos. A considerable number of aircraft were kept at Neubeiser as well as ground crewmen who serviced the aircraft and lived there. The facility was later renamed Smartt Field in honor of Ensign Joseph Smartt, who was killed in the Japanese attack on NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii on December 7, 1941.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{intercooler}} {{required a}} radiator, the radiator under the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> was halved {{in size and}} the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one radiator section provided enough coolant; a thermostatic switch turned off the starboard radiator section until more power was called for and extra engine cooling was required.|$|E
25|$|Various new ECMs and {{electronic}} support systems were retrofitted onto the Nimrod fleet {{in response to}} new challenges and to increase the type's defensive capabilities; additional equipment also provided more effective means of identification and communication. A number of modifications were introduced during the 1991 Gulf War; {{a small number of}} MR2s were fitted with improved Link 11 datalinks, new defensive ECM equipment including the first operational use of a towed radar decoy, and a forward looking infrared turret under the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 1950 Colquhoun {{was flying}} an Attacker {{to test the}} {{effectiveness}} of the air brakes. On the third of two dives the outer portion of the <b>starboard</b> <b>wing</b> folded up and the ailerons became locked. Colquhoun decided not to eject and managed to do a high-speed landing at Chilbolton, he used all but the last 100 yards (90m) of the runway and burst a tyre. He had saved the aircraft so the cause could be discovered and was awarded the George Medal for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Although the Vietnam Service Medal is a {{personal}} service award, it is permissible and customary under Coast Guard regulations for cutters to display service awards on the port and <b>starboard</b> bridge <b>wings.</b> Squadron One cutters were entitled to display the VSM by virtue of having served in Vietnam for more than thirty days during the eligibility period of 15 November 1961 to 30 April 1975.|$|R
2500|$|One common {{oversight}} is {{the fact}} that the collapse of the first funnel at a relatively shallow angle occurred when the forward expansion joint, over which several funnel stays crossed, opened as the hull was beginning to stress. [...] The opening of the joint stretched and snapped the stays. [...] The forward momentum of the ship as it took a sudden lurch forward and downward sent the unsupported funnel toppling onto the <b>starboard</b> bridge <b>wing.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the opening}} {{historical}} {{sequence of the}} HBO mini-series The Pacific, the USS Ralph Talbot is shown sailing through rough seas, apparently performing escort duty, based on the ships in the background. On the ship, sailors are seen on deck around the Number 1 and Number 2 gun mounts, manning the AA mounts below the Bridge, and on the <b>starboard</b> bridge <b>wing.</b> The ship's hull number is in war-time, low visibility reduced-size.|$|R
