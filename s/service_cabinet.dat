50|$|Japan's elite bureaucrats are {{insulated}} from direct political pressure {{because there are}} very few political appointments in the civil <b>service.</b> <b>Cabinet</b> ministers are usually career politicians, but they are moved in and out of their posts quite frequently (with an average tenure of under a year), and usually have little opportunity to develop a power base within a ministry, or force their civil service subordinates to adopt reforms. Below the cabinet minister is the administrative vice minister. Administrative vice ministers and their subordinates are career civil servants whose appointments are determined in accordance with an internally established principle of seniority.|$|E

5000|$|As an {{improved}} {{version of the}} above model, child protection workers were cut adrift from schools in the early 1990s in districts XV and XVI of Budapest. They were employed by the Educational <b>Service</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> Their duties were appointed by and they were superintended by the educational department of the local government. This model ended the above conflict of loyalties but it continued to use educational means and an educational approach in the resolution of a problem that could only partly be handled in this fashion. The model was criticized for two reasons. On the one hand, they continued to employ teachers, who were not qualified for child protection work. On the other hand, in state schools administration and the school social worker were both employed by the government. As a consequence, in a conflict between {{the school and the}} pupil the school social worker was not able to stand up for the child's rights when her/his own employer was the adversary. [...] The above two models has proved to be dead ends with respect to school social work. Yet the employment of child protection workers remained standard practice at schools.|$|E
