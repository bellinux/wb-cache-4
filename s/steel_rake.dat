50|$|A {{fire rake}} is a {{wildland}} fire fighting tool. A fire rake has a wooden or fiberglass handle with a rake head consisting of four very sharp, serrated, triangular steel blades. It {{is used to}} rake a fire break with the sharp teeth enabling it to reach fire in undergrowth in addition to loose surface debris. Another type of fire rake which {{looks more like a}} <b>steel</b> <b>rake</b> but with sharp edges on the teeth, and is sometimes referred to as a rake hoe is called a McLeod. The teeth of the more traditional fire rake which resemble the teeth of a great white shark allow it to get deeper into the undergrowth when necessary. But the preference for one over the other is somewhat subjective.|$|E

50|$|The 60 m high {{building}} {{consists of}} 14 floors which provide 84 apartments, including eight penthouses. The apartments are above a retail level, 16 metres high, and {{are supported by}} <b>raking</b> <b>steel</b> tubular columns in a manner reminiscent of Rotterdam's De Brug building. The raking columns allow the small close centred columns of the apartments to be channelled into large, widely spaced, columns of the retail section. This is due to apartments tolerating many closely spaced columns whereas retail areas cannot. The comparatively lightweight structure is principally constructed of steel, the skeleton balanced by precise weight ratios to ensure its stability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, thermo {{mechanical}} modelling {{of cutting}} {{process has been}} developed using a commercially available finite element analysis software, ABAQUS. A 2 -D orthogonal cutting has been modelled using Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation. The Johnson-Cook plasticity model has been assumed to describe the material behaviour during the process. This study is aimed at temperature and stresses distributions during machining of AISI 1045 <b>steel</b> with different <b>rake</b> angles; α= 0 ° and α =- 10 °. The {{results showed that the}} maximum stress for 0 ° and- 10 ° are 963 MPa and 967 MPa while the maximum temperature results shown that 771 °C and 347 °C...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the case}} of hard {{machining}} of <b>steels,</b> negative <b>rake</b> tools generate compressive deformation and high temperature under the cutting edge, leading to phase transformation or “white layers”. The resulting surface integrity can be predicted by numerical simulations which may be validated by comparing simulated and measured strain fields. Recent high speed imaging devices have facilitated strain field measurement by Digital Image Correlation (DIC), even at high strain rates. However, the analyse is generally restricted to the primary shear zone {{and not to the}} workpiece under the machined surface. For this study, a double-frame camera and a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, generally used in the field of fluid mechanics, have been employed to record images during an orthogonal cutting operation of a hardened steel. The effect of the rake angle and the edge preparation of c-BN tools on the subsurface displacement field, which has been experimentally investigated by using DIC, are presented in this paper together with an analysis on the origins of the strains. The results of these measurements will be used to validate cutting numerical simulations or to improve hybrid modelling of surface integrity...|$|R
40|$|During {{machining}} {{energy is}} transformed into heat due to plastic deformation of the workpiece surface and friction between tool and workpiece. High temperatures are generated {{in the region of}} the cutting edge, which have a very important influence on wear rate of the cutting tool and on tool life. This work proposes the estimation of heat flux at the chip-tool interface using inverse techniques. Factors which influence the temperature distribution at the AISI M 32 C high speed <b>steel</b> tool <b>rake</b> face during machining of a ABNT 12 L 14 steel workpiece were also investigated. The temperature distribution was predicted using finite volume elements. A transient 3 D numerical code using irregular and nonstaggered mesh was developed to solve the nonlinear heat diffusion equation. To validate the software, experimental tests were made. The inverse problem was solved using the function specification method. Heat fluxes at the tool-workpiece interface were estimated using inverse problems techniques and experimental temperatures. Tests were performed to study the effect of cutting parameters on cutting edge temperature. The results were compared with those of the tool-work thermocouple technique and a fair agreement was obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of obtaining a {{good process control}} {{in order to reach}} a good cleanliness of the steel were studied based on plant trials. Steel and slag samples were taken from two steel grades with a slightly different composition, but with similar processing conditions. Thereafter, the chemical compositions of the steel and slag samples were determined. The results show that the sum of the FeO and MnO was found to be a clear indicator for when reoxidation had taken place. No conclusive indicator was found to predict the extent of slag carry-over from the electric arc furnace. However, most of the variation in deoxidation seem to originate from the accuracy of the slag <b>raking.</b> <b>Steel</b> grades with low amounts of deoxidisers such as C and Si naturally were found to result in higher oxygen contents at the start of deoxidation. Furthermore, calculations of oxygen activities in the steel melt were made and the results were compared to measurements with varying results. Overall, the results indicate that calculation of oxygen activities with multivalence slag species such as Fe and Cr requires additional measurements to obtain accurate results.
