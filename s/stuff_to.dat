Stuffing can be standard polyester, wool, or cotton craft stuffing, but may be improvised from other materials. Wires, such as pipe cleaners or floral wire, {{may be used to}} make the doll posable.

25|$|The late Stephen Jay Gould {{was one of}} Knight’s most {{well-known}} fans, notably refusing to refer to Brontosaurus as “Apatosaurus” because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name. Gould writes in his 1989 book Wonderful Life, “Not since the Lord himself showed his <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day”.|$|E
25|$|Cali {{is governed}} by a mayor who is elected for a {{four-year}} term. Under the mayor, there are several administrative departments and secretaries. Mayor's elections started in 1986, followed by Governors' in 1992. Before these dates, all Colombian regional executive-branch leaders were appointed by the President himself. The first elected mayor was Carlos Holmes Trujillo of the Liberal Party. Unlike other Colombian cities, Cali has not properly adapted to the quite new Mayor's election system. The city has had some unsuccessful stories with some of its elected mayors, two of them being removed from office. Some argue this is caused by Aguablanca's huge mass population often driven to vote based in small short-termed gifts from populist candidates fully aware of this District needs. There were recorded cases of candidates giving bricks, cement and other <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> the District's leaders in exchange for shifting votes to their campaigns.|$|E
25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Starved {{generated}} controversy {{even before}} its premiere. A number of {{specialists in the}} treatment of eating disorders expressed concern that the program would either make light of or glamorize eating disorders. Others, however, felt that Starved might focus attention on eating disorders as a serious medical condition. The National Eating Disorders Association called for a boycott of the show and claimed that Diageo (makers of Tanqueray) and Nautilus agreed to pull their advertising. Schaeffer responded to the controversy, saying [...] "there is some difficult <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> watch. But I know my spirit and intention are good." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Broderick {{compared}} {{some parts}} of the album specifically to Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? (1986), Rust in Peace, or Countdown to Extinction (1992), but also stated [...] "I've been likening it to a very diverse CD. It's not one of those ones that you'll put it on and every song sounds like the last one. It's got everything from anthems to more radio friendly <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> hard-hitting thrash and some cool, dark-sounding stuff." [...] In a later interview, Broderick again touted the sonic diversity of the album, noting that it is [...] "like a cut in time from each CD of the past Megadeth discography".|$|E
500|$|USA Today {{film critic}} Claudia Puig {{said that the}} story did [...] "warrant a {{full-length}} feature, thanks to a clever plot and non-stop irreverent humor". Patrick Kolan believed that the film was [...] "easily the best <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> come [...] since season 12 or 13" [...] and praised the animation, but {{also said that the}} appearances of characters such as Comic Book Guy and Seymour Skinner were [...] "small and unfunny". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's good nature, stating that the laughs [...] "come in all sizes", but also noted that, [...] "little has been gained bringing the Simpsons to the screen." ...|$|E
500|$|De Fratus {{attended}} Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard, California, {{from which}} he graduated in 2005; he was {{a fan of the}} Los Angeles Dodgers. His high school coach, David Soliz, asserted that he could pitch in the major leagues for a long time, saying, [...] "He definitely has the <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> pitch in the majors. Justin has the stuff, but he also has the confidence. The odds were against him being drafted in the 11th round out of Ventura College." [...] De Fratus was the first Rio Mesa player to reach the majors during Soliz's tenure. He went on to attend Ventura College where, like at Rio Mesa, he was a starting pitcher.|$|E

50|$|More recently, {{for ease}} of production, pimientos are often puréed then formed into tiny strips, {{with the help of}} a natural gum (such as sodium {{alginate}} or guar gum). This allows olive <b>stuffing</b> <b>to</b> be mechanized, speeding the process and lowering production costs.|$|R

500|$|The term [...] "pink slime", a {{reference}} to the product's [...] "distinctive look", was coined in 2002 by Zirnstein in an internal FSIS e-mail. Expressing concern that ammonia should be mentioned on the labels of packaged ground beef to which the treated trimmings are added, Zirnstein stated [...] "I do not consider the <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> be ground beef, and I consider allowing it in ground beef to be a form of fraudulent labeling". He later stated that his main concern was that connective tissue is not [...] "meat", and that ground beef to which the product had been added should not be called ground beef, since it is not nutritionally equivalent to regular ground beef.|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without {{answering}} the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, [...] "Dammit, children, why do I {{always have to be}} the one to explain all this <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when he wound up having to dramatize the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at work here. Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E
500|$|Asimov wrote: [...] "A {{number of}} writers wrote pseudoscientific <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> ensure sales to Campbell, but the best writers retreated, I among them...." [...] Elsewhere Asimov went on to further explain, [...] "Campbell championed far-out ideas... He pained very {{many of the men}} he had trained (including me) in doing so, but felt it was his duty to stir up the minds of his readers and force curiosity right out to the border lines. He began a series of editorials... in which he championed a social point of view that could {{sometimes}} be described as far right (he expressed sympathy for George Wallace in the 1968 national election, for instance). [...] There was bitter opposition to this from many (including me – I could hardly ever read a Campbell editorial and keep my temper)." ...|$|E
500|$|Freelance writers Kenneth Biller and Chris Brancato {{pitched the}} idea for this episode to series creator Chris Carter under the title of [...] "The Girls from Greenwich", with the focus being on genetic {{experiments}} conducted on sets of twins. Brancato said the duo decided to do [...] "an X-File with a genetics experiment gone awry" [...] inspired by The Boys from Brazil, where Nazi scientists create clones of Adolf Hitler, while finding [...] "our own themes and characterizations to explore", such as commenting on human condition similarly to The Twilight Zone. The characters of Teena and Cindy were named after the wives of Glen Morgan and James Wong, who rewrote the original script prior to filming. [...] "Eve" [...] was the only episode of The X-Files to be directed by Fred Gerber, who Carter felt [...] "brought some interesting <b>stuff</b> <b>to</b> it".|$|E
