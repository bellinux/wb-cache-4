The respiratory epithelium develops from the primitive foregut endoderm {{as a result of}} inductive morphogenetic interactions with the surrounding visceral mesoderm. Following dissociation of the explanted fetal lung into single cells, these morphogenetic signalling pathways instruct reconstitution of the developing lung according to a process known as organotypic regeneration. Data presented here demonstrate that such fetal lung morphogenetic cues induce MESC derivatives to incorporate into the reforming pseudoglandular-like tubular ducts, display pan-keratin and surfactant protein C (<b>Sftpc)</b> immunoreactivity and express <b>Sftpc</b> transcripts while displaying a normal diploid karyotype in co-culture.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Interstitial pneumonias have {{recently}} been associated with mutations in the gene encoding surfactant protein C (<b>SFTPC).</b> In particular, <b>SFTPC</b> mutations {{have been reported in}} a number of familial forms of pulmonary fibrosis and in infants with interstitial lung diseases. The present study searched for <b>SFTPC</b> mutations in adult patients with sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In total, 35 adult patients with sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and 50 healthy subjects were investigated for <b>SFTPC</b> mutations by direct DNA sequencing. Of the patients with sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 25 suffered from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 10 patients from nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Only two frequent nonsynonymous variants, T 138 N and S 186 N, were detected. Allele frequencies of both variations as well as of other identified noncoding alterations did not differ significantly between the diverse patient groups and control subjects. In conclusion, mutations in the gene encoding surfactant protein C are not common in sporadic cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, suggesting that the mutated gene does not {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of these forms of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia...|$|E

Patients and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included 15 children (7 females and 8 males) with <b>SFTPC</b> mutations. HRCT scans have been performed in all the children and lung biopsies in 8 children. Results From all signs assessed on initial HRCT scans, ground-glass opacities (n= 14, 93 %) and lung cysts (n= 6, 40 %) were predominant. Interlobular septal thickening (n= 1, 7 %), air space consolidation (n= 1, 7 %), paraseptal emphysema (n= 2, 13 %), and pulmonary nodules (n= 1, 7 %) were also found. Histological analysis revealed accumulation of macrophages in the alveolar lumen, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and alveolar septal thickening. Dilatation of the respiratory bronchiole and alveolar duct associated with muscular hyperplasia were also described. Interestingly, lung cysts on HRCT scans were associated with dilatation of terminal bronchioli and alveolar duct in lung biopsies. Conclusion In children with <b>SFTPC</b> mutations, HRCT scan finding were highly correlated to the histological findings and, as such, represent a useful tool to identify patients that may require <b>SFTPC</b> gene sequencing...|$|E

Genomic DNA from the individual and two daughters (aged 39 and 43 years) was sequenced for the I 73 T mutation and variations in ATP-binding cassette A 3 (ABCA 3). All three had the I 73 T <b>SFTPC</b> mutation. The father and one daughter (aged 39 years) also had a transversion encoding an Asp 123 Asn (D 123 N) substitution in ABCA 3. The daughters were evaluated by pulmonary function testing and high-resolution CT (HRCT). Neither daughter had evidence of disease, except for focal subpleural septal thickening on HRCT scan in one daughter (aged 39 years). This daughter underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies revealing interstitial fibrotic remodeling.

We tested whether ER stress causes or exacerbates lung fibrosis by (i) conditional expression of a mutant form of surfactant protein C (L 188 Q <b>SFTPC)</b> found in familial interstitial pneumonia and (ii) intratracheal treatment with the protein misfolding agent tunicamycin. We developed transgenic mice expressing L 188 Q <b>SFTPC</b> exclusively in type II alveolar epithelium by using the Tet-On system. Expression of L 188 Q <b>SFTPC</b> induced ER stress, as determined by increased expression of heavy-chain Ig binding protein (BiP) and splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP 1) mRNA, but no lung fibrosis was identified {{in the absence of a}} second profibrotic stimulus. After intratracheal bleomycin, L 188 Q SFTPC-expressing mice developed exaggerated lung fibrosis and reduced static lung compliance compared with controls. Bleomycin-treated L 188 Q <b>SFTPC</b> mice also demonstrated increased apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells and greater numbers of fibroblasts in the lungs. With a complementary model, intratracheal tunicamycin treatment failed to induce lung remodeling yet resulted in augmentation of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. These data support the concept that ER stress produces a dysfunctional epithelial cell phenotype that facilitates fibrotic remodeling. ER stress pathways may serve as important therapeutic targets in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDominant {{mutations}} in the surfactant protein-C(SFTPC) gene {{have been linked}} with interstitial lung disease. The frequency of lung disease due to <b>SFTPC</b> {{mutations in}} the general population is unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify novel <b>SFTPC</b> mutations that are associated with lung function or disease {{in the general population}}. We resequenced the <b>SFTPC</b> gene in 760 individuals and identified 18 genetic variants, of which 5 were novel. Of the five novel mutations, two were situated in highly conserved areas of the <b>SFTPC</b> gene: A 53 T and Y 106 X. We genotyped the Copenhagen City Heart Study(n= 10, 604) and the Copenhagen General Population Study(n= 37, 337) to assess the clinical relevance of these mutations. Genotyping identified 36 individuals heterozygous for A 53 T and 3 individuals heterozygous for Y 106 X. A 53 T heterozygotes and Y 106 X heterozygotes did not differ from non-carriers in FEV 1 % predicted, FVC% predicted or FEV 1 /FVC. A 53 T heterozygotes had a two-fold increased risk for asthma in the Copenhagen City Heart Study and Copenhagen General Population Study combined (adjusted odds ratio 2. 2 (1. 0 – 4. 9)). A 53 T heterozygotes did not differ consistently from non-carriers in risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease. No Y 106 X heterozygotes suffered from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or interstitial lung disease. We identified two novel mutations in highly conserved areas of the <b>SFTPC</b> gene, and show that heterozygotes for the mutations have normal lung function and are unaffected by COPD and interstitial lung disease. A 53 T heterozygotes had increased asthma risk, but further research is required to conclusively determine whether this mutation is associated with asthma...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genetic {{variations}} {{associated with}} {{interstitial lung diseases}} (ILD) have not been extensively studied in Japanese infants. METHODS: Forty-three infants with unexplained lung dysfunction were studied. All 43, 22, and 17 infants underwent analyses of surfactant protein (SP) -C gene (<b>SFTPC)</b> and ATP-binding cassette A 3 gene (ABCA 3), SP-B gene (SFTPB), and SP-B western blotting, respectively. Two and four underwent assessment of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulating phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription- 5 (pSTAT- 5) and analyses of FOXF 1 gene (FOXF 1), respectively. RESULTS: ILD were diagnosed clinically in nine infants: four, three, and two had interstitial pneumonitis, hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP), and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV), respectively. Genetic variations considered responsible were detected in six (67 %) of the nine infants with ILD: three with hPAP (<b>SFTPC</b> p. Leu 45 Arg and p. Gln 145 fs, and ABCA 3 p. Arg 1583 Trp/p.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify new molecular markers for tumor cells in regional lymph nodes (LNs) and peripheral blood (PB) from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Candidate markers were selected based on digital transcript profiling and previous literature. KRT 19, CEACAM 5, EPCAM, DSG 3, SFTPA, <b>SFTPC</b> and SFTPB mRNA levels were initially validated by real-time reverse transcription PCR-based quantification in 16 NSCLC tumors and 22 LNs and 12 PB samples from individuals without known cancer. Five of the candidate markers were selected for secondary validation by quantification in parallel tumor biopsies, regional LNs and PB samples from 55 patients undergoing surgery for NSCLC. LN and PB marker status were compared to clinicopathological patient data. All selected markers except DSG 3 were present at high levels in the primary tumors and at very low or non-detectable levels in normal LNs and PB in the first round of validation, indicating a potential for detecting tumor cells in NSCLC patients.

40|$|AbstractELF 5, an Ets family {{transcription}} factor found exclusively in epithelial cells, {{is expressed in}} the distal lung epithelium during embryogenesis, then becomes restricted to proximal airways {{at the end of}} gestation and postnatally. To test the hypothesis that ELF 5 represses distal epithelial differentiation, we generated a transgenic mouse model in which a doxycycline inducible HA-tagged mouse Elf 5 transgene was placed {{under the control of the}} lung epithelium-specific human <b>SFTPC</b> promoter. We found that expressing high levels of ELF 5 during early lung development disrupted branching morphogenesis and produced a dilated epithelium. The effects of ELF 5 on morphogenesis were stage-dependent, since inducing the transgene on E 16. 5 had no effect on branching. ELF 5 reduced expression of the distal lung epithelial differentiation markers Erm, Napsa and <b>Sftpc,</b> and type II cell ultrastructural differentiation was immature. ELF 5 overexpression did not induce the proximal airway epithelial markers Ccsp and Foxj 1, but did induce expression of p 63, a marker of basal cells in the trachea and esophagus. High ELF 5 levels also induced the expression of genes found in other endodermal epithelia but not normally associated with the lung. These results suggest that precise levels of ELF 5 regulate the specification and differentiation of epithelial cells in the lung...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicroarray {{experiments}} {{designed to}} identify genes differentially {{expressed in the}} E 11. 5 lung and trachea showed that melanoma inhibitory activity (Mia 1) was expressed only in the lung. Mia 1 was abundantly expressed during early lung development, but was virtually absent {{by the end of}} gestation. Distal embryonic lung epithelium showed high levels of Mia 1 expression, which was suppressed by treatment with either retinoic acid or the FGF signaling antagonist SU 5402. Late-gestation fetuses in which lung epithelial hyperplasia was induced by misexpression of FGF 7 or FGF 10 showed continued expression of Mia 1 in areas of aberrant morphogenesis. Mia 1 expression was also significantly increased in urethane-induced lung adenomas. Treatment of E 18. 5 lung explants with exogenous MIA caused significant reductions in the expression of the lung differentiation markers Sftpa, Sftpb, <b>Sftpc,</b> and Abca 3. Bitransgenic mice expressing MIA {{under the control of the}} <b>SFTPC</b> promoter after E 16. 5, the age when Mia 1 is normally silenced, died from respiratory failure at birth with morphologically immature lungs associated with reduced levels of saturated phosphatidylcholine and mature SP-B. Microarray analysis showed significant reductions in the expression of Sftpa, Sftpb, Abca 3, Aqp 5, Lzp-s, Scd 2, and Aytl 2 in lungs misexpressing MIA. These results suggest that the silencing of Mia 1 that occurs in late gestation may be required for maturation of the surfactant system...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} relationships amongst tracheal and alveolar {{epithelial cells}} during lung development, we used conditional systems {{controlled by the}} rat CCSP and human <b>SFTPC</b> gene promoters to express Cre-recombinase in the developing mouse lung, thereby permanently labeling cells by expression of alkaline phosphatase or green fluorescent protein. When controlled by the rat CCSP promoter, continuous exposure of the fetus to doxycycline caused widespread recombination in conducting airway epithelial cells, including cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles before birth, and in both conducting and peripheral airways after birth. Neuroepithelial cells, identified by CGRP staining, were never labeled. Recombination and permanent labeling were observed in both ciliated and nonciliated respiratory epithelial cells, demonstrating their derivation from common progenitor cells during lung morphogenesis. Remarkable dorsal–ventral and cephalo–caudal labeling patterns, established before birth, were identified by recombination controlled by the rat CCSP gene promoter. In the trachea, subsets of epithelial cells labeled by the CCSP promoter were organized horizontally along the dorsal–ventral axis of the trachea, where selective labeling of cells juxtaposed to tracheal and bronchial cartilage was observed. In sharp contrast, recombination controlled by the human <b>SFTPC</b> gene promoter identified related cells that were organized in linear patterns along the cephalo–caudal axis of the conducting airways. Conditional expression of Cre-recombinase in the respiratory epithelium provides a useful model {{for the study of}} gene expression and function in the mouse respiratory tract and in the lung...|$|E
40|$|Monoallelic {{mutations}} of the Surfactant Protein C gene (<b>SFTPC)</b> {{are associated}} with Interstitial Lung Disease in children.

40|$|Abstract: Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{develops in}} preterm infants {{due to a}} combination of lung immaturity and lung injury. Cultured pluripotent bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) are known to reduce injury and induce repair in adult and in immature lungs, possibly through paracrine secretion of soluble factors. The paracrine relationship between BMSC and primary fetal lung epithelial type II cells is unknown. We determined the effects of BMSC on type II cell and fibroblast behavior using an in vitro co-culture model. Rat BMSC were isolated and co-cultured with primary fetal E 21 rat type II cells or lung fibroblasts in a Transwell system without direct cell contact. Effects of BMSC conditioned media (CM) on type II cell and fibroblast proliferation and on type II cell surfactant phospholipid (DSPC) synthesis and mRNA expression of surfactant proteins B and C (sftpb and <b>sftpc)</b> were studied. We also determined the effect of fibroblast and type II cell CM on BMSC proliferation and surface marker expression. Co-culture with BMSC significantly decreased type II cell and fibroblast proliferation to 72. 5 % and 83. 7 % of controls, respectively. Type II cell DSPC synthesis was significantly increased by 21 % and sftpb and <b>sftpc</b> mRNA expressions were significantly induced (2. 1 fold and 2. 4 fold, respectively). BMSC proliferation was significantly reduced during the co-culture. Flow cytometry confirmed that BMSC retained the expression of undifferentiated stem cell markers despite their exposure to fetal lung cell CM. We conclude that BMSC induce fetal type II cell differentiation through paracrine release of soluble factors. These studies provid...|$|E

Given that familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) and RA-ILD frequently share the usual pattern of interstitial pneumonia and common environmental risk factors, we hypothesised that the two diseases might share additional risk factors, including FPF-linked genes. Our aim was to identify coding mutations of FPF-risk genes associated with RA-ILD. We used whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by restricted analysis of a discrete number of FPF-linked genes and performed a burden test to assess the excess number of mutations in RA-ILD patients compared to controls. Among the 101 RA-ILD patients included, 12 (11. 9 %) had 13 WES-identified heterozygous mutations in the TERT, RTEL 1, PARN or <b>SFTPC</b> coding regions. The burden test, based on 81 RA-ILD patients and 1010 controls of European ancestry, revealed an excess of TERT, RTEL 1, PARN or <b>SFTPC</b> mutations in RA-ILD patients (OR 3. 17, 95 % CI 1. 53 - 6. 12; p= 9. 45 x 10 - 4).

40|$|Abstract Background Heterozygous {{mutations}} of <b>SFTPC,</b> {{the gene}} encoding surfactant protein C (SP-C), cause sporadic and familial {{interstitial lung disease}} (ILD) in children and adults. The most frequent <b>SFTPC</b> mutation in ILD patients leads to a threonine for isoleucine substitution at position 73 (I 73 T) of the SP-C preprotein (proSP-C), however {{little is known about}} the cellular consequences of SP-C I 73 T expression. Results To address this, we stably expressed SP-C I 73 T in cultured MLE- 12 alveolar epithelial cells. This resulted in increased intracellular accumulation of proSP-C processing intermediates, which matched proSP-C species recovered in bronchial lavage fluid from patients with this mutation. Exposure of SP-C I 73 T cells to drugs currently used empirically in ILD therapy, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine or methylprednisolone, enhanced expression of the chaperones HSP 90, HSP 70, calreticulin and calnexin. SP-C I 73 T mutants had decreased intracellular phosphatidylcholine level (PC) and increased lyso-PC level without appreciable changes of other phospholipids. Treatment with methylprednisolone or hydroxychloroquine partially restored these lipid alterations. Furthermore, SP-C I 73 T cells secreted into the medium soluble factors that modulated surface expression of CCR 2 or CXCR 1 receptors on CD 4 + lymphocytes and neutrophils, suggesting a direct paracrine influence of SP-C I 73 T on neighboring cells in the alveolar space. Conclusion We show that I 73 T mutation leads to impaired processing of proSP-C in alveolar type II cells, alters their stress tolerance and surfactant lipid composition, and activates cells of the immune system. In addition, we show that some of the mentioned cellular aspects behind the disease can be modulated by application of pharmaceutical drugs commonly applied in the ILD therapy. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Nuclear factor I (NFI) {{transcription}} factor family {{consists of four}} genes (Nfia, Nfib, Nfic and Nfix) that regulate the development of multiple organ systems in mice and humans. Nfib is expressed in both lung mesenchyme and epithelium and mice lacking Nfib have severe lung maturation defects and die at birth. Here we continue our analysis of the phenotype of Nfib−/− lungs and show that Nfib specifically in lung mesenchyme controls late epithelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation. There are more PCNA, BrdU, PHH 3 and Ki 67 positive cells in Nfib−/− lungs than in wild type lungs at E 18. 5 and this increase in proliferation marker expression is seen in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The loss of Nfib in all lung cells decreases the expression of markers for alveolar epithelial cells (Aqp 5 and <b>Sftpc),</b> Clara cells (Scgb 1 a 1) and ciliated cells (Foxj 1) in E 18. 5 lungs. To test for a specific role of Nfib in lung mesenchyme we generated and analyzed Nfibflox/flox, Dermo 1 -Cre mice. Loss of Nfib only in mesenchyme results in decreased Aqp 5, <b>Sftpc</b> and Foxj 1 expression, increased cell proliferation, and a defect in sacculation similar to that seen in Nfib−/− mice. In contrast, mesenchyme specific loss of Nfib {{had no effect on}} the expression of Scgb 1 a 1 in the airway. Microarray and QPCR analyses indicate that the loss of Nfib in lung mesenchyme affects the expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and FGF signaling which could affect distal lung maturation. Our data indicate that mesenchymal Nfib regulates both mesenchymal and epithelial cell proliferation through multiple pathways and that mesenchymal NFI-B-mediated signals are essential for the maturation of distal lung epithelium...|$|E

40|$|SummaryTo {{directly}} {{test the}} contribution of Scgb 1 a 1 + Clara cells to postnatal growth, homeostasis, and repair of lung epithelium, we generated a Scgb 1 a 1 -CreERTM “knockin” mouse for lineage-tracing these cells. Under all conditions tested, the majority of Clara cells in the bronchioles both self-renews and generates ciliated cells. In the trachea, Clara cells give rise to ciliated cells but do not self-renew extensively. Nevertheless, they can contribute to tracheal repair. In the postnatal mouse lung, it has been proposed that bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) which coexpress Scgb 1 a 1 (Secretoglobin 1 a 1) and <b>SftpC</b> (Surfactant Protein C), contribute descendants to both bronchioles and alveoli. The putative BASCs were lineage labeled in our studies. However, we find no evidence for the function of a special BASC population during postnatal growth, adult homeostasis, or repair. Rather, our results support a model in which the trachea, bronchioles, and alveoli are maintained by distinct populations of epithelial progenitor cells...|$|E
