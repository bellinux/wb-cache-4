50|$|Therapeutically, {{electromotive}} {{drug administration}} (EMDA) delivers a medicine or other chemical through the skin. In {{a manner of}} speaking, it is an injection without a needle, and may be described as non-invasive. It is different from dermal patches, which do not rely on an electric field. It drives a charged substance, usually a medication or bioactive agent, transdermally by repulsive electromotive force, through the skin. A small electric current is applied to an iontophoretic chamber placed on the skin, containing a charged active agent and its <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Another chamber or a skin electrode carries the return current. One or two chambers are filled with a solution containing an active ingredient and its <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The positively charged chamber, called the anode, will repel a positively charged chemical species, whereas the negatively charged chamber, called the cathode, will repel a negatively charged species into the skin.|$|E

In absence of laboratory tests (such as elevated serum total tryptase or/and plasma histamine levels). Distinguishing between anaphylaxis and acute infusion reactions is impossible since their symptoms are identical. Few Paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions described in literature are documented {{in the absence of}} standardized tests to chemotherapeutics drugs and since not all suspected patients undergo allergological tests. A 74 years old female patient, with history of Inobitriol induced laryngeal angioedema and right middle lobe NSCLC, developed a moderate anaphylactic reaction during Paclitaxel second administration. Infusion suspension and symptomatic treatments led to rapid symptoms remission. Prick tests to Paclitaxel were negatives but the intradermal reaction was positive, as well as basophile activation test. The mechanism of paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity reaction is uncertain and its <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> may be involved; in case of paclitaxel immediate hypersensitivity reaction, we recommend tryptase and/or histamine serum levels quantification to confirm the acute anaphylaxis episode and realization of allergologicals tests to Paclitaxel and its <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> (skin tests ± challenge test) 3 to 4 weeks after the incident.

40|$|Purpose. In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the relationship between solvent uptake into a model membrane (silicone) with the physical properties of the solvents (e. g., solubility parameter, melting point, molecular weight) and its potential predictability. We then assessed the subsequent topical penetration and retention kinetics of hydrocortisone from various solvents to define whether modifications to either solute diffusivity or partitioning were dominant in increasing permeability through solvent-modified membranes. Methods. Membrane sorption of solvents was determined from weight differences following immersion in individual solvents, corrected for differences in density. Permeability and retention kinetics of H- 3 -hydrocortisone, applied as saturated solutions in the various solvents, were determined over 48 h in horizontal Franz-type glass diffusion cells. Results. Solvent sorption into the membrane could be related to differences in solubility parameters, MW and hydrogen bonding (r(2) = 0. 76). The actual and predicted volume of solvent sorbed into the membrane was also found to be linearly related to Log hydrocortisone flux, with changes in both diffusivity and partitioning of hydrocortisone observed for the different <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Conclusions. A simple structure-based predictive model {{can be applied to the}} sorption of solvents into silicone membranes. Changes in solute diffusivity and partitioning appeared to contribute to the increased hydrocortisone flux observed with the various <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The application of this predictive model to the more complex skin membrane remains to be determined...|$|R

This study investigated whether endogenously elevated bilirubin would protect against adenine-induced kidney damage in male hyperbilirubinaemic Gunn rats and littermate controls. Animals were orally administered adenine or methylcellulose <b>solvent</b> (<b>vehicle)</b> daily for 10 days and were then monitored for 28 days. Serum and urine were assessed throughout the protocol for parameters of kidney function and antioxidant/oxidative stress status and kidneys were harvested for histological examination upon completion of the study. Adenine-treated animals experienced weight-loss, polyuria and polydipsia; however, these effects were significantly attenuated in adenine-treated Gunn rats. No difference in the presence of dihydroadenine crystals, lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis were noted in Gunn rat kidneys versus controls. However, plasma protein carbonyl and F- 2 -isoprostane concentrations were significantly decreased in Gunn rats versus controls, with no change in urinary 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 22 ̆ 7 -deoxyguanosine or kidney tissue F- 2 -isoprostane concentrations. These data indicated that endogenously elevated bilirubin specifically protects from systemic oxidative stress in the vascular compartment.

We conducted a phase I/II dose escalation study of DTI- 015 in 40 heavily pretreated patients with inoperable recurrent malignant glioma. The study goals were to establish a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) for DTI- 015 and assess its safety and activity. Patients received stereotactic intratumoral injection of DTI- 015 under magnetic resonance imaging guidance. Dose escalation was performed in two phases. First, DTI- 015 volume was escalated at a set BCNU concentration of 12. 5 mg/ml; second, BCNU mg dose was escalated by increasing BCNU concentration to 30, 45, 60, and 75 mg/ml. A MTD of 5 ml and 240 mg was established. Twenty-five of 28 DTI- 015 treatments (89 %) using ≤MTD were administered safely without producing high-grade drug-related adverse events. Median survival for GBM patients administered DTI- 015 at ≤MTD was 55 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated stable disease in 72 % of evaluable patients with a median of 10. 5 weeks.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether local delivery of paclitaxel, which inhibits cell proliferation by overstabilization of microtubules, prevents PC in a rat model. Methods. PC was induced by introducing a fine nylon thread into the bile duct in a rat. Paclitaxel (100 μl of 10, 100, and 1000 μmol/l or <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> was administered into the bile duct for 15 min. One week after treatment, histopathologic examination and 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of the bile duct were performed. Results. In comparison with the control, the mean thickness of the bile duct was reduced by 29 % in the 1000 μmol/l paclitaxel-treated group (2. 61 ± 0. 31 μm vs 3. 67 ± 0. 25 μm, P < 0. 05). The luminal area increased (P < 0. 0001) and the grade of epithelial-glandular proliferation was decreased (P < 0. 01) as the dose of paclitaxel increased. Ductal fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were similar in both groups. The BrdU labeling index was significantly lower in the paclitaxel-treated group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions. Local delivery of paclitaxel suppressed PC in a rat model by the inhibition of epithelial-glandular proliferation and may offer an effective therapeutic option for biliary stricture. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The amount of dopamine released during 1 h into hypophysial portal blood of vehicle-treated rats represented 18 % of the amount of DOPA that accumulated in 1 h in the median eminence of rats treated with NSD 1015. The reduction in the concentration of dopamine in the plasma of blood from a single hypophysial portal vessel after the inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase activity {{was associated with a}} concomitant increase in the concentration of PRL in the plasma of arterial blood.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of topical allergy screening systems {{relies on the}} ability of test agents to effectively penetrate the stratum corneum from applied vehicles and reach the viable cells involved in the cutaneous immune response system. There is very little evidence in the dermatologic literature to justify the choice and suitability of vehicles used in many allergy test systems and the effectiveness of occlusion, reported to have variable effects on solute penetration, often employed in combination with these systems. In this study we evaluated the in vitro human epidermal penetration of a mixture of paraben ester preservatives from a commercially available test ointment and two commonly employed <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicles</b> (acetone and ethanol), together with the effect of occlusion on the rate of delivery from these systems. Parabens were applied as finite doses (5 [*]mg per cm 2) to epidermal membranes mounted in horizontal Franz-type diffusion cells. At intervals of 2 [*]h for a total of 10 [*]h the receptor phase (20 % ethanol in distilled water) was completely removed and replaced. Occlusion was effected by the placement of a piece of high density polyethylene (20 [*]μm) over the application site immediately after dosing. Concen- trations of parabens in receptor fluid and remaining in the epidermis {{at the end of the}} study were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There was a significant change in the epidermal flux of parabens from each of the vehicles following occlusion. Whereas increases were observed for the acetone and ethanol vehicles a decrease was seen following occlusion of the ointment formulation. Changes in flux appeared to result from a significant decrease in the epidermal partitioning of the esters following occlusion of the ointment and primarily by an increase in paraben epidermal diffusivity (estimated from changes in flux/retention) following occlusion of the <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These studies show that the effects of occlusion are strongly vehicle dependent, having wide implications for optimization of this technique with a range of topically applied solutes...|$|R

We conducted 2 separate studies {{to examine the}} effects of in vitro Echinacea stimulation on the immune responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from athletes during preseason training. College-level male competitive athletes from 2 sports (wrestling and soccer) participated in the studies. PBMCs were isolated from blood sampled either pre- or post-practice, standardized to the same concentration, and then stimulated with extracts from Echinacea pallida, Echinacea simulata, or <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> control. Cytokine production (TNF, IL-Ib, IL-I 0, and IFN-g) was measured from super-natants collected between 24 - 72 hrs contingent on the specific cytokine; proliferation was assessed at 72 hrs. Extracts were phytochemically profiled by high pressure liquid chromatography to quantify known bioactive compounds including alkamides and caffeic acid derivatives. Results differed between the wrestlers and soccer players. In general, E. simulata was a more potent immunomodulator than E. pallida in both studies. Following exercise, PBMC production of TNF, IL-l 0, and IFN-g production either decreased or was unaffected. IL-lb levels showed no change in either study. PBMC proliferation increased in the wrestlers as a result of training, but decreased in the soccer players.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Platelets during storage undergo diverse {{alterations}} collectively {{known as}} the platelet storage lesion, including metabolic, morphological, functional and structural changes. Some changes correlate with activation of p 38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK). Another MAPK, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), is involved in PLT activation. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the properties of platelets stored in plasma in the presence or absence of p 38 and ERK MAPK inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single Trima apheresis platelet unit (n =  12) was aliquoted into five CLX storage bags. Two aliquots were continuously agitated with or without MAPK inhibitors. Two aliquots were subjected to 48 hours of interruption of agitation with or without MAPK inhibitors. One aliquot contained the same amount of <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> used to deliver the inhibitor. Platelets were stored at 20 - 24 °C for 7 days and sampled on Days 1, 4, and 7 for 18 in vitro parameters. RESULTS: Inhibition of p 38 MAPK by VX- 702 leads to better maintenance of all platelet in vitro storage parameters including platelet mitochondrial function. Accelerated by interruption of agitation, the platelet storage lesion of units stored with VX- 702 was diminished to that of platelets stored with continuous agitation. Inhibition of ERK MAPK did not ameliorate decrements in any in vitro platelet properties. CONCLUSION: Signaling through p 38 MAPK, but not ERK, is associated with platelet deterioration during storage...|$|E

In this study, we used Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to explore the effects of a parental exposure to diuron, a herbicide frequently detected in marine coastal environments. The present toxicogenomic study provides evidence that exposure of oyster genitors to diuron during gametogenesis results in changes in offspring, namely, transcriptomic profile alterations, increased global DNA methylation levels and reduced growth and survival within the first year of life. Importantly, we highlighted the limitations to identify particular genes or gene expression signatures that could serve as biomarkers for parental herbicide-exposure and further for multigenerational and transgenerational effects of specific chemical stressors. By analyzing samples from two independent experiments, we demonstrated that, due to complex confounding effects with both tested <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicles,</b> diuron non-specifically affected the offspring transcriptome. These original results question the potential development of predictive genomic tools for detecting specific indirect impacts of contaminants in environmental risk assessments.

The contour patterns are compared with the experimental, data using the variance and lack of fit, starting with the Scheffe linear model and building up to the full cubic model including the covariate terms. The fitted model provides information needed to predict optimum formulations, i. e., initial viscosity of less than 100 cP, but yielding rheological profiles commensurate with high degrees of substantivity when diluted with water.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The goal of {{this study}} was to further {{investigate}} the role of endogenous APGWamide levels in imposex induction in snails. APGWamide is a common neurotransmittor/neuromodulator peptide found in many species of molluscs, and is often related to sex organ growth or reproductive behavior. Mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta) were collected from the Rachel Carson Estuarine Reserve near Beaufort, NC, and were dosed with the environmental contaminant tributyltin (TBT), testosterone (T), or <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> (EtOH/ saline) controls. Both TBT and T have been shown previously to induce female snails to grow penises (a condition termed imposex), and to increase male penis size. Male normalized penis length was correlated to endogenous APGWamide levels (as measured by Western blotting of whole animal homogenates, r 2 5 0. 475), and control males had significantly higher APGWamide levels than control females. All TBT-treated animals, (male, female, and imposex) had levels of APGWamide similar to control males and significantly higher than control females. In testosterone treated animals, APGWamide levels were the same as controls and it is likely that testosterone interferes with a downstream signaling event to induce imposex. In addition, immunohistochemistry for APGWamide expression in abdominal areas was done on female, male and im-posex snails collected from the wild. The pattern of APGWamide in imposex snails was similar to male snails, showing large patches of immuno-reactive areas in the top portion of the visceral mass. In female snails, no areas of cross-reactivity were found...|$|E

The intravenous form includes the <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium which shows an impaired clearance under intermittent dialysis therapy. This investigation aimed to determine first clinical data on sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium blood levels to verify the risk for accumulation. Methods In four patients suffering from renal insufficiency and intermittent dialysis therapy who needed a treatment with intravenous voriconazole as a reserve antifungal at the intensive care unit of the Mainz University Hospital the trough levels of voriconazole and sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium were measured. Results A 75 -year-old woman showed a maximal sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium plasma level of 145 μg/ml in the initial phase. After a few days renal function recovered and the plasma levels came down to less than 20 μg/ml. In contrast to this patient with a recovery of renal function the remaining three patients showed renal failure during the complete period of intravenous treatment with voriconazole. In these patients an accumulation of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium plasma levels was determined with a maximum of 523 μg/ml in a 18 -year-old man, 409 μg/ml in a 57 -year-old man, and 581 μg/ml in a 47 -year-old man. Conclusion The present data indicate an accumulation of sulphobutylether beta cyclodextrin sodium in patients treated with intravenous voriconazole and dialysis therapy. Fortunately, no toxic effects were observed, although the accumulated dose values were lower but comparable with those used in previous toxicity studies with animals. </p...|$|E
50|$|Stain is {{composed}} of the same three primary ingredients as paint (pigment, <b>solvent</b> (or <b>vehicle),</b> and binder) but is predominantly vehicle, then pigment and/or dye, and lastly {{a small amount of}} binder. Much like the dyeing or staining of fabric, wood stain is designed to add color to the substrate (wood and other materials) while leaving some of the substrate still visible. Transparent varnishes or surface films are applied afterwards. In principle, stains do not provide a durable surface coating or film. However, because the binders are from the same class of film-forming binders that are used in paints and varnishes, some build-up of film occurs.|$|R
40|$|Of {{the various}} glycols studied thus far, {{propylene}} glycol {{is the only}} one which is relatively non-toxic, and therefore useful as a <b>solvent</b> and <b>vehicle</b> for medicinal and food agents (1, 2, 3). The isomer of propylene glycol has not been previously investigated and nothing is known about its actions or pos-sible toxicity. Since trimethylene glycol is isomeric with propylene glycol it was thought desirable to determine similarities in, or differences between, these two compounds. This report presents the results of such a study and shows that trimethylene glycol is entirely different pharmacologically from propylene glycol. PROPERTIES OF TRIMETHYLENE GLYCOL The chemical relationship between the propylene and trimethylene glycols is indicated by the following structural formulas...|$|R
40|$|In {{the method}} which Newburgh and Johnston (1, 2) have {{proposed}} for the calculation of water exchange, they define the latter as consisting of three components: 1, preexisting water from the external environment; 2, water formed de novo by the oxidation of food stuffs; 3, " preformed water. " This last term is applied to water which already existed as such in the tissues, presumably acting as a solvent for protoplasmic substances in the cells and as both <b>solvent</b> and <b>vehicle</b> in the circulating fluids and extracellular (or interstitial) fluids. This fluid or some fraction of it, they postulate, is intimately associated with protein, fat and carbohydrate (glycogen) in the tissues and is liberated when the latter are burned. Conversely it may be presumed that {{a fraction of the}} extraneous water becomes bound when the body content of these substances increases. It has been pointed out (3) in a simple analysis of the form of their mathematical calculations that it may be advisable, for certain purposes, at least, to distinguish this third fraction of water from the others because it belongs i...|$|R
40|$|Tomato {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} and agriculturally important Solanaceous species and vegetable crops, serving as a model for examination of fruit biology and compound leaf development. Cytokinin is a plant hormone linked to the control of leaf development and is known to regulate a wide range of genes including many transcription factors. Currently there is little known of the leaf transcriptome in tomato and how it might be regulated by cytokinin. We employ high throughput mRNA sequencing technology and bioinformatic methodologies to robustly analyze cytokinin regulated tomato leaf transcriptomes. Leaf samples of two ages, 13 d and 35 d were treated with cytokinin or the <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle</b> control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 2 h or 24 h, after which RNA was extracted for sequencing. To confirm the accuracy of RNA sequencing results, we performed qPCR analysis of select transcripts identified as cytokinin regulated by the RNA sequencing approach. The resulting data provide the first hormone transcriptome analysis of leaves in tomato. Specifically we identified several previously untested tomato orthologs of cytokinin-related genes as well as numerous novel cytokinin-regulated transcripts in tomato leaves. Principal component analysis of the data indicates that length of cytokinin treatment and plant age are the major factors responsible for changes in transcripts observed in this study. Two hour cytokinin treatment showed a more robust transcript response indicated by both greater fold change of induced transcripts and the induction of twice as many cytokinin-related genes involved in signaling, metabolism, and transport in young vs. olde...|$|E

Gelsemium sempervirens is used in homeopathy for treating patients with anxiety related symptoms, however {{there have been few}} experimental studies evaluating its pharmacological activity. We have investigated the effects of homeopathic doses of G. sempervirens on mice, using validated behavioral models. Centesimal (CH) dilutions/dynamizations of G. sempervirens, the reference drug diazepam (1 mg/kg body weight) or a placebo (<b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle)</b> were intraperitoneally delivered to groups of mice of CD 1 strain during 8 days, then the effects were assessed by the Light-Dark (LD) choice test and by the Open-Field (OF) exploration test, in a fully blind manner. In the LD test, the mean time spent in the illuminated area by control and placebo-treated animals was 15. 98 %, for mice treated with diazepam it increased to 19. 91 % (P =. 047), while with G. sempervirens 5 CH it was 18. 11 % (P =. 341, non-significant). The number of transitions between the two compartments increased with diazepam from 6. 19 to 9. 64 (P <. 001) but not with G. Sempervirens. In the OF test, G. sempervirens 5 CH significantly increased the time spent and the distance traveled in the central zone (P =. 009 and P =. 003, resp.), while diazepam had no effect on these OF test parameters.

40|$|The role {{of ovarian}} hormones {{in the control}} of the {{quantity}} and activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOHase) in neurites of the median eminence of the rat was investigated. TyrOHase was quantified by an immunoblot assay using purified rat TyrOHase as the standard. Treatment of ovariectomized animals with progesterone, but not estradiol, resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of TyrOHase in the median eminence. The in situ activity of the enzyme was assayed by measuring the rate of synthesis of L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), and the results were expressed as mol of dopa per hr per mol of TyrOHase. In animals treated with both estradiol and progesterone for 3 days, the in situ activity of TyrOHase in the median eminence was 114 +/- 13. 5 (mean +/- SEM) compared to 26 +/- 4. 7 for the controls. Estradiol or progesterone alone was much less effective than was the combination of estradiol and progesterone. To ascertain whether the effect of estradiol and progesterone on TyrOHase activity was reflected in the secretion of dopamine into hypophyseal portal blood, ovariectomized rats were treated for 3 days with both estradiol and progesterone or with the <b>solvent</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The concentration of dopamine in portal plasma of the hormone-treated animals was 1. 93 +/- 0. 533 ng/ml compared to 0. 34 +/- 0. 094 ng/ml in vehicle-treated animals. We conclude that the quantity and in situ molar activity of TyrOHase in neurites of the median eminence as well as the secretion of dopamine from these neurites are modulated by the combined action of estradiol and progesterone...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of sunscreens is often {{influenced by the}} solvents inwhich they are dissolved. In this regard, the ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of 13 UVA and UVB sunscreen chemicals were determined in 12 solvents ofvarying polarity and cosmetic interest. Changes inboth the wavelength of maximum absorbance (K max) and molar absorptivity () were observed {{for many of the}} sunscreen-solvent sys ems studied. Observed hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts in K max for a number of sunscreen chemicals were related to their structure and polarity. Polar solvents shifted the K max of polar sunscreens to shorter wavelengths (hypsochromic) andshifted less polar sunscreens to longer wavelengths (bathochromic). Ortho-substituted sunscreen chemicals, uch as salicylates and anthranilates xperienced a minimum or no UV absorbance shift. With the exception of PABA, most sunscreens showed increased absorbance in both polar and non-polar solvents and decreased absorbance in semi-polar solvents, such as hexylene glycol and C• 2 -C• 5 alcohols benzoate. The results of this study should aid the cosmetic chemist in selecting appropriate <b>solvents</b> and <b>vehicles</b> for sunscreen chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cyanobacteria {{can produce}} groups of {{structurally}} and functionally unrelated but highly potent toxins. Cyanotoxins {{are used in}} multiple research endeavours, either for direct investigation of their toxicologic properties, or as functional analogues for various biochemical and physiological processes. This paper presents occupational safety guidelines and recommendations for personnel working in field, laboratory or industrial settings to produce and use purified cyanotoxins and toxic cyanobacteria, from bulk harvesting of bloom material, mass culture of laboratory isolates, through routine extraction, isolation and purification. Oral, inhalational, dermal and parenteral routes are all potential occupational exposure pathways during the various stages of cyanotoxin production and application. Investigation of toxicologic or pharmacologic properties using in vivo models may present specific risks if radiolabelled cyanotoxins are employed, {{and the potential for}} occupational exposure via the dermal route is heightened with the use of organic <b>solvents</b> as <b>vehicles.</b> Inter- and intra-national transport of living cyanobacteria for research purposes risks establishing feral microalgal populations, so disinfection of culture equipment and destruction of cells by autoclaving, incineration and/or chlorination is recommended in order to prevent viable cyanobacteria from escaping research or production facilities. </p...|$|R
