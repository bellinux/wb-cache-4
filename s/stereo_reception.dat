5000|$|Very few [...] AM radio {{stations}} that broadcast with IBOC HD Radio {{during the day}} switch to C-QUAM AM Stereo during nighttime operation to reduce sideband digital (hash) interference and to provide long-range <b>stereo</b> <b>reception.</b> Many HD radio tuners have a limited ability to decode C-Quam stereo transmissions, (typically with lower bandwidth), and as a result, reduced audio quality than what could be expected from a specifically designed AMAX/C-QUAM only tuner. C-QUAM AM Stereo transmissions have the same range as AM Monural transmission, a key benefit.|$|E
5000|$|With about 50 {{stations}} {{using the}} technology and perhaps another 50 committed, a controversy emerged in 1989 when MIT professor and Bose Corporation CEO Amar Bose and Bose engineer William Short released a critical study, finding the system to {{have the potential to}} [...] "seriously degrade the quality of <b>stereo</b> <b>reception</b> whether received by FMX equipment or not." [...] According to the study, the heavy compression of the L&minus;R audio caused interference in receivers under multipath conditions. A BTP spokesman rebutted the finding, saying that the Bose analysis exaggerated a [...] "worst-case scenario", and actually employed [...] "flawed mathematics" [...] to attempt to prove their point. Perhaps not coincidentally, a patent application filed earlier by Bose disclosed an invention whose implementation was incompatible with the adoption of FMX, while another - filed by Bose and Short {{around the time of the}} release of the critical study - sought to improve the performance of FMX under multipath conditions.|$|E
50|$|The All-in-Wonder {{product line}} {{introduced}} in 1996, {{was the first}} combination of integrated graphics chip with TV tuner card and the first chip that enabled to display computer graphics on a TV set. The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analog video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and <b>stereo</b> TV audio <b>reception.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{efforts to}} {{transmit}} discrete four-channel quadraphonic music required {{the use of}} two FM stations; one transmitting the front audio channels, the other the rear channels. A breakthrough came in 1970 when KIOI (K-101) in San Francisco successfully transmitted true quadraphonic sound from a single FM station using the Quadraplex system under Special Temporary Authority from the FCC. Following this experiment, a long term test period was proposed that would permit one FM station {{in each of the}} top 25 U.S. radio markets to transmit in Quadraplex. The test results hopefully would prove to the FCC that the system was compatible with existing two-channel <b>stereo</b> transmission and <b>reception</b> and that it did not interfere with adjacent stations.|$|R
5000|$|All eight {{members of}} Stereo Kicks {{originally}} auditioned as soloists for series 11 of The X Factor, but were all rejected at the bootcamp stage. They were {{formed by the}} judges because they felt they were rejects that they could work with. The group first sang together at bootcamp within hours of being put together; they performed a cover of the Snow Patrol song [...] "Run". They received a standing ovation from all four judges with Simon {{saying that they were}} one of the best boybands they've ever had on the show. As a result, they got through straight to the judges' houses stage. At that stage they sang Justin Timberlake's [...] "Mirrors" [...] and later got sent to the live shows. The fans suggested names through the ITV website; they received over 46,000 entries. <b>Stereo</b> Kicks' <b>reception</b> has been very favourable with Simon Cowell himself saying: [...] "one of the best groups ever feature on the show", also they've been compared to be [...] "as good as One Direction" [...] by the public, and their performance of [...] "Run" [...] reached 1 million views on The X Factor Initially called the [...] "New Boy Band", they later held a poll on the website to determine a new name and [...] "Stereo Kicks" [...] was chosen.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, Selkirk Communications {{launched}} CJAZ at 92.1 FM in Vancouver, with an all-jazz music format, transmitting from Salt Spring Island at 100,000 watts. Although overall regional {{coverage was}} very good, poor <b>stereo</b> <b>reception</b> {{in the key}} Vancouver area led the station to change frequencies and transmitter site to 96.9 MHz and Mt Seymour in 1984, transmitting at 75,000 watts. Low ratings led to a format change on September 15, 1985, when the station adopted an urban adult contemporary format (the first in Canada), rebranded as FM 97 and the call sign was changed to CKKS-FM. This was followed {{about a year later}} by a switch to the [...] "adult contemporary music" [...] format and another on-air rebranding as [...] "97 Kiss FM". Four years later, the station was sold to Maclean-Hunter Ltd, and in 1994 it became a part of Rogers Broadcasting. The adult contemporary format would also arrive on CHQM-FM, which dropped its easy listening format in 1992, and surpassed CKKS as Vancouver's leading AC station, becoming Vancouver's most-listened-to FM station later on.|$|E
5000|$|Radio Dublin {{started in}} 1966 founded by Ken Sheehan, and peaked {{in the late}} 70s and up unto the early 80s until the arrival of Radio Nova and Sunshine radio whose professionalism and quality <b>stereo</b> <b>reception</b> left the station adrift in their wake in the {{subsequent}} years. Broadcasting on MW, SW and FM simultaneously. After Eamonn Cooke took over, Radio Dublin had ever increasing ambitions. It was the first radio station in the Republic of Ireland to complete a 24-hour broadcast, this {{on the occasion of}} the Irish general election of June 1977. The broadcast was hosted by Roland Burke and David Moore. The [...] "marathon" [...] broadcast over the following Christmas, of at least 185 hours was history in the making leading the way into really a new world of 1978. It was for many years accepted as just another radio station, with little being known about its lack of a licence. The station ceased full-time operation after the jailing of the station's then owner Eamonn Cooke for child sex offences which took place at the radio station, staff at the station destroyed much of the equipment in Inchicore [...] in anger at Cooke. Radio Dublin closed down in May 2003 and has never returned. Cooke died in June 2016.|$|E
