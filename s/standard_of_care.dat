40|$|This {{article is}} a {{follow-up}} on our previous work examining Canadian chiropractors’ attitudes towards chiropractic philosophy and scope of practice and their implications {{for the implementation of}} clinical practice guidelines. In this current study, we examined Canadian chiropractors’ attitudes toward <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> the organizations developing them and their relationship to the philosophy index. The findings indicated that there was no agreement about the definition <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> among chiropractors, although there was strong support for the concept. Most chiropractors preferred that chiropractic organizations set <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> - the strongest support was for the Canadian Chiropractic Association. Finally, we found differences among chiropractors’ attitudes toward <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and the organizations developing them with respect to philosophy. Empirically oriented chiropractors supported only a narrow definition <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> limited to issues surrounding safety and diagnosis. In addition, empirically oriented chiropractors would only support the development <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> by an expert panel of chiropractors. Rationalist and moderates supported the development <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> by a broader range of chiropractic organizations. We concluded that successful implementation <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> could occur if the CCA, in consultation with other chiropractic organizations, was actively committed to this initiative...|$|R

40|$|<b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{pertain to}} {{crafting}} and implementing patient-centered treatment interventions. <b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{must take into}} consideration the patient’s gender, ethnicity, medical and dental history, insurance coverage (or socioeconomic level, if a private patient), and the timeliness of the targeted scientific evidence. This resolves into a process by which clinical decision-making about the optimal patient-centered treatment relies on the best available research evidence, and all other necessary inputs and factors to provide the best possible treatment. <b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> must be evidence-based, and not merely based on the evidence – the dichotomy being critical in contemporary health services research and practice. Evidence-based <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> must rest on the best available evidence that emerges from a concerted hypothesis-driven process of research synthesis and meta-analysis. Health information technology needs to become an every-day reality in health services research and practice to ensure evidence-based <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> Current trends indicate that user-friendly methodologies, for the dissemination <b>of</b> evidence-based <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> must be developed, tested and distributed.

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recompression on air {{was shown}} to be an {{effective}} treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909. Evidence of the effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, and has since become the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for treatment of DCS. Recompression is normally carried out in a recompression chamber. At a dive site, a riskier alternative is in-water recompression.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E

40|$|CHDS State/LocalA {{disaster}} {{with mass}} casualties or event involving {{a weapon of}} mass destruction (WMD) is a profound, life-impacting event that can lead to further devastating consequences. Under austere conditions, however, the implementation <b>of</b> altered <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> can greatly increase the quality of life of individuals injured by such an event. This thesis evaluates, compares, and contrasts, at the various federal, state, and local levels, guidance documents for altered <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and presents a policy recommendation for the inclusion of triggers, guaranteed minimums <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> and legal immunity into existing planning guidance documents for altered <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> at the federal, state, and local levels.

5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{has contributed}} money {{and support for}} {{research}} and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further £10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E

5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
