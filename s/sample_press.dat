40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} method of using {{reflection}} density readings taken with a conventional graphic arts densitometer to provide a numeric measure of the visual difference between a <b>sample</b> <b>press</b> sheet and a reference sheet. This numerical measure was developed based {{on the theory that}} human response to variation in process color printing is more affected by changes in the proportions of process inks to each other than by variation in the overall inking level of the press sheet. The thesis then goes on to explain how the proposed system was tested. First, a set of color samples was generated. Observer evaluations of these color samples were converted to numeric values using psychometric evaluation methods. Using statistical methods, observer evaluations in numeric form were then tested against values obtained by using the proposed system. Observer evaluations of the color samples were also compared statistically with values from the Total Color Difference system as an additional test. The thesis concludes that the proposed system is a reliable predictor of observer response to color variation when the system is used for the purpose of comparing reference press sheets to <b>sample</b> <b>press</b> sheets...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a closed loop press control system has been the goal of many press manufacturers in recent years. These closed loop systems are designed to collect data from <b>sample</b> <b>press</b> sheets by measuring certain process variables which {{are considered to be}} indicators of press control. The theory is that by controlling the variation of these indicator variables, it is possible to control the color variation of the halftone overprints of the reproduction. The problem in the design of these automatic control systems, however, concerns which process variables should be considered indicators of press control. This study was undertaken to determine which process variables in sheet fed offset lithography can be considered indicators of press control in the halftone overprints of the press sheet. This thesis involves a series of correlation analyses which study the interellationships between several process variables of the reproduction. These process variables are: solid ink density of the process colors, density of screened process colors, hue and gray value of halftone overprint colors, hue and gray values of a near neutral gray halftone overprint, and hue and gray values of a critical halftone overprint color. The <b>sample</b> <b>press</b> sheets used in this thesis were taken from industrial production so that the results of the correlation studies of the process variables could be considered typical of those in industry. The experimental results indicated that the variation of the solid ink density of the process colors at the color bars was not a true indicator of the variation which occurred in the screened process colors. It was possible for the density of the solids to remain very close to the standard while the screened process colors varied in a large amount or in the opposite direction from the solids. This indicated that the density of the screened process colors was controlled by variables other than solid ink density. The experimental results also indicated that the density of the screened process colors may vary in large amounts from the standard and continue to produce halftone overprints with hue and gray values comparable to the standard. Also, the variations of the hue and gray values of the halftones were not consistent within the same press sheet. It may be concluded that further study is necessary which would clarify the proper indicator variables {{to be used in the}} control of the offset lithographic press. From the results of this study, it appears that proper control of the press is attainable through visually matching the halftones on the press sheet to those on the standard. Even though the process variables of this study showed a marked amount of variation, the hues and gray values of the halftone overprints remained visually stable. If an automatic closed loop press control system is to succeed, it must be able to evaluate the hues and gray values of the halftones. Proper adjustments can then be made to the offset press to match the halftones of the press sheet to the standard...|$|E

40|$|Waterless {{lithography}} {{is one of}} {{the printing}} processes that was developed around 1968. It has a strong impact in the current printing industry. Like other printing processes, waterless lithography has both advantages and disadvantages. It is said that waterless lithography can print with more consistency and less dot gain than conventional lithography. However, it has one significant disadvantage, currently there is only one waterless lithographic plate supplier in the industry. There is very little quantitative data describing the waterless lithographic process to support the arguments that waterless lithography prints with more consistency and less dot gain. There is even a report that conflicts with such arguments. Consequently, this research investigates waterless lithography to provide more quantitative data and a better understanding with its conventional counterpart. The purpose of this research was to compare a process capability index (consistency) in terms of solid ink density and the magnitude of dot gain between waterless lithography and conventional lithography. This research performed a series of test runs in an academic environment. The densities of the <b>sample</b> <b>press</b> sheets were measured and used to calculate dot gain. Several statistical methods were used to analyze data and compute process capability indices. From the data analysis, it was found that waterless lithography is only as good as, but not better than, conventional lithography in terms of process capability of solid ink density. Also, waterless lithography does not produce significantly less dot gain than conventional lithography...|$|E

The thesis provides an insight to the steps that need to be taken in order to produce a superconductive magnet mainly focusing on mechanical assembly. Tooling upgrade is necessary for the production of the superconductive dipole magnet prototypes in near future. Major attention is given by the introduction of the welding assembly in chapter three. The structural compression is given by the so called shell stress defined by the thermal shrinkage of the weld. The associated aspects include the closure of the gap in the half symmetry of the assembled mock-up. All this is important to minimize the risk for the quenches in the superconductive coil assembly. In the chapter four all the related constraints seen by the magnet are implied into the FEA model to find out the required minimum shrinkage of the weld. It was necessary to verify that the coil stresses stay below the defined limit during the pressing of the magnet and welding, after the welding procedure, as well as the cooling to 1. 9 K followed by operation at nominal current 13 kA (12 T). An aspect is given to the modifications performed for the <b>sample</b> <b>press.</b> The specification of the press implied the analysis of the required hydraulic system, user control interface and coordination of related activities. The luminosity upgrade involves the utilization of the Nb 3 Sn superconductor. The diffusion process of the Nb 3 Sn towards superconductive characteristics implies the stringent heat treatment cycle. An Ar-inert gas furnace is used. It is important to select the appropriate numerical methods to verify critical process parameters as the ramping rate [◦C/h] and the circulation speed of the used Ar-inert gas [m/s].

40|$|The {{multi-angle}} screening configuration {{is by far}} {{the most}} widely used screening configuration for process color printing, but there are alternative screening configurations which may be preferable in certain situations. Color separations made using the Staggered Position One-Angle screening configuration are reported to provide printed reproductions on newsprint which appear sharper, offer improved color reproduction, produce smoother color reproduction, and preserve color better in the shadows. The staggered position technique can be generated with high-end scanners and prepress equipment, as well as with desktop publishing workstations using the 2 ̆ 2 Flamenco 2 ̆ 2 screening algorithm. However, the staggered position method may be subject to greater color variation than the multi-angle method due to random misregistration which can occur during a newspaper press run. This study investigated printed process color reproductions produced by the staggered position screening technique in comparison to reproductions produced by the multi-angle screening technique at two commonly used screen rulings, 85 and 100 lpi, on newsprint. During a press run, one printing plate at a time was laterally misregistered in eight increments. A total of 32 <b>sample</b> <b>press</b> sheets and an OK standard press sheet were taken during the press run. A series of printed color patches on each press sheet were measured with a computerized spectrophotometer to determine if the color difference (AE) between the sample and the OK standard press sheet was significant or not. The two screening methods were also evaluated for consistency of color reproduction. Using a two sample t-test, it was determined that color misregistration resulted in a significant statistical difference between the staggered position test target and the multi- angle test target for the same screen frequency. On an individual patch-by-patch comparison, there were certain patches which did not exhibit a significant statistical difference between the two screen configurations. It was also determined that the multiangle screening method produced consistent, acceptable color variation with every increment of misregistration.

40|$|Gear marking is a print {{defect in}} flexography. It {{appears as a}} uniformly spaced pattern of lateral {{alternating}} dark and light bands along the web length corresponding to the distance between gear teeth. A comprehensive definition characterizes gear marking as a regular pattern attributable to metal burrs, nicks, debris, or other flaws that lead to unsmooth movement somewhere in the mechanical system of the press.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate some factors that were expected to contribute to both the causes and the severity of flexographic gear marking. The factors studied (independent variables) included plate hardness, and surface speed differential between the plate image area and the substrate when gear mark severity was the dependent variable of the study. The test target were designed and printed on the RIT 2 ̆ 7 s Mark Andy 4120 System narrow-web press. To study the effect of plate hardness, three plate types with different hardness, 40 Shore A, 50 Shore A, and 60 Shore A, were used. To study the effect of surface speed differential, two types of stickybacks, 0. 015 inch and 0. 020 inch, were used to create variations in surface speed differentials. Six pressruns were performed; the first three pressruns were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 015 -inch stickybacks and the others were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 020 -inch stickybacks.

The associated aspects include the closure of the gap in the half symmetry of the assembled mock-up. All this is important to minimize the risk for the quenches in the superconductive coil assembly. In the chapter four all the related constraints seen by the magnet are implied into the FEA model to find out the required minimum shrinkage of the weld. It was necessary to verify that the coil stresses stay below the defined limit during the pressing of the magnet and welding, after the welding procedure, as well as the cooling to 1. 9 K followed by operation at nominal current 13 kA (12 T). An aspect is given to the modifications performed for the <b>sample</b> <b>press.</b> The specification of the press implied the analysis of the required hydraulic system, user control interface and coordination of related activities. The luminosity upgrade involves the utilization of the Nb 3 Sn superconductor. The diffusion process of the Nb 3 Sn towards superconductive characteristics implies the stringent heat treatment cycle. An Ar-inert gas furnace is used. It is important to select the appropriate numerical methods to verify critical process parameters as the ramping rate [Celcius/h] and the circulation speed of the used Ar-inert gas [m/s]. This implies the definition of the appropriate numerical methods to carry out an analysis with the aid of CFD. The analysis should provide solid backround for further development of the analysis of heat transfer between the furnace and the coil...|$|E

(hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness) were kept during the experiment at store?ponds in Trebon. Carps in each pond were fed with triticale or modified form of triticale (not processed, pressed, crushed, not processed cooked at 120 °C and 100 °C and pressed at 120 °C) and one control pond with fish. After the experiment the fish were killed, and the recovery factor was esteblished. The fillets were obtained from samples of muscle precisely in a defined way, and property values texture by TPA (Texture profile analyst) was found. The results show that all four monitored mechanical properties of textures, reach the highest values of control (hardness: 4, 756 kg, springiness: 0. 689, cohesiveness: 0. 788 and chewiness: 2, 585 kg), and the lowest textural properties were observed in triticale, not processed, heat- prepared at 120 °C: hardness: 3, 259 kg, springiness: 0. 646 and chewiness: 1, 579 kg, and cohesiveness was lowest in triticale not processed cooked at 120 °C: 0. 733. Only <b>samples</b> <b>pressed</b> at 120 °C and not processed triticale were statistically significanty different from the others in parameter of hardness.
