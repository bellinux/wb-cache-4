50|$|The Las Marismas area {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of {{wildlife}} species. Commonly seen terrestrial animals include deer, lynx, and wild boars. Notable avian species include vultures, flamingos, herons, <b>spoonbills,</b> and <b>ducks,</b> as well as the rare Spanish imperial eagle, whose population is considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|R
500|$|The shores {{along the}} bay, {{specifically}} the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, {{are home to}} countless birds including the endangered whooping crane, pelicans, herons, egrets, roseate <b>spoonbills,</b> shorebirds, <b>ducks,</b> and geese. [...] American alligators, collared peccaries, feral hogs, coyotes, bobcats, raccoon and white-tailed deer as well as clams and crabs are included among the bay's diverse wildlife.

5000|$|Long Beach {{township}} is near a sandy {{beach that}} stretches 2.4 kilometres between coastal rock formations. Bird {{life in the}} beach and lagoon area includes blue penguins, seals, terns, pukeko, herons, <b>spoonbills,</b> and <b>ducks.</b> Because the beach lies within a bay and is seldom affected by swells, {{it is a common}} swimming location. Rock-climbing cliffs and caves at the beach's western end also attract many visitors. The Mopanui Ecological Society, a Long Beach community group, has been extensively beautifying the area through mass planting of native flora in reserve areas.|$|R
50|$|Grey kangaroos, wallabies, possums, {{echidnas}} (spiny ant eaters), {{black and}} brown snakes, Eastern Blue-tongued Lizards and Amphibolurus muricatus (Jacky dragons) {{may be seen}} in and around the town.

50|$|The brolga and {{magpie goose}} find habitat in the sedge swamps of Bowling Green Bay. The park {{is one of}} the best places to see the rarely {{observed}} zitting cisticola.

We also see the critically endangered species of crocodile, the gharial, a strict fishetarian with a long, narrow snout.|$|R
2500|$|Every year {{approximately}} 15,000 greater flamingos {{are reported}} to visit the lake along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, <b>spoonbills</b> and <b>ducks.</b> The highest concentrations of flamingo {{are found in the}} periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below. The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity. Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, [...] 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, spotbill duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew. Several species of wintering waterfowl have been noted including bar-headed goose, ruddy shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, common teal, northern pintail, garganey, northern shoveller, common pochard, brown-headed gull, black-headed gull, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern and Caspian tern. Birds of prey which appear in winter are the: white-bellied sea eagle, harriers and peregrine falcons. The largest concentrations of flamingos occur in the Andhra Pradesh part of the sanctuary, around the islands of Vendadu and Irukkam.|$|R
5000|$|The Macquarie Marshes {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as a 2378 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA), defined by the maximum extent of the 1990 floods. [...] Among over 200 species of birds recorded, the marshes have supported over 1% of the world population of the endangered Australasian bittern, as well as white-necked herons, intermediate egrets, nankeen night-herons, Australian white and straw-necked ibises, and sharp-tailed sandpipers. The IBA also supports a population of diamond firetails. [...] Other birds recorded in substantial numbers include glossy ibises, great and little egrets, royal <b>spoonbills,</b> Pacific black <b>ducks</b> and Caspian terns. Australian painted snipes, superb parrots, painted and pied honeyeaters have been recorded in the IBA.|$|R
60|$|We {{got under}} way and passed Punta Gorda, {{where there is a}} colony of tame Indians from the {{province}} of Missiones. We sailed rapidly down the current, but before sunset, from a silly fear of bad weather, we brought-to in a narrow arm of the river. I took the boat and rowed some distance up this creek. It was very narrow, winding, and deep; on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high, formed by trees intwined with creepers, gave to the canal a singularly gloomy appearance. I here saw a very extraordinary bird, called the Scissor-beak (Rhynchops nigra). It has short legs, web feet, extremely long-pointed wings, and is of {{about the size of a}} tern. The beak is flattened laterally, that is, in a plane at right angles to that of a <b>spoonbill</b> or <b>duck.</b> It is as flat and elastic as an ivory paper-cutter, and the lower mandible, differently from every other bird, is an inch and a half longer than the upper. In a lake near Maldonado, from which the water had been nearly drained, and which, in consequence, swarmed with small fry, I saw several of these birds, generally in small flocks, flying rapidly backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake. They kept their bills wide open, and the lower mandible half buried in the water. Thus skimming the surface, they ploughed it in their course: the water was quite smooth, and it formed a most curious spectacle to behold a flock, each bird leaving its narrow wake on the mirror-like surface. In their flight they frequently twist about with extreme quickness, and dexterously manage with their projecting lower mandible to plough up small fish, which are secured by the upper and shorter half of their scissor-like bills. This fact I repeatedly saw, as, like swallows, they continued to fly backwards and forwards close before me. Occasionally when leaving the surface of the water their flight was wild, irregular, and rapid; they then uttered loud harsh cries. When these birds are fishing, the advantage of the long primary feathers of their wings, in keeping them dry, is very evident. When thus employed, their forms resemble the symbol by which many artists represent marine birds. Their tails are much used in steering their irregular course.|$|R
