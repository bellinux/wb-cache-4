5|$|A United States Geological <b>Survey</b> <b>report</b> in the 1960s {{measured}} {{the concentration of}} bicarbonate in Mud Creek to range from 41 to 109 milligrams per liter, {{but there were no}} carbonates in the water. The creek's nitrate concentration ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 milligrams per liter for filtered water and the concentration of sulfates ranged from 23 to 29 milligrams per liter, again for filtered water. The concentration of chlorides in the creek's filtered waters ranged from 7 to 23 milligrams per liter. The calcium and magnesium concentrations in filtered water were 20 to 44 and 4.4 to 6 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E
