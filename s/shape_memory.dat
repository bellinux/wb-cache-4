Two example applications developed at Fulmer are: heat-shrinkabe sleeves for use as pipe couplings and an actuator for the deployment of solar panels on spacecraft.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} reasons for these {{differences}} in autobiographical perspectives across cultures. Each culture has its own unique set of factors that affect the way people perceive the world around them, such as uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and power distance. While these various cultural factors contribute to <b>shaping</b> one's <b>memory</b> perspective, the biggest factor in <b>shaping</b> <b>memory</b> perspective is individualism. One's sense of self is important in influencing whether autobiographical memories are recalled in the observer or field point of view. Western society {{has been found to}} be more individualistic, with people being more independent and stressing less importance on familial ties or the approval of others. On the other hand, Eastern cultures are thought of as less individualistic, focusing more on acceptance and maintaining family relationships while focusing less on the individual self.|$|R

30|$|Our {{emotions}} and memories are intertwined, each influencing the other. For example, autobiographical memory, the personal memories from our lifetime, plays {{a critical role}} in enhancing positivity (Conway and Pleydell-Pearce 2000). In turn, our current mood <b>shapes</b> <b>memories</b> by filtering what we remember (Berntsen 2002; Matt et al. 1992). Mood-congruent memory, for instance biases us to remember past experiences that are emotionally consistent with current mood. However, in other contexts, people remember mood-incongruent memories to regulate emotions, i.e., recalling positive past experiences to improve current negative moods (Erber and Erber 1994).|$|R
