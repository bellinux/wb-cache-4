40|$|Pigs {{which were}} {{deficient}} in vitamin E and/or selenium had the following parameters weekly determined {{from six to}} 13 weeks of age: Packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, red cell and white cell counts, red cell indices, reticulocyte count, serum iron, serum total iron binding capacity, myeloid: erythroid ratio, <b>serum</b> <b>glutamic-oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> and creatine phosphokinase activities and body weight. Except for the myeloid:erythroid ratio and serum creatine phosphokinase activity, these parameters were {{not found to be}} significantly affected by either vitamin E deficiency, selenium deficiency or deficiency of both. The myeloid:erythroid ratio was increased (p less than 0. 01) in association with selenium deficiency, which tends to indicate decreased erythropoiesis but was not reflected in the peripheral red cell picture. Evidence of dyserythropoiesis was not found to be a significant feature in serial bone marrow aspiration biopsies of vitamin E and/or selenium deficient pigs. Even if the <b>serum</b> <b>glutamic-oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activities were not found to be significantly affected by either vitamin E deficiency, selenium deficiency or deficiency in both as compared to replete animals, a few animals, especially in the group deficient in both vitamin E and selenium, presented quite marked transient increases of <b>serum</b> <b>glutamic-oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activity which was interpreted to reflect the occurrence of acute episodes of hepatosis dietetica. Serum creatine phosphokinase activities were found to be increased in association with vitamin E deficiency (p less than 0. 01), selenium deficiency (less than 0. 05) and the interaction was also significant (p less than 0. 01).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{acclimation}} to environmental temperatures of 10 to 12 or 28 to 30 C on {{the resistance of}} broiler chicks to dietary aflatoxin was examined. Broiler chicks were acclimated from day-of-age for 2 wk to environmental temperatures of 10 to 12 or 28 to 30 C. On Day 14, a single oral dose of aflatoxin (8 mg per kg of body weight) was administered to SO chicks in each environment. An increase in aflatoxin resistance, as assessed by survival rate, was conveyed by acclimation to cold temperatures. In each environmental chamber, a separate group of chicks was maintained for 2 additional wk, but those groups received 5 mg of aflatoxin per kg feed. By {{the end of the}} study, aftatoxicosis was characterized by: 1) a significant (P£. 05) decrease in body weight; 2) increases in spleen weight, liver weight, liver lipid, and liver dry-matter content; 3) changes in the serum levels of total protein, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, potassium, phosphorus, iron and calcium; and 4) increased hepatic hyperplasia. Acclimation to 10 to 12 C was characterized by: 1) an increase in body weight, liver weight, spleen weight and bursa weight; 2) changes in the serum glucose and potassium levels; and 3) a decrease in <b>glutamic-oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activity.

40|$|To {{determine}} the cause of hepatic injury in patients with hypoxaemia, the persistence of liver susceptibility to toxic injury after hypoxia was investigated in rats. Centrilobular necrosis and marked elevation of serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and <b>serum</b> <b>glutamic-oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (SGOT) activities were induced by carbon tetrachloride (0. 1 ml/kg body weight) given in the period between 3 h before and 21 h after exposure to 7 % oxygen for 3 h. This observation, that a short period of hypoxia results in a prolonged sensitivity to carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury, has not been described previously. The mechanism of the phenomenon is obscure.

Ad-HO- 1 -transfected macrophages significantly decreased local neutrophil accumulation, TNF-α/IL- 1 β, IFN-γ/E-selectin, and IP- 10 /MCP- 1 expression, caspase- 3 activity, and the frequency of apoptotic cells, as compared with controls. Unlike in controls, Ad-HO- 1 -transfected macrophages markedly increased hepatic expression of antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 /Bcl-xl and depressed caspase- 3 activity. These results establish the precedent for a novel investigative tool and provide the rationale for a clinically attractive new strategy in which native macrophages can be transfected ex vivo with cytoprotective HO- 1 and then infused, if needed, to prospective recipients exposed to hepatic IR–mediated local inflammation, such as during liver transplantation, resection, or trauma...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: 							Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the clinical efficacy and toxicity of metronomic administration of low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) in lymphoma and sarcoma rat tumour models. 							METHODS: 							Adult inbred rats were challenged with lymphoma TACB and sarcoma E 100 s. c. on day 0. Animals were divided into two groups: group I, control, injected with saline three times a week; and group II, treated with Cy 10 mg/kg three times a week, from day 10 until the tumour was non-palpable, or 5 mg/kg three times a week from day 7. Tumours were measured and animals were weighed twice weekly. Periodic blood samples were taken for determination of urea, creatinine, <b>serum</b> <b>glutamic-oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase,</b> lactate dehydrogenase and haematological parameters. 							RESULTS: 							The administration of low-dose Cy eradicated established rat lymphomas and sarcomas; there was neither metastatic growth nor recurrence at primary sites for 100 % of the lymphomas and 83 % of the sarcomas. In addition, the treatment did not cause weight loss, and was devoid of haematological, cardiac, hepatic and renal toxicity. 							CONCLUSIONS: 							Metronomic administration of Cy at low doses on a thrice weekly schedule to already grown rat lymphomas and sarcomas demonstrated itself to be a successful antitumour therapy that did not cause weight loss and was devoid of haematological, cardiac, hepatic and renal toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the protective effects of luteolin, a flavonoid, against acute immobilization-induced liver damage in mice. Mice were immobilized for a period of 6 h daily for three consecutive weeks. Luteolin (25 or 100 mg/kg, i. g.) was administered 30 min before subjecting the animals to restraint stress (RS). Our experiment showed that RS could induce liver damage, with an increase in glutamic-pyruvic <b>transaminase</b> (GPT) and <b>glutamic-oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (GOT) in the liver tissue. Furthermore, the changes of anti-oxidative capacity in liver tissue were also measured. The changes of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities (CAT) of stress group were significantly different from those in the control group. However, these changes in stress low and high-doses of luteolin modulation group were improved. These results demonstrated that luteolin has a protective effect against RS-induced liver damage through scavenging both free radicals activity and lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} feed {{restriction}} on lipogenesis, carcass composition, and protein utilization were investigated. Two feed restriction programs were used: 1) restricted duration of feeding (RDF) whereby pullets {{had access to}} feed for 7 or 9 hr/day and 2) restricted access to feed (ADF) in which feed was available on alternate days. A control group received the same diet as the restricted groups but on an ad libitum basis. The feeding programs were applied to a white egg and brown egg strain of commercial laying hens from 1 until 5 weeks of age or from 3 days (RDF) or 10 weeks (ADF) until 19 weeks of age. The ADF restriction resulted in 12 to 25 % decrease in body weights at 5 weeks and 5 to 11 % decrease in body weights at 18 or 19 weeks. The RDF depressed body weights 24 % at 5 weeks and 2 % at 18 weeks. The RDF and ADF increased hepatic malic enzyme and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activities in both age groups. Plasma uric acid and hepatic glutamic pyruvic transaminase were affected, but not consistently, by ADF. It is hypothe-sized that ADF and RDF lead to increased lipogenesis and increased utilization of amino acids as sources of energy. Under conditions of mild restriction, this may result in increased carcass fat content.
