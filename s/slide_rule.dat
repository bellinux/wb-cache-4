5|$|This {{identity}} allows multiplication to {{be carried}} out by consulting a table of logarithms and computing addition by hand; it also enables multiplication on a <b>slide</b> <b>rule.</b> The formula is still a good first-order approximation in the broad context of Lie groups, where it relates multiplication of infinitesimal group elements with addition of vectors in the associated Lie algebra.|$|E
5|$|The bomb sight {{was also}} {{supplied}} with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> for use when the main computor stopped working. In {{this case the}} bomb aimer would dial in the same basic parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E

These are no longer available in 2012. In addition, Faber-Castell {{has a number of}} <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> still in inventory, available for international purchase through their web store.

50|$|<b>Slide</b> <b>rules</b> {{exist in}} a diverse range of styles and {{generally}} appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings (scales) essential to performing mathematical computations. <b>Slide</b> <b>rules</b> manufactured for specialized fields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid in calculations common to those fields.|$|R
25|$|Since real numbers can be {{represented}} as distances or intervals on a line, the <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> was invented in the 1620s, shortly after Napier's work, to allow multiplication and division operations {{to be carried out}} significantly faster than was previously possible. Edmund Gunter built a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale at the University of Oxford. His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations, including multiplication and division. William Oughtred greatly improved this in 1630 with his circular <b>slide</b> <b>rule.</b> He followed this up with the modern <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> in 1632, essentially a combination of two Gunter rules, held together with the hands. Slide rules were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved professional workers, until the invention of the pocket calculator.|$|E

The schools would provide the instructors, classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, food services, and health and recreational facilities. Textbooks, classroom supplies, and an engineering <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> (usually a K Log-Log Duplex Decitrig) were also supplied. (The <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> in its holder strapped on the belt was a standard part of students’ uniform of the day.) The contracts required the schools to provide all of this under a flat-rate per student-month.|$|E
50|$|In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, {{started to}} make <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> from bamboo, which had the {{advantages}} of being dimensionally stable, strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933, and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of celluloid, plastic, or painted aluminium. Later cursors were acrylics or polycarbonates sliding on Teflon bearings.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the electronic, {{transistorized}} calculator in the 1970s, <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> became obsolete for most uses. <b>Slide</b> <b>rules</b> had never been very profitable for K & E, so it was not difficult to discontinue the line. K & E's market share shrank because of other technological advancements, and the firm shut down its slide-rule engraving machines in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Slide</b> <b>rules</b> {{have often}} been {{specialized}} to varying degrees for their field of use, such as excise, proof calculation, engineering, navigation, etc., but some <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> are extremely specialized for very narrow applications. For example, the John Rabone & Sons 1892 catalog lists a [...] "Measuring Tape and Cattle Gauge", a device to estimate {{the weight of a}} cow from its measurements.|$|R
25|$|The new color {{matching}} functions {{were to be}} everywhere {{greater than or equal}} to zero. In 1931, computations were done by hand or <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> and the specification of positive values was a useful computational simplification.|$|E
25|$|At Oxford University, Edmund Gunter {{built the}} first analog device to aid computation. The 'Gunter's scale' was a large plane scale, {{engraved}} with various scales, or lines. Natural lines, such as the line of chords, the line of sines and tangents are placed {{on one side of}} the scale and the corresponding artificial or logarithmic ones were on the other side. This calculating aid was a predecessor of the <b>slide</b> <b>rule.</b> It was William Oughtred (1575–1660) who first used two such scales sliding by one another to perform direct multiplication and division, and thus is credited as the inventor of the <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> in 1622.|$|E
25|$|The 17th century {{also saw}} the {{invention}} of some very powerful tools to aid arithmetic calculations like Napier's bones, logarithmic tables and the <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> which, for their ease of use by scientists in multiplying and dividing, ruled over and impeded the use and development of mechanical calculators until the production release of the arithmometer in the mid 19th century.|$|E

Shortly after the SR-11 featured an added key for entering Pi (π). It was followed {{the next year}} by the SR-50 which added log and trig functions {{to compete with the}} HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed TI-30 line which is still produced.|$|E
25|$|Multiplying {{numbers to}} {{more than a couple of}} decimal places by hand is tedious and error prone. Common {{logarithms}} were invented to simplify such calculations. The <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> allowed numbers to be quickly multiplied to about three places of accuracy. Beginning in the early 20th century, mechanical calculators, such as the Marchant, automated multiplication of up to 10digit numbers. Modern electronic computers and calculators have greatly reduced the need for multiplication by hand.|$|E
25|$|Speed is {{the change}} in {{distance}} to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity {{to see where the}} target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making grease pencil marks on the radar screen and then calculating the speed using a <b>slide</b> <b>rule.</b> Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.|$|E

25|$|The Sumerians {{developed}} a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology {{resulted in the}} creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. The period c. 2700 – 2300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical calculators {{continued}} to be sold, though in rapidly decreasing numbers, into the early 1970s, {{with many of the}} manufacturers closing down or being taken over. Comptometer type calculators were often retained for much longer to be used for adding and listing duties, especially in accounting, since a trained and skilled operator could enter all the digits of a number in one movement of the hands on a Comptometer quicker than was possible serially with a 10-key electronic calculator. In fact, it was quicker to enter larger digits in two strokes using only the lower-numbered keys; for instance, a 9 would be entered as 4 followed by 5. Some key-driven calculators had keys for every column, but only 1 through 5; they were correspondingly compact. The spread of the computer rather than the simple electronic calculator {{put an end to the}} Comptometer. Also, by the end of the 1970s, the <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> had become obsolete.|$|E

500|$|Law {{believes}} that the general standard of production design and special effects is {{lower than that of}} , expressing satisfaction with the scale models but suggesting that [...] "the slow-motion filming and wobbly mirror effects are more in keeping with Blake's 7." [...] He views the [...] "info dump" [...] opening titles as a weak imitation of the Space: 1999 introduction, and the multiple appearances of the E=mc2 equation as confusing. Certain props (such as the <b>slide</b> <b>rule)</b> and design elements (such as punched cards) also come under criticism from Law, who questions whether a futuristic [...] "lightship" [...] would be equipped with such relatively primitive technology. Although he suggests that the plot device of the accident-prone Altares reflects the shifting public perception of space exploration in the 1970s ("a time when optimism in the space programme was on the wane"), Law regards such design elements as indicative of the manner in which The Day After Tomorrow [...] "has {{stood the test of time}} less well than other series." ...|$|E
500|$|Vincent Law, in {{a review}} {{published}} in the Gerry Anderson-centric fanzine Andersonic, considers The Day After Tomorrow an [...] "oddity" [...] and an [...] "uncharacteristically lacklustre entry in the Anderson canon", commenting that the programme [...] "cracks along at a fair old pace, but the educational content does tend to deaden {{the first half of}} the story and limits the room for character development." [...] Although he credits the production for [...] "getting its science lesson across in a superficial way", he expresses a negative view of the narration, remarking that [...] "at times Ed [...] comes across like a presenter of one of those old schools programmes from the 70s, just imparting a string of dry facts." [...] He believes that Jane is the only character who develops over the course of the special. The adults, by contrast, are [...] "pretty much peripheral", while David can be considered a [...] "miniature Spock" [...] who [...] "lurks around the ship either brandishing his <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> threatening to calculate something, or staring out of the porthole (a nice touch!) dribbling about pulsars." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{the results}} of {{calculations}} based on Teller's concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it could {{not lead to a}} successful weapon, while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding. [...] Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer. To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller's approach was feasible. [...] To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, MANIAC, at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos. [...] Ulam enlisted Everett to follow a completely different approach, one guided by physical intuition. [...] Françoise Ulam was one of a cadre of women [...] "computers" [...] who carried out laborious and extensive computations of thermonuclear scenarios on mechanical calculators, supplemented and confirmed by Everett's <b>slide</b> <b>rule.</b> Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios. [...] The results showed that, in workable configurations, a thermonuclear reaction would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining. Ulam had used his expertise in Combinatorics to analyze the chain reaction in deuterium, which was much more complicated than the ones in uranium and plutonium, and he concluded that no self-sustaining chain reaction would take place at the (low) densities that Teller was considering. [...] In late 1950, these conclusions were confirmed by von Neumann's results.|$|E
