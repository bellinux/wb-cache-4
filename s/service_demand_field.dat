There are many important aspects {{to be considered}} in the increasing bus <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> include the changes of bus service elements and characteristics of ridership factors. The study aims to evaluate the change in ridership factors and to assess the bus <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> sensitivity with respect to ridership factors change. Primary data on bus services are collected from the regular stage bus operated in the mixed traffic at a corridor level and secondary data are compiled from some resources with respected institution. The study concludes that the bus <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> responses most sensitive on travel time elasticity. Meanwhile, some other factors such as ticket fare, fuel price, per capita income, service frequency, and headway indicate inelastic factors in the change of bus <b>service</b> <b>demand.</b> Therefore, especially for current bus system and based on the short-term period, the bus <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> is not sensitive with respect to the change in ticket fare, fuel price, per capita income, service frequency, and headway. It may change based on those factors and some circumstances for long-term period.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in building analytic performance models such as queuing network models is obtaining <b>service</b> <b>demands</b> for the various workloads and various devices. While some of these parameters can be easily measured, some may {{not be easy to}} obtain due to the complexity that the measurements may entail or because it may not be possible to stop the operation of a production system to collect measurements. This paper discusses a black-box approach for computing unknown <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> parameters in queuing network models. The paper addresses the problem of finding a subset of the <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> values given the known values and given the values of the response times for all workloads. A unique closed form solution is given for the case of a single missing parameter and a process for obtaining a feasible solution for the case of multiple missing parameters is discussed. Numerical examples illustrate the approach. An online <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> estimator that successively computes better estimates for the <b>service</b> <b>demands</b> is described. The experiments carried out with this estimator show a relatively low relative error in the predicted response times when the estimated <b>service</b> <b>demands</b> are used. ...|$|R

The commercial services of the airports provide opportunities for airport operators to increase their profitability. This research focuses on the non-aviation part of the airport business activity. Transfer passengers are chosen to be the target group due to their potential quantitative growth in the future. The literature review of this thesis represents the main occurrence of <b>service</b> <b>demand,</b> previous ways to increase the <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> and, further alternative ways to increase <b>service</b> <b>demand.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> literature review also clarifies different ways to increase <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> at the airport environment.

To better allocate resources, a more accurate prediction on medical <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> is very urgently needed.

To achieve this aim, the study combines Taylor Approximation into the Grey Markov Chain model, and develops a new model named Taylor-Markov Chain GM (1, 1) (T-MCGM (1, 1)).

Methods: Analysis of data from the household component of the 2009 Survey of Disability Ageing and Carers (N= 64, 213 persons). Results: In Australia in 2009, 1. 0 % of people aged 15 years or over (177, 900 persons) provided informal, primary care to a co-resident with a psychological disability. One-quarter (27. 2 %) of these carers reported <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> for respite care, of whom one-third had used respite services {{in the past three}} months and four-fifths had an unmet need for any or more respite care.

40|$|In {{cellular}} networks, {{users are}} grouped into different cells and served by different access points (base stations) that provide wireless {{access to services}} and applications. In general, the <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> is very heterogeneous, non-uniformly distributed, and dynamic. Consequently, radio access networks create very irregular topologies with more access points where <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> is concentrated. While this dynamism requires networks {{with the ability to}} adapt to time-varying conditions, the non-uniformity of the <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> makes the planning, analysis, and optimization difficult.

RESULTS: Sixteen per cent of Australian adults reported <b>service</b> <b>demand,</b> of whom one-third did not meet criteria for a 12 -month mental disorder (equivalent to 5. 7 % of the adult population). Treatment patterns tended to follow a gradient defined by level of possible need. For example, service users with a 12 -month disorder received, on average, 1. 6 - 3. 9 times more consultations {{than their counterparts in}} other levels of possible need, and had 1. 9 - 2. 2 times higher rates of psychologist consultation. Service users with a lifetime but not 12 -month disorder or any other indicator of need consumed a similar average number of services to people with mild 12 -month mental disorders, but received relatively fewer services involving the mental health sector. <b>Service</b> <b>demand</b> was associated with increased suicidality and psychological distress in all levels of possible need examined, and with poorer clinical and functional status for those with 12 -month or lifetime disorders.

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of multi-tier systems {{is known to}} be significantly degraded by workloads that place bursty <b>service</b> <b>demands</b> on system resources. Burstiness can cause queueing delays, oversubscribe limited threading resources, and even cause dynamic bottleneck switches betweenresources. Thus,thereisneedfor amethodologytocreate benchmarks with controlled burstiness and bottleneck switches to evaluate their impact on system performance. We tackle this problem using a model-based technique for the automatic and controlled generation of bursty benchmarks. Markov models are constructed in an automated manner to model the distribution of <b>service</b> <b>demands</b> placed by sessions of a given system on various system resources. The models are then used to derive session submission policies that result in user-specified levels of <b>service</b> <b>demand</b> burstiness for resources at the different tiers in a system. Our approach can also predict under what conditions these policies can create dynamic bottleneck switching among resources. A case study using a three-tier TPC-W testbed shows that our method is able to control and predict burstiness for session <b>service</b> <b>demands.</b> Further, results from the study demonstrate that our approach was able to inject controlled bottleneck switches. Experiments show that these bottleneck switches cause dramatic latency and throughput degradations that are not shown by the same session mix with non-bursty conditions...|$|R

In particular, the maximum likelihood approach is found to be typically two to five times more accurate than utilization based regression, thus suggesting that estimating <b>service</b> <b>demands</b> from response times can help in improving performance model parameterization. 1...|$|R
