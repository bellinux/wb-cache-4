50|$|In the Oxford {{area the}} river splits into several streams across the floodplain, which create {{numerous}} islands. On the right bank a large island {{is created by}} Seacourt <b>Stream,</b> Botley <b>Stream</b> <b>and</b> Bulstake <b>Stream,</b> <b>and</b> there are smaller islands, including the island now known as Osney, created by streams between Bulstake <b>Stream</b> <b>and</b> the Thames, including Osney Ditch. The Oxford suburbs of Grandpont and New Hinksey are on an island created by Bulstake <b>Stream,</b> Hinksey <b>Stream</b> <b>and</b> Weirs Mill <b>Stream.</b> Iffley Meadows is an island west of Iffley Lock, between Weirs Mill <b>Stream,</b> Hinksey <b>Stream</b> <b>and</b> the Thames.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and mountain lions, while the <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> 11,000 lakes {{are found}} in Belarus. Three major rivers run through the country: the Neman, the Pripyat, and the Dnieper.

5|$|Monthly {{rainfall}} {{is greater}} downwind of cities, partially {{due to the}} UHI. Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons, and decreases the occurrence of weak tornadoes. The UHI decreases air quality by increasing the production of pollutants such as ozone, and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> put stress on their ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Texas has 3,700 named <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> 15 major rivers, {{with the}} Rio Grande as the largest. Other major rivers include the Pecos, the Brazos, Colorado, and Red River. While Texas has few natural lakes, Texans have built over 100 {{artificial}} reservoirs.|$|E

5|$|The {{soil and}} {{topography}} in the catchment are predominantly sandy with very low water retention capacity.

5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by <b>streams</b> <b>and</b> weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the <b>streams,</b> <b>and</b> fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
