50|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between the Legitimists and the Orléanists is the nationality requirement. For Orléanists, foreign-born heirs forfeit their right of <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> <b>estates</b> in France by the law of aubain. Foreigners include, apart from the usual definition, those Frenchmen who left without intent of returning. They also cite the opinion of Charles Dumoulin, a French jurist of the sixteenth century: Common sense requires that princes of the blood who have become foreigners be excluded from the throne just as the male descendants of princesses. The exclusion of both is {{in the spirit of}} the fundamental custom, which overlooks the royal blood in princesses only to prevent the scepter from falling in foreign hands.For this reason, Orléanists also exclude the Orléans-Braganza (Brazilians) and Orléans-Galliera (Spanish), junior descendants of Louis Philippe, King of the French, from the succession to the French throne.|$|E

50|$|The most {{remarkable}} disabilities under which women were still placed in 1910 were {{the exclusion of}} female heirs from <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> real <b>estate,</b> except {{in the absence of}} a male heir; and the fact that a husband could obtain a divorce for the adultery of his wife, while a wife could obtain it only for her husband's adultery if coupled with some other cause, such as cruelty or desertion.|$|R
40|$|The English Law {{has been}} {{enforced}} in Hong Kong since 1842, but some cases involving Chinese traditional practices would {{be judged on}} the basis of Qing Code. The Hong Kong Chinese followed the traditional convention of succession in the male line. This essay is to discuss a court case which raises questions regarding a paternal nephew's adoption as heir and his <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> <b>estate.</b> The Court of Appeal had previously refused another paternal nephew's request for the right to inherit his uncle's estate. This paper discusses: (1) the specification of the adoption procedure in the Qing Code that is obviously not concrete enough and so the court needs reliable evidence and reasonable deduction to determine whether the paternal nephew was adopted; and (2) how the court makes fair and reasonable rulings {{on the basis of}} legal provision stipulated {{in the spirit of the}} Confucianism centuries earlier...|$|R
50|$|In {{a dispute}} over <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the <b>estate,</b> the castle was besieged by William Cockburn and his brother in law, David Home of Wedderburn in 1517. Antoine d'Arces, Sieur de la Bastie, the French deputy for Regent Albany, summoned Cockburn and Home to resolve the dispute.

50|$|The {{title was}} vacant from 1523 to 1544. In 1523, Louise of Savoy, mother of King Francis I of France, {{challenged}} the <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the <b>estate</b> of Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who died childless. She claimed the succession as the heir by proximity of blood, as {{a descendant of}} the House of Bourbon through her mother. Seeing no hope of prevailing against the king's mother, the Constable of Bourbon went into the service of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1531, the duchy merged into the royal domain for the first time.|$|R

Rudra Singh, being the eldest son of Chhatra Singh, was declared to be Maharaja of Darbhanga. This permanently settled the issue of succession and thereafter the succession was based upon primogeniture.|$|R
50|$|Gladstone became Lord of the Manor of {{the family}} estates at Hawarden, when its {{previous}} owner, his nephew, William Glynne Charles Gladstone, was killed in action in April 1915.

He succeeded his late nephew as Lord Lieutenant of Flintshire, and was President of the University College of North Wales at Bangor. He was a Justice of the Peace (JP) for both Flintshire and Cheshire. He was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D., and was raised to the peerage as Baron Gladstone of Hawarden, of Hawarden in the County of Flint, on 22 June 1932. He was the Constable of Flint Castle in 1934.|$|R
5000|$|King George III held {{faith with}} Bathurst as the Speaker for the House of Lords. A former {{treasury}} commissioner {{he had the}} sinecure of a tellership of the Exchequer. It entailed some duties but the job was worth £1,200 per annum. More importantly for the <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the <b>estates</b> {{he was able to}} secure a tellership for his son by 1790. He continued to plant a new garden into his retirement. Then in 1788 a sick King George decided he would take the waters at Cheltenham with Queen Charlotte. En route the royal family stopped during July at Cirencester Park. The earl developed the Sapperton tunnel the following year for a new canal dug to connect the Severn with the Thames. During the reign hundreds of local acts of Parliament authorised construction of roads, bridges, tunnels, and infrastructures.|$|R
60|$|Sir James Carnegie had not {{returned}} to England {{after the fall}} of Calais; he perceived that he was in grave disfavour with the Black Prince, and guessed, as was the case, that some suspicion had fallen on him in reference to the attack upon Walter in the camp, and to the strange attempt which had been made to destroy him by Sir Phillip Holbeaut. He had, therefore, for a time taken service with the Count of Savoy, and was away from England, to the satisfaction of Walter and Dame Vernon, when the marriage took place; for he had given proofs of such a malignity of disposition that both felt, that although his <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the <b>estates</b> was now hopelessly barred, yet that he might at any moment attempt some desperate deed to satisfy his feeling of disappointment and revenge.|$|R

5|$|Humphreys, a Naval captain, {{had married}} Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall {{long before he}} succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely {{respected}} in the Stockport area, but following his <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the <b>estate</b> in 1829, there were disputes from {{other members of the}} Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton.|$|R
25|$|During the Revolution, he {{received}} yet more help; men were proud to labour for him, {{and did not}} murmur because he absorbed all the credit and fame.

Dumont was a Genevese exile and old friend of Romilly who willingly prepared the famous addresses that Mirabeau used to make the Assembly marked by sudden bursts of eloquent declamation; Clavière helped him in finance and not only worked out his figures, but also wrote his financial discourses; Lamourette wrote the speeches on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; Reybaz not only wrote for him his famous speeches on the assignats, the organization of the national guard, and others, which Mirabeau read word for word at the tribune, but also even the posthumous speech on <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the <b>estates</b> of intestates, which Talleyrand read in the Assembly as the last work of his dead friend.|$|R

25|$|After {{the wars}} had ended {{he was put}} on the list of superannuated captains, but {{achieved}} some recompense when he was made a Companion of the Bath on 26 September 1831, on the occasion of King William IV's Coronation Honours. He received a further honour when he was nominated a Knight Commander of the Guelphic Order of Hanover in February 1834, and was promoted to rear-admiral on 10 January 1837. He assumed the surname of Davenport when his wife inherited the Davenport estates at Bramall in 1838, and was restored to the active list on 17 August 1840. He settled at Bramall and had become widely respected in the Stockport area prior to his wife's inheritance, but following his <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the <b>estate</b> there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property.

50|$|Modern urban {{communities}} and families {{were no longer}} structured and organised purely along traditional lines. The customary rules of succession simply determined <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the deceased's <b>estate</b> without the accompanying social implications they traditionally had. Nuclear families had largely replaced traditional extended families. The heir did not necessarily live with the whole extended family (which included the spouse of the deceased and other dependants and descendants), but often simply acquired the estate without assuming, or even being {{in a position to}} assume, any of the deceased's responsibilities. In these changed circumstances the succession of the heir to the assets of the deceased did not necessarily correspond in practice with an enforceable responsibility to provide support and maintenance to the family and dependants of the deceased.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 May 1505, Charles {{married his}} agnatic second cousin, Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon. It was a dynastic match, {{intended}} {{to settle the}} question of <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the Bourbon <b>estates,</b> which had arisen because Suzanne's father, {{the last of the}} senior Bourbon line, had died without sons. Charles was the scion of the next-senior Bourbon line, and thus the [...] "heir male" [...] of the House of Bourbon, while Suzanne was the [...] "heir general." [...] With the marriage, Charles's position as Duke of Bourbon became undisputed. This cementing of position was important for another reason: with the death of Charles IV, Duke of Alençon in 1525, Charles became the agnatic heir to the French royal line in case of a failure of male heirs (which indeed happened in 1589).|$|R
60|$|Their intercourse, however, though thus renewed, {{continued}} to be rather formal and civil than partaking of brotherly cordiality; yet it was sufficient to the wishes of both parties. Sir Everard obtained, in the frequent society of his little nephew, something on which his hereditary pride might found the anticipated pleasure of a continuation of his lineage, and where his kind and gentle affections could {{at the same time}} fully exercise themselves. For Richard Waverley, he beheld in the growing attachment between the uncle and nephew the means of securing his son's, if not his own, <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the hereditary <b>estate,</b> which he felt would be rather endangered than promoted by any attempt on his own part towards a closer intimacy with a man of Sir Everard's habits and opinions.|$|R
60|$|By {{a former}} marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply {{provided}} {{for by the}} fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the Norland <b>estate</b> was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it.|$|R
60|$|The vehemence of Sir Everard's resentment {{against his}} brother was but short-lived; yet his dislike to the Whig and the placeman, though unable to stimulate him to resume any active {{measures}} prejudicial to Richard's interest, in the <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the family <b>estate,</b> continued <b>to</b> maintain the coldness between them. Richard knew enough of the world, and of his brother's temper, to believe that by any ill-considered or precipitate advances on his part, he might turn passive dislike into a more active principle. It was accident, therefore, which at length occasioned a renewal of their intercourse. Richard had married a young woman of rank, by whose family interest and private fortune he hoped to advance his career. In her right he became possessor of a manor of some value, at the distance of {{a few miles from}} Waverley-Honour.|$|R
60|$|After {{a time he}} woke up, {{and woke}} in a nasty temper. He began to find fault in an {{incoherent}} way with everything. Harold said little, just enough to prevent any cause for further grievance. Then Leonard changed and became affectionate. This mood was a greater bore than the other, but Harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference. Leonard was this by time making promises {{to do things for}} him, that as he was what he called a 'goo' fell',' he might count on his help and support in the future. As Harold knew him to be a wastrel, over head and ears in debt and with only the <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> a small <b>estate,</b> he did not take much heed to his maunderings. At last the drunken man said something which startled him so much that he instinctively drew himself together with such suddenness as to frighten the horse and almost make him rear up straight.|$|R
5000|$|The gentry of England and Wales {{played a}} pivotal role in {{regional}} administration for several centuries while a largely un-centralised system of national government prevailed. From mediaeval times, Knights of the Shire (later Members of Parliament) generally came from landed families in each county, and fulfilled these roles on an almost rotational basis from session to session [...] - [...] not as a parliamentary career [...] - [...] but as an occasional duty expected of their status. Such families generally inter-married strictly within their own counties, thus creating an administrative class in each county closely bonded by familial ties. In English and Welsh feudal society a mans social status was dependent on both the extent of his landholding and by the status of his overlord: those holding land directly from the king were the tenants-in-chief, a group of exalted status. Tenants-in-chief proved to be the monarchs most reliable administrators in the shires because they owed the king personal allegiance and military service as his feudal tenants. Originally they were selected by King William the Conqueror (1066-1087) for their military prowess and reliability as commanders, fellow-conquerors and administrators of his new kingdom of England, and were awarded estates for their further support. However over time, and despite careful [...] "good-breeding", the martial qualities of their progeny may have degenerated by natural process from those of the founders of their House, yet they still inherited the high social status and military obligations of tenants-in-chief. They thus derived their status no longer from personal qualities, but purely from the land they held, and thus the ownership and <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> their <b>estate</b> was of particular importance.|$|R
