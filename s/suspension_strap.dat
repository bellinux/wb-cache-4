5000|$|Supporters of TRX Training {{claim that}} it can improve {{mobility}} and stability, increase metabolic results, build lean muscle, and develop functional strength.Other advocates of the system say that you can't help but use your core for stabilization. [...] Hedrick states that, [...] "People who like yoga and Pilates tend to like TRX {{because there are some}} crossovers. But it's also great for runners, cyclists, or anyone who is an endurance athlete and wants to have more strength training." [...] On the contrary, some analysts worry that the instability of <b>suspension</b> <b>straps</b> could possibly result in injury, especially for those with a history of joint or back injuries, or inadequate core strength. Fabio Comana, a research scientist at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise, states that suspension training may work for well-conditioned athletes and gym-goers who regularly train their core, however, it is potentially dangerous for those who haven’t built up their core.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that wearing a protective helmet reduces airflow around the head and leads to an increase in heat-related stress and discomfort due to excessive sweat. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate vent designs in order to improve the air ventilation and heat dissipation in cricket helmets. An experiment was conducted in a research wind tunnel using a thermal manikin headfoam at a constant wind speed of 2. 3 m/s. Thermal comfort was measured in terms of heat dissipation and heat gain with ten K-type thermocouples. A comparison was made between four different helmets in terms of the vent design variations and temperature distributions. An increase in heat dissipation and a reduction in temperature in thermocouples were observed in the design incorporating <b>suspension</b> <b>straps.</b> The heat dissipation increases when there is an air gap between the head surface and the helmet shell/liners and where an air gap allows cooling air to circulate through the helmet. The thermal manikin experiment provided an efficient investigation of heat gain and/or loss for different vent designs, whereby its application is restricted to controlled experimental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Electromyographic {{response}} of global abdominal stabilizers {{in response to}} stable-and unstable-base isometric exercise. J Strength Cond Res 29 (6) : 1609 - 1615, 2015 -Core stability training traditionally uses stable-base techniques. Less is known as {{to the use of}} unstable-base techniques, such as suspension training, to activate core musculature. This study sought to assess the neuromuscular activation of global core stabilizers when using suspension training techniques, compared with more traditional forms of isometric exercise. Eighteen elite level, male youth swimmers (age, 15. 5 ± 2. 3 years; stature, 163. 3 ± 12. 7 cm; body mass, 62. 2 ± 11. 9 kg) participated in this study. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to determine the rate of muscle contraction in postural musculature, associated with core stability and torso bracing (rectus abdominus [RA], external obliques [EO], erector spinae [ES]). A maximal voluntary contraction test was used to determine peak amplitude for all muscles. Static bracing of the core was achieved using a modified "plank" position, with and without a Swiss ball, and held for 30 seconds. A mechanically similar "plank" was then held using <b>suspension</b> <b>straps.</b> Analysis of sEMG revealed that suspension produced higher peak amplitude in the RA than using a prone or Swiss ball "plank" (p= 0. 04). This difference was not replicated in either the EO or ES musculature. We conclude that suspension training noticeably improves engagement of anterior core musculature when compared with both lateral and posterior muscles. Further research is required to determine how best to activate both posterior and lateral musculature when using all forms of core stability training...|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} modern {{suspension}} system and, along with advances {{in the construction of}} roads, heralded the single greatest improvement in road transport until the advent of the automobile. The British steel springs were not well suited for use on America's rough roads of the time, so the Abbot-Downing Company of Concord, New Hampshire re-introduced leather <b>strap</b> <b>suspension,</b> which gave a swinging motion instead of the jolting up and down of a spring suspension.|$|R

40|$|Recently we {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} <b>Suspension</b> Trapping (<b>STrap)</b> for bottom-up proteomics sample processing that is based upon SDS-mediated protein extraction, swift detergent removal and rapid reactor-type protein digestion in a quartz depth filter trap. As the depth filter surface is made of silica, it is readily modifiable with various functional groups using the silane coupling chemistries. Thus, during the digest, peptides possessing specific features could be targeted for enrichment by the functionalized depth filter material while non-targeted peptides could be collected as an unbound distinct fraction after the digest. In the example presented here the quartz depth filter surface is functionalized with the pyridyldithiol group therefore enabling reversible in-situ capture of the cysteine-containing peptides generated during the STrap-based digest. The described C-STrap method retains all advantages of the original STrap methodology and provides robust foundation for the conception of the targeted in-situ peptide fractionation in the STrap format for bottom-up proteomics. The presented data support the method’s use in qualitative and semi-quantitative proteomics experiments...|$|R
5000|$|Another use of cymbals is the {{suspended}} cymbal. This instrument takes {{its name from}} the traditional method of suspending the cymbal by means of a leather strap or rope, thus allowing the cymbal to vibrate as freely as possible for maximum musical effect. Early jazz drumming pioneers borrowed this style of cymbal mounting during the early 1900s and later drummers further developed this instrument into the mounted horizontal or nearly horizontally mounted [...] "crash" [...] cymbals of a modern drum kit, However, most modern drum kits do not employ a leather <b>strap</b> <b>suspension</b> system. Many modern drum kits use a mount with felt or otherwise dampening fabric to act as a barrier to hold the cymbals between metal clamps: thus forming the modern day ride cymbal.|$|R
50|$|During the show's run, the stunts {{took their}} toll on the trucks (for example, one clip that appears in the opening credits clearly shows an axle {{breaking}} after a jump), so several different years, make (Chevy/GMC) and model trucks are used during the show's initial run. As a result, there are some inconsistencies in the episodes. For instance, in the pilot episode the truck (a 1980 model) has two square headlights and a light tan interior. For {{the remainder of the}} series, it almost always had the quad headlight configuration of the 1981-1987 models, with a dark brown interior. The truck usually appeared to be a long bed model, but sometimes a short bed model was used. The truck was powered by a stock 350 V8 and Turbo 350 automatic transmission. After destroying several trucks due to the huge jumps, a custom built jump truck was built as a solution. It had a reinforced frame and heavy duty axle trusses, dual shocks all around, <b>suspension</b> limiting <b>straps,</b> lift blocks, and a steel weight box in the bed (which was loaded with up to 800 lbs of lead for a jump) and a mid-mounted engine that actually sat {{in the middle of the}} cab. This greatly reduced the number of trucks scrapped during the show's production.|$|R

McCulloch Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA PURPOSE: An {{increased}} quadriceps to hamstring muscle activation ratio (Q:H) is {{a significant}} predictor of anterior cruciate ligament injuries for females. To reduce the risk of injury, instability exercise has been implemented in training programs for the perceived benefits of increased neuromuscular activation. In particular, instability systems using <b>suspension</b> <b>straps</b> to create unstable environments for either the upper or lower extremities have become increasingly popular, although the direct implications remain unclear. Our objective was to determine the effect of instability introduced by a suspension system during single-leg side lunges and if that instability would increase the activation of the hamstrings, subsequently decreasing the Q:H as hypothesized. METHODS: Seventeen physically fit female subjects (18 - 23 years) were asked to volunteer for the study. Two different types of single-leg side lunges were performed; one using a suspension exercise system (SLSUS) and the other using a stationary box (SLBOX). Two sets of three repetitions of each lunge were performed to maximal knee flexion. Electromyography (EMG) was used to measure muscle activation during both the eccentric and concentric phases of the lunge. Motion capture analysis was used to evaluate frontal plane motion and knee flexion angle in the sagittal plane. Medial/lateral (M/L) knee motion in the frontal plane was normalized as a percentage of hip motion. Paired t-tests were conducted between trials to compare frontal and sagittal plane postural sway and knee flexion angle. EMG SLSUS trials were normalized to SLBOX trials and compared using one sample t-tests. RESULTS: Participants reached a greater degree of knee flexion during the SLSUS compared to the SLBOX (75. 03 ° ± 8. 7 ° vs. 70. 3 °, ± 8. 7 ° p = 0. 005; all values reported as mean ± SD). Greater M/L normalized knee motion was observed when performing SLSUS compared to SLBOX (267 % ± 22 % of hip motion vs. 172 % ± 13 % of hip motion, p = 0. 021). The rectus femoris and the semimembranosus/semitendinosus showed greater peak activation during the suspension trials (1. 19 % ± 0. 29 %, p = 0. 014; 1. 30 % ± 0. 37 %, p = 0. 004). No differences were found for Q:H ratio between lunge modalities. The biceps femoris showed more muscle activation during the concentric phase of the suspension trials versus the box trials (1. 13 % ±. 21 %, p = 0. 021). CONCLUSION: Although there was no decrease in the Q:H ratio, the instability created by the suspension exercise increased hamstring activation more than quadriceps activation. Our findings suggest suspension exercise can be a beneficial exercise based on its ability to achieve higher activation of knee stabilizing muscles...|$|R
50|$|Silver Cross is {{well known}} for the {{manufacture}} of traditional coach-built prams, characterised by a hard body, C-spring suspension, spoked wheels and folding hood. This method of pram building was pioneered by William Wilson, an engineer and inventor from Leeds, England. Wilson went on to establish Silver Cross in 1877, marketing this type of coach-built baby carriage, and registering numerous patents for perambulator design in order to protect his unique invention. Despite refinements in techniques and manufacturing processes, the method of pram building today remains very similar to early pram building, with body panels being pressed from aluminium, riveted together and then painted to a high gloss finish. The body is then hand upholstered with a pram bed, and also decorated with fine line detail (in kind with fine lines applied to the coachwork of horse-drawn carriages - hence the term coach-built pram). The fine lines are hand painted and require considerable skill to apply. The steel suspension of the pram is hand bent around a specially shaped form in order to create the C-shaped suspension members, which are then attached to the body using leather straps. It is the C-spring <b>suspension</b> and leather <b>straps</b> that create the unique coach-built pram 'bounce'. The spoked wheels (traditionally chromed) are then attached to the suspension to complete the rolling chassis. Traditional pram wheels are large in diameter to further enhance the smooth ride. A folding fabric hood, pushing handle and covering fabric apron are then attached to the pram to complete the build. Silver Cross also manufactures a collection of coach-built dolls prams, which are scaled-down replicas of the full size prams. The dolls prams are made {{in exactly the same way}} as the real prams with the same coachwork, spoked wheels and folding hood. Silver Cross currently manufactures two models of full-size coach-built pram in the UK, the Balmoral and the Kensington, as well as two models of dolls pram, the Oberon and the Chatsworth. Silver Cross is the only pram manufacturer still producing coach-built prams in the UK.|$|R
