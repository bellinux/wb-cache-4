40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse virtual consortia in the {{construction}} sector. Focusing on the bidding/tendering process, we review the existing information systems over the Internet that support this process. Our results show that although there are {{a substantial number of}} systems that support searching for calls for tenders, few of them provide support for other vital items of the bidding/tendering process, such as robust collaboration facilities for the virtual consortium formation and for the management of the bid. We then present the <b>SupplyPoint</b> system, which has been developed in order to electronically support and automate the whole tendering/bidding process of virtual consortia. <b>Supplypoint</b> provides - in addition to what existing systems already do - a collaboration platform that facilitates, in a virtual manner, the formation of consortia. 1...|$|E
40|$|The tendering/bidding {{process is}} vital for {{companies}} in the construction sector, This sector includes a number of actors performing at each stage of the process three different roles (client, info provider, provider). Based oil e-commerce technologies numerous systems have been developed, aiming at the electronic support of this process. A short review of those systems indicates that they mainly focus oil providing information about tenders. However, they don't cover much of the bidding process, where {{the formation of a}} virtual consortium is often required and the preparation of the final bidding document requires bids from subcontractors and suppliers. <b>SupplyPoint</b> is an innovative European-wide research and development effort partly funded by the European Commission under the ESPRIT Programme. The <b>SupplyPoint</b> system will support the whole tendering and bidding process, electronically providing - in addition to what existing systems provide - services for forming virtual consortia that bid for construction projects...|$|E
40|$|Work in today's {{economic}} organisations {{is either}} performed through {{the execution of}} continuous operations or through the implementation of one-off projects; hence one can distinguish between "operation-centric" and "project-centric" business environments. New {{information and communication technologies}} facilitate the introduction of innovative organisational structures in both environments. Based on the term "virtual organisation", which is used for describing the new organisational structures in operation-centric environments, we introduce the term "virtual consortium" for project-centric ones and provide an analysis of the business processes of a virtual consortium. We concentrate in the construction sector, {{as one of the most}} suitable application domains to test the new concept and related systems. Focusing on one of the most critical processes of a virtual consortium, the bidding/tendering process, we review the existing information systems available on the Internet, which support this process for construction projects. Our results show that although there are a substantial number of systems that support searching for call for tenders, few of them provide support for other vital elements of the bidding/tendering process, such as robust collaboration facilities for the virtual consortium formation and for the management of the bid.

In "Kure City" (about 240, 000 population), qKo (ratio of fire-spreading by water <b>supplypoints)</b> is calculated greater than pKo (ratio of fire-spreading by fire engines). This "Ko" may beone of the effective estimation factors and useful calculating methods of water-networks for fireflows...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of e-business {{in the past}} few years has introduced new ways for organisations to perform standard processes. In the construction sector most of the efforts have been focused on the tendering and bidding process. As a result many electronic tendering systems have already been developed and are currently in use, mainly in the USA, Canada, Europe and Australia, supporting basically the search for tenders and the acquisition of tender documents. The <b>SupplyPoint</b> system has been developed in order to electronically support and automate the whole tendering/bidding process providing, in addition to search facilities of current systems, a collaboration platform that could support - in a virtual manner - the formation of consortia. The system is partly funded by the European Commission under the ESPRIT Programme (EP- 27007) and is currently under the final stage of development and testing. 1...|$|E
