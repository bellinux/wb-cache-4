The upper terrace of the Northern Palace included living quarters for the king and a semicircular portico to provide a view of the area. A stairway on the west side led down to the middle terrace that was a decorative circular reception hall. The lower terrace was also for receptions and banquets. It was enclosed on all four sides with porticos and included a Roman bathhouse.|$|E

40|$|The <b>storage</b> ring <b>complex</b> at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI {{consists}} of the Collector Ring CR, the accumulator/decelerator ring RESR and the New Experimental Storage Ring NESR. An additional High Energy Storage Ring HESR serves experiments with high energy antiprotons. The CR serves for fast stochastic precooling of antiproton and rare isotope (RI) beams. Additionally {{it will be used}} for isochronous mass measurement of very short-lived radioactive nuclei. For experiments with RI beams, the RESR serves as a decelerator ring. For the physics program with antiprotons the RESR is used to accumulate high intensity antiproton beams. The NESR {{will be one of the}} main instruments for nuclear and atomic physics. In the case of antiproton operation, the NESR could be used to decelerate injected beams for experiments with low energy antiprotons.

40|$|In this article, we {{demonstrate}} {{the connection between}} intracellular iron storage and oxidative stress response in cyanobacteria. Iron {{is essential for the}} survival of all organisms. However, the redox properties that make iron a valuable cofactor also lead to oxidative interactions, resulting in the formation of harmful radicals. Therefore, iron accumulation in cells should be tightly regulated, a process in which ferritin family proteins play an important role. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains two ferritin-type <b>storage</b> <b>complexes,</b> bacterioferritin and MrgA. Previous studies demonstrated the role of bacterioferritin and MrgA in iron storage. In addition, MrgA was found to {{play a key role in}} oxidative stress response. Here, we examined the dual role of the ferritin family proteins using physiological and transcriptomic approaches. Microarray analysis of iron-limited wild-type and ΔmrgA cultures revealed a substantial up-regulation of oxidative stress-related genes in mutant cells. The PerR regulator was found to play an important role in that process. Furthermore, we were able to {{demonstrate the}} connection between internal iron quota, the presence of the two <b>storage</b> <b>complexes,</b> and the sensitivity to externally applied oxidative stress. These data suggest a pivotal role for the ferritin-type proteins of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in coordinating iron homeostasis and in oxidative stress response. The combined action of the two complexes allows for the safe accumulation and release of iron from storage by minimizing damage resulting from interactions between reduced iron and the oxygen radicals that are produced in abundance by the photosynthetic apparatus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Large-scale e-Science {{experiments}} present unprecedented {{data handling}} requirements with their multi-petabyte data <b>storages.</b> <b>Complex</b> software applications, {{such as the}} ATLAS High Energy Physics experiment at CERN, run throughout Grid computing sites {{around the world in}} a distributed environment, with scientists performing concurrent analysis on data and producing new data products shared among the collaboration. In this paper, we introduce a multi-phase infrastructure to achieve data provenance for an e-Science experiment. We propose an infrastructure to integrate provenance onto an existing legacy application with strong emphasis on scalability and explore the relationship between provenance and metadata introducing a model where data provenance is made available as metadata through a separate reasoning phase. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Photochemical {{properties}} of transition metal complexes are dis— cussed {{as they relate}} to possible schemes for energy <b>storage.</b> <b>Complexes</b> of copper(I) with r—acceptor ligamds have been used to sensitize isomeri— zations of organic molecules, and there is room for considerable further investigation in this area. Electron transfer reactions have been more intensively studied. These reactions fall into three broad categories: ionization, oxidative addition/reductive elimination, and excited state electron transfer. Experiments in the first two categories have ierally led to rather poor storage efficiency and have required ultraviolet light. But long—lived excited states of coordination compounds can participate in chemical reactions with high efficiency, and such systems are promising for solar energy storage. Specific systems of this type that are discussed in detail involve electron transfer quenching of the lowest emissive excited states of Ru(2, 2 '_bipyridine), M (diisocyanoalkane) (M=Rh,Ir), and Mo 6 Cl. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the structure of visuospatial memory in adulthood. Adults 40 – 89 years of age (n= 160) performed simple <b>storage</b> and <b>complex</b> visuospatial span tasks. Simple storage tasks were distinguished into three presentation formats: (i) visual, which involved maintaining shapes and textures; (ii) spatial-sequential, which involved maintaining sequentially-presented locations; and (iii) spatialsimultaneous, which involved maintaining patterns of locations. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that, among the domain-differentiated models, the one considering visuospatial memory in its simple visual, spatial-sequential and spatial-simultaneous components and complex visuospatial memory yielded a good fit to our data. Structural equation modeling also showed that age had a direct effect on visual, spatialsequential and spatial-simultaneous memory, and on complex visuospatial memory. Altogether these results suggest the importance of considering both the type of processing involved (in simple <b>storage</b> vs. <b>complex</b> visuospatial tasks) and the presentation format of the stimuli in the visuospatial domain...|$|R
