500|$|It surpassed {{anything}} that I ever thought. [...] I didn't {{ever think that}} I {{should be in the}} cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. [...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head, but <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{although}} it was a little sadly.|$|E
60|$|I stopped, {{and looked}} up at Giuliana. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through unshed tears that {{magnified}} her matchless eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... - Well; {{she knew}} nothing thereof did she survive, And {{suffered}} nothing if numbered among the dead; [...] Yet--yet--if on earth alive Did she feel a smart, and with vague strange anguish strive? If in heaven, did <b>she</b> <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sadly and shake her head? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with placid amicability. I was {{a little}} taken aback and hesitated.|$|R
60|$|She flung {{herself down}} on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a plate of {{sandwiches}} <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{a little}} curiously. All the time I felt somehow {{that she was}} taking very careful note of my answers.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It was {{wonderful}} {{what a difference}} the smile made in her face. To me she seemed at that moment radiantly beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, [...] "I'm {{willing to}} try." [...] <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "And I have more faith than you, Hugh. I think we'll succeed."....|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, {{it is of}} {{no great}} consequence, <b>at</b> any rate.' <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> back <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> closed my door, and {{a few moments later}} I heard her key turn in the lock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{the moon}} rose I {{returned}} {{to the same place}} and sought for the house, but it was no longer there. When I saw that, I knew who the woman was, and wherefore <b>she</b> had <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{mean the}} spirit now {{standing}} behind you led me here. She says {{her name is}} Margaret Bartol. She said: 'Comfort my dear husband. Restore his faith.' <b>She</b> is <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> wants me to go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a little}} sarcasm, and added: [...] "You always thought more of him than anybody, didn't you? Ah, well, come up and see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I didn't--I didn't taunt you, now, did I?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{with head}} {{inclined}} to her slim shoulder, {{as if in}} mimicry of my ivory Hypnos.|$|E
6000|$|... “Now don’t {{say that}} this is what you get for {{bringing}} a woman along,” she said. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> whimsically, gloriously, and I knew {{there was no need for}} forgiveness.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{tried to}} <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through her tears. We {{were in the}} old sitting-room, {{surrounded}} by the books.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll make George take me," [...] {{she went}} on as Mrs. Saltram came up to {{interrupt}} us. She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as <b>she</b> had <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and, addressing the question to her, continued: [...] "But {{the chance of a}} lecture--one of the wonderful lectures? Isn't there another course announced?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, she knew, then, {{that the}} touch of your hand would cause sleep, that sleep would save her," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>smiling</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|But she {{had turned}} aside her sallow, long face, and did not hear what I said. Suddenly again she looked at me. She was searching. And {{at the same time}} <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and her eyes looked softly, darkly, with {{infinite}} trustful humility into mine. I was being cajoled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Belike," [...] said Charlotte, [...] "that is some holy relic, to which, maybe, you owe {{your present}} recovery. Surely, {{when you are}} whole again, you have vowed a pilgrimage to the shrine of the saint, your friend?" [...] Here <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> gaily, for she was a right merry damsel, and a goodly.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘She {{would do}} very well for my place of {{business}} in Havana,’ said the Señora Mendizabal, once more studying me through her glasses; ‘and I should take a pleasure,’ she pursued, more directly addressing myself, ‘in bringing you acquainted with a whip.’ And <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a savoury lust of cruelty upon her face.|$|E
60|$|The {{next thing}} I noticed {{was that a}} great {{mellowness}} had descended upon {{the mother of the}} last of his race. But these terms, irritation, mellowness, appeared gross when applied to her. It is impossible to give an idea of the refinement and subtlety of all her transformations. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> faintly <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A little woman, about 5'3", 65 years old, {{in a big}} church hat, {{with big}} glasses, <b>she’s</b> <b>smiling</b> right <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> says, ‘Fired up!’ I jumped, but {{everyone}} acted like this was normal. They all said, ‘Fired up!’ We hear the same voice saying, ‘Ready to go!’ And the people, they all say, ‘Ready to go!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Spartan girl! Proud Lucy!" [...] <b>she</b> would say, <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Graham {{says you}} are the most peculiar, capricious little woman he knows; but yet you are excellent; we both think so." ...|$|R
60|$|She gave {{a little}} shrug to her slim {{shoulders}} as <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and she seemed not a whit disturbed concerning the conversation with his Excellency. I wondered whether this were birth, or training, or both, or a natural {{ability to cope with}} affairs. The women of her order had long been used to intercede with sovereigns, to play a part in matters of state. Suddenly I became aware that she was looking at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the real}} joy of that feast was that Miss Sterling. Just a little trick she was, not bigger than two bits' worth of chewing plug; {{but she had}} a way about her that seemed to say she was the people, and you {{believed}} it. And yet, she never put on any airs, and <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> the same as if I was a millionaire while I was telling about a Creek dog feast and listened like it was news from home.|$|E
6000|$|I looked {{among the}} letters lying between {{the pages of}} the book. Most of them were signed simply [...] "Chris." [...] or [...] "Christopher." [...] But one gave his name in full, and it was a name I know well as that of a famous man, whose hand I have often shaken. I thought of his hard-featured, {{handsome}} wife, and of his great chill place, half house, half exhibition, in Kensington, filled constantly with its smart, chattering set, among whom he seemed always to be the uninvited guest; of his weary face and bitter tongue. And thinking thus there rose up before me the sweet, sad face of the woman of the miniature, and, meeting her eyes as <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from out of the shadows, I looked at her my wonder.|$|E
6000|$|... "You artists have--such strange ideas," [...] <b>she</b> remarked, <b>smiling</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You wish Isobel {{to remain}} a child of nature, perhaps. Yet you must admit that a few lessons in deportment would be of advantage." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{asked her}} if she could make the descent alone--if she were not afraid. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> bravely and shrugged her shoulders. She afraid! So {{beautiful}} is she that I am always having difficulty in remembering that she is a primitive, half-savage cave girl of the stone age, and often find myself mentally limiting her capacities to those of the effete and overcivilized beauties of the outer crust.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the connection of}} rapport and autoethnography. Focusing on her own ethnographic work, the author explores how including her own stories in her ethnographies complexifies the narratives told about the field and increases rapport {{between her and her}} participants. The author {{addresses the}} benefits and ethical implica-tions of this method, using descriptions and examples not only from her work but from work others have done. The author’s hope is to show not only how an autoethnographic method allows her to be more empathic toward those engaged in her study but also how sharing her stories with her field participants fosters their openness as well. For the past 2 years, I have been conducting fieldwork at Dalet Shalom Messianic Congregation, where congregants believe that cultural and ethnic ties to Judaism can be retained while recognizing that Jesus (to whom they refer in Hebrew as Yeshua) is the Messiah. Now, at a Messianic conference, I find myself sitting with Carol, one of Dalet Shalom’s congregants. Carol and I, although friendly to each other, have never had an in-depth conversation. <b>She</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now. “I’m so glad you were able to come to the conference! Isn’t i...|$|R
60|$|I went out, as I had proposed, to {{meet the}} {{messenger}} with my letter from London at the lodge gate. On the stairs I saw no one. In the hall I heard the Count still exercising his birds. But on crossing the quadrangle outside, I passed Madame Fosco, walking by herself in her favourite circle, round and round the great fish-pond. I at once slackened my pace, {{so as to avoid}} all appearance of being in a hurry, and even went the length, for caution's sake, of inquiring if she thought of going out before lunch. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in the friendliest manner--said she preferred remaining near the house, nodded pleasantly, and re-entered the hall. I looked back, and saw that she had closed the door before I had opened the wicket {{by the side of the}} carriage gates.|$|E
6000|$|I grew {{a little}} {{weary of the}} {{beautiful}} snow {{in the days that}} followed my first talk with Mr Crimble, and fretted at the close air of the house. The last day of the year the wind was still in the north. It perplexed me that the pride which from my seed had sprung up in Fanny, and had prevented her from taking part in the parish concert, yet allowed her to attend it. She set off thickly veiled. Not even Mr Crimble's spectacles were likely to pierce her disguise. I had written a little letter the afternoon before and had myself handed it to Mrs Bowater with a large fork of mistletoe from my Christmas bunch. It was an invitation to herself and Fanny to sit with me and [...] "see in" [...] the New Year. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> over it--still her tranquil, though neglected self--and I was half-satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was a bad}} day for me," [...] he said, {{speaking}} {{slowly and}} painfully. [...] "A bad thing for me when that legacy came. I thought I'd see Paris, do the thing--like a toff. And I heard 'Alcide' sing, and that little dance she did. I was in the front row, and I fancied <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Lord, what a state I was in! Night after night I sat there, I watched her come in, I watched her go. She dropped a flower--it's in my pocket-book now. I couldn't rest or eat or sleep. I made Hainault's acquaintance, stood him drinks, lent him money. He shook his head all the time. Annabel Pellissier was not like the others, he said. She had a few acquaintances, English gentlemen, but she lived with her sister--was a lady. But one day he came to me. It was Celeste's idea. I could be presented as Meysey Hill. We were alike. He was--a millionaire. And I passed myself off as Meysey Hill, and since--then--I haven't had a minute's peace. God help me." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the fifth}} night, when {{the place was}} fairly packed and looked {{for all the world}} like Oddy's or Romano's, and me and the two young fellers helping me was working double tides, I {{suddenly}} understood, and I went up to Katie and, bending over her very respectful with a bottle, I whispers, 'Hot stuff, kid. This is a jolly fine boom you're working for the old place.' And by the way <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> back <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I seen I had guessed right.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, if I didn't {{know you}} so well I believe I {{should have given}} in long ago. I'm not {{thinking}} of you alone, but of myself, too. I'm afraid I shouldn't be happy, that I should begin to think--and then I couldn't stop. The plain truth, as I've told you over and over again, is that I'm not big enough." [...] <b>She</b> continued <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> a <b>smile</b> on which I {{could not bear to}} look. [...] "I was wrong not to have gone away," [...] I heard her say. [...] "I will go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was one of}} my men, was he not? And he {{has made}} game of me to his wench. He has told her things about me. He has made me foolish in her eyes. Yes, yes, I can read it in her saffron face and in her watery eyes when we meet at the church door on Sundays. <b>She</b> smiles--yes, <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>me!</b> Nigel, go to him! Do not slay him, nor even wound him, but lay his face open with thy riding-whip, and then come back to me and tell me how I can serve you." ...|$|R
