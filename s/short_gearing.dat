50|$|From the 1997 launch, {{and until}} 2001, the Latin American Ka was {{substantially}} {{similar to the}} European Ka, differing only in levels of equipment and trim. The main differences from the European model were the very <b>short</b> <b>gearing</b> for the manual gearbox (the only transmission available) {{and the lack of}} soundproofing, which had been gradually removed annually since 2000 as a way to cut down costs, following the practice of other Brazilian car makers at the time.|$|E
50|$|Gearbox {{synchromesh}} {{changed to}} Borg Warner design and <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> lever, improving driveability on manual transmission cars.|$|R
5000|$|EX hatchback/coupe/sedan: <b>Shorter</b> <b>gearing</b> {{than all}} the {{variants}} save for the Si with a 4.25 final drive ...|$|R
50|$|Si Coupe: <b>Shortest</b> <b>gearing</b> {{of all the}} 6th {{generation}} Honda Civics, 4.266 final drive, {{available in}} manual transmission only.|$|R
5000|$|... gearbox: Ricardo JH3 5 speeds gearbox + reverse gear, option - gearbox with <b>short</b> <b>gears</b> {{and main}} gear 4.5 ...|$|R
50|$|For the DX/LX/EX Civics {{equipped}} with automatic transmissions, {{the only difference}} between the DX/LX vs. the EX is that the EX has slightly <b>shorter</b> <b>gearing</b> in 1st-3rd gear but otherwise shares same 0.638 4th gear ratio and 4.357 final drive ratio.|$|R
50|$|Other {{issues can}} stem from inequities or resentment caused by bargained for {{benefits}} career firefighters receive under contract including training wages, <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> rotations, clothing allowances, and overtime pay. Sometimes starting volunteer firefighters {{are perceived as}} using their volunteer positions as stepping stones to full-time career positions.|$|R
50|$|The main {{features}} are rear monoshock rear suspension, a manual five-speed <b>short</b> <b>gear</b> ratio transmission, dual camshaft engine, lightweight chassis construction, 17 inch alloy cast wheels and front disc brake, {{most of which}} are rarely found in underbones. Some suzuki FX125s were supplied with spoked wheels.|$|R
2500|$|The 1965 (and {{optional}} in 1966) Riviera Gran Sport {{also came}} with a 425 cubic [...] "Super Wildcat" [...] engine, with dual carbs and dual snorkel chrome air cleaner. You could add H2 option (Ride and handling package) for even better road handling. <b>Shorter</b> <b>gear</b> ratio for steering, 1inch lower suspension.|$|R
5000|$|The fastest autocross {{cars are}} {{purpose-built}} [...] "specials" [...] (A Modified in SCCA Solo) with small lightweight bodies, sticky tires, wild wings, powerful engines, and <b>short</b> <b>gears.</b> While their top speeds are typically limited by gearing, their transient cornering capabilities far exceed those of vehicles not expressly designed for autocross use.|$|R

50|$|Twin Clutch SST (Sport- or Sportronic Shift Transmission) is {{the brand}} name of a {{six-speed}} dual clutch transmission developed by Getrag for Mitsubishi Motors. The system was first incorporated in the 2008 Lancer Evolution X, and {{was designed to be}} a more performance-oriented system than that developed by rival manufacturers, with <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> ratios optimized for acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|The new Clio III drew {{technology}} from Formula One, including a rear diffuser and brake cooling side vents, they upgraded the engine, now to [...] The car is heavier than its predecessor, but the acceleration figures are slightly improved {{due to a}} combination of more power, torque and the new six-speed gearbox with <b>shorter</b> <b>gearing</b> according to the official figures published on the Renaultsport website www.renaultsport.co.uk.|$|R
50|$|The 2006 Volvo FL {{transmission}} is {{offered as a}} Manual made by ZF from its Eco Mid series or Automatic by Allison. The Volvo FL is available with two overdrive manual gearboxes, one with 6 gears {{and the other with}} 9. The gearboxes are servo-assisted and light in operation, with a <b>short</b> <b>gear</b> lever. The lever is vibration-free and has a short throw and a very well-defined shift pattern.|$|R
50|$|Like other Celicas, the GT-Four {{received}} {{minor changes}} in August 1991 for the 1992 model year. This facelift included the new Toyota ellipse emblems {{on the hood}} and trunk, restyled tail lights with smoked red frame, and <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> shift. The Japanese models also got round-shape front fog lights. The All-Trac Turbo retained the automatic air conditioner, but the fan switch was changed from the push button type to the more conventional rotary type.|$|R
5000|$|Vauxhall {{offered the}} Monaro buyer a limited edition prior to {{discontinuation}} of the model: the VXR 500. A Harrop supercharger was installed onto the standard GM 6.0 LS2 engine by Vauxhall dealer Greens of Rainham {{in conjunction with}} tuning firm Wortec, increasing power to [...] and torque to 677 N·m (500 lbf·ft). In addition to this, a <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> linkage was added to enable quicker shifts. The resultant 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) was 4.8 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Its {{popularity}} in South East Asia, mainly in Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines, {{is due to}} its price—around US$1850 (94,000 to 95,001 pesos or around 16,500,001 rupiah in Indonesia). The main features are full-length front shock, rear monoshock suspension, six-speed <b>short</b> <b>gear</b> ratio transmission, dual camshaft engine, lightweight chassis construction, alloy cast wheel, large-diameter front disc brake, and a rear disc brake, which is rarely found in underbones. The top speed of stock Raider 150 is between 125 and 155 kilometers per hour.|$|R
5000|$|A lightly revised A111 was {{introduced}} at the 52nd Turin Motor Show in October/November 1970. A distinguishing feature of these [...] "series 2" [...] cars were double-stacked tail lamps, {{of the same}} design seen on the original A111. New bumpers gained rubbing strips but dispensed with the over-riders (bringing overall length to less than four metres), there was new model badging on the tail, and the interior was partly redesigned, including a new centre console and a <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> shifter.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the 403, the 404 and 405 had an {{improved}} gearbox with much <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> lever which improved what was already {{by the standards}} of the day a very slick gearchange. The 405, though not the 404, had overdrive as standard apart from the earliest models, and front disc brakes became an option apart from the earliest models, and were fitted to almost all 405 drophead coupés. A few late 405s were fitted with the torquier 2.2 litre engine introduced in the later 406.|$|R
50|$|Other {{upgrades}} {{included the}} introduction of a larger 64 L fuel tank, <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> lever throw on the manual gearbox, relocation of the dipswitch from under the brake pedal to the high left of the firewall, and the windscreen wiper motor was relocated to the engine side of the firewall — greatly reducing wiper noise. All models benefited from additional safety features (some compulsory under new Australian Design Rules, or ADRs) such as dual circuit brakes with a tandem master cylinder, double sided safety rims, front seat belts and front power disc brakes on V8 models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, it {{was called}} Riviera Gran Sport and the later models were still officially called Gran Sport but showed GS badges instead of Gran Sport.Unlike the {{mid-size}} GS models, the Riviera and Wildcat GS package included a standard 3.42 positraction rear axle until 1973.The 1965 (and optional in 1966) Riviera Gran Sport also came with a 425 cubic [...] "Super Wildcat" [...] engine, with dual carbs and dual snorkel chrome air cleaner. You could add H2 option (Ride and handling package) for even better road handling. <b>Shorter</b> <b>gear</b> ratio for steering, 1 inch lower suspension.|$|R
50|$|For testing purposes, units E.645.016 and 017 {{were built}} {{with an even}} <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> ratio (20/69), that allowed a maximum speed of 110 km/h. These units were {{intended}} {{to be used for}} hauling heavy trains on steep lines. This modify was not applied on other E645s, however units 016 and 017 remained on regular service with their gear ratio for many years. Unit 016 was scrapped prematurely, as being involved in Murazze di Vado (see below) accident in 1978, while unit 017 reverted to the usual 21/68 ratio {{in the first half of}} the 1990s; however it retained the shorter roncola with considerably less notches than the usual E.645/6 ones.|$|R
5000|$|The WRX {{debuted in}} November 1992 with [...] The center {{differential}} was a viscous coupling type, the rear {{limited slip differential}} was a viscous type. The WRX Type RA is a stripped down version of the WRX that was available in the Japanese market for people to purchase for motorsports and tuning. Targeted for race and rally, the RA versions were generally lighter in weight; featuring reduced soundproofing, manual windows, no air conditioning, no anti-lock brakes, and added racing features such as more robust engines, driver controlled center differentials, and <b>shorter</b> <b>gearing.</b> The WRX Type RA uses a closer ratio gearbox and a three-spoke leather steering wheel from Nardi.|$|R

50|$|Exclusive to the Scion tC: {{note the}} {{slightly}} <b>shorter</b> 5th <b>gear,</b> and much <b>shorter</b> final drive {{compared to the}} Camry E351. Please, do not confuse the E35x for the E153. The E35x has a completely different transaxle case.|$|R
50|$|Subjects {{taught at}} the school include communications, the {{creative}} industries, event management, interactive media, journalism, photography, popular music, public relations, radio, and television. Alongside provision for undergraduate and postgraduate education, the school teaches <b>short</b> courses <b>geared</b> towards the media industry.|$|R
2500|$|A noted comedy routine between Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis {{involved}} Lewis (in boxing <b>shorts</b> and <b>gear)</b> {{stating that}} he's fighting Gene Tierney. [...] This {{plays on the}} similarly named Gene Tunney, who held the world heavyweight boxing title from 1926 to 1928.|$|R
50|$|She {{wrote the}} short story The Face of An Arab Woman in 1993, earning her the Creativity Award from Al Jasra Cultural and Social Club in 2001. In 1999, she co-authored a {{collection}} of <b>short</b> stories, <b>geared</b> mainly towards children, with Saudi author Khalil Al-Fazie.|$|R
5000|$|By 2012, RCM's staff {{included}} a creative director, two designers, a social media manager, a copywriter, and a developer. That year, the Austin-based content management consultancy DigitHaus named RCM the design agency for its app division, and Sirena Water Wear named RCM its agency of record {{to promote a}} line of tailored <b>shorts</b> <b>geared</b> for fishing. In 2013, the company announced an expansion of its strategy department, providing lead generation messaging, media buying, radio advertising, and social media marketing campaigns. RCM confirmed Austin Urology Institute, National Instruments (NI), ShoreTel, and Texas Disposal Systems as recent clients. NI Alliance Partner Network endorsed RCM as a [...] "trusted service provider" [...] and invited the company to NI Alliance Day to discuss with network members how marketing techniques can help leaders in the engineering industry.|$|R
5000|$|The Apollo was {{essentially}} a re-branded Ford Verona sold from 1990 to 1992. More expensive and marketed as a sportier model, it was only available with the 1.8 L AP engine. Compared with the Verona, it has only minor differences. These are <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> ratios, stiffer shock absorbers, different dashboard with orange lightning (unlike the Verona, the Apollo do not share its dashboard with the Escort [...] ), smoked tail lights very seemed to the ones from the Ford Sapphire, chrome-less rear window frames, fixed-height front seats, painted mirrors (GLS trim) and airfoil. During the first model years, its front turn signals had clear lenses while the Verona had orange lenses. [...] Trim levels were GL (base model) and GLS. A special edition named VIP was released in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Green started {{producing}} in 2012, {{using his}} laptop. He composed and recorded the album {{over the course}} of two years while touring with alt-J, in hotel rooms. In the process, he used Ableton Live and a <b>short</b> music <b>gear,</b> including Bass Station II and OP-1 synthesisers, a H2n recorder, and a Game Boy.|$|R
50|$|In 1930 {{the mass}} {{production}} was started, with a first series of 85 units. In the meantime the E.625 were re-converted to E.626. In 1934-1938 {{a record number}} of 308 units was built, while in 1939 the last series, with <b>short</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, was shipped (they were later standardized). The new E636 of the 1940s initially shared the motors and part of the electro-mechanic devices with the E.626.After the destruction of the World War II, in 1946 an updating and repairing program was launched, while other units remained in the countries previously occupied by Italy. 17 locomotives were ceded to the Yugoslavian Railways (Class E361) and, in 1958, 4 were given to Czechoslovakia (Class E 666.0). Now inadequate to the passenger role, the E.626 were transferred to the cargo service, apart several commuter trains in some areas of Italy.|$|R
5000|$|The 505 {{was praised}} by {{contemporary}} journalists for its ride and handling, especially on rough and unmade roads; perhaps {{one reason for}} its popularity in less developed countries; - [...] "Remember that the 505´s predecessor, the 504, had an outstanding ride. It took a British-market model on a hard charging drive across the green lanes of the Chilterns. The impacts were well suppressed and the car veritably floated over the undulations and potholes. I concluded that the 505 {{is as good as}} the 504 (but no better)." [...] The 505 also had good ground clearance; if it wasn't enough though, Dangel offered a taller four-wheel drive version of the 505 estate equipped with either the intercooled turbodiesel 110 hp (81 kW) engine or the 130 hp 2.2 L petrol (96 kW) engine. The four-wheel drive 505 also had <b>shorter</b> <b>gear</b> ratios.|$|R
5000|$|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had {{a comedy}} routine in which Lewis (in boxing <b>shorts</b> and <b>gear)</b> states he's fight'n Gene Tierney (the actress). Martin corrects Lewis and {{suggests}} that he must mean [...] "Gene Tunney." [...] Lewis then quips [...] "You fight who you wanna fight, I'm fight'n who I wanna fight, I'm fight'n Gene Tierney." ...|$|R
25|$|On 4 July 2016 Evans {{announced}} that he had stepped down as presenter of the show and cutting his contract with Top <b>Gear</b> <b>short</b> by two years.|$|R
25|$|The XT-37 was aerodynamically clean, {{so much so}} that a speedbrake {{was fitted}} behind the {{nosewheel}} doors to help increase drag for landing and for use in other phases of flight. Since the <b>short</b> landing <b>gear</b> placed the engine air intakes close to the ground, screens pivoted over the intakes from underneath when the landing gear was extended, to prevent foreign object damage.|$|R
