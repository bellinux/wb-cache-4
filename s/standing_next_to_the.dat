5|$|The captain puts Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{in charge}} of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who has brought his girlfriend Katy Moore (Amy Adams) on the cruise with him, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their {{significant}} others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a life vest and jump off the ship, the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{developed}} a new ploy for the 1967–68 season by <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> goalkeeper during corners {{to prevent him from}} coming out to collect the ball; this created havoc for opposition defences and is still a frequently used tactic in the modern era. However, for the second successive season Leeds finished fourth and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals, this time losing 1–0 to Everton at Old Trafford. They finally won major honours though by beating Arsenal 1–0 in the final of the League Cup; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of the game despite allegations that Charlton pushed goalkeeper Jim Furnell in the build up to the goal. Leeds then went on to lift the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after beating CA Spora Luxembourg, FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland) and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final with Hungarian club Ferencvárosi. They won 1–0 at Elland Road and drew 0–0 in Budapest to claim their first European trophy.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E

500|$|On August 23, 2008, a California Highway Patrol ("CHP") {{dispatcher}} in Humboldt County, California {{received a}} 911 call from an anonymous caller. According to the dispatcher, the caller reported a silver Ford F150 pickup with {{the license plate}} number [...] "8D94925" [...] ran them off the highway. The caller stated that the truck was last seen heading southbound on California State Route 1. CHP dispatchers relayed the report to officers in the geographic area, and the vehicle was soon spotted traveling southbound at mile marker 66 near Fort Bragg, California. Officers pulled over the vehicle and discovered that Lorenzo Prado Navarette and Jose Prado Navarette were the only occupants. After <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cab of the pickup truck, the officers noticed [...] "a very distinct smell of marijuana coming from the vehicle".

She had leather strips painstakingly braided into her hair to blend with her dark roots. The frizzy afro she sports halfway through the video was actually a hairpiece. During {{the middle of the}} video, Madonna and her dancers appear in a series of boxes, trying to break free.

500|$|Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews {{is portrayed}} as a very kind and {{pleasant}} man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, {{that it is a}} [...] "mathematical certainty" [...] that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this {{has become one of the}} most famous legends of the sinking of the Titanic, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat n. 15 at approximately 1:40a.m. There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation. Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to use as floating devices. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship at the last moment.|$|E

2500|$|The castle {{itself was}} {{described}} as having a long causeway which wound up to the great gate of the fortress itself. [...] Inside the keep there were stables and an armoury, {{as well as a}} great hall in the rear which was dug out of the mountainside. [...] There also was a great tower (the Hornburg) the top of which consisted of the great horn of Helm Hammerhand. [...] The Deep, which {{was described as}} <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fortress, was barred by the long Deeping Wall, which was described as consisting of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed water from the Deeping Stream to enter; this rendered a fresh supply in sieges of great length. The Deeping Wall itself is described as standing 20 feet tall; and also being wide enough for four men to stand side by side. Access to the fortress from within the Deep was made possible by a long stair which led to the Hornburg's rear gate.|$|E
2500|$|Davidson {{comments}} that [...] "the {{position of the}} tree in the centre {{as a source of}} luck and protection for gods and men is confirmed" [...] by these rituals to Warden Trees. Davidson notes that the gods are described as meeting beneath Yggdrasil to hold their things, and that the pillars venerated by the Germanic peoples, such as the pillar Irminsul, were also symbolic of the center of the world. Davidson details that {{it would be difficult to}} ascertain whether a tree or pillar came first, and that this likely depends on if the holy location was in a thickly wooded area or not. Davidson notes that there is no mention of a sacred tree at Þingvellir in Iceland yet that Adam of Bremen describes a huge tree <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple at Uppsala in Sweden, which Adam describes as remaining green throughout summer and winter, and that no one knew what type of tree it was. Davidson {{comments that}} while it is uncertain that Adam's informant actually witnessed that tree is unknown, but that the existence of sacred trees in pre-Christian Germanic Europe is further evidenced by records of their destruction by early Christian missionaries, such as Thor's Oak by Saint Boniface.|$|E

2500|$|Chapters {{told from}} Strathmore's {{perspective}} reveal his motives. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring {{and at the}} same time arranging for Hulohot to kill him, he would facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor and enable him to unlock Digital Fortress. By making phone calls to Numataka posing as North Dakota, he thought he could partner with Numatech to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own backdoor Trojan so that the NSA could spy on every computer equipped with these chips. However, Strathmore was unaware that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm that, once unlocked would [...] "eat away" [...] at the NSA databank's security and allow [...] "any third-grader with a modem" [...] to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but soon after David Becker figures out the password (3, the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb, Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to the nuclear bombs that killed Tankado's mother and left him crippled), and is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka is Ensei Tankado's father. Numataka left Tankado the day he was born since Tankado was a deformed child.|$|E
