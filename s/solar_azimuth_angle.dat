The <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> {{can be calculated}} to a good approximation with the following formula, however angles should be interpreted with care because the inverse sine, i.e. x = sin−1(y) or x = arcsin(y), has multiple solutions, only one {{of which will be}} correct.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} formulas {{can also}} be used to approximate the <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle,</b> but these formulas use cosine, so the azimuth angle as shown by a calculator will always be positive, and should be interpreted as the angle between zero and 180 degrees when the hour angle, h, is negative (morning) and the angle between 180 and 360 degrees when the hour angle, h, is positive (afternoon). (These two formulas are equivalent if you assume the [...] "solar elevation angle" [...] approximation formula).|$|E
40|$|Pronounced {{effects on}} the {{reflective}} response of a crop canopy due to changes in <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> and row <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> have been noted on soybeans planted in wide rows. Understanding the interaction between row azimuth and illumination direction on the crop canopy spectral response is {{necessary in order to}} utilize effectively the spectral data collected on row crops. The objective of this experiment was {{to determine the effects of}} rows and row direction on the reflective response of a soybean canopy as a function of <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> and zenith <b>angles.</b> Data were acquired over eleven plots in 1979. One plot was planted in east-west and north-south rows 25 cm wide to obtain, at later growth stages, a canopy with negligible row effects. A bare soil plot was included in order to monitor the sunlit soil background reflectance of the soybean plots. The remaining nine plots were planted in soybeans with 76 cm wide rows with the following azimuthal directions: 90 - 270, 105 - 285, 120 - 300, 135 - 315, 150 - 330, 165 - 345, 180 - 360, 210 - 030, and 240 - 060 degrees. The row directions were selected to favor the data collections during the morning hours when cloud free conditions are more likely. Reflectance data were acquired with a Landsat band radiometer (Exotech 100) at 15 minute intervals throughout the day on three days, representing three canopy growth stages with 65, 75 and 95 percent soil cover for those plots with 76 cm wide rows. Analysis of the data has shown minor effects on reflectance due to solar zenith angle. (Significant effects may be observed at lower latitudes whose wider diurnal variations of solar zenith angle are observed.) The two visible bands (0. 5 - 0. 6 µm) and (0. 6 - 0. 7 µm) were significantly affected by the interaction of <b>solar</b> and row <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles.</b> Reflectances of canopies with rows parallel to the <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> illumination <b>angle</b> were more than double the reflectance of canopies with rows perpendicular to the illumination angle...|$|R

40|$|The {{multi-satellite}} operational INPE {{system that}} monitors vegetation fires is constantly improving its existing products and introducing new ones. The original AVHRR/NOAA algorithm was replaced in 2012, {{increasing the number}} of fire pixels detected, when compared to the previous method. This paper summarizes the new method and a novel procedure developed and tested to validate the fire detections. Fire pixels were automatically verified in relation to detections made by the ten other satellites used in the INPE monitoring considering a distance radius of 10 km, and also to fire scars in Landsat/TM- 5 scenes up to 18 days after the detection date. The increase in the detections was about 29 % and 370 % for the late afternoon and early morning overpasses, respectively, resulting in an overall increase of ~ 31 %. 80 % of the cases were correctly validated and 12. 5 % were eliminated as image noise; 7. 5 % had no means to be verified due to cloud cover or missing TM scenes. The new method uses varying thresholds in channels 1, 2 in the image according to the pixel´s solar reflection and <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles.</b> The method should become the basis for the algorithms used with all satellites in INPE´s fire monitoring.

50|$|A solar {{envelope}} can {{be generated}} for any land parcel during any time interval using the following methods: the heliodon (sun-simulating machine), descriptive geometry, or computers software (e.g Autodesk Revit and DIVA for Grasshopper in Rhino). Given a site, and its location and orientation, a heliodon {{can be used to}} determine the <b>Solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> and altitude angle for any given time. Four critical time points are typically used to determine the solar envelope: morning and afternoon cut-off time during the winter and summer solstice. If the information in regards to solar positions and site geometry are known, the solar envelope can be directly calculated using trigonometry. The current computer software can be the easiest and fastest way for calculating the solar envelope using the same principle that is being used in the heliodon method.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> is the {{azimuth angle}} of the sun. It defines in which {{direction}} the sun is, whereas the solar zenith angle or its complementary angle solar elevation defines how high the sun is. There are several conventions for the solar azimuth, however it is traditionally defined as the angle between a line due south and the shadow cast by a vertical rod on Earth. This convention states the angle is positive if the line is east of south and negative if it is west of south. For example, due east would be 90° and due west would be -90°. Another convention is the reverse; {{it also has the}} origin at due south, but measures angles clockwise, so that due east is now negative and west now positive.|$|E

An eclipse per model ΔT≈7500 with <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> being about 290° would make King Mirian and his fellow hunters or royal entourage witness the totality of it, but not the townspeople nearby. The visibility conditions for the king on Tkhoti mountain could have been similar to the Solar eclipse of July 11, 2010 as seen at sunset from the mountainous terrain of Patagonia. During the eclipse of AD 319, observers at lower elevations near Mtskheta, {{would have seen the}} sky grow prematurely dark and then slightly brighter, without the Sun reappearing over the horizon. At higher elevations nearby such as where the king might have been, totality of an eclipse may indeed have been a remarkable sight. L. V. Morrison and F. R. Stephenson per their geophysical model ΔT≈7450±180°, do not contradict this scenario and an intriguing possibility, but it remains an open question whether the ancient and medieval written accounts are trustworthy, if they are based on actual facts.|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} significantly influences many biological entities in {{the terrestrial}} biosphere. However, {{the amount of}} UV exposure can be affected by surfaces that reflect UV radiation. Knowledge about reflected UV radiation from surfaces in the built environment is limited, especially from vertical or other non-horizontal surfaces and the resulting effects of UV radiation reflection from these surfaces. The main aims {{of this research is}} comprised of (1) characterisation of UV radiation reflection from a variety of urban building materials in vertical positions, (2) quantification of the biological effect of UV reflection from simulated structures on a human and (3) establishing relationships between UV radiation measurement indicators and resulting biological effects. UV radiation reflection was investigated using spectral measurements made with portable spectrometers, and took into consideration factors that could influence the measurements including orientation, direction, <b>solar</b> zenith and <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> and surface type. The biological effects due to reflection from vertical urban structures were investigated using dosimetry which enabled body site UV exposure analysis. Relationships from UV radiation reflection between different surface orientations (vertical, horizontal and inclined) were quantified. The UV Index was used to predict changes to UV exposure from certain vertical UV radiation reflective surfaces. Spectral reflection from vertical urban structures was found to be variable and for metallic surface types the variation appears to be predominantly controlled by solar zenith and <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles,</b> with man-made surfaces reflecting some radiation specularly. Hence, surface type and the coating on the surface type dictates the way UV radiation is reflected from a surface. Increases in UV exposure are observed during seasons with larger solar zenith angles, and decreases in seasons with predominantly lower solar zenith angles. This produces an observable seasonal effect, creating a potential problem in cooler seasons than in warmer seasons due to human behaviour, where personal UV protection can be overlooked compared to thermal comfort. This study has shown that UV reflection from certain vertical surfaces will substantially enhance UV exposure to an individual, and reduce the time for an outdoor worker to exceed recommended UV exposure limits...|$|R
40|$|The {{increases}} in the erythemal UV exposures to horizontal planes and to inclined planes over three surfaces that are found in an urban environment (water, concrete and sand) due to the albedo of these surfaces have been estimated. For the cloud free case, the additional daily estimated UV exposures to a horizontal plane have a maximum value of 222 (J m- 2), where the index after the unit is there to indicate that it refers to a biologically effective exposure. In comparison, the daily erythemal UV exposures over a year to a horizontal plane ranged from 425 to 8, 321 (J m- 2). For a vertical receiving plane that is rotating about a vertical axis, the additional erythemal daily UV exposures for the sub-tropical latitude location of this research for the ranges of <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> encountered over the days in each season ranged from 16 to 311 (J m- 2), 29 to 566 (J m- 2) and 46 to 905 (J m- 2) for water, concrete and sand respectively. The estimated error is ± 20 % and the calculations are based on clear-sky conditions. The additional erythemal UV averaged over each of the seasons was higher for the receiving plane inclined at 45 degrees below the horizontal plane. In a similar fashion, the vertical surface has the higher additional erythemal UV exposures compared to the surfaces inclined at an angle above the horizontal...|$|R

40|$|To {{comply with}} {{insolation}} requirements of some countries [1, 2], recommendations {{have been made}} on several graphical methods for estimating {{the shadow of a}} building or its features cast by sunlight on other features or buildings on the drawing paper [3, 4]. These methods use a series of graphs for estimating the solar shadow. To many architects, these methods are not easy to apprehend and are time-consuming for implementation. Furthermore, many projection lines will have to be drawn on the drawing paper, causing likely confusion and difficulty in identifying each line. Also, separate sheets of pre-drawn graphs have to be produced for different latitudes. There are now software developed for architects and students [5] to help them design for fenestration and obtain solar shading masks, and for obtaining solar shadows for buildings. In the learning process of a person, however, physical tools do maintain their contribution, and complement learning with the computer software. In pursuing this complementing contribution of the physical tools, a physical universal-solar-chart shadowplotter has been invented. This tool performs as a universal solar chart [6] for relating the latitude, day, apparent solar time, <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle,</b> and solar altitude angle, for any latitude selected. Also it enables an efficient plotting of the shadow of an object, such as the corner of a house, cast by the sun light on the ground, when the <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angle</b> and solar altitude angle are known. In fact, these angles can also be found by the tool. This paper reports on the principles of design and operation of this tool. This tool however is first seen in its patented form [7], which does not contain sufficiently illustration of the principles to the normal architectural science readers.

Monitoring of these resources is important for the assessment of availability of water in Himalayan rivers. Therefore a study was taken up with the objective to monitor snow cover in the sub-basins of Ganga. Snow cover was monitored for Yamuna basins for beginning from 2003 by using the algorithm based on Normalized Difference Snow Index. These basins are {{selected on the basis of}} different climatic zones. The snow accumulation and ablations curves are different for each basin, depending upon climatologically sensitive zones and altitude distribution of the basin. NDSI Algorithm was used to generate snow cover products in every five and ten daily intervals. The present result gives the current status of Snow cover area of five and ten daily products. The AWiFS data of Resourcesat satellite was analyzed to estimate snow extent. The snow cover was monitored for a period between October and June from year 2003 to 2010 A total 156 AWiFS scenes were analyzed during this period.

The NO 2 photolysis frequency in the street, averaged over atmospheric conditions and street orientation, is reduced to less than 20 % for narrow streets, to about 40 % for typical urban streets, and only to about 80 % for garden streets, each with about ± 5 % uncertainty. A parameterization of RJ with the global solar irradiance is given for values that are averaged over the meteorological conditions and the street orientation...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{backscattered}} ultraviolet (SBUV) ozone profiles have been compared with Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II profiles {{over the period}} October 1984 through June 1990, when data are available from both instruments. SBUV measurements were selected to closely match the SAGE II latitude/longitude measurement pattern. There are {{significant differences between the}} SAGE II sunrise and the sunset zonal mean ozone profiles in the equatorial zone, particularly in the upper stratosphere, that may be connected with extreme SAGE II <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> <b>angles</b> for tropical sunrise measurements. Calculation of the average sunset bias between SBUV and SAGE II ozone profiles shows that allowing for diurnal variation in Umkehr layer 10, SBUV and SAGE II agree to within +/- 5 % for the entire stratosphere in the northern midlatitude zone. The worst agreement is seen at southern midlatitudes near the ozone peak (disagreements of +/- 10 %), apparently the result of the SBUV ozone profile peaking at a lower altitude than SAGE. The integrated ozone columns (cumulative above 15 km) agree very well, to within +/- 2. 3 % in all zones for both sunset and sunrise measurements. A comparison of the time dependence of SBUV and SAGE II shows that there was less than +/- 5 % relative drift over the 5. 5 years for all altitudes except below 25 km, where the SBUV vertical resolution is poor. The best agreement with SAGE is seen in the integrated column ozone (cumulative above 15 km), where SAGE II has a 1 % negative trend relative to SBUV over the comparison period. There is a persistent disagreement of the two instruments in Umkehr layers 9 and 10 of +/- 4 % over the 5. 5 -year comparison period. In the equatorial zone this disagreement may be caused in part by a large positive trend (0. 8 K per year) in the National Meteorologica Center temperatures used to convert the SAGE II measurement of ozone density versus altitude to a pressure scale for comparison with SBUV. In the middle stratosphere (30 - 40 km), SBUV shows a 2 - 4 % negative drift relative to SAGE II. If the actual ozone trends are considered, SBUV and SAGE II agree in showing little ozone change (less than 2 %) between 1984 and 1990, except in layer 3 where SAGE II measures a large ozone decrease. But over 11 years, SBUV measured a 7 % per decade ozone decrease between 40 and 50 km, decreasing in magnitude at lower altitudes, in good agreement with 11 -year trends derived from the average of 5 Umkehr stations...|$|R
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the magnitude and}} makeup of error in cryospheric radiation observations due to small sensor misalignment in in situ measurements of solar irradiance. This error is examined through simulation of diffuse and direct irradiance arriving at a detector with a cosine-response fore optic. Emphasis is placed on assessing total error over the solar shortwave spectrum from 250 to 4500 nm, as well as supporting investigation over other relevant shortwave spectral ranges. The total measurement error introduced by sensor tilt {{is dominated by the}} direct component. For a typical high-latitude albedo measurement with a solar zenith angle of 60 °, a sensor tilted by 1, 3, and 5 ° can, respectively introduce up to 2. 7, 8. 1, and 13. 5 % error into the measured irradiance and similar errors in the derived albedo. Depending on the daily range of <b>solar</b> <b>azimuth</b> and zenith <b>angles,</b> significant measurement error can persist also in integrated daily irradiance and albedo. Simulations including a cloud layer demonstrate decreasing tilt error with increasing cloud optical depth...|$|R
