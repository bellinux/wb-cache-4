5000|$|The {{province}} {{is remembered}} today by philatelists for having <b>issued</b> postage <b>stamps</b> from 1881 on, although a postcard was issued locally for internal use in 1880. The 1878 Treaty of Berlin {{provided for the}} Ottoman Empire to <b>issue</b> <b>special</b> <b>stamps</b> for Eastern Rumelia. However, they were slow to do so. In 1880, in part {{a reaction to the}} local postcard, the Turkish government sent some 50,000 piasters worth of Turkish stamps overprinted with [...] "ROUMELIE / ORIENTALE" [...] in an oval. The Eastern Rumelian government found these to be unsatisfactory in presenting the province as an autonomous region, and refused to issue them. A compromise was reached, new stamps specifically printed for Eastern Rumelia were sent from Constantinople and both versions were issued on 16 January 1881. Overprints on stamps of Turkey were made locally. First was an [...] "R.O." [...] that was stamped both on regular Turkish stamps and the oval overprinted ones. This was done in Philippopolis. In addition, a pattern of bars was sometimes used. All of these overprints are uncommon and extensively counterfeited.|$|R

One pane of 100 stamps were found to have an invert error, known as the Inverted Jenny, because the airplane image in the centre is inverted relative to the outer frame. The error {{is one of the most}} well known airmail stamps. Several countries, such as Germany, Finland, Russia and the United States, <b>issued</b> <b>special</b> airmail <b>stamps,</b> or overprinted stamps, for the Zeppelin flights that took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s.|$|R
