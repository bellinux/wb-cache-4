[...] 5-HT2A is thought to correspond to what was originally described as D subtype of 5-HT receptors by Gaddum and Picarelli. In the pre-molecular-cloning era when radioligand binding and displacement was the only major tool, <b>spiperone</b> and LSD were shown to label two different serotonin receptors, and neither of them displaced morphine, leading to naming of the 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, corresponding to high affinity sites from LSD, <b>spiperone</b> and morphine respectively. Later it was shown that the 5-HT2 was very close to 5-HT1C and thus were clubbed together, renaming the 5-HT2 into 5-HT2A.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that antipsychotics affect dopamine release from dopaminergic neurons, but the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Besides, there are few studies {{on the effects of}} antipsychotics on intracellular dopamine content. In this study, the effects of 8 antipsychotics on dopamine release and intracellular dopamine content in PC 12 cells were investigated. Pretreatment with haloperidol, <b>spiperone,</b> pimozide, aripiprazole and risperidone markedly inhibited high potassium-evoked dopamine release. By contrast, pretreatment with chlorpromazine slightly increased high potassium-evoked dopamine release, while pretreatment with sulpiride and olanzapine had no effect. Haloperidol, <b>spiperone,</b> pimozide, chlorpromazine, aripiprazole and olanzapine evoked dopamine release, while sulpiride and risperidone had no effect. In addition, haloperidol, <b>spiperone,</b> pimozide, aripiprazole and risperidone reduced intracellular dopamine content in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that the reduction in high potassium-evoked dopamine release by pretreatment with antipsychotics results from the reduction in vesicular dopamine content. Treatment with the 8 antipsychotics did not affect the expression of total or phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase. Instead, haloperidol, <b>spiperone,</b> pimozide and aripiprazole as well as reserpine transiently increased extracellular levels of dopamine metabolites. In addition, haloperidol, <b>spiperone,</b> pimozide, aripiprazole and risperidone reduced vesicular [3 H]dopamine transport.

In CA 3 membranes from rats sacrificed 1 h or 24 h after administration of 5 mg/kg i. p. <b>spiperone</b> or methiothepin, no decrease in [3 H]- 8 -OH-DPAT Bmax values approached statistical significance. Autoradiograms from identically treated rats showed {{significant increases in}} Kd values in both CA 1 and CA 3 hippocampal subfields 24 h but not 1 h after administration of the drugs, while no changes were observed in the dorsal raphe at either time. In vitro co-incubation of membranes with <b>spiperone</b> (200 or 500 nM) or methiothepin (500 nM) resulted in significant decreases in both affinity and Bmax values. In contrast, co-incubation with BMY 7378 (5 nM) increased only Kd values. GTP gamma S produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of specific [3 H] 8 -OH-DPAT binding. At 0. 1 mM of GTP gamma S, Kd values were increased three-fold and Bmax values were significantly decreased. When membranes were co-incubated with GTP gamma S and <b>spiperone</b> or BMY 7378, Kd values increased further. Moreover, the effects of <b>spiperone</b> and GTP gamma S on Bmax values were additive. It is concluded that BMY 7378 acts as a competitive antagonist at hippocampal post-synaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors, whereas <b>spiperone</b> and methiothepin exert their delayed antagonistic effects at these receptors through a non-competitive mechanism of action, possibly affecting the coupling of the receptors to their Gi/o proteins...|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronidases are {{groups of}} enzymes that degrade hyaluronic acid (HA). To stop enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} we modified testicular hyaluronidase (HYAL) by activated polyethylene oxide {{with the help}} of electron-beam synthesis. As a result we received pegylated hyaluronidase (pegHYAL). <b>Spiperone</b> is a selective D 2 dopamine receptor antagonist. It was demonstrated on the model of a single bleomycin damage of alveolar epithelium that during the inflammatory phase monotherapy by pegHYAL or <b>spiperone</b> reduced the populations of hematopoietic stem /progenitor cells in the lung parenchyma. PegHYAL also reduced the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, interleukin (IL) - 1 β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α in the serum and lungs, while <b>spiperone</b> reduced the level of the serum IL- 1 β. Polytherapy by <b>spiperone</b> and pegHYAL caused the increase of the quantity of hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells in the lungs. Such an influx of blood cell precursors was observed on the background of considerable fall level of TGF-β and the increase level of TNF-α in the serum and lungs. These results show pegHYAL reduced the bleomycin-induced fibrosis reaction (production and accumulation of collagen) in the lung parenchyma. This effect was observed at a single and repetitive bleomycin damage of alveolar epithelium, the antifibrotic activity of pegHYAL surpassing the activity of testicular HYAL. The antifibrotic effect of pegHYAL is enhanced by an additional instillation of <b>spiperone.</b> Therapy by pegHYAL causes the flow of CD 31 ‒ CD 34 ‒ CD 45 ‒ CD 44 + CD 73 + CD 90 + CD 106 +-cells into the fibrous lungs.

Evidence to support this hypothesis comes from monitoring the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, or urinary levels of metabolites of neurotransmitters, or from measuring the number, location, and affinity of neurotransmitter receptors by ligand-binding techniques. Abnormalities of dopamine receptor have been reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Hunting ton's chorea (1), Parkinson's disease (2), schizophrenia (3 â€” 8),and tardive dyskinesia (9 - 11).

The models differ with respect to the description of specific binding. Nonlinear regression analysis shows that the in vivo specific binding of 3 H-labeled <b>spiperone</b> in the frontal cortex (mainly serotonergic) can be described by a noninteracting sites model, whereas the specific binding in the striatum (mainly dopaminergic) can best be described by models that lead to sigmoid saturation curves. These results were tested and partly confirmed by determining the region-of-interest/cerebellar radioactivity ratio of 11 C-labeled N-methylspiperone, with and without pretreatment with haloperidol. The estimated B(max) was 32 fmol/mg wet tissue in the frontal cortex and ~ 90 fmol/mg wet tissue in the striatum. The free plus nonspecific binding of <b>spiperone</b> was similar in the frontal cortex but lower in the striatum than in the cerebellum. The occurrence of sigmoidicity can be best explained by the existence of high-affinity/low-capacity sites in the cerebellum rather than mutual interactions of striatal sites.

Quinagolide (D 2 / 3 agonist), ropinirole (D 2 / 3 / 4 agonist), SKF 38393 (D 1 / 5 agonist), AR-C 68397 AA (Viozan™) (dual D 2 /B 2 agonist) and dopamine inhibited hypertonic saline induced depolarization by approximately 50 %. Data suggests that AR-C 68397 AA and quinagolide also inhibited depolarization of the human vagus. The quinagolide response was blocked by sulpiride (D 2 / 3 antagonist) but not SCH 23390 (D 1 / 5 antagonist); ropinirole was partially blocked by sulpiride, totally blocked by <b>spiperone</b> (at a concentration that blocks all dopamine receptors) but not by SCH 23390. The response to SKF 38393 was not blocked by sulpiride but was by SCH 23390. The inhibition evoked by AR-C 68397 AA was only partially blocked by SCH 23390 but not by sulpiride or <b>spiperone</b> whereas dopamine was blocked by <b>spiperone.</b> The effect of dopamine was not stimulus-specific as it inhibited capsaicin-induced depolarization of the rat vagus in a <b>spiperone</b> sensitive manner.

Trazodone and <b>spiperone</b> were apparently simple competitive antagonists since they produced antagonism that was surmountable over the concentration range studied and, in each tissue, their apparent affinity appeared to be independent of the antagonist concentration. Furthermore, concentration-ratios obtained with the two antagonists in combination suggested that antagonism was additive, implying mutual competition with a single population of 5 -HT receptors. Ketanserin was a non-surmountable antagonist of 5 -HT in the rat caudal artery and methysergide demonstrated surmountable, competitive antagonism only in the rabbit aorta. Antagonist dissociation constants estimated for apparently competitive interactions showed that ketanserin, <b>spiperone</b> and trazodone expressed affinities which differed according to the tissue used. In the case of trazodone, affinity estimates differed {{by as much as}} 12 fold. These discrepancies were independent of the 5 -HT receptor agonist used and could not be attributed to an inadequate equilibration of the antagonist.

In the presence of either ketanserin or <b>spiperone,</b> concentration-effect curves for 5 - 5 -HT became biphasic. The responses to low concentrations of 5 - 5 -HT were resistant to blockade by either antagonist. The responses to high concentrations of 5 -HT were antagonized by ketansenn and <b>spiperone</b> in a concentration-dependent and par-tially surmountable manner. The lack of complete surmountability was at least partially due to fade dunng the determination of the cumulative concentration-effect curves. The PKB values for the component of the 5 -HT-induced contractions that was antago...|$|E
40|$|A {{complementary}} DNA (cDNA) encoding a serotonin receptor with 51 % sequence {{identity to}} the 5 HT− 1 C subtype was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library by homology screening. Transient {{expression of the}} cloned cDNA in mammalian cells was used to establish the pharmacological profile of the encoded receptor polypeptide. Membranes from transfected cells showed high−affinity binding of the serotonin antagonists <b>spiperone,</b> ketanserin and mianserin, low affinity for haloperidol (a dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist), 8 −OH−DPAT as well as MDL− 72222 and no detectable binding of [3 H]serotonin. This profile is consonant with the 5 HT− 2 subtype of serotonin receptors. In agreement with this assignment, serotonin increased the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration and activated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in transfected mammalian cells. The agonist also elicited a current flow, blocked by <b>spiperone,</b> in Xenopus oocytes injected with in vitro synthesized RNA containing the cloned nucleotide sequence...|$|E
40|$|At {{recombinant}} human 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 5 -HT 1 A receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO- 5 -HT 1 A), 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT), {{acted as a}} full agonist (relative to 5 -HT= 100 %) for stimulation of receptor-mediated [35 S]-GTPγS (guanylyl 5 ′-[γ-thio]-tryphosphate) binding. In contrast, <b>spiperone</b> inhibited basal [35 S]-GTPγS binding by 30. 2 % (IC 50 = 55. 5 [*]nM) in CHO- 5 -HT 1 A membranes but not in control untransfected membranes. The antagonist, N-{ 2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2 -pyridinyl) -cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY 100, 635), blocked both 5 -CT-induced stimulation and spiperone-induced inhibition of [35 S]-GTPγS binding without itself modifying [35 S]-GTPγS binding. It is concluded that, in this heterologous expression system, 5 -HT 1 A receptors display ‘constitutive' activation of G-proteins and that <b>spiperone</b> displays inverse agonist activity whereas WAY 100, 635 acts as a ‘neutral' antagonist at this site...|$|E
40|$|In the avian forebrain, {{the medial}} {{striatum}} and the intermediate medial mesopallium {{are thought to}} be important structures for associative learning in chicks, where the role of dopaminergic systems in learning processes has been verified in various behavioral paradigms, such as one-trial passive avoidance learning. However, it is not yet clear whether the dopaminergic system of these regions is responsible for associative learning underlying cue-elicited drug reward. In this study, a 6 -day conditioning schedule in day-old chicks with i. p. morphine (2 mg/kg) was used to compare the effects of intracerebrally injected dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, and D(2) antagonist, <b>spiperone.</b> The antagonists were injected bilaterally (3 mu g/site) into either the medial striatum or the intermediate medial mesopallium, and tests were conducted on morphine-induced conditioned place preference or locomotor activity. The acquisition of place preference was significantly inhibited by SCH 23390 in either the medial striatum or the intermediate medial mesopallium, but not by <b>spiperone.</b> However, in the medial striatum, but not in the intermediate medial mesopallium, the locomotor activity was blocked by both SCH 23390 and <b>spiperone.</b> These data suggest that the medial striatum and the intermediate medial mesopallium in birds are differentially involved in the rewarding effects of morphine, and similarly to mammals, the dopamine D(1) system may {{play an important role in}} the development of opiate reward.

40|$|Using {{recently}} available selective agonists and antagonists we {{have examined}} further our postulate (Apperley et al., 1980) that 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) mediates contraction of dog saphenous vein via a different 5 -HT receptor type {{from that in}} the rabbit aorta. In the rabbit isolated aorta, ketanserin and <b>spiperone</b> were potent, specific, competitively-acting antagonists of the contractile effects of 5 -HT. In contrast, in the dog isolated saphenous vein neither ketanserin nor <b>spiperone</b> caused any rightward displacement of concentration-response curves to 5 -HT although the maximum response was reduced by about 10 %. In the rabbit aorta 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CONH 2 -T) was a weak agonist whilst the 5 -N,N-dimethyl and 5 -N-ethyl derivatives were even weaker or inactive. The contractile effect of 5 -CONH 2 -T in the rabbit aorta was potently and competitively antagonized by ketanserin. In contrast, in the dog saphenous vein 5 -CONH 2 -T and its 5 -N,N-dimethyl and 5 -N-ethyl derivatives were all potent agonists. The contractile effect of 5 -CONH 2 -T was not markedly affected by ketanserin. The profile of action of ketanserin and <b>spiperone</b> in the rabbit aorta {{is consistent with the}} view that 5 -HT 2 receptors mediate contraction in this preparation. However, the 5 -HT receptor mediating contraction in the dog saphenous vein appears to be ' 5 -HT 1 -like', sharing a number of characteristics with the 5 -HT 1 recognition site identified from [3 H]- 5 -HT ligand binding studies in brain tissue...|$|E
40|$|Background. Cerebral {{ischemia}} {{is known}} to produce brain damage and related behavioural deficits, including memory deficits and motor disorders. Evidence shows that EA significantly promotes recovery of neurological function and thus improves quality of life. Objective. Evidence exists for the involvement of catecholamines in human neuroplasticity. A better understanding of dopaminergic (DAergic) modulation in this process will be important. Methods. A total of 72 adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 6 groups: normal, model, EA, <b>spiperone</b> group, EA + <b>spiperone</b> group, and pergolide. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used in all 6 groups except the normal group. A behavioural assessment was conducted at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after MCAO. The percent of brain infarct area was also determined 7 days after MCAO. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP- 43) fluorescence double labeling was performed in the striatum. Results. In this study, we found that EA at Fengchi (GB 20) acupoints resulted in marked improvements based on a behavioural assessment. Both TTC staining and GAP- 43 immunofluorescence labeling results showed that EA treatment reduced ischemia injury and promoted neuroplasticity compared with the model group. The D 2 R-selective agonist, pergolide, showed similar results, but these results were reversed by the D 2 R-selective antagonist, <b>spiperone.</b> We also {{found that there were}} more colocalization and expression of GAP- 43 and TH in the EA and pergolide groups than those in the other groups. Conclusion. These results suggest that the neuroplasticity induced by EA was mediated by D 2 autoreceptors in DAergic neurons...|$|E
40|$|In Xenopus oocytes expressing {{neuronal}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAcChoRs), {{made up of}} alpha 2 and beta 4 subunits, acetylcholine (AcCho) elicited ionic membrane currents (AcCho currents) {{that were}} modulated by serotonergic agents. Both agonists and antagonists specific for various serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 HT) receptor subtypes interacted directly with alpha 2 beta 4 nAcChoRs: 5 HT, (+/-) - 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin, methysergide, <b>spiperone,</b> and ketanserin reversibly reduced the amplitude of AcCho currents and accelerated their decay. The AcCho-current time course decayed with two exponential functions. In the presence of 5 HT, the fast time constant of current decay (tau f) was not greatly modified, but the slow time constant (tau s) was reduced. With AcCho and 5 HT both at 100 microM, tau s was reduced from 140 s to 85 s. The order of potency for inhibition of AcCho current amplitudes was (+/-) - 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin > methysergide > <b>spiperone</b> > ketanserin > 5 HT. The inhibition was voltage-dependent but {{the magnitude of the}} voltage dependence for the different blockers did not correspond to their blocking potency: e. g., the block with <b>spiperone</b> was stronger than with 5 HT, but it was less voltage-dependent. Our results suggest that serotonergic agents block neuronal nAcChoRs in a noncompetitive manner, similar to the block of muscle nAcChoR by curare and other substances. These results show that neuronal nAcChoR channels that have been activated by their specific neurotransmitter may be modulated by nonspecific neurotransmitters and their antagonists. These effects may help to better understand brain functions as well as the mode of action of the many serotonergic agents that are used in medical practice...|$|E
40|$|Serotonergic (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) fibers are {{distributed}} throughout the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb of the sea lamprey. This study tested for 5 -HT modulation of olfactory sensory responses to pheromone, amino acid and bile acid odours in the dorsal and lateral regions of the olfactory bulb by recording local field potentials. The peak amplitude of dorsal and lateral olfactory bulb responses to amino acid odours declined during 5 -HT bath-application. The peak amplitude of responses to all odours increased during pharmacological blockade of the 5 -HT 1 a receptor, but was not affected when 5 -HT {{was added to the}} 5 -HT 1 a antagonist, <b>spiperone.</b> The 5 -HT 1 a antagonist, s(-) -uh- 301, lengthened responses and had a larger number of peaks to all odours and <b>spiperone</b> lengthened responses and had a larger number of peaks to amino acids. We conclude that 5 -HT attenuates odour responses in olfactory bulb via the 5 HT 1 a receptor and suggest that 5 -HT may also modulate olfactory-mediated behaviours...|$|E
