40|$|Samples of {{biodiesel}} (B 100) from {{producers and}} terminals in 2011 were tested for critical properties: free and total glycerin, flash point, cloud point, oxidation stability, cold soak filterability, and metals. Failure rates for cold soak filterability and oxidation stability were below 5 %. One <b>sample</b> <b>failed</b> flash point due to excess methanol. One <b>sample</b> <b>failed</b> oxidation stability and metal content. Overall, 95 % {{of the samples}} from this survey met biodiesel quality specification ASTM D 6751. In 2007, a sampling of B 100 from production facilities showed that nearly 90 % met D 6751. In samples meeting D 6751, calcium was found above the method detection limit in nearly half the samples. Feedstock analysis revealed half the biodiesel was produced from soy and half was from mixed feedstocks. The saturated fatty acid methyl ester concentration of the B 100 was compared to the saturated monoglyceride concentration {{as a percent of}} total monoglyceride. The real-world correlation of these properties was very good. The results of liquid chromatograph measurement of monoglycerides were compared to ASTM D 6751. Agreement between the two methods was good, particularly for total monoglycerides and unsaturated monoglycerides. Because only very low levels of saturated monoglycerides measured, the two methods had more variability, but the correlation was still acceptable...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: On the {{assumption}} of psychotherapy indication, a multidimensional assessment {{was carried out in}} a study group consisting of 103 imprisoned male offenders (mean age 20. 8 years). It included a demographic and personal history inventory, psychological tests, and diagnosis according to the multiaxial classification. In addition, psychotherapy adherence was categorized, and therapy objectives were formulated. Participants showed multiple devel-opmental risk factors and average-to-good results in language-free IQ-test scores. Further-more, they displayed a more-pronounced negative attitude to life and higher rates of aggres-sion toward themselves. Main ICD- 10 disorders included personality and behavior disorders, substance use disorders, conduct disorders, and emotional disorders. The spectrum of psychi-atric morbidity within the psychotherapy group was largely comparable with that of impris-oned and forensic populations, whereas the total prevalence was slightly higher.

30|$|In all the samples, the L values {{remained}} more or {{less the}} same upon heating; while both dry and vehicle b values were increased noticeably upon heating. It is also observed that the increase in dry b value is more pronounced in HunterLab than BYK. However, the increase in dry as well as vehicle b values upon heating is {{more or less}} the same in the reference sample and the sample contaminated by oil. So it is not possible to distinguish between reference and oil-contaminated samples from this result. In other words, both reference and oil-contaminated samples heated at 100 °C passed the dry b test, while when the temperature was increased to 180 °C, both <b>samples</b> <b>failed</b> the dry b test. Unlike this observation, all the four <b>samples</b> <b>failed</b> in the vehicle b test irrespective of the nature of the sample. So, it is obvious from this result that the heating did not make any special change in the sample contaminated by oil; rather, it changed the b value of both reference and oil-contaminated sample to the same extent. The brightness and color of oil-contaminated pigment were compared with the pure, uncontaminated pigment prepared from the same base pigment under similar conditions.|$|R
