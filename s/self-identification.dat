5|$|Indonesia's 2000 census {{reported}} 2,411,503 citizens (1.20 {{percent of}} the total population) as ethnic Chinese. An additional 93,717 (0.05 percent) ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were reported as foreign citizens, mostly those of the People's Republic of China and Republic of China, who {{may not be able to}} pay the cost of becoming an Indonesian citizen. Because the census employed the method of <b>self-identification,</b> those who refused to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese, or had assumed the identity of other ethnic groups, were recorded as non-Chinese. It is also likely that some did not identify themselves for fear of repercussions in the wake of anti-Chinese violence in 1998, as several census stated that there are around 6 to 7 millions Chinese living in Indonesia.|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThis study {{proposes a}} micro-institutional theory of {{political}} violence, {{according to which}} citizens’ participation in political violence is partially an outcome of tight coupling of persons’ practices and <b>self-identifications</b> with institutional logics opposed to dominant logics associated with world culture, such as the nation-state and gender equality. The study focuses on two types of institutional carriers through which persons adopt institutional logics: routine practices and <b>self-identifications</b> associated with three institutional logics: the familial, the ethnic, and the religious logics. Using a 15 -country survey data from early twenty-first-century sub-Saharan Africa, the study finds {{evidence in support of}} the theory. Reported participation in political violence is associated with practices and <b>self-identifications</b> uncoupled from dominant world-culture logics but tightly coupled with the patriarchal familial logic, with an oppositional ethnic logic, and with a politicized oppositional religious logic.

50|$|<b>Self-identifications</b> {{during the}} {{existence}} of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth often made use of the Latin 'gens-natione' construct (familial or ethnic origin combined with a national identity). The construct was used by the elite inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, by the Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) elites, and in Prussia. Religious affiliation was sometimes added, leading to <b>self-identifications</b> such as Natione Polonus, gente Ruthenus; Natione Polonus, gente Prussicus; or Natione Polonus, gente Ruthenus, origine Judaeus. The Latin phrasing reflects the use of that language as a neutral lingua franca, which continued into the 18th century.|$|R

5|$|Second and third-generation {{descendants}} of Japanese-Palauans who were descended from earlier settlers generally chose to remain behind, although {{those who were}} raised in Japanese-speaking families reportedly faced trouble conversing in Palauan. Most retained their Japanese surnames, but Japanese-Paluans generally identified themselves as Palauans after the war. Second-generation Japanese-Palauans usually married Palauan women, and became assimilated with the local Palauan populace. In terms of <b>self-identification,</b> Japanese-Palauans usually emphasised their Japanese identities only on occasions when they associate with other Japanese, for instance when they participate in memorial services for Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War. Some Japanese-Palauans also chose {{to be buried in}} Japanese cemeteries after their deaths, notably those in Koror.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's <b>self-identification</b> as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E

40|$|As a {{specific}} way of interpreting the seven Messages of Revelation 2 and 3, scholars accept {{the importance of the}} <b>self-identifications</b> of Christ in these Messages. Little or (in the case of some of the <b>self-identifications)</b> no research has, however, been done on the coherence of the self - identification {{with the rest of the}} pericope. In the present article an attempt is made to define this coherence in the Message to Smyma (Revelation 2 : 8 - 11). In the article it is argued that coherence exists on three levels, namely coherence of thought structure, coherence of theme, and coherence of content. The conclusion arrived at points to the fact that a valid interpretation of the Messages cannot be made without taking this coherence into consideration...|$|R

50|$|Different social {{situations}} also compel people to attach themselves to different self-identities which may cause some to feel marginalized, switch between different groups and <b>self-identifications,</b> or reinterpret certain identity components.

25|$|In {{a nationally}} representative, online sample of 3145 men and 3283 women, 3.6% {{of the men}} and 1.4% of the women {{identified}} as gay. A further 5.5% {{of the men and}} 7.4% of the women identified as bisexual. <b>Self-identification</b> was assessed on a 5-point scale and all three non-exclusive options were combined for bisexual <b>self-identification.</b> Same-sex attraction is more prevalent than homo- or bisexual orientation. Of the men, 9.9% reported at least some same-sex attraction (4.2% exclusively). Among women, this was 10.9% (1.5% exclusively), of which a large group reported mainly heterosexual attraction. Of the men, 3.6% had had sex with men {{in the past six months}} and a further 2.0% with both men and women. For women, these percentages were 1.6% and 0.8% respectively. Gay or bisexual <b>self-identification</b> without same-sex attraction was almost non-existent. However, not all men and women who felt attracted to their own gender identified as gay or bisexual. Same-sex sexual behavior did occur among men and women who neither reported any same-sex attraction or a gay or bisexual identification, especially when lifelong sexual behavior was considered.|$|E

Furthermore, critics argued that self-identified racial identifications from patients as an indicator for race during the trials were not a sufficient categorization method because these <b>self-identifications</b> were socially constructed and have no biological connection to genomic data.|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} in media and communication research {{have been suggested}} to understand why people consume news. Gratification theory states that satisfying audiences’ social and psychological needs {{is the key to}} attracting and keeping those audiences [12]. Specifically, desires such as entertainment, interpersonal communication, information learning, escapism, and surveillance are the general factors that are associated with news consumption on the Internet [27]–[30]. The few studies that have focused on content sharing activities in online communities found that gratification, social interaction, reciprocity, and <b>self-identifications</b> are strongly related to why people share knowledge online [31]. On the other hand, as an attempt to understand how people manage opinion conflicts, selective exposure theory hypothesizes that individuals tend to favor information that reinforces pre-existing views while avoiding contradictory information [13].|$|R
