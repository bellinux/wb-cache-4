Others in the party included Ivor Novello, Margaret Rutherford, Diana Wynyard and Bobbie Andrews. In her autobiography, A Star Danced, she has given a graphic account of their landing on a Normandy beach and of the progress of her unit through the wrecked towns, where {{there was still no}} water or electricity. Shows were given in shell-torn cinemas and hastily lighted casinos.|$|E
500|$|The SAS raid, codenamed [...] "Operation Nimrod", was {{broadcast}} live at peak {{time on a}} bank holiday Monday evening and was viewed by millions of people, mostly in the UK, making it a defining moment in British history. Both the BBC and ITV interrupted their scheduled programming to show {{the end of the}} siege, which proved to be a major career break for several journalists. Kate Adie, the BBC's duty reporter at the embassy when the SAS assault began, went on to report from war zones across the world and eventually to become chief news correspondent for BBC News, while David Goldsmith and his team, responsible for the hidden camera {{at the back of the}} embassy, were awarded a BAFTA for their coverage. The success of the operation, combined with the high-profile it was given by the media, invoked a sense of national pride compared to Victory in Europe Day, the end of the Second World War in Europe. The operation was declared [...] "an almost unqualified success". Margaret Thatcher recalled that she was congratulated wherever <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the following days, and received messages of support and congratulation from other world leaders. However, the incident strained already-tense relations between the UK and Iran following the Iranian Revolution. The Iranian government declared that the siege of the embassy was planned by the British and American governments, and that the hostages who had been killed were martyrs for the Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Zahau's autopsy {{results would}} reveal four {{instances}} of head trauma. Investigators and outside commentators expressed various theories regarding the head injuries. San Diego Medical Examiner Jonathan Lucas stated that [...] "because {{there was evidence}} that <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the balcony in a non-vertical position, she may have struck {{her head on the}} balcony on the way down." [...] Werner Spitz, an expert witness who testified during the trial of Casey Anthony, said it was a possibility, stating, [...] "When the body first dropped, she doesn't necessarily jump to her death, so she would drop directly downward and she could easily hit {{against the side of the}} structure from which she is hanging." [...] However, he noted that the case was not [...] "cut-and-dried" [...] and that to draw stronger conclusions he would have preferred to see what the body looked like before the wrist bindings were removed. Forensic consultant and doctor of criminal psychology Maurice Godwin expressed doubt, stating, [...] "The chances of bumping into the railing, going over the balcony and hitting your head four times is highly unlikely." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haxey and Westwoodside lie {{in an area}} of North Lincolnshire {{known as}} the Isle of Axholme. The {{official}} story is that in the 14th century, Lady de Mowbray, wife of an Isle landowner, John De Mowbray, was out riding towards Westwoodside on the hill that separates it from Haxey. As <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the hill her silk riding hood was blown away by the wind. Thirteen farm workers in the field rushed to help and chased the hood all over the field. It was finally caught by one of the farm workers, but being too shy to hand it back to the lady, he gave it to one of the others to hand back to her. She thanked the farm worker who had returned the hood and said that he had acted like a Lord, whereas the worker who had actually caught the hood was a Fool. So amused was she by this act of chivalry and the resulting chase, that she donated 13 acres (53,000m²) of land on condition that the chase for the hood would be re-enacted each year. This re-enactment over the centuries has become known as [...] "The Haxey Hood" ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{career at}} the Met, however, was not without its ups-and-downs. Flagstad got {{involved}} in a long-running feud with tenor co-star Lauritz Melchior after Melchior took offense to some comments Flagstad made about [...] "stupid publicity photos" [...] during a game of bridge in Flagstad's hotel suite while the two were on tour together in Rochester, NY. Present during the infamous bridge game were Flagstad, Melchior and his wife, and Edwin McArthur. Afterwards, Melchior fanned the flames further by insisting that there be no solo curtain calls for Flagstad when the two performed together. Audiences had no clue that, despite the marvelous and sometimes historic performances, the two {{never said a word}} to each other off stage for the next two years. It was Flagstad's husband Henry Johansen who finally brought the two together to make peace. Flagstad also feuded with the Met's general manager, Edward Johnson, after conductor Artur Bodanzky's death, when she asked to be conducted for a few performances by her accompanist, Edwin McArthur, rather than by the Met's new conductor Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad had wanted this for McArthur, whom she had taken under her wing. Johnson refused and would not hear of it any further. Flagstad did get her way, though; <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> Johnson's head and discussed the matter with the Met's board of directors, particularly David Sarnoff, RCA and NBC founder and chairman. It was Sarnoff who made the arrangements for McArthur to begin conducting Met productions on a limited basis. Her relationship with Johnson improved, however; just before Flagstad left the Met in 1941, on the night of her 100th performance of Isolde ...|$|E
