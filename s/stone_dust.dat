500|$|Minor restorations {{have already}} begun; two Palmyrene funerary busts of a {{deceased}} {{man and a}} woman, damaged and defaced by ISIL, were taken from Palmyra, then to Beirut to be sent off to Rome. Italian experts restored the portraits using 3D technology to print resin prosthetics, which were coated with {{a thick layer of}} <b>stone</b> <b>dust</b> to blend in with the original stone; the prosthetics were attached to the damaged faces of the busts using strong magnets. The restored pieces are now back in Syria. Abdulkarim said the restoration of the busts [...] "is the first real, visible positive step that the international community has taken to protect Syrian heritage". In July 2017, the discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, speaking in the [...] "Faces of Palmyra" [...] ("I Volti de Palmyra") exhibition in Aquileia, said that: [...] "The archaeological site of Palmyra is a vast field of ruins and only 20-30% of it is seriously damaged. Unfortunately these included important parts, such as the Temple of Bel, while the Arc of Triumph can be rebuilt." [...] He added: [...] "In any case, by using both traditional methods and advanced technologies, {{it might be possible to}} restore 98% of the site".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{addition}} of <b>stone</b> (limestone) <b>dust</b> to roadway dust in an underground coal mine increases the Total Incombustible Content (TIC) {{to reduce the}} potential of the coal dust igniting and propagating an explosion. Coal dust explosions have been proven {{to be one of the}} most severe hazards in an underground coal mine hence as Queensland legislation requires the use of roadway <b>stone</b> <b>dusting,</b> the required levels of TIC are higher than other mining districts around the world which also employ other coal dust explosion barriers. Compliance testing currently involves Low Temperature Ashing (LTA) of representative samples with a turn around on results of up to two weeks. To minimise the time that the mine is potentially out of compliance and unsafe, the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM) has been tested at a Queensland underground coal mine to determine its effectiveness, through 11 different calibration methods, in rapidly measuring the TIC of roadway dust samples. The key focus of the calibration methods was to explore the effectiveness of the CDEM at its designed threshold of 80 % TIC, the use of an inbuilt methane content adjustment to replicate the Queensland legislative requirement of 85 % TIC and the use of actual 85 % TIC calibration samples.

40|$|Now-days, {{all over}} the world, {{construction}} activities are taking place on huge scale. Due to this there is great increase in cost of construction. Natural river sand {{is one of the}} key ingredients of concrete, is becoming expensive due to excessive cost of transportation from sources. Also large scale depletion of sources creates environmental problems. Unfortunately, production of cement also involves large amount of carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere, a major contributor for green house effect and the global warming. To overcome these problems there is a need of cost effective, alternative and innovative materials. These materials are <b>stone</b> quarry <b>dust,</b> fly ash, silica fume, rice husk, recycled waste aggregate etc. some of them are industrial by products and are substantially available. In this paper a comprehensive effort is made to partially replace the natural river sand by <b>stone</b> quarry <b>dust</b> and cement by fly ash as an alternative in combination with mineral admixture, for concrete ingredients which shall lead to global sustainable development and lowest possible environmental impact and will also reduce cost of construction as well. 1...|$|R

It began the descent easy enough, rolling over, wobbling, and threatening to stop; but in a few minutes it was soaring through the air two hundred feet at a jump. It grew rapidly smaller until it struck a slight slope of volcanic sand, over which it darted like a startled jackrabbit, kicking up behind it a tiny trail of yellow <b>dust.</b> <b>Stone</b> and <b>dust</b> diminished in size, until some of the party said the stone had stopped. That was because they could not see it any longer. It had vanished into the distance beyond their ken. Others saw it rolling farther on--I know I did; and it is my firm conviction that that stone is still rolling.|$|R
