5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the implant (referred to as primary <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E

40|$|The {{gas phase}} <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> Group I metal {{complexes}} of the polyether ionophore antibiotics lasalocid and monensin were investigated by collision induced dissociation mass spectrometry. Electrospray ionization was {{used with a}} triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the determination of threshold dissociation energies upon application of increasing collision energies. Various data analysis techniques for the determination of dissociation energies are discussed to assess the most suitable method for determining the <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> the ionophore-metal complexes studied here. In all cases only the relative <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> different complexes may be obtained by the method presented in this study, which does not assess absolute gas phase dissociation energies. Correction factors have been applied, however, {{to account for the}} energy conversion during collisions of different metal complexes and the varying degrees of freedom of different sized ligands, allowing for the comparison <b>of</b> the <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> different ionophores with like-metals. The measured threshold dissociation energies were compared with respect to the ionic radius of the metal cation, revealing a maximum stability for the K+ complexes of both lasalocid and monensin. A striking decrease in the <b>stabilities</b> <b>of</b> the Rb+ and Cs+ complexes was observed and is believed to be related to a decreasing degree of coordination that the ionophores can accomplish with the larger metals.
