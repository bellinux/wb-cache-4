5|$|After {{the season}} started on June1, CSU issued a mid-season {{forecast}} on August4, which predicted 11named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. Six {{days after the}} CSU prediction, NOAA also released a mid-season outlook, forecasting exactly the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of activity, 11named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. With a 75% percent chance of above average activity, there was an elevated risk of landfalling hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males {{do not have to}} expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the <b>same</b> <b>amount.</b> The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
40|$|The cancer on {{the side}} of the greater {{curvature}} of the stomach is generally benign. It is considered to owe to that the connective tissue surrounding tumor proliferates more markedly on that side than that on the lesser curvature and suppresses the growth of the cancer by enclosing. Rabbits were used for the following experiments. 1. The <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> of Brown-Pearce tumor stocks were inoculated at the same in the greater and lesser curvatures of the same rabbit. The growth was always stronger in the lesser curvature. 2. The <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> of foreign bodies (hard paraffin, silk thread and fluid paraffin) were enbedded or injected at the same time into the greater and lesser curvatures of the same rabbit. The proliferation of surrounding connective tissue was more marked in the greater curvature than in the lesser curvature. 3. The <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> of Brown-Pearce tumor were inoculated at the same time into the greater and lesser curvatures. The proliferation of connctive tissue surrounding the new tumor was stronger in the greater curvature than in the lesser curvature, but the inflammatory infiltration howed no difference. 4. From the results in 1) and 3) the proliferation of the connective tissue surrounding the tumor is to be considered one of anticarcinomic reactions...|$|R

5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E

5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E

5|$|In 1722, René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur {{demonstrated}} that iron {{was transformed into}} steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon.

5|$|In 1772, the French {{scientist}} Antoine Lavoisier used a lens {{to concentrate}} {{the rays of}} the sun on a diamond in an atmosphere of oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, proving that diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment. By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E

5|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> {{of the drug}} may differ {{by as much as}} 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E
5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
