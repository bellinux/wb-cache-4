5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain interacts with the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world goes to the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain receives somatosensory input from the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and visual input from the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual field.|$|E

5|$|Filling {{the void}} left by Barrett's {{departure}} in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote {{the lyrics to}} the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon has been a concept album. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, The Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{was one of the}} most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.|$|E
