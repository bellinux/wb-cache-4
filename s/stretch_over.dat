5|$|The Waterloo Wind Farm is a 111 MW {{wind farm}} which was {{completed}} in 2010 at an estimated cost of $300 million. Thirty-seven Vestas V90 3 MW turbines <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> the 18km wind farm site and are connected through a 33 kilovolt (kV) internal reticulation network to the wind farm substation. The wind farm is approximately 30 kilometres south-east of the township of Clare and 100km north of Adelaide. A Stage 2 expansion was approved to add up to an additional 6 turbines to the existing farm and increase its total generating capacity to over 130 MW. Expansion is expected to commence in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{international}} terminal's original completion, it has undergone two large expansions. One such expansion is underway and will <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> twenty years (2005–25). This will include an additional high-rise office block, {{the construction of}} a multi-level car park, the expansion of both international and domestic terminals. These expansions—and other plans and policies by Macquarie Bank for airport operations—are seen as controversial, as they are performed without the legal oversight of local councils, which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments. As of April 2006, some of the proposed development has been scaled back.|$|E
25|$|When {{international}} {{measure was}} introduced in the English-speaking countries, the basic geodetic datum in North America was the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27), which had been constructed by triangulation based on the definition of the foot in the Mendenhall Order of 1893, that is 1foot= meters: this definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the US survey foot to distinguish it from the international foot. For most applications, {{the difference between the two}} definitions is insignificant– one international foot is exactly 0.999998 of a US survey foot, for a difference of about inch (3mm) per mile– but it affects the definition of the State Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCSs), which can <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> hundreds of miles.|$|E
25|$|Indonesia has a well-preserved, natural {{ecosystem}} with rainforests that <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> about 57% of Indonesia's land (225 million acres), approximately 2% {{of which}} are mangrove systems. One reason why the natural ecosystem in Indonesia is still well-preserved is because only 6,000 islands out of 17,000 are permanently inhabited. Forests on Sumatra and Java are examples of popular tourist destinations. Moreover, Indonesia has one of longest coastlines in the world, measuring , {{with a number of}} beaches and island resorts, such as those in southern Bali, Lombok, Bintan and Nias Island. However, most of the well-preserved beaches are those in more isolated and less developed areas, such as Karimunjawa, the Togian Islands, and the Banda Islands.|$|E

500|$|... "Un-American Graffiti" [...] is {{the first}} episode of Veronica Mars not {{to be part of}} a broader story arc in the form of a mystery that Veronica solves over several episodes.

Series creator Rob Thomas gave two rationales for the creative change. The first was that he believed that the story arcs alienated new or casual viewers, meaning that the change would solve the series' low Nielsen ratings, while the other reason was that he noticed that after the first season, the show had garnered the most narrative criticism about the story arcs. On trying the new narrative structure, Thomas stated, [...] "It seems like a good time to do it—a good fun test balloon. Try it over five [...] and see how fans and non-fans react." [...] However, Thomas also commented that the show would continue to exhibit a degree of serialization through Veronica's romantic and personal life. In addition, the new story formula was a way to have episodes focus on Veronica's personal life instead of devoting most of the episode time to advancing rushed mysteries.|$|E

They are home to the largest fishing port in the U.S., Dutch Harbor. The primary target species is pollock, but crabs, salmon and groundfish are also important. Between 1997 and 2001, groundfish were caught by bottom trawling, a fishing method which destroys the habitat of the groundfish, the ocean floor coral and sponge communities. In 2005, about 80,000km2 (30,000 sq mi) of seafloor around the Aleutian Islands were permanently closed to destructive fishing gears. In 2008, NOAA fisheries created the Aleutian Islands Habitat Conservation Area (AIHCA), most of which is closed to bottom trawling. At 725,000km2 (280,000 sq mi), the AIHCA is the largest marine protected area in the USA.|$|E
