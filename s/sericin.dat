5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with <b>sericin.</b> In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of fibroin protein surrounded by <b>sericin,</b> which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding <b>sericin</b> is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding <b>sericin.</b> Since this discovery, silk with the <b>sericin</b> removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the <b>sericin</b> from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na2CO3 solution, which removes the <b>sericin</b> without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Biocompatibility, i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The biocompatibility of silk arose during its increasing clinical use. Indeed, wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses when silk fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of <b>sericin,</b> the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that <b>sericin</b> is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of <b>sericin</b> is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of <b>sericin</b> to inflammatory responses based on isolated <b>sericin</b> and <b>sericin</b> based biomaterials. In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo. Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses and diseases have been triggered by the degraded products of silk fibroin.|$|E
30|$|The current {{recombinant}} protein production systems using transgenic silkworms utilize mainly silk glands. The silk gland secretory products are categorized into two groups—sericins and fibroins. The <b>sericins</b> are glue proteins coating {{the surface of}} the silk thread and contribute as much as 25 % of the cocoon silk. The fibroins form the silk thread and constitute the remaining 75 % of the cocoon silk proteins. The <b>sericins</b> are produced in the middle silk gland (MSG) region, while the fibroins are secreted in the posterior part of the silk glands (PSG). The <b>sericins</b> and fibroins have different properties; the <b>sericins</b> are easily dissolved in ordinary buffer, but dissolving fibroins requires the use of strong protein-denaturing agents. The protein secretory mechanisms also differ in the MSG and PSG. The {{recombinant protein}}s produced in the MSG are secreted more easily compared to those in the PSG. For example, intact human collagen produced in the PSG is not transferred to the lumen, whereas there is no problem with its secretion in the MSG (Adachi et al. 2010;Tomita 2011). Therefore, the MSG as a production system is more useful for proteins, which require easy purification without losing their biological activity, whereas the PSG seems to be more suitable for the production of specialized proteins, like modified silks (Tatemastu et al. 2012). Consistently, human serum albumin, mouse IgG antibody, and full-length collagen have been produced in MSGs (Ogawa et al. 2007;Iizuka et al. 2009;Adachi et al. 2010). Projects involving the production of fluorescent color proteins, spider silks, cytokine, human growth factor and mini-collagen as a fusion protein with fibroin H or L chains were performed in PSGs (Iizuka et al. 2013;Teule et al. 2012;Kurihara et al. 2007;Tomita et al. 2003). The production of human μ-opioid receptor was also reported in the fat body (Tateno et al. 2009). Although the production of recombinant proteins in transgenic silkworms has already been established, problems regarding increasing productivity and posttranslational modifications need to be addressed (Tatemastu et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{the pure}} fibroins were {{isolated}} by first removing the <b>sericins</b> from the silk threads, {{and then a}} range of BMSF/APSF blends were prepared, respectively, from these sericin-deprived, “regenerated” silks, and cast as membranes. The enhancement of cell adhesion to the fibroin membranes is important for tissue engineering applications, but not sufficient. Equally important is the strength of these membranes, as they will ultimately be manipulated by surgeons to be implanted. We evaluate and discuss here the characteristics of membranes made of BMSF, APSF and their blends, {{with an emphasis on}} their mechanical properties.|$|R
40|$|Silk cocoons are {{composed}} of fiber proteins (fibroins) and adhesive glue proteins (<b>sericins),</b> which provide a physical barrier to protect the inside pupa. Moreover, other proteins were identified in the cocoon silk, {{many of which are}} immune related proteins. In this study, we extracted proteins from the silkworm cocoon by Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7. 5), and found that they had a strong inhibitory activity against fungal proteases and they had higher abundance in the outer cocoon layers than in the inner cocoon layers. Moreover, we found that extracted cocoon proteins can inhibit the germination of Beauveria bassiana spores. Consistent with the distribution of protease inhibitors, we found that proteins from the outer cocoon layers showed better inhibitory effects against B. bassiana spores than proteins from the inner layers. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to reveal the extracted components in the scaffold silk, the outermost cocoon layer. A total of 129 proteins were identified, 30 of which were annotated as protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors accounted for 89. 1 % in abundance among extracted proteins. These protease inhibitors have many intramolecular disulfide bonds to maintain their stable structure, and remained active after being boiled. This study added a new understanding to the antimicrobial function of the cocoon...|$|R
25|$|Specific {{purposes}} {{apart from}} the commercial are researched in advanced countries to breed development for specific purposes like <b>sericin</b> production, sex-limited breeds, and thin/thick filament production. Disease-resistance breeding is important, as the major reason for crop losses is pathogen infection. Efforts are being made to select breeds which are tolerant or resistant to various pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Silk {{emitted by}} the {{silkworm}} {{consists of two}} main proteins, <b>sericin</b> and fibroin, fibroin being the structural center of the silk, and serecin being the sticky material surrounding it. Fibroin {{is made up of}} the amino acids Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala and forms beta pleated sheets. Hydrogen bonds form between chains, and side chains form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond network.|$|E
25|$|A special {{manufacturing}} process removes the outer <b>sericin</b> coating of the silk, {{which makes it}} suitable as non-absorbable surgical sutures. This process has also recently led {{to the introduction of}} specialist silk underclothing, which has been used for skin conditions including eczema. New uses and manufacturing techniques have been found for silk for making everything from disposable cups to drug delivery systems and holograms.|$|E
40|$|Ultracentrifugal {{analyses}} of the native silk proteins extracted from the {{various parts of the}} middle silk gland of the mature silkworm have revealed that there exist four components with S °M,, values of 10 S, 9 - 10 S, 9 S, and 4 S in the extract. It is suggested that the fastest 10 S component is the native fibroin synthesized in the posterior silk gland and transferred to the middle silk gland to be stored there, while the slower three components probably correspond to inner, middle, and outer <b>sericins</b> which were synthesized in the posterior, middle, and anterior portion of the middle silk gland, respectively. Native fibroin solution was prepared from the most posterior part of the middle silk gland. Ultracentrifugal analyses have shown that the solution contains considerable amounts of aggregates in addition to the main 10 S component. Treatment with lithium bromide (Liar), urea, or guanidine hydrochloride solution up to 6 M all have failed to dissociate the 10 S component. From the sedimentation equilibrium analyses and partial specific volume of 0. 71 6 i the molecular weight of the 10 S component of the native fibroin solution was found to be between 3. 2 - 4. 2 X 10 5, with a tendency to lie fairly close to 3. 7 X 10 5...|$|R
40|$|Insect silks are {{secreted}} {{from diverse}} gland types; this chapter {{deals with the}} silks produced by labial glands of Holometabola (insects with pupa in their life cycle). Labial silk glands are composed of a few tens or hundreds of large polyploid cells that secrete polymerizing proteins which are stored in the gland lumen as a semi-liquid gel. Polymerization is based on weak molecular interactions between repetitive amino acid motifs present {{in one or more}} silk proteins; cross-linking by disulfide bonds may be important in the silks spun under water. The mechanism of long-term storage of the silk dope inside the glands and its conversion into the silk fiber during spinning is not fully understood. The conversion occurs within seconds at ambient temperature and pressure, under minimal drawing force and in some cases under water. The silk filament is largely built of proteins called fibroins and in Lepidoptera and Trichoptera coated by glue-type proteins known as <b>sericins.</b> Silks often contain small amounts of additional proteins of poorly known function. The silk components controlling dope storage and filament formation seem to be conserved at the level of orders, while the nature of polymerizing motifs in the fibroins, which determine the physical properties of silk, differ at the level of family and even genus. Most silks are based on fibroin β-sheets interrupted with other structures such as α-helices but the silk proteins of certain sawflies have predominantly a collagen-like or polyglycine II arrangement and the silks of social Hymenoptera are formed from proteins in a coiled coil arrangement...|$|R
25|$|Silk moths {{lay eggs}} on {{specially}} prepared paper. The eggs hatch and the caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh mulberry leaves. After about 35 days and 4 moltings, the caterpillars are 10,000 times heavier than when hatched and {{are ready to}} begin spinning a cocoon. A straw frame is placed over the tray of caterpillars, and each caterpillar begins spinning a cocoon by moving its head in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and force it through openings in the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is coated in <b>sericin,</b> a water-soluble protective gum, and solidifies on contact with the air. Within 2–3 days, the caterpillar spins about 1 mile of filament and is completely encased in a cocoon. The silk farmers then heat the cocoons to kill them, leaving some to metamorphose into moths to breed {{the next generation of}} caterpillars. Harvested cocoons are then soaked in boiling water to soften the <b>sericin</b> holding the silk fibers together in a cocoon shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a continuous thread. Since a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial use, anywhere from three to ten strands are spun together to form a single thread of silk.|$|E
25|$|Silk fibers {{from the}} Bombyx mori {{silkworm}} have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5–10 μm wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of beta-sheets, {{due to a}} 59-mer amino acid repeat sequence with some variations. The flat surfaces of the fibrils reflect light at many angles, giving silk a natural sheen. The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and diameter: crescent-like for Anaphe and elongated wedge for tussah. Silkworm fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands {{as a pair of}} primary filaments (brin), which are stuck together, with <b>sericin</b> proteins that act like glue, to form a bave. Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 μm. See cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.|$|E
25|$|Silks {{derived from}} Bombyx mori are {{generally}} made of two parts: the silk fibroin fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa {{and a heavy}} chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond and a glue-like protein, <b>sericin,</b> comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic Beta sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of poly(lactic acid) and hundreds of times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers have {{found their way into}} tendon tissue engineering, where mechanical properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides more choices for their use in tissue engineering.|$|E
5000|$|Composed {{structurally}} of 18 different amino acids, and 32% serine, in most commonly, {{a randomized}} amorphous coil. When in the amorphous coil, <b>sericin</b> {{can also be}} easily be converted into a β-sheet conformation, via repeated moisture absorption and mechanical stretching. Using gamma ray examination, {{it was determined that}} <b>sericin</b> fibers are composed typically of three layers, all with fibers running in different patterns of directionality. The innermost layer, typically is composed of longitudinally running fibers, the middle layer is composed of cross fiber directional patterned fibers, and the outer layer consists of fiber directional fibers. The overall structure can also vary based on temperature, whereas the lower the temperature, there were typically more β-sheet conformations than random amorphous coils. There are also three different types of <b>sericin,</b> which make up the layers found on top of the fibrin. <b>Sericin</b> A, which is insoluble in water, is the outermost layer, and contains approximately 17% nitrogen, along with amino acids such as serine, threonine, aspartic acid, and glycine. <b>Sericin</b> B, composed the middle layer and is nearly the same as <b>sericin</b> A, but also contains tryptophan. <b>Sericin</b> C is the innermost layer, the layer that comes closest to and is adjacent to fibroin. Also insoluble in water, <b>sericin</b> C can be separated from the fibroin via the addition of a hot, weak acid. <b>Sericin</b> C also contains the amino acids present in B, along with the addition of proline.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition of <b>sericin</b> is C30H40N10O16.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sericin</b> {{has also}} been used in {{medicine}} and cosmetics. Due to its elasticity and tensile strength, along with a natural affinity for keratin, <b>sericin</b> is primarily used in medicine for wound suturing. It also has a natural infection resistance, and is used variably due to excellent biocompatibility, and thus is used commonly as a wound coagulant as well. When used in cosmetics, <b>sericin</b> {{has been found to}} improve skin elasticity and several anti-aging factors, including an anti-wrinkle property. This is done by minimizing water loss from the skin. To determine this, scientists ran several experimental procedures, including a hydroxyproline assay, impedance measurements, water loss from the epidermis and scanning electron microscopy to analyze the rigidity and dryness of the skin. The presence or <b>sericin</b> increases hydroxyproline in the stratum corneum, which in turn, decrease skin impedance, thus increasing skin moisture. Adding in pluronic and carbopol, two other factors that can be included in <b>sericin</b> gels, perform the action of repairing natural moisture factors (NMF), along with minimizing water loss, and in turn, improving skin moisture.|$|E

What is not so well known though is that silk has been used in traditional medicine in both China and Korea for centuries. The source of these silk amino acids is typically the domesticated moth, silkworm (Latin name: Bombyx mori).|$|E
