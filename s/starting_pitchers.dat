40|$|In the Japanese Professional Baseball League (JPBL), the <b>starting</b> <b>pitcher</b> is {{announced}} {{prior to the}} game in the Pacific League (PL) but not in the Central League (CL).

(b) In the CL, neither the salary (or the overall number of wins) of the home team’s <b>starting</b> <b>pitcher</b> nor that of the visiting team affect attendance. game information; attendance; Japanese Professional Baseball League...|$|R
