Identitary issues affect the public dimension of collective life {{and they often}} develop into economic, legal, political terms. There are many types of collective identity. We would clarify {{some of them in}} order to focus the analytical tools that are necessary to face the phenomena we are interested with: national and regional identities. Crucial in our argument are the concept of “political identity” and its “territorial” dimension. This concept and this dimension consent to compare Nation-State and (sub-national) region as space of collective life, and their “authoritative” degree. According to this subject this essay will treat the following points: the return of identity politics nowadays (section 1); the concept of collective identity (section 2); the many faces of collective identity (section 3); the relationship among politics, territory and identity, analyzed through the paradigmatic case of Nation-state and national identity (section 4); the structuring of political <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>centre</b> and peripheries, where we consider how the dominance of Nation-State model has to face persisting of territorial cleavages (section 5); the case of the regional issue (section 6); the “strength” and the “value” of Nation-State (sections 7 and 8) ...|$|R

This paper examines how {{the presence of}} retail amenities in Dutch regions is dependent on their {{spatial structure}}. Retail amenities, in particular those specialized retail functions that require a large urban support base, are less found in more polycentric and more dispersed regions. This {{can be explained by}} the observation that in polycentric and dispersed regions the degree of market fragmentation is higher as a result of more intense regional competition and <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> retail <b>centres.</b> Evidence is found for ways to overcome the lack of agglomeration benefits in more polycentric and more dispersed regions. Both concentration of retail and more complementarities between cities' retail amenities may make up for the disadvantages of regions being polycentric or dispersed. These findings provide a rationale to coordinate regionally specialized retailing in polycentric and dispersed regions...|$|R

The basic patch antenna undergoes the first and second iteration process to form the first and second iteration fractal structures. The array elements are equally <b>spaced</b> <b>between</b> their corresponding <b>centres.</b> Through experimental investigations, {{it was found that the}} fractal antenna array operates at lower frequency of operations compared to the basic two element square patch antenna.

Usage of two–phase gas–liquid foam flow as a coolant allows achieving relatively large heat transfer intensity with smaller coolant mass flow rate. However number of foam peculiarities complicates an application of the analytical methods for heat transfer investigation. Presently an experimental method of investigation {{was selected as the}} most suitable. Due to the fact that tube bundles of different geometry my be used in foam apparatus, the experimental investigation of heat transfer of the in–line tube bundle with different <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> tubes to vertical foam flow was performed. Spacing among the centres of the tubes across the in–line tube bundle was 0. 03 m and spacing along the bundle was 0. 03 m. In other case the spacing along the bundle was 0. 06 m. Results of investigation showed that an effect of “shadow” is slight and heat transfer is higher for the tubes of the in–line tube bundle with more <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> the tubes’ <b>centres</b> along the bundle. cs 201...|$|R
5000|$|Via fences {{are also}} used in post-wall waveguide, also known as {{laminated}} waveguide (LWG). [...] In LWG, two parallel via fences form the sidewalls of a waveguide. Between them, and {{the upper and lower}} groundplanes of the substrate, is an electromagnetically isolated space. There is no electrical conductor within this space, but electromagnetic waves can exist within the enclosed dielectric material of the substrate and their direction of propagation is guided by the LWG. This technology is typically used at millimetre band frequencies and consequently dimensions are quite small. Furthermore, good isolation requires that the vias are closely spaced. Typically, 60 dB isolation is required between guides, that is 30 dB per fence. A typical W band (75-110 GHz) fence specification meeting this requirement in LWG is [...]003 in vias <b>spaced</b> [...]006 in <b>between</b> <b>centres.</b> This can be challenging to manufacture, and a higher density of vias is sometimes achieved by constructing the fence from two staggered rows of vias.|$|R

60|$|Or {{instead of}} night, suppose it {{day and the}} place a temple. With those who are {{entering}} you enter too through the outer gateway into the courtyard. At the farther end rises a building the like of which for richness of effect you have probably never beheld or even imagined. In front of you a flight of white stone steps leads up to a terrace whose parapet, also of stone, is diapered for half its height and open latticework the rest. This piazza gives entrance to a building or set of buildings whose every detail challenges the eye. Twelve pillars of snow-white wood sheathed in part with bronze, arranged in four rows, make, as it were, {{the bones of the}} structure. The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the <b>centre</b> columns lies open. The other triplets are webbed in the middle and connected, on the sides and front, by grilles of wood and bronze forming on the outside a couple of embrasures on either hand the entrance in which stand the guardian Nio, two colossal demons, Gog and Magog. Instead of capitals, a frieze bristling with Chinese lions protects the top of the pillars. Above this in place of entablature rises tier upon tier of decoration, each tier projecting beyond the one beneath, and the topmost of all terminating in a balcony which encircles the whole second story. The parapet of this balcony is one mass of ornament, and its cornice another row of lions, brown instead of white. The second story is no less crowded with carving. Twelve pillars make its ribs, the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> being filled with elaborate woodwork, while on top rest more friezes, more cornices, clustered with excrescences of all colors and kinds, and guarded by lions innumerable. To begin to tell the details of so multi-faceted a gem were artistically impossible. It is a jewel of a thousand rays, yet whose beauties blend into one as the prismatic tints combine to white. And then, after the first dazzle of admiration, when the spirit of curiosity urges you to penetrate the centre aisle, lo and behold it is but a gate! The dupe of unexpected splendor, you have been paying court to the means of approach. It is only a portal after all. For as you pass through, you catch a glimpse of a building beyond more gorgeous still. Like in general to the first, unlike it in detail, resembling it only as the mistress may the maid. But who shall convince of charm by enumerating the features of a face! From the tiles of its terrace to the encrusted gables that drape it as with some rich bejewelled mantle falling about it in the most graceful of folds, it is the very eastern princess of a building standing in the majesty of her court to give you audience.|$|R
