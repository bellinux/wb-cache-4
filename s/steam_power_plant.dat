500|$|Nevada was {{the first}} {{battleship}} in the US Navy to have triple gun turrets, a single funnel, and an oil-fired <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> In particular, {{the use of the}} more-efficient oil gave the ship an advantage over earlier coal-fired plants. Nevada was also the first US battleship with geared turbines, which also helped increase fuel economy and thus range compared to earlier direct drive turbines. The ability to steam great distances without refueling was a major concern of the General Board at that time. In 1903, the Board felt all American battleships should have a minimum steaming radius of [...] so that the US could enforce the Monroe Doctrine. One of the main purposes of the Great White Fleet, which sailed around the world in 1907–1908, was to prove to Japan that the US Navy could [...] "carry any naval conflict into Japanese home waters". Possibly as a result of this, battleships after 1908 were mainly designed to [...] "steam 8,000miles at cruising speeds"; given the distance between San Pedro, where the fleet would be based, and Manila, where the Fleet was expected to have to fight under War Plan Orange, was , endurance was obviously a major concern for the U.S. Navy. Also, oil allowed for the boiler-room crew to be reduced— the engineer on [...] estimated that 100 firemen (stokers) and 112 coal passers could be adequately replaced by just 24 men, which would allow some crew's quarters to be eliminated; this would save weight and also reduce the amount of fresh water and provisions that the ship would have to carry.|$|E

30|$|Geothermal <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> mainly {{come in two}} groups, namely, <b>steam</b> and binary <b>power</b> cycles. These cycles {{operate at}} high {{geothermal}} fluid enthalpy. The single flash cycle contains only one throttling valve (expansion valve) through which the geothermal fluid is expanded, and one separator to separate the vapor from the liquid after the expansion process in the expansion valve. This separation occurs at constant pressure and temperature. The vapor generated is sent to a steam turbine to produce electricity while the liquid is re-injected back to the ground. The geothermal fluid in the well is above 182  °C for the flash <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Flash <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> use a condenser to condense the steam leaving the turbine and then re-inject it into the ground.|$|R
50|$|Rankine cycle: <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> The Rankine {{cycle is}} the cycle used in <b>steam</b> turbine <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> The {{overwhelming}} majority of the world's electric power is produced with this cycle. Since the cycle's working fluid, water, changes from liquid to vapor and back during the cycle, their efficiencies depend on the thermodynamic properties of water. The thermal efficiency of modern steam turbine plants with reheat cycles can reach 47%, and in combined cycle plants, in which a <b>steam</b> turbine is <b>powered</b> by exhaust heat from a gas turbine, it can approach 60%.|$|R
50|$|In 1920/1 a {{joint venture}} Rosenthal-Isolatoren GmbH (Rosenthal Insulators) with Rosenthal & Co. AG {{as well as a}} steel plant were founded in Hennigsdorf.

2500|$|Combining {{two or more}} {{thermodynamic}} cycles {{results in}} improved overall efficiency, reducing fuel costs. In stationary power plants, a widely used combination is a gas turbine (operating by the Brayton cycle) burning natural gas or synthesis gas from coal, whose hot exhaust powers a <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> (operating by the Rankine cycle). [...] This is called a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, and can achieve a best-of-class real (HHV - see below) thermal efficiency of around 54% in base-load operation, {{in contrast to a}} single cycle <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> which is limited to efficiencies of around 35–42%. Many new gas power plants in North America and Europe are of the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine type. [...] Such an arrangement is also used for marine propulsion, and is called a combined gas and steam (COGAS) plant. Multiple stage turbine or steam cycles are also common.|$|E
2500|$|For eleven {{months in}} 1932 to 1933, Monticello was {{chartered}} by maritime unions {{during a long}} wage dispute so that union men could ride on a union boat from Seattle to their jobs at the Navy Yard and still boycott the Puget Sound Navigation Company, then the biggest private inland shipping concern on the Sound. [...] Virginia V also was chartered by the unions for a similar role. By this time, Monticello’s <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> {{was in a state}} of deterioration. [...] Her boiler tubes were leaking, and the engineering crew hit on the idea of putting horse manure in the feedwater to stop the leaks. [...] This actually worked, although one of her all-union crew had to carry the burden of collecting horse manure along the waterfront and bringing it back to the boat.|$|E
2500|$|The National Theatre Brno is {{the leading}} scene of opera, drama and ballet {{in the city of}} Brno. The first {{permanent}} seat of the National Theatre Brno was established in 1884 and it was called Národní divadlo v Brně (en: the National Theatre in Brno), today this institution owns the Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre built in 1965, and the Reduta Theatre which is Central Europe's oldest theatre. The composer Leoš Janáček is also connected with the National Theatre Brno. [...] Another interesting fact about the National Theatre Brno: the Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison's electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] unlined {{aboveground}} ash fill, {{which was}} situated [...] above the ash pond and [...] above the Emory River winter level, [...] above sea level, contained a watery slurry of fly ash {{generated by the}} burning of finely ground coal at the <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> Fly ash is the fine particulate pollutants produced by the combustion of coal, which are collected rather than allowing them to escape into the atmosphere, then mixed with water {{so they can be}} pumped into the retaining pond. Once the particulate matter settles out, it is dredged to drying cells. The dredge cell was surrounded by [...] tall earthen walls, which had twice developed leaks since 2002. Although the land surrounding the power plant is largely rural rather than residential, the spill caused a mudflow wave of water and ash that covered 12 homes, pushing one entirely off its foundation, rendering three uninhabitable, and caused some damage to 42 residential properties. It also washed out a road, ruptured a major gas line, obstructed a rail line, downed trees, broke a water main, and destroyed power lines. Though 22 residences were evacuated, nobody was reported to be injured or in need of hospitalization. It was the largest coal-related slurry spill in United States history, {{more than three times the}} size of the Martin County sludge spill of 2000, which spilled [...] of liquid coal waste. The [...] of sludge were enough to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools, and the volume released was about 101 times larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (1.1 billion/10.9 million=100.9). On December 23, 2008, a TVA spokesman, Gil Francis Jr., stated that, at the time of the spill, the area contained about 2.6 million cubic yards (2.2 millionm³) of ash, and that two-thirds of that had been released, which would later be found to cover an area of [...] The New York Times noted that the amount spilled is larger than the amount stated to have been in the pond before the spill, a discrepancy the TVA was unable to explain. The containment area affected was one of three; the other two stayed intact, while only the retaining wall for the [...] solid waste containment area was affected.|$|E
2500|$|The King George Vs {{were the}} first British battleships to {{alternate}} engine rooms and boilers in the machinery spaces, which reduced the likelihood of one hit causing the loss of all power. The machinery was arranged in four engine (turbine) rooms and four boiler rooms, with the 8 machinery compartments alternating in pairs of engine or boiler rooms. Each pair of boiler rooms formed a unit {{with a pair of}} engine rooms. Nominal full power was 110,000 shaft horsepower at 230 rpm with [...] steam at [...] The machinery was designed to operate at an overload power of 125,000 shp and Prince of Wales [...] "...main machinery steamed at overload powers of 128,000 to 134,000 shaft horsepower with no difficulties..." [...] during the hunt for the Bismarck. The Admiralty boilers operated very efficiently and similar boilers of nearly identical power, fitted to [...] during her rebuilding in 1937, achieved a full power specific fuel consumption [...] of 0.748lb per shp on trials which compared favourably with contemporary battleships. During full power trials on 10 December 1940, King George V at 41,630 tons displacement achieved 111,700 shp at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715lb per shp. [...] After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use fuel oils with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use. The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination to reduce the efficiency of the <b>steam</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> and increased the maintenance required. [...] By 1944 the specific full power fuel consumption had increased to 0.8lb per shp and boiler maintenance was becoming increasingly difficult. The Admiralty had been aware of this problem and were designing new types of oil sprayers and burners that could burn the available fuel oil much more efficiently, and sometime after 1944, Duke of York and Anson were fitted with new, higher pressure, oil sprayers and burners that restored the boilers to full efficiency. These same oil sprayers and burners were used in [...] along with other detail improvements so that Vanguard achieved a full power specific fuel consumption of 0.63lb per shp while using the same steam pressures and temperatures as used on the King George V class.|$|E
