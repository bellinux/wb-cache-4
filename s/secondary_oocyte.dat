A total of 13 DNA probes were obtained through chromosome microdissection and DOP-PCR amplification, labelled with two fluorochromes and sequentially hybridized on river buffalo, cattle (Bos taurus, 2 n = 60,XY), sheep (Ovis aries, 2 n = 54,XY) and goat (Capra hircus, 2 n = 60,XY) metaphases. The same set of paintings were then hybridized on bovine <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes</b> to test their potential use for aneuploidy detection during in vitro maturation.

The evaluation of aneuploidies in bovine oocytes is useful for monitoring the reproductive health of this species and FISH is the main method employed for this purpose. To date only 2 – 3 chromosomes were simultaneously investigated for aneuploidy detection in cattle oocytes. In this work we propose a multi-color ZOO-FISH by the simultaneous detection of six specific chromosome painting probes on <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes</b> matured in vitro. Standard procedures were employed for 24 h in vitro oocytes maturation, whereas specific autosomal probes were prepared by microdissection and DOP-PCR using river buffalo mitosis (2 n= 50). Probes were labelled with spectrum-green and -orange in a second DOP-PCR. Three sequential rounds of FISH were achieved for the same slides. Each round was realized using two probes simultaneously hybridized on MII oocytes with the corresponding first polar bodies (I pb). Slides were counterstained with DAPI in antifade. Digital images were captured in gray-scale and pseudo-colored by the software. Six specific probes, painting 3 out of 5 sub-metacentric river buffalo chromosomes (BBU 1 p, 1 q, 3 p, 3 q, 4 p and 4 q) were sequentially hybridized on BTA <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes</b> with the corresponding (I pb).

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Early embryo {{development}} {{is dependent on}} maternally derived RNA and protein synthesized during oogenesis. In the bovine embryo this dependence lasts until the 8 - 16 cell stage, at which time embryonic transcripts become essential for continued development. One proposed mechanism for this transition from maternal to zygotic control of development (maternal to zygotic genome activation; MZGA) is the appearance of transcription factors that activate specific genes in the embryonic genome. The E 26 transforming specific (Ets) family of transcription factors is involved in development, differentiation and protease regulation, and is a logical candidate gene {{to be involved in}} MZGA. Determining the role of Ets- 1 in early {{embryo development}} may provide useful insight into mechanisms contributing to early embryonic death and pregnancy failure. Ets- 1 transcripts were detected in bovine primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes,</b> primary and <b>secondary</b> cumulus <b>oocyte</b> complexes (COC), presumed zygotes, and 2 - to 16 -cell in vitro-derived embryos.

Blocking Ets- 1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides inhibited development in in vitro-derived bovine embryos. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) production by in vivo-derived bovine embryos was reduced with antisense oligonucleotides. These results suggest that Ets- 1 is likely constitutively expressed in early cleavage stage bovine embryos.

40|$|AbstractOocytes of {{wild-type}} mice are ovulated as the <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes</b> {{arrested at}} metaphase {{of the second}} meiotic division. Their fertilization or parthenogenetic activation triggers {{the completion of the}} second meiotic division followed by the first embryonic interphase. Oocytes of the LT/Sv strain of mice are ovulated either at the first meiotic metaphase (M I) as primary oocytes or in the second meiotic metaphase (M II) as <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes.</b> We show here that duringin vitromaturation a high proportion of LT/Sv oocytes progresses normally only until metaphase I. In these oocytes MAP kinase activates shortly after histone H 1 kinase (MPF) activation and germinal vesicle breakdown. However, MAP kinase activation is slightly earlier than in oocytes from wild-type F 1 (CBA/H × C 57 Bl/ 10) mice. The first meiotic spindle of these oocytes forms similarly to wild-type oocytes. During aging, however, it increases in size and finally degenerates. In those oocytes which do not remain in metaphase I the extrusion of first polar bodies is highly delayed and starts about 15 h after germinal vesicle breakdown. Most of the oocytes enter interphase directly after first polar body extrusion. Fusion between metaphase I LT/Sv oocytes and wild-type mitotic one-cell embryos results in prolonged M-phase arrest of hybrids in a proportion similar to control LT/Sv oocytes and control hybrids made by fusion of two M I LT/Sv oocytes. This indicates that LT/Sv oocytes develop cytostatic factor during metaphase I. Eventually, anaphase occurs spontaneously and the hybrids extrude the polar body and form pronuclei in a proportion similar as in controls. In hybrids between LT/Sv metaphase I oocytes and wild-type metaphase II oocytes (which contain cytostatic factor) anaphase I proceeds at the time observed in control LT/Sv oocytes and hybrids between two M I LT/Sv oocytes, and is followed by the parthenogenetic activation and formation of interphase nuclei. Also the great majority of hybrids between M I and M II wild-type oocytes undergoes the anaphase but further arrests in a subsequent M-phase. These observations suggest that an internally triggered anaphase I occurs despite the presence of the cytostatic activity both in LT/Sv and wild-type M I oocytes. Anaphase I triggering mechanism must therefore either inactivate or override the CSF activity. The comparison between spontaneous and induced activation of metaphase I LT/Sv oocytes shows that mechanisms involved in anaphase I triggering are altered in these oocytes. Thus, the prolongation of metaphase I in LT/Sv oocytes seems to be determined by delayed anaphase I triggering and not provoked directly by the cytostatic activity...|$|R

To elucidate the changes involved in acquisition of their fertilizability, rabbit primary oocytes displaying a germinal vesicle (GV oocytes) were placed in Fallopian tubes inseminated previously with spermatozoa, recovered 2 - 5 h later and examined by light and electron micro-scopy. At least 4 aspects of GV oocyte/sperm interaction were abnormal. Although the vest-ments and oolemma seem normally receptive to spermatozoa, fusion with the oolemma of the primary oocyte did not elicit exocytosis of cortical granules, and consequently multiple entry of spermatozoa into the ooplasm was common. Secondly, the GV oocyte cortex failed to achieve a normal engulfment of the anterior part of the sperm head. It sank into the ooplasm capped by only a small rostral vesicle or left the stable inner acrosomal membrane as a patch in the oolemma. Only rarely then was there significant dispersion of the sperm chromatin, and this remained surrounded by nuclear envelope.

Within this neural secretome, we identified a gene transcript that encoded a precursor protein with striking similarity to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). We additionally identified another GnRH NP superfamily member, the adipokinetic hormone/corazonin-related peptide (ACP). M. rosenbergii GnRH and ACP were widespread throughout the nervous tissues, implicating them as potential neuromodulators. Furthermore, GnRH was found in non-neural tissues, including the stomach, gut, heart, testis and ovary, in the latter most prominently within <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes.</b> The GnRH/corazonin receptor-like gene is specific to the ovary, whereas ACP receptor-like gene expression is more widespread.

In conclusion, our targeted analysis of the M. rosenbergii neural secretome has revealed the decapod GnRH and ACP genes.

In order to obtain clues about the molecular basis of the switch from proliferation to endoreduplication, we have investigated changes in the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases in diploid versus giant trophoblast cells. Interestingly, while cyclin B 1 transcripts were found in both diploid and giant cells, the protein was found exclusively in diploid cells. This could be explained by either inhibition of translation or by constitutive degradation of the protein. The latter was ruled out by examining blastocysts which had been cultured {{in the presence of the}} proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal followed by immunostaining for cyclin B 1. In these experiments cyclin B 1 protein accumulated in diploid but not in giant cells. Fusion of trophoblast giant cells with <b>secondary</b> <b>oocytes,</b> which are rich in maturation promoting factor (MPF) activity, revealed that an exogenous source of active MPF could cause chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown in endocycling cells; therefore endoreduplication via polyteny evidently requires the suppression of MPF activity.
