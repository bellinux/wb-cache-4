John Donne's two Anniversary poems (1611 - 12) historically have received negative criticism because of their hyperbolic praise of Elizabeth Drury. They have also been examined as either complementary or as distinct in a failed series. This study, using close reading analysis, examines the Anniversaries using the alchemical imagery found within the eulogy sections of both poems to reinterpret the nature and function of Elizabeth Drury in each poem and to argue for the poems' complementary nature. Donne's use of alchemical imagery, throughout his canon, is well documented. When Louis Martz, in 1947, concluded that the Anniversaries followed the Ignatian meditation format of Introduction, Body (with sections comprised of meditation, eulogy, refrain/moral), and Conclusion, he invited further investigations of the separate sections. Donne's use of alchemical imagery in other works supports the premise that he satirized exoteric, physical alchemy, but supported esoteric, or spiritual, alchemy. Analysis of both poems, focusing on the eulogy sections, five in FirAn and seven in <b>SecAn,</b> and their attendant meditation and refrain/moral sections, reveals that Elizabeth Drury functions as much more than beloved, deceased daughter of Donne's patron, Robert Drury. Drury progresses from functioning as the Philosopher's Stone in FirAn, attempting to transmute the world's iniquity into spiritual gold to the ouroboros, the symbol of perfect completion, in <b>SecAn,</b> where she models and guides the poetic persona's as well as the reader's soul to heaven. The study concludes that the Anniversary poems are complements. Drury's function in FirAn purposely fails; as the tincture, or the Philosopher's Stone, in the first poem, Drury could not induce permanent change upon the world because of its own flawed nature. The anatomization of the dead world in the first poem reconciles the reader to the necessity of following or progressing toward heaven, after Drury's example. Therefore, in <b>SecAn,</b> Donne changes her into the symbol of perfect completion, the ouroboros, so her function is not to change a dead world, but to lead the living toward salvation. The two poems, harmonious in structure and alchemical imagery, analyzed within the eulogy sections complete one another and change our perception of Elizabeth Drury...|$|R

Se amplían sus {{diagnosis}} y aumenta considerablemente el número de ejemplares referidos a cada una de ellas. Se establecen nuevas sinonimias y se da a conocer un esqueleto casi completo de Notopithecus adapinus y su reconstrucción en vida, lo que incrementa el conocimiento de la anatomía postcraneal de esta especie y de los notopitecinos en general. Se establecen variaciones morfológicas de la dentición a {{lo largo de}} la ontogenia y se reconoce un patrón de erupción dentaria distinto de otros grupos de notoungulados.

El lectotipo de N. adapinus es el ejemplar MACN-A 10822 a que comprende maxilar, húmero, tibia, fíbula y cinco vértebras. Se designa el ejemplar MACN-A 10858 a como lectotipo de Adpithecus reduncus y MACN-A 10827 a como lectotipo de Gonopithecus trigonodontoides. El holotipo de Notopithecus fossulatus (MACN-A 10824 a) no permite su determinación y se refiere como especie inquirenda. Notopithecus summus se considera un nomen dubium. Antepithecus brachystephanus incluye como sinónimos a Antepithecus interrasus, Infrapithecus cinctus, Pseudoadiantus imperfectus, Pseudadiantus <b>secans,</b> Adpithecus reduncus y Gonopithecus trigonodontoides (partim). Se restringe la serie típica de A. brachystephanus al M 1 figurado por Ameghino (1901), actualmente perdido, y a los sintipos aquí referidos como MACN-A 10841 a y MACN-A 10841 b. Se considera Antepithecus innexus sinónimo de Oldfieldthomasia debilitata. Se identifica como holotipo de Antepithecus plexostephanos al ejemplar MANC-A 10840 b y se refiere esta especie a los Oldfieldthomasiidae. Transpithecus obtentus incluye como sinónimos a Notopithecus fossulatus (partim), Acoelodus connectus, Paginula parca (partim) y Patriarchippus annectens. Guilielmoscottia plicifera incluye como sinónimo a Adpithecus amplidens. Se revisan, además, los taxones referidos recientemente al grupo de los notopitecinos, Punapithecus minor de la Puna (noroeste argentino) y Johnbell hatcheri e Ignigena minisculus de la región central de Chile. Para Punapithecus minor, se propone una nueva diagnosis a partir de la reinterpretación de algunos de los ejemplares referidos a esta especie. Se desestima la asignación del ejemplar SGO-PV 3604 a Antepithecus brachystephanus y, por tanto, la presencia de esta especie en Chile. Los miembros de la Familia Archaeopithecidae están muy relacionados morfológicamente con los notopitecinos. Entre los ejemplares de arqueopitécidos revisados se observaron dos patrones morfológicos claramente diferenciables, el patrón de Archaeopithecus alternans y el de Archaeopithecus rogeri por lo que se propone la validez de un único género (Archaeopithecus) con dos especies. Desde el punto de vista filogenético, los notopitecinos en sentido amplio resultaron ser parafiléticos, tal como se había establecido en estudios previos. Sin embargo, en esta tesis se propone un nuevo agrupamiento que incluye a los notopitecinos de Patagonia, excluyendo a las especies extra-patagónicas (P. minor, J. hatcheri e I. minisculus) y considerando la inclusión tentativa de los Archaeopithecidae (AMNH 28782). Este grupo resultó monofilético y está diagnosticado filogenéticamente por seis sinapomorfías, siendo una de ellas el patrón de erupción, un carácter exclusivo entre los notoungulados y que caracteriza a Notopithecus, Antepithecus y Transpithecus. En este sentido, se revalida la Familia Notopithecidae, integrada en principio por Notopithecus adapinus, Antepithecus brachystephanus, Transpithecus obtentus y Guilielmoscottia plicifera, excluyéndolos de la Familia Interatheriidae. La inclusión de los arqueopitécidos en este grupo precisa una rigurosa revisión de los taxones incluidos en la Familia Archaeopithecidae a fin de clarificar su estatus sistemático y sus relaciones filogenéticas. Se concluye con un capítulo en el que: se resume el contexto paleoclimático en el que se desarrollaron los notopitécidos; se discute la distribución bioestratigráfica del grupo, que queda restringida a las edades Casamayorense (Subedad Barranquense, Eoceno medio) y Mustersense (Eoceno medio–tardío); se presenta un análisis multivariado que apoya la diferenciación específica establecida; se realiza una estimación de las masas corporales, resultantes entre 1 y 5 kg; se infiere acerca de algunas características paleoecológicas, tal como el hábito alimentario; y se discuten aspectos paleobiogeográficos para el grupo. In this contribution {{a detailed}} systematic study of all involved species considered as notopithecines, a group of extinct ungulates of the Suborder Typotheria (Order Notoungulata) endemic to South America, is performed. A comparative morphologic description is realized, allowing the recognition of four valid species: Notopithecus adapinus, Antepithecus brachystephanus, Transpithecus obtentus, and Guilielmoscottia plicifera, expanding their diagnosis and significantly {{increasing the number of}} specimens referred to each of taxon. New synonyms are established and an almost complete skeleton of Notopithecus adapinus and its life reconstruction is presented, expanding the knowledge of the postcranial elements of this species and the notopithecines as a whole. Morphological variations of the dentition throughout ontogeny are established, and a pattern of tooth eruption different from other groups of notoungulates is recognized. N. adapinus includes as synonyms Adpithecus <b>secans,</b> Adpithecus subtenuis, Infrapithecus diversus, Epipithecus confluens, Antepithecus gradatus, Adpithecus reduncus (partim), Gonopithecus trigonodontoides, Notopithecus <b>secans,</b> and Notopithecus reduncus. The lectotype of N. adapinus is the specimen MACN-A 10822 a, which comprises the maxilla, humerus, tibia, fibula, and five vertebrae. The specimen MACN-A 10858 a is established as holotype of Adpithecus reduncus and MACN-A 10827 a as the lectotype of Gonopithecus trigonodontoides. The holotype of Notopithecus fossulatus (MACN-A 10824 a) does not permit its determination and is referred to as species inquirenda. Notopithecus summus is considered nomen dubium. Antepithecus brachystephanus includes as synonyms Antepithecus interrasus, Infrapithecus cinctus, Pseudoadiantus imperfectus, Pseudadiantus <b>secans,</b> Adpithecus reduncus, and Gonopithecus trigonodontoides (partim). The type series of A. brachystephanus is restricted to the M 1 figured by Ameghino (1901), presently lost, and the sintypes here referred as MACN-A 10841 a and MACN-A 10841 b. Antepithecus innexus is a synonym of Oldfieldthomasia debilitata. The specimen MANC-A 10840 b is identified as the holotype of Antepithecus plexostephanos and it is referred to the Oldfieldthomasiidae. Transpithecus obtentus includes as synonyms Notopithecus fossulatus (partim), Acoelodus connectus, Paginula parca (partim), and Patriarchippus annectens. Guilielmoscottia plicifera includes as synonym Adpithecus amplidens. In addition, taxa later referred to notopithecines, Punapithecus minor from the Puna (northwest Argentina) and Johnbell hatcheri and Ignigena minisculus from central Chile are also included in this thesis. For Punapithecus minor, a new diagnosis is proposed based on the reinterpretation of some specimens referred to this species. The attribution of the specimen SGO-PV 3604 to Antepithecus brachystephanus is rejected and, therefore, the presence of this species in Chile. The members of the Family Archaeopithecidae are morphologically closely related to the notopitecines. Two clearly distinguishable morphological patterns were observed among the studied specimens of arqueopitecids that of Archaeopithecus alternans and that of Archaeopithecus rogeri, proposing the validity of a single genus (Archaeopithecus) with two species. From a phylogenetic point of view, the notopithecines sensu lato are a paraphyletic group, as previously established. However, a new assemblage is proposed in this thesis, which includes the notopithecines from Patagonia, excluding the extra- Patagonian species (P. minor, J. hatchery, and I. minisculus), and considering the tentative inclusion of the Archaeopithecidae (AMNH 28782). This assemblage forms a monophyletic group supported by six synapomorphies; {{one of them is the}} dental eruption pattern, an exclusive character among notoungulates that characterizes Notopithecus, Antepithecus, and Transpithecus. Therefore, the Family Notopithecidae is revalidated, integrated at first by Notopithecus adapinus, Antepithecus brachystephanus, Transpithecus obtentus, and Guilielmoscottia plicifera, excluding them from the Family Interatheriidae. The inclusion of the arqueopithecids in this group requires a rigorous revision of the taxa included in the Family Archaeopithecidae, in order to clarify their systematic status and phylogenetic relationships. The thesis concludes with a chapter that: summarizes the paleoclimatic context in which the notopithecines were developed; discusses the biostratigraphic distribution of the group, restricting it to the Casamayoran (Barrancan subage, middle Eocene) and Mustersan (middle–late Eocene) ages; presents a multivariate analysis that supports the established specific differentiation; includes a body mass estimation, resulting a range between 1 and 5 kg; infers some paleoecological characteristics such as the feeding behaviour; and discuss paleobiogeographic aspects for the group.

40|$|We further {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} nonlinear structures that arise from the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. When the analysis is linear, assuming perturbations grow exponentially in time, we find the growth rates of two important instabilities numerically. These are the only purely growing modes. The wavelength-doubling instability is seen to dominate its rival, that of Benjamin and Feir, at least when the amplitude of the wave is not too large. Approximate formulae, found to higher order than in part I (referenced in 1), are checked against the numerically found values. The models are seen {{to be better than}} expected. For the dominant wavelength-doubling instability, our model extends beyond the assumed region of validity. It is surprisingly close, almost up to the soliton limit. When we depart from linear stability analysis and include terms nonlinear in the perturbation, a simple analysis shows that the linear instability eventually drives a doubly space-periodic hyperbolic <b>secans</b> pulse in time. After a long time, initial conditions are reproduced. A proof that the maximum amplitude achieved by the perturbation is approximately proportional to the linear growth rate is given within the limitations of the calculation. This fact was suspected from numerics. A second class of possible dynamic behaviour, not arising from initially linear growth of a perturbation, is found. This class involves fully two-dimensional stationary solutions and their possible oscillations...|$|E

Lipids greatly stimulated the ATPase activities of the fragments N 608 -N 798, reaching maximal activities around N 619. Three helices in amino-acyl residues SecA 619 - 831, which includes the "Helical Scaffold" Domain (SecA 619 - 668) are critical for pore formation, ion channel activity, and for function with SecYEG-SecDF•YajC. In the presence of liposomes, N-terminal domain fragments of SecA form pore-ring structures at fragment-size N 640, ion channel activity around N 798, and protein translocation capability around N 831. SecA domain fragments ranging in size between N 643 -N 669 are critical for functional interactions with SecYEG-SecDF•YajC. In the presence of liposomes, inactive C-terminal fragments complement smaller non-functional N-terminal fragments to form SecA-only pore structures with ion channel activity and protein translocation ability. Thus, SecA domain fragment interactions with liposomes defined critical structures and functional aspects of SecA-only channels. These data provide the mechanistic basis for SecA to form primitive, low-efficiency, SecA-only protein-conducting channels, {{as well as the}} minimal parameters for SecA to interact functionally with SecYEG-SecDF•YajC to form high-efficiency channels...|$|R
40|$|E. coli {{is natural}} flour in large {{intestine}} and main common pathogen between human and animal, and its transportable by food, that its important cause of diarrhea infections in cows, particularly in calves. The {{aim of this}} survey is identify and separating E. coli and verotoxicogenic, that by referring to Tabriz slaughterhouse in chance 43 excrement samples from calves and 151 excrement samples from cows has been taken and transport to microbiology laboratory of veterinary faculty of Islamic azad TabrizUniversity. After in riching the samples and culturing in plates this results has been taken: From 194 taken samples, 113 E. coli samples were separated that were 85 positive sorbitol samples and 28 negative sorbitol samples. From 85 positive sorbitol samples were 19 samples of calves and 66 samples of cows and from 28 negative sorbitol samples were 13 samples of calves and 15 samples of cows. Also serological test accomplished for determining E. coli non O 157 serotypes on the positive sorbitol samples that 9 samples of cows and 42 samples of cows demonstrate positive reaction, then on 28 negative sorbitol samples and 85 positive sorbitol samples, the PCR test accomplished by using <b>secans</b> of stx 1, stx 2 gens, that 15 samples of 28 negative sorbitol samples and 19 samples of 42 positive sorbitol samples were E. coli and verotoxicogenic. The result demonstrated that high amount of E. coli and verotoxicogenic exist in excrement of cows and calves slaughtered in Tabriz slaughterhouse...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} circular migration {{of a unique}} population of rural Mexican farmworkers between Guanajuato, Mexico and central Connecticut over a six-year period. Capitalizing on the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, many of these men were able to obtain U. S. legal permanent resident status, and thus became able to legalize not only their own immigration status, but also that of family members. This allows {{a unique opportunity to}} examine the impact of legal status on the migration patterns of Mexican farmworkers. Three themes emerge in this study. First, a robust transnational network has developed which facilitates continued labor migration. By mitigating the dangers and uncertainty of illegal migration, the network allows flexibility in choosing when and where to migrate for work. The network is bolstered by close, personal relationships between workers and employers, guided by a moral economy which promotes trust and reciprocity, and results in substantial economic and socio-emotional benefits for the workers and their families. In addition, as legal immigrants, the farmworkers in this study are able to apply for legalization for their family members. The dissertation examines the family dynamics involved in deciding whether or not to legalize children, uncovering complex and unexpected rationales driven by local cultural logics about gender, migration and work. Finally, the dissertation examines the impact of remittances from legal migration on status hierarchies and class subjectivities in the transnational space linked through the network. The addition of migrant wealth disturbs the traditional status structure in the sending community, creating tensions within and between families. I conclude by arguing that Rio Secans’ networking, legalization, and migrations strategies produce incremental but important gains that may ultimately produce intergenerational improvements to the wellbeing of Rio <b>Secans</b> and their families...|$|E
40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} {{of three}} ostracod-mussel bands occurring respectively in the Lower Modiolaris, Upper Communis and Upper Similis-Pulchra Zones of the Northumberland and Durham Coal Measures is described. The Hopkins' Band in the Dower Modiolaris Zone is compared with similar bands at an equivalent stratigraphical horizon in the Midgeholme and Cumberland coalfields. The dominant non-marine lamellibranchs in this band resemble, or are related to, Anthracosia regularis and Garbonicola oslancis. The Three Quarter ostracod-mussel band from the Communis Zone contains Ourvirimula and Garbonicola declevis, while the Claxheugh Shell Bed from the Upper Similis-Pulchra Zone contains Naiadites and forms resembling Anthraconauta phillipsi. The ostracod, annelid, plant and fish remains in these bands are also described. The validity and distinction of the ostracod genera Jonesina and Geisina are established and the species J. fastigiata, G. arcuata and G. subarcuata {{are described in}} detail. The ostracod species Carbonita cf. evelinae, C. of. rankiniana, C. humilis, G. pungens. G. inflata, C. <b>secans</b> and C. concava sp. nov. are described from the Hopkins' Band {{and the presence of}} moults and dimorphic forms of these species is shown in the ostracod populations of the bands. The synonomay, morphology and stratigraphical ranges of the above species of ostracods from the British Coal Measures are reviewed and discussed. The true generic assignment and growth forms of the worm Microconchus (Spirorbis) pusillus are discussed. Vertical sequences of six "faunal phases" for the Hopkins' Band and three for the Three Quarter Band are deduced from a study of the respective faunas at several localities. These faunal phases are subsequently related to changing ecological conditions. The conditions under which the sediments of the Hopkins' Band were laid down are deduced from a study of the petrology of the sediments and their chemical composition. The orientation and associations of fossils in the sediments are recorded and the published information on palaeoecology and comparative ecology of living mussels and ostracods is reviewed. It is concluded that the Hopkins' Band was deposited in a brackish lagoonal environment {{at the beginning of a}} typical Coal Measures cyclothem. At first the richly carbonaceous bottom sediment of this lagoon prohibited the establishment of a benthonic fauna, but a change in the source and type of sediment and increase in turbulence enabled a mussel fauna to thrive with a reduction of the previously abundant pseudo-planktonic ostracod fauna. Increased sedimentation eliminated this fauna and the conditions became more deltaic. Similar environmental conditions are deduced for the Three Quarter Band, but the Claxheugh Shell Bed is believed to have formed in a small isolated brackish or fresh water lake within the main delta or swamp...|$|E
