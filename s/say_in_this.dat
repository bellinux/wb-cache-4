5|$|The {{primary role}} of free women in {{classical}} Athens was {{to marry and}} bear children. The emphasis on marriage {{as a way to}} perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Athenian women typically first married much older men around age fourteen. Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative, who was responsible for choosing their husband; the bride had little <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> decision. Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents' property, women often married relatives. This was especially the case of women with no brothers (epikleroi), whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her.|$|E
25|$|At {{around two}} months, the baby engages in cooing, which mostly {{consists}} of vowel sounds. At around four months, cooing turns into babbling, {{which is the}} repetitive consonant-vowel combinations. Babies understand more than {{they are able to}} <b>say.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> 0–8 months range, the child is engaged in vocal play of vegetative sounds, laughing, and cooing.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} Kroll's phases is the {{preparation}} for writing phase. In this phase {{the child is}} believed to grasp the technical skills needed for writing, allowing them to create the letters needed to write the words the children <b>say.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> initial phase children experience many opportunities to extend their spoken language skills. Speaking and writing are considered fairly separate processes here, as children's writing is less well developed at this stage, whereas their spoken language is becoming more skilled.|$|E

25|$|The {{exemptions}} lead {{to internal}} {{problems in the}} case of acquisition of Japanese or South Korean citizenship since neither Japan nor South Korea allows its nationals to hold foreign citizenships in their adult years. (See Japanese and South Korean nationality laws.) Of course, they are strictly Japanese/South Korean internal affairs and have to be solved by Japanese/South Korean citizens themselves, according to the laws of their own country. They are not problems of the Dutch state, and all that the Dutch laws <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect is that such Dutch subjects with dual nationality are allowed to renounce to their Dutch nationality.|$|E
2500|$|Ratzinger did not {{directly}} say whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions, but did <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> same context that [...] "It {{would be foolish to}} construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the lyrical {{content of}} Mirror Ball, Young said, [...] "There's idealism and reality, {{the two have}} got to come {{together}} yet there are always major problems when they do. Maybe that's the crux of what I'm trying to <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> new album. It's also a commentary {{of the differences between}} my peace and love '60s generation and the more cynical '90s generation." [...] "Song X" [...] and [...] "Act of Love" [...] were written about abortion. [...] "Downtown" [...] includes references to Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. The reference to Led Zeppelin was partly inspired by Young's performance with the band at the 1995 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|The first day's {{play was}} entirely washed out, {{and the second}} day's play cut to 51 overs, as rain and bad light had a <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> match at Anguilla ending in a draw. Leeward Islands won the toss, and {{concluded}} their innings 20 overs into the third morning when Mervyn Dillon removed Adam Sanford, and the Leewards closed on 171. All the Trinidad bowlers got wickets, Dave Mohammed taking the most with three, and also bowling the most. Omari Banks snared two wickets for the Leewards, and Trinidad were 146 for 6 before captain Darren Ganga was joined by Richard Kelly. Both completed their half-centuries, sharing a stand of 75 before Ganga smacked a full toss from Banks to Sylvester Joseph to be out for 65 - enough to be named Man of the Match. Trinidad and Tobago were eventually bowled out for 274 midway through the morning session on day four, and the Leewards were 26 for two just before lunch, but a stand of 105 between Austin Richards and Sylvester Joseph ensured that the Leewards ended on 131 for three.|$|E
2500|$|Rosberg {{called his}} race as [...] "the toughest of the year" [...] and deemed it {{worse than the}} British Grand Prix when he retired from a gearbox failure. He stated that his car's {{reliability}} needed the most attention and wanted to understand the problem: [...] "It’s tough not even leaving the grid. I was hoping the team could fix it [...] because {{it was going on}} and off, sometimes working, sometimes not. There’s no point in shouting, it’s a reliability issue, and it’s happened again." [...] Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff apologised to Rosberg immediately following the competitor's retirement, saying as a championship participant, it is [...] "a bitter moment" [...] when that person loses ground in the battle and that there was nothing much to <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> situation. He later stated {{he did not want to}} see the championship being decided on reliability problems and that Mercedes needed to refocus and discover the origin of their problems. The team's technical director Paddy Lowe added reliability concerns worried him throughout the season and hoped it would not be repeated in the future.|$|E
