40|$|The S-Farm overground {{transfer}} (OGT) {{line will}} bypass the existing line(s), between valve pits 241 -S-B and 241 -S-D {{that no longer}} meet system requirements. The new OGT line will provide a waste transfer pipeline between these valve pits in support of saltwell pumping activities. The length of the OGT line is approximately 180 ft from pit to pit. The primary pipe is nominal 1 -in. diameter stainless steel (SST) braided Ethylene-propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) hose. The encasement pipe is a nominal 3 -in., flanged, SST pipe made up of several different length pipe <b>spool</b> <b>pieces</b> (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 1 and sh. 2). The OGT line slopes from valve pit 241 -S-B toward valve pit 241 -S-D. At each end, the primary and encasement pipe connect to a pit entry spool piece. The pit entry <b>spool</b> <b>pieces</b> are constructed of prefabricated SST materials. These <b>spool</b> <b>pieces</b> allow for {{the separation of the}} primary and encasement pipelines after the pipes have entered the valve pits (drawing H- 2 - 818280, sh. 2). The pit entry <b>spool</b> <b>pieces</b> also allow for leak detection of the encasement pipe at each end (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 2). The OGT encasement pipeline is supported above ground by adjustable height unistrut brackets and precast concrete bases (drawing H- 2 - 829654, sh. 1). The pipeline is heat-traced and insulated. The heat tracing and insulation supply and retain latent heat that prevents waste solidification during transfers and provides freeze protection. The total length of the pipeline is above ground, thereby negating the need for cathodic corrosion protection.

40|$|AbstractMaterial {{properties}} of Zr 2. 5 wt% Nb pressure tube change during reactor operation {{due to the}} surrounding environmental conditions. Measurement of mechanical {{properties of}} the pressure tubes is important for assessing their fitness for service. As it is required to remove a pressure tube from service to prepare specimens for doing the property measurement in laboratory, any in-situ technique has great significance.

40|$|During {{the first}} three LHC {{synchronization}} tests on August 10, August 24, and September 7, 2008, linear and higher-order polarity checks were performed with beam 1 in Sector 23 and beam 2 in Sector 78. The main principle of these checks was to launch free betatron oscillations and use the difference trajectory measurements with respect to inverted polarities of circuits under investigation. In the case of zero nominal strength for a circuit, a finite value was introduced. The magnet circuits subjected to these tests were the QT and QTL trim quadrupoles, the MQS skew quadrupoles, the SF and SD arc sextupole circuits, the MCS b 3 <b>spool</b> <b>pieces,</b> the OD and OF Landau octupoles, and the MSS skew sextupoles. For some of these circuits sensitivity was enhanced by introducing large momentum offsets. To detect and remove improve spurious contributions from initially off-center orbits, four sets of trajectories were recorded, namely with and without oscillation, and with two magnet strength settings, respectively. We report on the measurements and their results. In particular we demonstrate that low-intensity single-pass measurements are sensitive enough to detect the sign and the amplitude of b 3 <b>spool</b> <b>pieces,</b> lattice sextupoles, skew sextuples, and Landau octupoles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{radiological}} engineering services for the design of special contamination containments. These containments were to be used during the replacement of leaking and damaged gaskets on the glove boxes in Technical Area- 55 (TA- 55). The damaged gaskets involved 18 windows and 5 interconnecting <b>spool</b> <b>pieces</b> in fuel processing glove boxes. The work scope included the design and manufacture of special contamination containment enclosures (containments), the preparation of procedures and tool lists to support gasket replacement while using the containments, and the training of appropriate TA- 55 personnel in the proper installation, operation and removal of the containments. It was originally anticipated that two basic containment designs would be required, one for the windows and one for <b>spool</b> <b>pieces.</b> Upon examination of the glove boxes it was evident that the individual space envelopes and interferences associated with each glove box would require uniquely designed containments for effective gasket replacement. This resulted in 13 individual containment designs that accommodated the interferences and allowed gasket replacement within the containment. Successful use of the containments for glove box gasket replacement was a significant accomplishment. The operation has proven that a properly managed containment program can enhance routine maintenance of the glove boxes while preventing a contamination release. The ability to perform these operations in containments reduces costs by preventing a contaminant release and eliminating the associated cleanup expenses, reduced radioactive waste and fuel processing down time...|$|E

40|$|For {{a second}} year in a row dynamic {{aperture}} experiments have been performed at the LHC. These studies have been carried out by two teams following alternative techniques: On Beam 1 a novel approach has been tested which heats the beam until the emittance becomes large, and derives the dynamic aperture from beam losses assuming an inverse logarithm model for the time-dependence of the intensity. On Beam 2, the traditional approach of sampling the dynamic aperture with large amplitude kicks has been pursued [1].

Effects of temperature gradients in the cold bore tube of the magnet during measurements have been observed [6] and we show that this effect is the most probable explanation for our observations of the geometry measurements in the vertical plane. The aim of this work is to present an algorithmic approach to filter this effect and improve the measurement results. The effect is relatively small but for some magnets the displacement is up to - 0. 3 mm. The magnet positioning is controlled to 0. 1 mm.

The presence of combustor emissions in the duct is proposed as the primary mechanism producing the attenuation and dispersion of combustion noise propagating in an operating liquid fuel combustion system. First, a complex mathematical model for calculating attenuation and dispersion taking into account mass transfer, heat transfer, and viscosity effects due to the presence of liquid fuel droplets or solid soot particles is discussed. Next, a simpler single parameter model for calculating pressure auto-spectra and cross-spectra which takes into account dispersion and attenuation due to heat transfer between solid soot particles and air is developed.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a post LHC hadron {{collider}} operating in the ra- diation damping regime was discussed in the DPF workshop on future hadron facilities[1]. To date hadron colliders have all op- erated {{in a state of}} insigni®cant damping, where phase space di- lution from any source results in a costly degradation of instanta- neous and thus integrated luminosity. The concept of using radi- ation damping to enhance the integrated luminosity results in an effective decoupling of the machine performance from the ini- tial beam parameters. By relying more heavily on the damping mechanism, the requirements for tight emittance control through the injector chain and during the collider ®ll process can be re- laxed allowing for less stringent injection ®eld quality and the possibilities for looser tolerances in many other aspects of the machine.
