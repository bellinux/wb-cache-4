500|$|Turner's {{discovery}} in Hollywood {{is considered by}} film historians to be a show-business legend, [...] and has been recounted numerous times with slight variations. One {{version of the story}} has her discovery occurring at Schwab's Pharmacy, but according to both Turner and a 1995 Los Angeles Times article, this was a reporting error that began circulating after the publication of articles by columnist Sidney Skolsky. According to Turner, as a junior at Hollywood High School, she <b>skipped</b> <b>a</b> typing class and bought a Coke at the Top Hat Malt Shop located on the southeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and McCadden Place. While in the shop, Turner was spotted by William R. Wilkerson, publisher of The Hollywood Reporter. Wilkerson was attracted by her beauty and physique, and with the permission of her mother, referred her to the actor/comedian/talent agent Zeppo Marx. In December 1936, Turner was introduced by Marx to film director Mervyn LeRoy, who signed her to a fifty-dollar weekly contract with Warner Bros. on February 22, 1937. At the suggestion of LeRoy, she would take the stage name Lana Turner, a name she would come to legally adopt several years later.|$|E
500|$|On xx, Croft and Sim {{touched on}} themes of love, desire, and loss in their songwriting, which Croft said has [...] "always been based around emotions, {{right from the}} start.

[...] Like Croft, Sim said he wrote much of his lyrics at night when his emotions ran [...] "a bit higher". Because of their reserved personalities, Robert Christgau believed they relied on a low-key, vulnerable style and [...] "traded ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers, and friends". According to NME magazine's Emily Mackay, all of the songs dealt with the consuming emotions associated with first love, including the tacit intimacy on [...] "VCR", the yearning expressed on [...] "Heart <b>Skipped</b> <b>a</b> Beat", and the premature affection warned of on [...] "Crystalised". Petra Davis from The Quietus argued that the thematic crux of xx was in the succession of songs from [...] "Islands" [...] to [...] "Shelter", each of which saw [...] "a radical shift in perspective on a similar—perhaps a single—love story." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, the San Diego Conquistadors of the NBA rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $600,000 salary. However, the Lakers sued {{their former}} star and {{successfully}} {{prevented him from}} actually playing, because he still owed them the option year of his contract. Barred from playing, Chamberlain mostly left the coaching duties to his assistant Stan Albeck, who recalled: [...] "Chamberlain... has a great feel for pro basketball... the day-to-day things that {{are an important part}} of basketball... just bored him. He did not have the patience." [...] The players were split on Chamberlain, who was seen as competent, but often indifferent and more occupied with promotion of his autobiography Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door than with coaching. [...] He once <b>skipped</b> <b>a</b> game to sign autographs for the book. In his single season as a coach, the Conquistadors went a mediocre 37–47 in the regular season and lost against the Utah Stars in the Division Semifinals. However, Chamberlain was not pleased by the Qs' meager attendance: crowds averaged 1,843, just over half of the Qs' small San Diego 3,200-seat sports arena. After the season, Chamberlain retired from professional basketball.|$|E
