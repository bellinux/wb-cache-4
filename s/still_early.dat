5|$|At this point, <b>still</b> <b>early</b> in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different}} approach to that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, pro-angiogenic protein therapy uses well-defined, {{precisely}} structured proteins, with previously defined optimal {{doses of}} the individual protein for disease states, and with well-known biological effects. On the other hand, an obstacle of protein therapy is the mode of delivery. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intramuscular routes of protein administration are not always as effective, as the therapeutic protein may be metabolized or cleared before it can enter the target tissue. Cell-based pro-angiogenic therapies are <b>still</b> <b>early</b> stages of research, with many open questions regarding best cell types and dosages to use.|$|E

500|$|After {{establishing}} {{himself as}} a premier player in France and an international during the 2004–05 campaign, Benítez declared that Diarra still had a future at Liverpool stating [...] "I think it's <b>still</b> <b>early</b> days for him, but it's good news {{for us to see}} a young player doing so well. If he continues to play well for his club and is in the national team, we will be reminding everyone he is our player". However, in April 2005, Diarra revealed that he wanted to stay with Lens for the long-term. After finishing the season, on 24 June 2005, Liverpool granted his request after Lens reached an agreement with the club on a transfer fee, purported to be €3.2million. Diarra finished his Liverpool career with no first-team appearances and only one club appearance, which came in a pre-season friendly.|$|E

500|$|What the {{technology}} and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions. Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that [...] "at a conservative estimate" [...] the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently, and had some very complex floor traps for [...] "transformations" [...] {{such as that of}} Proteus. The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle's Empress of Morocco (1673) (see detail, top right) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets. Pepys' mentions of stage effects in his diary, 1660–68, give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s, and even more in entering into their enthusiasms, but the 1660s were <b>still</b> <b>early</b> days. There are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from the heyday of the machine play in the 1670s–90s, although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from the better-documented French and Italian opera scenery which inspired Thomas Betterton at Dorset Garden Theatre.|$|E

We've always had a very instinctive way of communicating with each other, which I guess is why we make good music together." [...] Bickers in turn reflected [...] "I think we're both old enough and ugly enough to address any issues head-on and keep our tempers in check. We're also doing things at our own pace rather than letting a record company dictate what we do, which helps... It's <b>still</b> <b>early</b> days but communication is good and so is the music. This is about letting bygones be bygones and just getting on with it. Personally, I've never been happier." ...|$|E
