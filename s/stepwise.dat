5|$|The cooling of Antarctica {{occurred}} <b>stepwise,</b> as {{the continental}} spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.|$|E
5|$|Electron beam {{processing}} is used {{to irradiate}} materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products. Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and <b>stepwise</b> decrease of its activation energy.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, <b>stepwise</b> motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{seasonality}} may {{be incorporated}} by allowing {{time of year}} to influence transmission rate in a <b>stepwise</b> or sinusoidal fashion.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the term}} meditatio as part of a formal, <b>stepwise</b> process of {{meditation}} goes back to the 12th-century monk Guigo II.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} <b>stepwise</b> management protocol {{has been}} introduced by the California Maternity Quality Care Collaborative. It describes 4 stages of obstetrical hemorrhage after childbirth and its application reduces maternal mortality.|$|E
25|$|Dirk Niebel, the Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development in Germany, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur that {{financial}} aid to Uganda will be cut, with a <b>stepwise</b> plan for this having already been made.|$|E
25|$|The three {{constants}} are not {{independent of}} each other and {{it is easy to see}} that β2= K1K2. The constants K1 and K2 are <b>stepwise</b> constants and β is an example of an overall constant.|$|E
25|$|In his 1961 book The Atom and its Nucleus, Gamow {{proposed}} {{representing the}} periodic {{system of the}} chemical elements as a continuous tape, with the elements in order of atomic number wound round in a three-dimensional helix whose diameter increased <b>stepwise</b> (corresponding to the longer rows of the conventional periodic table).|$|E
25|$|Like {{industry}} standards such as UML activity diagrams, Business Process Model and Notation and EPCs, Petri nets offer a graphical notation for <b>stepwise</b> {{processes that}} include choice, iteration, and concurrent execution. Unlike these standards, Petri nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} organic reactions is basically infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed {{that can be used}} to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a <b>stepwise</b> reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence—although the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone.|$|E
25|$|This phase {{transition}} {{is of the}} first order; it is accompanied by an anomaly in the heat capacity, elastic, and other properties. In particular, whereas adamantane molecules freely rotate in the cubic phase, they are frozen in the tetragonal one; the density increases <b>stepwise</b> from 1.08 to 1.18 g/cm3 and the entropy changes by {{a significant amount of}} 1594J/(mol·K).|$|E
25|$|The Hobbit {{themes are}} very Celtic-sounding, scored for Celtic {{instruments}} namely fiddle and tin whistle. Their maturation through {{the story has}} them not only transform melodically and harmonically, but also {{make use of the}} orchestral relatives of the folk instruments with which they are originally played. The music is <b>stepwise</b> and calm, with old-world modal harmonies to evoke familiarity.|$|E
25|$|A clausula or clausula vera ("true close") is a dyadic or intervallic, {{rather than}} chordal or harmonic, cadence. In a clausula vera two voices {{approach}} an octave or unison through <b>stepwise</b> motion. This {{is also in}} contrary motion. In three voices the third voice often adds a falling fifth creating a cadence similar to the authentic cadence in tonal music.|$|E
25|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{was created}} by {{movement}} on four left-stepping strike-slip fault segments in a diagonal <b>stepwise</b> sequence known as echelon formation. In the areas where these segments overlap, pull-apart basins have developed, forming three bathymetric lows known as the Daka Deep, the Aragonese Deep and the Elat Deep. Parts of three of these faults ruptured during the 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Paterson and his {{co-workers}} disclosed the third-generation total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide. The <b>stepwise</b> method used in previous generations to incorporate the C(1)–C(8) subunit {{was replaced by a}} late-stage Still-Gennari olefination, which leads to a notable improvement in convergence. The Paterson third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 11.1% (highest reported to date) with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 37 total steps.|$|E
25|$|This is not, {{however, the}} typical case. For the example, {{we have a}} {{canonical}} form available that reduces any string to one of length at most three, by decreasing the length monotonically. In general, {{it is not true}} that one can get a canonical form for the elements, by <b>stepwise</b> cancellation. One may have to use relations to expand a string many-fold, in order eventually to find a cancellation that brings the length right down.|$|E
25|$|Directed {{evolution}} is a mimic {{of the natural}} evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires three things to happen: variation between replicators, that the variation causes fitness differences upon which selection acts, and that this variation is heritable. In DE, a single gene is evolved by iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection or screening, and amplification. Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one round as the template for the next to achieve <b>stepwise</b> improvements.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in <b>stepwise</b> motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in <b>stepwise</b> motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E
25|$|A new mix {{was created}} for the stereo version of the album, and on 25 February 1963 Martin made one created from {{original}} takes 16, 17 and 18. This stereo version has Lennon fluffing the final verse, causing him to sing 'come on' with a slight chuckle in his voice. Also different in the stereo mix is Harrison's lead guitar line before the final verse; rather than duplicating the overdubbed harmonica exactly as he had earlier in the song, Harrison drops down a fourth for the third note, rather than continuing down by <b>stepwise</b> motion.|$|E
25|$|The name {{suspended}} {{derives from}} an early polyphonic technique developed during the common practice period, in which a <b>stepwise</b> melodic progress to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed or suspended by extending {{the duration of the}} previous note. The resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note. In traditional music theory the inclusion of the third in either chord would negate the suspension, so such chords would be called added ninth and added eleventh chords instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} pantoprazole's {{discovery}} {{is a good}} example of the <b>stepwise</b> development of PPIs. The main focus of modification of timoprazole was the benzimidazole part of its structure. Addition of a trifluoromethyl group to the benzimidazole moiety led to a series of very active compounds with varying solution-stability. In general fluoro substituents were found to block metabolism at the point where they were attached. Later the more balanced fluoroalkoxy substituent, instead of the highly lipophilic and strongly electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl substituent, led to highly active compounds with supposed longer half-lives and higher solution stability.|$|E
25|$|Skrol's {{activity}} {{started to}} evolve in 1996, consisting of composer, instrumentalist and sound alchemist Vladimír Hirsch, singer Martina Sanollová and lyricist and producer Tom Saivon. The creative {{principle of the}} band is based on neo-classical concepts with a congregation of martial industrial, with an attempt to attain an organic amalgam of the two on rudiments of rock music patterns. Vladimír Hirsch composed 5 instrumental albums for the band, that were <b>stepwise</b> recorded in the period between 1997 and 2000 and 4 of them were released between 1999 and 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} transformation efficiency, transformed cells are grown in super optimal broth to expedite the recovery process after transformation. In this method, two subsequent transformations must be performed in order to incorporate the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids necessary for recombination. This is because preliminary studies found that when both Cas9 and sgRNA were expressed {{at the same time}} without the linear DNA to be incorporated into the genome, cell death was induced due to the disruption of the crucial gene. Therefore, the expression of the recombination machinery and sgRNA were kept under strict control and transformed <b>stepwise</b> to reduce cell lethality.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} host cell, the virus {{must find a}} way to uncoat. The virus {{particles}} enter the cell in a structure known as an endosome (also called an endolysosome). Disassembly is a <b>stepwise</b> process. Uncoating requires a low pH, which is provided by the help of endocytic proteases. Acidification of the endosome removes the outer-capsid protein σ3. This removal allows membrane-penetration mediator μ1 to be exposed and attachment protein σ1 goes through a conformational change. After uncoating is completed, the active virus is released in the cytoplasm where replication of the genome and virion takes place.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{algorithms}} used a Cα-Cα distance map together with a hierarchical clustering routine that considered proteins as several small segments, 10 residues in length. The initial segments were clustered one after another based on inter-segment distances; segments with the shortest distances were clustered and considered as single segments thereafter. The <b>stepwise</b> clustering finally included the full protein. Go also exploited the fact that inter-domain distances are normally larger than intra-domain distances; all possible Cα-Cα distances were represented as diagonal plots in which there were distinct patterns for helices, extended strands and combinations of secondary structures.|$|E
25|$|Most {{versions}} of the arboreal hypothesis state that the ancestors of birds were very small dinosaurs that lived in trees, springing from branch to branch. This small dinosaur already had feathers, which were co-opted by evolution to produce longer, stiffer forms that were useful in aerodynamics, eventually producing wings. Wings would have then evolved and become increasingly refined as devices to give the leaper more control, to parachute, to glide, and to fly in <b>stepwise</b> fashion. The arboreal hypothesis also notes that, for arboreal animals, aerodynamics are far more energy efficient, since such animals simply fall to achieve minimum gliding speeds.|$|E
25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} shows a {{positive}} azeotrope of hypothetical constituents, X and Y. The bottom trace illustrates the boiling temperature of various compositions. Below the bottom trace, only the liquid phase is in equilibrium. The top trace illustrates the vapor composition above the liquid at a given temperature. Above the top trace, only the vapor is in equilibrium. Between the two traces, liquid and vapor phases exist simultaneously in equilibrium: for example, heating a 25% X : 75% Y mixture to temperature AB would generate vapor of composition B over liquid of composition A. The azeotrope is the point on the diagram where the two curves touch. The horizontal and vertical steps show the path of repeated distillations. Point A is the boiling point of a nonazeotropic mixture. The vapor that separates at that temperature has composition B. The shape of the curves requires that the vapor at B be richer in constituent X than the liquid at point A. The vapor is physically separated from the VLE (vapor-liquid equilibrium) system and is cooled to point C, where it condenses. The resulting liquid (point C) is now richer in X than it was at point A. If the collected liquid is boiled again, it progresses to point D, and so on. The <b>stepwise</b> progression shows how repeated distillation can never produce a distillate that is richer in constituent X than the azeotrope. Note that starting {{to the right of}} the azeotrope point results in the same <b>stepwise</b> process closing in on the azeotrope point from the other direction.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{the mature}} male gametes in many sexually {{reproducing}} organisms. Thus, eggtogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis, {{of which the}} female equivalent is oogenesis. In mammals it occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male testes in a <b>stepwise</b> fashion. Spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for sexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process. It starts at puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male infertility).|$|E
25|$|In modern layman usage {{the term}} is {{restricted}} to the displacement of the third only and the dissonant second or fourth no longer needs to be held over (prepared) from the previous chord. Neither is it now obligatory for the displaced note to make an appearance at all though {{in the majority of}} cases the conventional <b>stepwise</b> resolution to the third is still observed. In post-bop and modal jazz compositions and improvisations suspended seventh chords are often used in nontraditional ways: these often do not function as V chords, and do not resolve from the fourth to the third. The lack of resolution gives the chord an ambiguous, static quality. Indeed, the third is often played on top of a sus4 chord. A good example is the jazz standard, Maiden Voyage.|$|E
25|$|Dahn equated Chararic with Theodemar, even {{saying that}} the latter was the name he took upon baptism. It has also been {{suggested}} that Theodemar and Ariamir were the same person {{and the son of}} Chararic. In the opinion of some historians, Chararic is nothing more than an error on the part of Gregory of Tours and never existed. If, as Gregory relates, Martin of Braga died about the year 580 and had been bishop for about thirty years, then the conversion of Chararic must have occurred around 550 at the latest. Finally, Ferreiro believes the conversion of the Suevi was progressive and <b>stepwise</b> and that Chararic's public conversion was only followed by the lifting of a ban on Catholic synods in the reign of his successor, which would have been Ariamir; while Theodemar would have been responsible for beginning a persecution of the Arians in his kingdom, to root out their heresy.|$|E
25|$|Once a lesion has cavitated, {{especially}} if dentin is involved, remineralization {{is much more}} difficult and a dental restoration is usually indicated ("operative treatment"). Before a restoration can be placed, all of the decay must be removed otherwise it will continue to progress underneath the filling. Sometimes a small amount of decay can be left if it is entombed and there is a seal which isolates the bacteria from their substrate. This can be likened to placing a glass container over a candle, which burns itself out once the oxygen is used up. Techniques such as <b>stepwise</b> caries removal are designed to avoid exposure of the dental pulp and overall reduction of the amount of tooth substance which requires removal before the final filling is placed. Often enamel which overlies decayed dentin must also be removed as it is unsupported and susceptible to fracture. The modern decision-making process with regards the activity of the lesion, and whether it is cavitated, is summarized in the table.|$|E

500|$|The {{orchestra}} {{returns to}} A minor before a final postlude in A major. In Górecki's own words: [...] "Finally there came that unvarying, persistent, obstinate 'walczyk' , sounding well when played piano, {{so that all}} the notes were audible. For the soprano, I used a device characteristic of highland singing: suspending the melody on the third [...] and descending from the fifth to the third while the ensemble moves <b>stepwise</b> downward [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Polyphonic {{arrangements}} {{called for}} the women to sing diminutions (melodic divisions of longer notes) and other ornaments in consort. Diminutions were traditionally improvised in performance. However, to coordinate their voices, they transcribed and rehearsed the music in advance, transforming these improvisations into highly developed musical forms that composers would emulate. The singers may have used the more traditional practice in their solo repertoire, performing ornaments extemporaneously. Specific ornaments used by the concerto delle donne, mentioned in a source from 1581, were such popular sixteenth-century devices as passaggi (division of a long note into many shorter notes, usually <b>stepwise),</b> cadenze (decoration of the penultimate note, sometimes quite elaborate), and tirate (rapid scales). Accenti (connection of two longer notes, using dotted rhythms), a staple of early Baroque music, are absent from the list. [...] In 1592 Caccini claimed that Alfonso II asked him to teach his ladies the new accenti and passaggi styles.|$|E
