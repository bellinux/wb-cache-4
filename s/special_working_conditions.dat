40|$|The {{issue of}} {{employment}} {{of women in}} today's society and their position in labor relations is for me, as a wife and mother, very close. Obtaining the appropriate awareness of rights that current legislation provides {{is in the interest}} of every woman. For this reason I chose for this doctoral work theme called 'Specific working conditions of women'. The aim of this work was to survey and evaluate current legislature about <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> for women, which is the focus of the whole work. The main theme - <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> of women cannot be held in isolation. Firstly I discussed about the status of women in society and in labor relations and also about the question of equality between men and women. The focus of this work is discussion about the current applicable legislation and also taking into account the necessary requirements and international legal obligations arising out of the Czech Republic's membership in the European Union, including some important judgments of the ECJ. The theme of the <b>Special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> for women, which also contents the issues about maternal and parental holiday in order to ensure appropriate care for children, is closely related to the regulation of social security for workers in this period and also the possibility of provision of care for [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Resumé: In my {{rigorous}} work I {{dealt with}} the legal arrangement of the <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> of juveniles and minors. These conditions are being legally arranged since over two centuries. One of the characteristical signs {{in the development of}} this legal arrangement is enlarging the legal protection of working minors as well as of juveniles resulting namely in shortening the working hours for minors, determinations of the minimal age for taking a job, determinations of the obligatory school attendance duration as well as the inhibition of certain works and workplace which are dangerous for juveniles. The development of the legal arrangement of the above mentioned working conditions is strongly affected by legal documents from the field of the european as well as international law arranging the fundamental human, social and economical rights. These international documents complete and enlarge the Czech legal arrangement of the <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> of the juveniles. The Labour code no. 262 / 2006 Sb. with the relating legal rules provide a special legal protection since these juveniles are not yet physically and mentally adult enough and thus their sound and safe development has to be protected.

U Pravilniku o poslovima s posebnim uvjetima rada utvrđeni su uvjeti koje moraju ispunjavati radnici da bi mogli raditi na takvim poslovima. U radu su navedeni primjeri nepoštivanja ovog Pravilnika i posljedice za zdravlje radnika. Naglašena je važnost nadzora uvjeta rada, ispravne klasifikacije štetnosti u radnom procesu i provođenja prethodnih i kontrolnih zdravstvenih pregleda. Sve ovo donosi dvostruku korist; korist je radniku jer ne oboli i produžuje mu se radni vijek, a korist poslodavcu je da ne mora isplaćivati odštetne zahtjeve.

Unable to confirm the etiology of the liver damage, however, a committee appointed for determining occupational disability did not recognize the disease ot the two workers as occupational This example shows the necessity to introduce and perform strict control of technological processes and working conditions. At the same time, accurate assessment of the danger present at the workplace requires preliminary and periodical examination of the workers. This is extremely important today when the necessity of performing such examinations is frequently disputed. It is expected that the compulsory health insurance for occupational diseases imposed on employers will eventually bring medical examination to the deserved place...|$|E

The T&C industry is Pakistan’s main export engine. It is also a major industrial employer, {{and one of the}} few sectors that provide paid employment to female workers. The policy paper highlights the potentially negative impact of the phase out of the textile quota regime on employment-intensive garment production in Pakistan. This sub-sector also provides most employment for women workers.

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{theoretical framework}} is proposed for analysing justice in global <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> In addition to {{gender and race}} as popular criteria to identify disadvantaged groups in organizations, in multinational corporations (MNCs) local employees (i. e. host country nationals (HCNs) working in foreign subsidiaries) deserve <b>special</b> attention.

Although {{a number of reasons}} have been put forward to justify such inequalities—usually with efficiency goals in mind—recent studies have used equity theory to question {{the extent to which they}} are perceived as fair by HCNs. However, since perceptual equity theory has limitations, this study develops an alternative and non-perceptual framework for analysing such inequalities. Employment discrimination theory and elements of Rawls’s ‘Theory of Justice’ are the theoretical pillars of this framework.

With the rise of the women's movement in the United States in the 1960s, the ERA garnered increasing support, and, after being reintroduced by Representative Martha Griffiths (D-MI), in 1971, it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification.|$|R

This is also the maximum period allowed under the applicable law. In accordance with Art. 136a of the Labour Code extended working hours shifts can be established in the company given that the production process requires it and provided that the legal limitations are met.

40|$|The {{practice}} of dentistry involves laborious high finesse dental preparations, precision and control in executions {{that require a}} particular attention, concentration and patience of the dentist and finally the dentist’s physical and mental resistance. The optimal therapeutic approach {{and the success of}} practice involve <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> for the dentist and his team in an ergonomic environment. The meaning of the posture in ergonomics is the manner in which different parts of the body are located and thus the reports are established between them in order to allow a special task execution. This article discusses the posture adopted by dentists when they work, beginning with the balanced posture and going to different variants of posture. The ideal posture of a dentist gives him, on the one hand the optimal working conditions (access, visibility and control in the mouth) and on the other hand, physical and psychological comfort throughout the execution of the clinical acts. Although the theme of dentist posture is treated with great care and often presented in the undergraduate courses and the continuing education courses on ergonomics in dentistry, many dentists do not know the subject well enough nor the theoretical issues and therefore nor the practical applicability. The risk and perspective of the musculoskeletal disorders related to unbalanced postures should determine the dentists take postural corrective actions and compensation measures in order to limit the negative effects o...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{discrimination against}} women on labor market and stresses the influence of social values on the allocation of labor. This influence {{can be observed in}} job segregation itself and in <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> associated with typically female jobs. This influence is part of a mechanism of job rationing. All social institutions (churches, family, political parties [...] .) share a common history characterized by a strict vision of sex-role segregation. The roles {{of men and women in}} the labour market, an important social institution, will reflect this sex-role segregation. Job segregation has long been viewed by many economists as an exogenous phenomenon [...] . a matter of "tastes". But in this thesis, it is suggested that job segregation, as well as other aspects of the treatment of women on the labor market, is a rationale response by society to job scarcity. Working conditions associated with typically female jobs, for example, are not technologically determined but are part of a mechanism of job rationing: in maintaining women's instability on labor market, low wages and short job ladders induce women to leave the labor market when they are no longer wanted. The evolution of women's participation rates shows the relationship between social values dealing with paid work for women and the needs of female labor force. This vision of the labor market is corroborated by an analysis of working conditions in Montreal office jobs. Detailed data for eight Montreal firms were used in this research. The results indicate that to understand the treatment of women office workers, it is important to distinguish between two groups of firms: those where most office workers are males and those where most are females. In the male dominated firms female workers enjoy much better wages and other working conditions. And, as a result, female labor turnover is apparently not different from male labor turnover in these firms...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Work in pharmaceutical-chemical {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} exposure to numerous hazards, both physical (microclimate, illumination, noise) and chemical (organic solvents). Organic solvents can cause damage to many organic systems and have carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic effects. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze patterns of chronic morbidity of workers employed in pharmaceuticalchemical industry during 2002. Method. The study was conducted in the pharmaceutical- chemical industry "Zdravlje" Leskovac in 2002. A total of 143 workers in workplaces with <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> - exposed to chemical hazards as well as 40 workers from control group took part in the study. The physical examinations of the participants were performed at the Department of Occupational Health in Health Center, Leskovac. Results. Heart diseases were the most frequent both among exposed workers (17. 8 %) and in control group (33. 3 %). Respiratory diseases were at the second place (16. 9 % in the exposed group, and 7. 4 % in control group). Arterial hypertension was diagnosed in 14. 7 % workers occupationally exposed to hazards, and in 12. 5 % workers from control group (p> 0. 05). Chronic bronchitis was diagnosed in 17. 5 % of the exposed workers and in only 5. 0 % of controls (p> 0. 05). The highest prevalence of diseases in both groups was observed among workers aged 40 - 49 years, with 20 - 29 years of exposure working time. 73. 4 % of the exposed workers and 85 % of control workers were capable of work (p> 0. 05). Conclusion. Workers occupationally exposed to hazards in pharmaceutical-chemical industry have higher prevalence of various diseases compared to non-exposed workers, which can be the result of work, working conditions and work activity. Preventive measures should be directed towards the decrease of occupational hazards and unfavorable working conditions and increase of work protection. Regular physical examinations of workers are of prime importance for the prevention of occupational morbidity, traumatism and invalidity. ...|$|E

Night work is physiological reasons effort of the day and from social reasons less favorably. Night work is governed by national and international regulations.

MEWPs are often preferred over traditional tech-niques due to their impressive features of mobility, flexibility, cost and time reduction. But the number of accidents occurred during the use of MEWPs should not be underestimated: ac-cording to international databases, approximately 200 fatal accidents / year occur due to machines overturn, electrocution, fall from height, stability problems and overrun of the performance limits. Specialized operators are required for MEWPs (Italian law D. Lgs 81 / 08, art. 73, par. 5 provides for specific Information Formation and Training for some categories of equipment, including the MEWPs). In spite of that, both in routine operations and in emergency conditions, a not negligible num-ber of Hazard Factors can be identified such as over-confidence, unconsidered modus operandi due to haste, lack of preliminary inspections and function checks, poor maintenance and sometimes incom-pleteness of instruction handbooks. Moreover, the widespread practice of rent without operator of the MEWPs for temporary operations appears to lay at very the base of many accidents. The Authors analysed, within Prosecutor investi-gations, a number of fatal accidents involving MEWPs, and in the present paper the case histories are discussed with reference to: the criteria of selection among different ty-pologies of MEWPs, taken into account the most suitable operating characteristics and parameters for both common and <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> (sup-porting structures, working heights, rated capacities, outreaches,…); the Hazard Identification techniques suitable {{to point out the}} main possible operating deviations, to implement preventive measures for an effective MEWP Risk Assessment and Management; the basics of operators Information, For-mation and Training, to grant them appropriate knowledge of the various categories of MEWPs and the machines correct use, typical misuses and criti-calities in different yard situations; the paramount importance of maintenance in accordance with the provisions of the Italian trans-position of European Directives and the C-type standards, and the involved responsibilities in case of rented machines,; the familiarization of trained workers, essen-tial to a user-friendly utilization of the particular MEWPs model both in ordinary work and emergen-cy situations; the essential need of completeness and intel-ligibility of the machine accompanying documents, with special reference to the instruction handbook, for a correct and clear informatio...|$|E

Os fatores que lastreiam a limitação da jornada no decorrer da história foram abordados, bem como aqueles que autorizam a jornada reduzida, aquém do limite constitucional, para algumas categorias específicas que, em virtude das condições especiais de trabalho, são consideradas profissões penosas extenuantes. A legislação relacionada ao tema foi analisada, mormente a Lei n° 3. 999 / 61, em razão de ser ela fonte de embates jurídicos e decisões conflitantes no Judiciário, porquanto alguns juristas consideram que tal diploma estaria estipulando jornada reduzida para médicos e cirurgiões-dentistas. Insta destacar que, atualmente, haja vista a edição da orientação jurisprudencial n° 53, do Tribunal Superior do Trabalho, a matéria encontra-se pacificada nesse {{tribunal}} superior segundo o entendimento de que a citada lei não estipula jornada reduzida. Em que pese tal posicionamento, no presente estudo, por meio de um levantamento de publicações relacionadas aos riscos e às doenças ocupacionais do cirurgião-dentista, bem como de argumentos que fundamentam a jornada reduzida para outras atividades, procurou-se demonstrar que a profissão atende aos requisitos que autorizam a concessão desse benefício. Essa singularidade, no que toca ao desgaste físico e psíquico do trabalhador, justifica, portanto, um tratamento diferenciado. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the dentist working hours by different aspects. The factors that justify the hours limitation in the labor history had been approached, such as those ones which allowed a reduction of hours of work, less than the constitutional limit, for some specific occupations that, due to the <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> were considered arduous and exhausting professions. The legislation related to this subject had been analyzed, in particular the law 3. 999 / 61, since its is the source of legal discussions and conflicting decisions in the Judiciary, whereas some jurists consider that such law would be stipulating a reduction of hours of work for physicians and dentists. Its important to emphasize that, nowadays, whereas the jurisprudential orientation, edition 53, of the Tribunal Superior do Trabalho, the subject is settled in this superior court, according to the common sense which the cited law does not determine a reduced working hours. Despite of this orientation, this present study, through a survey of publications that were related to the risks and occupational diseases for the dentists, as well as arguments that justify the reduction of hours of work for others activities, attempted to demonstrate that the profession fulfill the requirements for the concession of this benefit.

According to this system, when the contracting parties (either a local union with a single employer, or any other arrangement, including a group of employers' associations with a group of different trade unions or councils of trade unions) have signed a collective agreement, either one or both of them may petition the Minister of Labour requesting that certain clauses foreseen and spelt out in the Act become obligatory for all employers and employees of the same industry in a definite region. This region may be the whole province or a limited area, such as a city. On receiving the petition the Minister of Labour publishes it in the Quebec Official Gazette. Following this notice during a period of at least thirty days he receives the objections of anyone who wishes to oppose the proposed regulations. Then, if he deems that the collective agreement has acquired a « preponderant significance and importance » in regard to the establishment of working conditions in the industry, he may recommend the adoption of an order in council or decree. By this means the appropriate clauses of the agreement with the expedient modifications will become binding on all the employers and employees {{under the jurisdiction of the}} decree. The provisions of the agreement that may thus receive the « juridical extension » are those concerning wages, hours of labour, apprenticeship regulations, the ratio of apprentices to journeymen in an undertaking and, by virtue of an amendment enacted last year, social security benefits. After a decree has been adopted, the contracting parties must set up a joint or parity committee to police the enforcement of the dispositions contained in the order in council. The functioning of the joint committee and the supervision of the application of the decree by the joint committee's inspectors are financed by a levy of one half of one percent that may be imposed both on the wages of the workers and on the payroll of the employers, subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN QUEBECFrom the very beginning of the operation of the Act, the construction industry has had recourse very extensively to the juridical extension of its collective agreements. In the first few years only the building part of the industry was covered, but with increasing rapidity all types of on-site construction have come under the system, although slight variations are still to be found in the industrial jurisdiction of the various general construction decrees. There are now sixteen such construction decrees regarding as many different geographic areas, the whole of them covering almost the entire province. The trade union movement in Quebec is split mainly into two groups. For historical reasons, the national syndicates have developed alongside the local branches of the international unions. In the construction industry the two groups claim an approximately equal membership throughout the province, the international unions having a stronger foothold in Montreal and the syndicates in the rest of the province. IMPACT ON LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONThe decree system has had a definite influence on both management and labour organizations, although it is difficult to assess its exact importance. On the union side it caused an unequivocal increase in the number of local unions in the building trades during its first years of application, that is roughly between 1935 and the beginning of World War II. Since World War II, the impact on unionization is much more difficult to evaluate. In the day-to-day life of the union, the existence of a decree creates the following difficulty: the workers being protected by the decree and having to pay a levy to the joint committee do not see as clearly as they otherwise would the reason for joining a union. Concerning the effect of this situation on unionization, no absolute conclusion appears possible. The development of labour unions in the construction industry in Quebec has been roughly comparable to that of corresponding unions in the neighbouring province of Ontario; this would imply that, on the whole, the adverse effect of the decree system on unionization may not have been as wide as one might think. Concerning management organizations, the impact of the decree system is probably subject to less controversy although the general influence may have been more scattered over time. Due to the obligation of bargaining regularly in order to maintain and to amend the decree, employers were forced to get together and take a common position. Construction associations existed in Montreal and Quebec before the establishment of the decree system; but everywhere else they appeared following the application of this labour-management relations formula. IMPACT ON THE BARGAINING UNITThe bargaining unit in the construction industry under the decree system is a multi-employer, multi-trade and geographic unit. Multi-employer bargaining seems to have been the general rule in Quebec earlier than elsewhere. Although there were a few instances of it before 1934, it was truly and completely established with the decree system. The basic idea of juridical extension renders single-employer bargaining useless except in special cases, since after having signed an agreement which has a preponderant significance and importance, the parties may obtain that everyone in the industry be obliged, through an order in council, to abide by the same working conditions as those agreed to in their contract. Multi-trade bargaining is even now very seldom found in the building trades on the North American continent. Outside of Quebec, Canadian examples of such bargaining are limited almost strictly to a very few huge projects, such as the hydro-electric constructions of the Ontario Hydro on the Niagara and St. Lawrence Rivers, and the Peace River power project in British Columbia. At the beginning, certain trades in Quebec City and in Trois-Rivières had their own special decree. But because of the necessity of establishing a corresponding joint committee and of financing it, it soon became evident that small groups would have to join the general group. Thus industry-wide bargaining in each of the ten or twelve regions then governed by construction decrees became the rule without exception until the late 1940 's when in the Montreal area some technical trades started to bargain separately for their own <b>special</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> while remaining under the same joint committee and the same decree, but with a special section for them in it. Definition of the bargaining unit with reference to a geographic territory is the third major characteristic. Under the system of juridical extension, the territorial bargaining unit becomes a necessity. The fact that the decree imposes definite working conditions on all the employers and the employees in an industry implies that the territory to which this order in council will apply must be very precisely defined. This territorial jurisdiction usually corresponds to the territory in which both management and labour organizations recruit their members and exert their influence. Concerning its determination, we find again the presence of forces operating in opposite directions. As an area which had depended upon a decree centered in another region gradually reaches a stage of greater economic development, unions and employers of the district look for a decree of their own. Of the 16 decrees now in force many of them are subdivisions of former larger territories. It must be said here that a single decree may foresee two, three, four, and even in some cases five or six zones, with different rates of wages according to the economic situation of the zones concerned. IMPACT ON THE LEVEL OF WAGESThe very nature of the decree system is to make it obligatory on everyone to follow the wage rates agreed upon by the contracting parties, if their contract has acquired the preponderant significance foreseen by the law. The Act itself explicitly permits agreements, both individual and collective, providing for more advantageous working conditions than those foreseen in the decree. Such collective agreements for higher wages are almost nonexistent in the construction industry. From the workers' point of view, perhaps the most important effect of the decree system is to have imposed a definite rate of wages for all types of on-site construction work including the non-union sector of the industry. It appears that in large metropolitan areas if not everywhere, a substantial differential may be found between the wage rates paid on union and non-union projects. It may be asked whether the uniform rate of wages under the decree system has exerted a downward pressure on the wage rates at the bargaining table. A study of the Toronto-Montreal interregional differentials over time leads to the following observations. The relative differential between the Toronto union rate and the Montreal decree rate for construction labourers has been substantially narrowed since the inception of the decree system in Quebec. This suggests that the labourers rate in Montreal under the decree system is effectively a union rate, the remaining regional differential being explained by the different economic environment. IMPACT ON INDUSTRIAL CONFLICTSIf we now turn to industrial conflicts, the construction industry in Quebec in comparison to the same industry in other provinces and in the United States has been extremely peaceful, although strikes do occur once in a while for various reasons. With respect to industrial peace, the influence of the decree system seems to have been very important. By ensuring to all construction workers relatively good working conditions, the system has removed one of the main, if not the main cause of industrial conflicts. The structure of the bargaining unit, with its multi-trade composition, has also had a stabilizing influence on industrial relations. While jurisdictional conflicts plague this industry elsewhere, these are almost always solved without a work stoppage in Quebec. One of the instruments for resolving these problems rests in the detailed definitions of trades which appear in every single decree now in force in the Province. A third factor which may have had the deepest influence in keeping the industry peaceful appears to be the long experience of bargaining that has resulted from the decree system. CONCLUSIONThus although the joint committee still has very limited power and jurisdiction, it appears to have a very important influence on the whole complex of labour relations in the construction industry in Quebec. The whole decree system seems to be rather well suited to an industry in which competition is keen, unionization difficult and conflicting forces constantly at work between the persons and groups involved. It has been an important factor favouring unity and cohesiveness. It has brought some order into an industry which seems to have a natural tendency towards confusion and sometimes chaos. The system is far from being perfect. But if the parties together with the government strive to better this institution as they have done, especially in the last two or three years, we may hope that it will continue to render good service to the industry and to all the persons actually involved in it for their living...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to analyse the wage {{differentials}} associated with non-pecuniary <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> using objective and subjective data. In some situations a worker can be compensated for unsatisfactory <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> via a higher wage; conversely, {{in the presence of}} segmented labor markets, higher wages can be associated with favorable non-monetary <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> Moreover, a positive correlation between wages and satisfactory <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> exists when there is efficient union bargaining regarding both wages and <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the present study, we estimate a wage equation with variables that capture workers' subjective views regarding their current non-pecuniary <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> allowing for unobserved individual heterogeneity. Our results reveal a positive wage differential associated with satisfactory non-pecuniary <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> This result supports the segmentation labor market hypothesis. The focus of the study is on Italian workers, but we compare the core results the those obtained for other Mediterranean countries. Copyright 2007 The Author.
