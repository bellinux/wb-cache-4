With the addition of features like a clutch-protected brush roller, a by-pass motor and hospital-grade filtration, the first SEBO found acceptance in the market by 1979. Commercial cleaning manufacturers such as Windsor Kärcher and Jeyes Hygiene re-branded SEBO uprights under their own name during the early 1980s.

40|$|The {{pneumatic}} conveying of bulk solid materials by {{the generation of}} a partial vacuum or negative pressure is the oldest form of conveying such materials through pipelines. It was developed approximately {{one hundred years ago}} to assist the rapid unloading of wheat grain from ships, barges and lighters in the London docks. However, the basic design of the device for entraining the bulk solid into the conveying pipeline has changed very little since those times. This thesis examines the effect of entrainment mechanisms in co-axial tube type <b>suction</b> <b>nozzles</b> on the performance of such conveying systems. The normal design of such nozzles is one where the inner conveying tube is retracted inside the outer tube. The work has demonstrated that with this configuration, high air velocities are necessary to effect entrainment of material beneath the nozzle into the conveying pipeline. By rearranging the nozzle so that the inner tube protrudes from the outer tube, a configuration can be obtained where, for free flowing products, the material flows readily under the action of gravity into the entraining airstream flowing down the annular chamber formed by the two tubes. The work has demonstrated that, for a given air flow rate, the product feed rate, and hence system throughput will be maximised by arranging these tubes such that the angle formed by them in the entrainment region is greater than the angle at which the product flows under the action of gravity into this region. Since a lower air flow rate and hence power consumption is required to achieve a given system throughput, this configuration has been identified as a more efficient entrainment mechanism than that associated with the usual configuration of <b>suction</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The effect of throttling the air flowing down the annular chamber on product entrainment into such nozzles is also identified and presented...|$|R

40|$|Suction {{sampling}} with modified garden leaf-blowers (G-vacs) is {{a widely}} used method for research on invertebrates in agricultural and grassland habitats. Approaches vary from sweeping the collecting nozzle {{across the surface of}} the vegetation within a known area, applying the nozzle firmly to the ground to delimit a sample area equal to nozzle crosssection, or applying the nozzle repeatedly within a larger open-ended cylinder placed on the ground. These approaches vary in potential for the inadvertent capture of specimens from outside of the sample area as a result of air being drawn into the nozzle from adjacent vegetation. This has never been studied adequately and is defined here for the first time as the Peripheral Suction Effect (PSE). Invertebrate species are likely to differ in susceptibility to PSE and so both sample size and composition could be impacted. This study compares two series of samples of Auchenorrhyncha taken using the same G-vac <b>suction</b> sampler (<b>nozzle</b> area, 0. 01 m 2) from areas enclosed and unenclosed by an openended cylindrical enclosure (area 0. 17 m 2) intended to prevent PSE. The unenclosed samples contained greater numbers of leafhoppers including Arthaldeus pascuellus, Javesella pellucida and immature Deltocephalinae. Numbers of immature Delphacinae did not differ between enclosed and unenclosed samples. The species composition of the two series of samples was similar, but the proportional representation of immature Delphacinae in unenclosed samples was diluted by the inflated numbers of other taxa that were drawn from the surrounding area. Peripheral suction effects are taxa-specific and therefore have the potential to bias measures of invertebrate community composition. Use of an open-ended cylinder to delimit the sample area is recommended as a simple, inexpensive and effective method of avoiding problems associated with PSE when using a G-vac. The potential for PSE with other models of suction samplers is discussed and questions for further research are identified...|$|R

Tests were carried out using the two-stage Low Speed Research Turbine of the Aerodynamics Research Laboratory of GE Aircraft Engines. Blading in this facility models current, state-of-the-art low pressure turbine configurations. The instrumentation technique involved arrays of densely-packed hot-film sensors on the surfaces of second stage rotor and nozzle blades. The arrays were located at mid-span on both the suction and pressure surfaces. Boundary layer measurements were acquired over a complete range of relevant Reynolds numbers.

40|$|Effective {{treatment}} of municipal wastewater {{is becoming increasingly}} important to good water governance. It is vital that every operation in the wastewater treatment process be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency and sustainability. One such operation is anaerobic digestion, in which microbes act {{in the absence of}} oxygen to turn sludge into odour free bio-solids and methane-rich biogas, from which energy can be recovered. Tenney &amp; Budzin (1972) argued that around 50 % of the geometric volume of an anaerobic digester is stagnant and thus oversizing is a necessity. It is the contention of this project that an increase in capital cost of such magnitude is unnecessary and can be avoided if the all parameters including mixing requirements are carefully considered. Mixing is important to the digestion process as it provides the necessary contact between the feed sludge and the active biomass, which in turn gives uniform temperature and substrate concentration throughout the digester. In the interest of sustainability, there is a push in the wastewater industry to move to more concentrated feed stocks to conserve water. While an increase in solids concentration provides a richer feed stock for digestion, it also presents a challenge regarding the hydrodynamics of mixing in anaerobic digesters. There are three mixing techniques usually employed for anaerobic digesters, mechanical mixing, gas sparging and liquid jet recirculation mixing. This project focuses on the latter, which involves pumping sludge out of the digester, passing it through a heat exchanger and returning it to the digester through a nozzle submerged in the liquid body of the digester. As sludge is an opaque fluid and therefore difficult to study on a lab-scale, this work employed a model digester using xanthan gum Keltrol T (XGKT) solution, which has been shown to mimic sludge across the range of shear rates found in anaerobic digesters. A flow visualisation technique was employed to study the effect of a number of factors on the creation of active volume over time. In the tank with a 1 : 1 aspect ratio, three distinct mixing regimes were identified using a downward-facing nozzle placed at half the liquid height, each associated with different hydrodynamics at play. The effects of jet velocity and fluid rheology were investigated, and it was found that fluid rheology has a much greater impact on mixing performance than jet velocity. Increased jet velocity was even shown to have a detrimental effect on mixing performance over the observed timescale. Through first-principles analysis of advection-diffusion, solutions were developed to describe the expansion of active volume in terms of advection-diffusion in bounded and unbounded domains. It was found that the solution for the unbounded domain can be fit to the creation of active volume {{in the early stages of}} mixing and the solution for the bounded domain can be fit to later stages of active volume creation. However, the majority of active volume creation occurs in transition between the two solutions. To understand why the majority of active volume creation occurred between the two ideal advection-diffusion equations, a state-of-the-art electrical resistance tomography (ERT) technique was employed to fully investigate the 3 D mixing environment. It was found that the creation of active volume begins to deviate from the unbounded advection-diffusion curve as the suction flow field begins to interact with the jet flow field and &lsquo;short-circuiting&rsquo; occurs. This short-circuiting effect becomes more pronounced in fluids with more complex rheology such that steady-state cavern formation occurs in fluids with a yield stress. This has not been observed in jet recirculation mixing before. To overcome the steady-state carven formation in rheologically complex fluids, a simple nozzle inversion was employed such that the nozzle is pointing upwards towards the flexible surface. In all cases, an upward-facing nozzle performed better than a downward-facing nozzle because a surface velocity induced by the jet aided in the mixing process, which was not found when the jet was pumping against the rigid floor of the tank. Furthermore, rather than generating a short-circuiting effect that results from having two competing flow fields, an upward-facing &lsquo;jet&rsquo; nozzle and a downward-facing &lsquo;suction&rsquo; nozzle lead to two complimentary flow fields that greatly enhances the mixing performance. Based on the interaction between jet and suction flow fields, a design equation was formulated for jet mixing based on the separation of the jet and <b>suction</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The equation was based on the observed trend that mixing time decreases with increased separation of the two nozzles up to a certain point. Beyond this point, the further separation of nozzles has no effect on mixing time. This has beneficial implications in designing jet recirculation systems with multiple inlet and outlets, although, further tests need to be conducted with different configurations on the pilot and industrial scales to verify this...|$|R

It also integrates a piping system to supply the model with exhaust and hot air to simulate the inlet <b>suction</b> and <b>nozzle</b> exhausts, respectively. Hot gas ingestion studies have been performed with the facility ground plane installed. The DAS provides vertical (ascent and descent) translation speeds of up to 48 in. /s and horizontal translation speeds of up to 12 in. /s. Model pitch variations of +/- 7, roll variations of +/- 5, and yaw variations of 0 to 180 deg can be accommodated and are maintained within 0. 25 deg throughout the translation profile. The hot air supply, generated by the facility heaters and regulated by control valves, provides three separate temperature zones to the model for STOVL and hot gas ingestion testing.

This aspect causes low efficiency of these systems in comparison with conventional compression systems operating with most of synthetic or natural refrigerants. Therefore, improving of carbon dioxide cycle efficiency {{is one of the}} most important issue for refrigeration and heat pump engineering. Â Most of investigations presented in literature were focused on the analysis of the whole system including ejector of assumed geometry applied. This makes unfavourable conditions for the estimation of the possibilities of the cycle efficiency improvement since they also depend on the performance of the ejector applied in the system. The last one is undoubtedly complicated and separate issue since there is lack of theoretical model of two-phase ejector that was proved experimentally and could be applied in such analysis. Authors of the paper proposed own approach based on the pure thermodynamic analysis of the compression-ejection cycle. In this method it is possible to analyse the operating parameters of the ejector that are required by the refrigeration system in order to improve system efficiency. The analysis refers to determine the requirements of the refrigeration system for the ejector operation. The analysis presented in the paper is focused on the cases which have not been discussed in previous studies, i. e. application of two-phase ejector for subcritical cycles and application of two-phase ejector as a second step compressor in wide range of operating parameters covering both subcritical and supercritical cycles.

40|$|The {{jet pump}} {{generally}} needs a long throat {{to mix the}} driving and induced fluids and transfer the momentum of driving fluid to induced fluid. Simultaneously the energy losses occur when the fluids flow through the long throat happened due to the friction loss occurs inside of the throat wall. Therefore, {{it is known that}} the throat length largely affects the jet pump efficiency. In this study, experimental studies are performed for a typical single nozzle jet pump using water as driving fluid and sand as the induced fluid. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the performance of dredging jet pump. The effects of the pump operating conditions and geometries on its performance were investigated. The experimental rig was constructed such a way it can be changing the mixing chamber length and diffuser angles. In this study three different mixing chamber length to mixing chamber diameter ratio of 6. 75, 7. 25 and 7. 86 are studied. And three different diffuser angles of 4 º, 5. 5 º and 7 º respectively with one <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle</b> of semi cone angle of 22 º. Also one type o...|$|E
40|$|The main {{target of}} the paper is to {{evaluate}} the hydraulic parameters of a movable jet pump equipped by a fixed fluidizer under the effect of some parameters such as: area ratio, mass flow ratio, driving nozzle to mixing chamber distance, suction inlet configuration and speed of jet pump when moves during operation. A special experimental test rig has been designed and built to study {{the effect of these}} parameters experimentally. A theoretical formula had been derived to predict jet pump performance under various working conditions using basic fluid mechanics equations (continuity, momentum and energy equations). In this paper, three different diameters of driving nozzle, namely (10. 16, 11. 9 & 13. 9 mm) have been used with one mixing chamber of 25. 4 mm diameter (i. e. three different area ratios of 0. 16, 0. 22 & 0. 3). Also four driving nozzle to mixing chamber distances were tested with values of D 1, 1. 5 D 1, 2 D 1 & 2. 5 D 1 mm (D 1 = nozzle diameter). One type of sand was used with 0. 52 mm mean particle size diameter and with a specific gravity of 2. 65. Furthermore, one <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle</b> of semi cone angle 24...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 11 In 1991, {{four large}} double suction cooling pumps were {{installed}} at a chemical plant in Texas. Although these pumps met performance specifications {{on the test}} stand, they proved to be noisy when installed. Sound power levels greater than 93 dbA were observed. Pumping applications involving cooling water have been especially difficult to solve over the tears, due {{to the presence of}} dissolved air inherent in a cooling tower sump. Water that contains large amounts of dissolved air changes the apparent required net positive suction head (NPSH). In such applications, traditional correction techniques failed because the entire system was not analyzed, and the source of the noise generation could not be pinpointed. This paper deals with the steps involved with obtaining a solution to this problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed on the pump and impeller. Initial investigation revealed that the impeller was not the source of the problem. The casing inlet was then analyzed. The model indicated the presence of separation in the <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle,</b> causing a flow distortion at the impeller eye. A unique guide ring was developed to minimize the flow separation. The CFD analysis was revised to reflect the new geometry, and a significant improvement in the flow was predicted. A prototype guide ring was manufactured and installed in one of the four pumps. Pressure profiles were obtained by experiment to validate the analyses. The results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the performance of water jet pump. This study is reported in a series of three papers. In this paper, the performance of water jet pump was studied. The effects of the pump operating conditions and geometries on its performance were investigated. The experimental rig was constructed such a way it can be changing the driving nozzle, mixing chamber and diffuser. During experimental program water is used in both motive and pumped sides. In this study three different diameters of driving nozzles, namely (10, 12. 7 and 16 mm) have been used with one mixing chamber of 25. 4 mm diameter (i. e. three different area ratios of 0. 155, 0. 25 and 0. 4). Furthermore three different mixing chamber lengths to mixing chamber diameter ratio of 6. 75, 7. 25 and 7. 86. And three different diffuser angles of 4 º, 5. 5 º and 7 º respectively with one <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle</b> of semi cone angle of 22 º. The effect of nozzle to throat spacing to nozzle diameter ratio "X " with values of 0 D, D, 1. 5 D and 2 D, on the jet pump performance was also tested under different flow rates and motive pressures. In all cases, it was found that the best efficiency for the jet pump is attained with "X " equal one, and the best values for these design parameters have been obtained from the experimental work. The performance of slurry jet pump and the comparison between them will later be discussed in another further paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{covers the}} experimental results {{obtained in the}} current work. A set of experiments were carried out to study the effect of some parameters {{on the performance of}} the suggested jet pump. These parameters such as: area ratio (four different area ratios of 0. 16, 0. 22, 0. 26 and 0. 3 were used), driving nozzle outlet diameter to mixing chamber diameter ratios (four ratios were tested with values of 1, 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5). Also, two suction inlet configuration were selected (one with cylindrical inlet part, and the another with conical inlet part) and two vertical level positions for jet pump at 10 and 30 mm from sand bed were studied. In addition, the experimental study also includes the performance of the slurry jet pump in two cases (stationary and movable), for the movable case, two speeds for jet pump of 0. 7 and 0. 35 m/min were tested. One type of quartz sand was used with 0. 52 mm mean particle size diameter and with a specific gravity of 2. 65. Furthermore, one <b>suction</b> <b>nozzle</b> of semi cone angle 24 ° was used with one diffuser of semi cone angle 5. 5 °. One fluidizer of 3 mm holes diameter was used too. A special experimental test rig has been designed and built to study the effect of these parameters experimentally. The performance of slurry jet pump is described by two sets of curves. The first shows the relationship between the head ratio (N) and the mass flow ratio (M). The second set shows the relationship between the jet pump efficiency (η) and the mass flow ratio...|$|E
