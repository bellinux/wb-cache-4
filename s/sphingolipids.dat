5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as <b>sphingolipids</b> {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary <b>sphingolipids</b> have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary <b>sphingolipids</b> also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and <b>sphingolipids</b> play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are <b>sphingolipids</b> containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain. Each of these lipid classes is known to play functional roles within the body, including the support of gut, immune, and central nervous system development.|$|E

Interactions between <b>sphingolipid</b> and Ch as well as <b>sphingolipid</b> and another <b>sphingolipid</b> result in significant deviations from the additivity rule. An equilibrium theory to describe the behavior of monolayer components at the air–water inter-face was developed in order to obtain the stability constants and Gibbs free energy values of SM–Ch, SM–Cer and Cer– Ch complexes.

40|$|SummaryIron {{constitutes}} {{a major source}} of toxicity due to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species that can damage cellular macromolecules. However, the precise mechanism by which exposure to high iron concentrations results in cellular toxicity remains unknown. Here we identify <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis and signaling as a major mediator of iron toxicity in S.  cerevisiae. Inhibition of <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis by myriocin treatment or after overexpression of the negative regulator Orm 2 p confers resistance to high iron. High iron conditions upregulate <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis, and increasing <b>sphingolipid</b> levels by inactivating Orm 2 p exacerbates sensitivity to iron. Toxicity is mediated by <b>sphingolipid</b> signaling, as inactivation of the sphingolipid-activated protein kinases Pkh 1 p and Ypk 1 p and of the transcription factor Smp 1 p also enhances resistance to high iron conditions. These results demonstrate an unexpected connection between <b>sphingolipid</b> flux and iron toxicity and show that activation of a signal transduction cascade contributes to iron-mediated cellular toxicity...|$|R
5|$|<b>Sphingolipids</b> are a {{complicated}} family of compounds that {{share a common}} structural feature, a sphingoid base backbone that is synthesized de novo from the amino acid serine and a long-chain fatty acyl CoA, then converted into ceramides, phosphosphingolipids, glycosphingolipids and other compounds. The major sphingoid base of mammals is {{commonly referred to as}} sphingosine. Ceramides (N-acyl-sphingoid bases) are a major subclass of sphingoid base derivatives with an amide-linked fatty acid. The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono-unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the <b>sphingolipids,</b> and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated <b>sphingolipids</b> from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{studies in}} this {{dissertation}} {{demonstrate that the}} gene expression pathway maps are useful tools to notice alteration in different branches of <b>sphingolipid</b> biosynthesis pathway based on microarray and other transcriptomic analysis. To facilitate the integrative analysis of gene expression and <b>sphingolipid</b> amounts, updated pathway maps were prepared using an open access visualization tool, Pathvisio v 1. 1. The datasets were formatted using Perl scripts and visualized {{with the aid of}} color coded pathway diagrams. Comparative analysis of transcriptomics and <b>sphingolipid</b> alterations from experimental studies and published literature revealed 72. 8 % correlation between mRNA and <b>sphingolipid</b> differences (p-value < 0. 0001 by the Fisher's exact test). The high correlation between gene expression differences and <b>sphingolipid</b> alterations highlights the application of this tool to evaluate molecular changes associate with <b>sphingolipid</b> alterations as well as predict differences in specific metabolites that can be experimentally verified using sensitive approaches such as mass spectrometry. In addition, bioinformatics sequence analysis was used to identify transcripts for <b>sphingolipid</b> biosynthesis enzyme 3 -ketosphinganine reductase, and homology modeling studies helped in the evaluation of a cell line defective in <b>sphingolipid</b> metabolism due to mutation in the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme of de novo biosynthesis pathway. Hence, the combination of different bioinformatics approaches, including protein and DNA sequence analysis, structure modeling and pathway diagrams can provide valuable inputs for biochemical and molecular studies of <b>sphingolipid</b> metabolism.

40|$|Yeast {{members of}} the ORMDL family of {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) membrane proteins {{play a central role}} in lipid homeostasis and protein quality control. In the absence of yeast Orm 1 and Orm 2, accumulation of long chain base, a <b>sphingolipid</b> precursor, suggests dysregulation of <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis. Physical interaction between Orm 1 and Orm 2 and serine palmitoyltransferase, responsible for the first committed step in <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis, further supports a role for the Orm proteins in regulating <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis. Phospholipid homeostasis is also affected in orm 1 ∆ orm 2 ∆ cells: the cells are inositol auxotrophs with impaired transcriptional regulation of genes encoding phospholipid biosynthesis enzymes. Strikingly, impaired growth of orm 1 ∆ orm 2 ∆ cells is associated with constitutive unfolded protein response, sensitivity to stress, and slow ER-to-Golgi transport. Inhibition of <b>sphingolipid</b> synthesis suppresses orm 1 ∆ orm 2 ∆ phenotypes, including ER stress, suggesting that disrupted <b>sphingolipid</b> homeostasis accounts for pleiotropic phenotypes. Thus, the yeast Orm proteins control membrane biogenesis by coordinating lipid homeostasis with protein quality control...|$|R
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although <b>sphingolipids</b> such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSphingolipid {{breakdown}} products {{are now being}} recognized to play a dual role in cellular signalling, acting as intracellular as well as extracellular signalling molecules. Both types of action may even be found with one <b>sphingolipid</b> species. The recent demonstration of G protein-coupled receptors with high affinity for sphingosine 1 -phosphate and sphingosylphosphorylcholine has been followed by the discovery of several novel <b>sphingolipid</b> actions, such as regulation of heart rate, oxidative burst, neurite retraction or platelet activation.

40|$|SummaryMitochondria are {{functionally}} {{and physically}} associated with heterotypic membranes, yet {{little is known}} about how these interactions impact mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. We observed that dissociation of heterotypic membranes from mitochondria inhibited BAK/BAX-dependent cytochrome c (cyto c) release. Biochemical purification of neutral sphingomyelinases that correlated with MOMP sensitization suggested that <b>sphingolipid</b> metabolism coordinates BAK/BAX activation. Using purified lipids and enzymes, sensitivity to MOMP was achieved by in vitro reconstitution of the <b>sphingolipid</b> metabolic pathway. <b>Sphingolipid</b> metabolism inhibitors blocked MOMP from heavy membrane preparations but failed to influence MOMP in the presence of sphingolipid-reconstituted, purified mitochondria. Furthermore, the <b>sphingolipid</b> products, sphingosine- 1 -PO 4 and hexadecenal, cooperated specifically with BAK and BAX, respectively. <b>Sphingolipid</b> metabolism was also required for cellular responses to apoptosis.

25|$|Cholesterol, {{given that}} it composes about 30% of all animal cell membranes, is {{required}} to build and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group on cholesterol interacts with the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and <b>sphingolipids,</b> while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells {{do not need to}} build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.|$|E

40|$|The {{protein and}} lipid {{composition}} of eukaryotic plasma membranes is highly dynamic and regulated according to need. Despite its great plasticity, the plasma membrane retains some organizational features, {{such as its}} lateral organization into distinct domains. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, large immobile protein clusters, termed eisosomes, are important for plasma membrane organization. Eisosomes help to sort proteins into discrete domains, function in endocytosis and are implicated in cellular signaling. The major eisosome components Pil 1 and Lsp 1 were first identified as in vitro targets of the <b>sphingolipid</b> long chain base-regulated Pkhkinases. However, {{it is not known}} if eisosomes are targets of Pkh-mediated <b>sphingolipid</b> signaling in vivo. In this thesis, I show that Pkh-kinases regulate eisosome formation in response to alterations of complex <b>sphingolipid</b> levels in the plasma membrane. I found that Pkh-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Pil 1 controls the assembly state of eisosomes. The combination of different unbiased, global analysis methods, such as proteomics and high content screening enabled me to identify Nce 102 as a negative regulator of Pkh-kinases. Nce 102 relocalizes between MCC domains, overlaying eisosomes, and the remainder of the plasma membrane in response to alterations in <b>sphingolipid</b> levels. Together with its regulatory function on Pkh-kinases that localize at eisosomes, this relocalization suggests that {{it is part of a}} <b>sphingolipid</b> sensor.

2500|$|... eNOS {{expression}} and activity {{are controlled by}} multiple interconnected mechanisms of regulation present at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels. Binding of transcription factors such as Sp1, Sp3, Ets-1, Elf-1, and YY1 to the NOS3 promoter and DNA methylation represents an important mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Posttranscriptionally, eNOS is regulated by modifications of the primary transcript, mRNA stability, subcellular localization, and nucleocytoplasmatic transport. Posttranslational modifications of eNOS include fatty acid acylation, protein-protein interactions, substrate, and co-factor availability, and degree of phosphorylation. Importantly, eNOS is attached by myristoylation and palmitoylation to caveolae, a pocket-like invagination on the membrane rich in cholesterol and <b>sphingolipids.</b> With the binding of eNOS to caveolae, the enzyme is inactivated due to the strong and direct interaction of eNOS with caveolin-1.
