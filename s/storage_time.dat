An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E

The effect of <b>storage</b> <b>times</b> with ∼ 0, 15, 30 and 45 days for concentrated NR latex with different ammonia contents on their properties such as alkalinity, magnesium content and viscosity was observed. It was found that generally, magnesium content in field NR latex and latex concentrate decreased with <b>storage</b> period <b>times.</b> The alkalinity content in both concentrated NR and skim latex increased with increasing ammonia content in field latex. The viscosity of concentrated NR latex increased as a function of <b>storage</b> period <b>time</b> of field NR latex.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{dynamical}} approach to quantum memories using an oscillator-cavity model. This overcomes the known difficulties of achieving high quantum input-output fidelity with long <b>storage</b> <b>times</b> {{compared to the}} input signal duration. We use a generic model of the memory response, which is applicable to any linear storage medium ranging from a superconducting device to an atomic medium. The temporal switching or gating of the device may either be through a control field changing the coupling, or through a variable detuning approach, as in more recent quantum memory experiments. An exact calculation of the temporal memory response to an external input is carried out. This shows {{that there is a}} mode-matching criterion which determines the optimum input and output pulse time evolution. This optimum pulse shape can be modified by changing the gate characteristics. In addition, there is a critical coupling between the atoms and the cavity that allows high fidelity in the presence of long <b>storage</b> <b>times.</b> The quantum fidelity is calculated both for the coherent state protocol, and for a completely arbitrary input state with a bounded total photon number. We show how a dynamical quantum memory can surpass the relevant classical memory bound, while retaining long <b>storage</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{leakage current}} {{includes}} all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage {{and is the}} DC current that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage in correct polarity. It depends on the capacitance value, on applied voltage and temperature of the capacitor, on measuring time, {{on the kind of}} electrolyte, and on preconditions like previous <b>storage</b> <b>time</b> without voltage applied or thermic stress from soldering. (All non-solid electrolytic capacitors needs a recovery time of some hours after soldering before measuring the leakage current. Non-solid chip capacitors need a recovery time after reflow soldering of about 24 hours.) Leakage current is reduced by applying operational voltage by self-healing processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{degree of}} treatment for the collected dried feces depends entirely on whether this product will be reused in agriculture. If it is not reused, but only buried, then no further treatment is required. The dried feces are in almost all cases not entirely sanitized when removed from a vault of the UDDT, so careful handling is obligatory. In scenarios wherein excreta is to be reused in agriculture, a secondary treatment of fecal matter and storage of urine is advisable to ensure adequate sanitization. Fecal material from single vault UDDTs must always be post-treated, even if just via prolonged storage. Fecal material from double vaults has typically passed a certain <b>storage</b> <b>time</b> and is therefore already more sanitized. However, a secondary form of treatment is optional but recommended for household systems and required for large-scale systems.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this storage method. When the {{electric}} power flows into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the <b>storage</b> <b>time.</b> This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces. The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|Mixing is a {{critical}} step in batter preparation since overmixing causes the gluten to develop excessively and create a batter with too high of a viscosity {{that is difficult to}} pour and does not expand easily. A thick batter that is difficult spreading in the baking iron has an increased water activity of around 0.85. The increased viscosity made it harder for water to evaporate from the waffle causing an increase in water activity. The control waffles with a softer texture had a water activity of 0.74 after cooking. The Aw is less because the softer texture allows the water to evaporate. With an increased <b>storage</b> <b>time,</b> waffle physical and textural properties changes regardless of the batter viscosity. [...] Aged waffles shrink because air bubbles leak out and the structure starts to condense. Hardness and viscosity also increases as time goes by.

2500|$|The {{ability of}} non-solid {{aluminum}} electrolytic capacitors {{to have a}} stable behavior during longer storage times can be tested by using an accelerating test of storage the capacitors at its upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours without voltage applied.

Method Hand touch DNA samples were used to investigate the detection and inspection results of DNA on different substrates. Four preprocessing methods, including the direct cutting method, stubbing procedure, double swab technique, and vacuum cleaner method, were used in this study. DNA was extracted from mock samples with four different preprocessing methods. The best preprocess protocol determined from the study was further used to compare performance after various <b>storage</b> <b>times.</b> DNA extracted from all samples was quantified and amplified using standard procedures. Results The amounts of DNA and the number of alleles detected on the porous substrates were greater than those on the non-porous substrates. The performances of the four preprocessing methods varied with different substrates.
