He also was one of the founders of Zenshuji, a Soto Zen temple located in Los Angeles, California. Suzuki's father and Kitano had a tense history between them. Sogaku had trained with Kitano in his early Zen training and felt that he was such a high priest due to familial status and connections. Shunryu did not <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> Kitano, however. He saw a humble man who gave clear instruction, and Shunryu realized that his father was very wrong in his assessment.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.|$|E

2500|$|The modernists, in general, use a {{subjective}} language. Martí's stylistic creed {{is part of}} the necessity to de-codify the logic rigor and the linguistic construction and to eliminate the intellectual, abstract and systematic expression. There is the deliberate intention and awareness to expand the expressive system of the language. The style changes the form of thinking. Without falling into unilateralism, Martí values the expression because language is an impression and a feeling through the form. Modernism mostly searches for the visions and realities, the expression takes in the impressions, the state of mind, without reflection and without concept. This is the law of subjectivity. We can <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> works of Martí, one of the first modernists, who conceives the literary task like an invisible unity, an expressive totality, considering the style like [...] "a form of the content" [...] (forma del contenido).|$|E
2500|$|While {{the artist}} had {{produced}} his first vehicle in Poland with additional conceptual versions designed when he lived in Canada, it was with his Homeless Vehicle Project of 1987-89, that he redirected “attention {{from the work of}} art as dissent to the work of art as social action: in this case, the discussions and design collaboration with members of the homeless community to develop both a physical object and a conceptual design that would make their participation in the urban economy visible and self-directed.” The Homeless Vehicle Project was both symbolic and useful: [...] the artist’s first work to use a collective process to legitimize the problems of a marginal community “without legitimating the crisis of homelessness.” While the public was cautious, the operators of the vehicles took the project seriously. According to Wodiczko, “You <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> certain gestures, certain ways of behaving, speaking, dialoguing, of building up stories, narratives: the homeless become actors, orators, workers, all things which they usually are not. [...] The idea is to let them speak and tell their own stories, to let them be legitimate actors on the urban stage.” The attention to testimony as a transformative process while still tentative in the Homeless Vehicle Project became a significant performative process in the artist’s Instruments and eventually part of the his projections as well.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Arthur wins a large cash prize in a {{sweepstakes}} and uses it to take the whole family on a holiday to Egypt. After they return, Arthur thinks that Harry should know (what he [...] then believes to be) the truth about Sirius Black. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it seems that Arthur does not fully believe the stories of Harry's abuse {{at the hands of}} the Dursleys until he witnesses what they think about Harry and the Wizarding world and is stunned to see them so eager to say goodbye to him, before taking him to the Quidditch World Cup. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Mr Weasley is a member of the Order, and accompanies Harry to his visit in the Ministry. During one of his shifts in the Ministry guarding Sybill Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's pet snake Nagini attacks him. Harry, who is mentally connected with Voldemort, manages to <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> a vision and is able to warn the Hogwarts authorities. Arthur is subsequently saved just in time and sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, where he fully recovers. Rowling has revealed that in the original draft for Order of the Phoenix she planned to kill Arthur. She changed her mind, however, saying that she could not kill Arthur as he is one of the few good fathers in the series. However, as she [...] "wanted to kill parents", she spared Arthur's life in exchange for Lupin's and Tonks's. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Arthur has been promoted to Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.|$|E

6000|$|Under a {{transport}} of Joy or of vivid Pleasure, {{there is a}} strong tendency to various purposeless movements, and to the utterance of various sounds. We <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> our young children, in their loud laughter, clapping of hands, and jumping for joy; in the bounding and barking of a dog when going out to walk with his master; and in the frisking of a horse when turned out into an open field. Joy quickens the circulation, and this stimulates the brain, which again reacts on the whole body. The above purposeless movements and increased heart-action may be attributed in chief part to the excited state of the sensorium,[10] and to the consequent undirected overflow, as Mr. Herbert Spencer insists, of nerve-force. It deserves notice, that it is chiefly the anticipation of a pleasure, and not its actual enjoyment, which leads to purposeless and extravagant movements of the body, and to the utterance of various sounds. We <b>see</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> our children when they expect any great pleasure or treat; and dogs, which have been bounding about at ...|$|E
