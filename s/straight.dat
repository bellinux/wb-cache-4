5|$|At the US Open, Murray {{entered a}} Grand Slam tournament as {{defending}} champion {{for the first}} time, and started strongly with a <b>straight</b> sets win against Michaël Llodra. He backed this up with wins over Leonardo Mayer, Florian Mayer and Denis Istomin to reach the quarterfinals at a major for the 11th <b>straight</b> tournament. In the last 8, Murray faced Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, but lost in <b>straight</b> sets, ending Murray's streak of four consecutive major finals. Following his disappointing run of form on hard courts, Murray next joined the Great Britain Davis Cup team in their World Group Play-off tie on clay against Croatia, where he played in two singles and the doubles rubbers. After defeating 16-year-old Borna Ćorić in <b>straight</b> sets, Murray teamed up with Colin Fleming to defeat Croatian number 1 Ivan Dodig and Mate Pavić in the doubles, and take a 2–1 lead in the tie. Murray then sealed Britain's return to the World Group by defeating Dodig in <b>straight</b> sets.|$|E
