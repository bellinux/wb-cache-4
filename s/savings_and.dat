We test for cointegration between <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment using the recently developed bounds testing approach to cointegration and derive the long-run elasticities using the autoregressive distributed lag modeling approach for Japan {{over the period}} 1960 - 1999.

Amongst our key results we find that <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment are cointegrated for Japan; investment causes <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> <b>saving</b> causes investment; shocks to <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment have a permanent effect; and the long-run coefficient on saving is 0. 68, implying a moderate rate of correlation.

40|$|The Feldstein–Horioka (FH) puzzle, that is {{the strong}} {{correlation}} between <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment {{in a world where}} obstacles to capital mobility are limited, has been studied extensively since it was exposed in 1980. Even though the theoretical and empirical literature has examined many of its potential causes, the puzzle persists. This paper aims at shedding further light on the issue by investigating the relationship between <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment in South Africa since 1946 using fractional integration and cointegration techniques to account for high persistence in the series. We find evidence of fractional cointegration between <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment, indicating some degree of persistence in the gap between the two variables. We also find a structural break in <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment ratios to GDP around 1980, which roughly coincides with the start of a financial deregulation process in South Africa. While fractional cointegration holds before the break, it does not thereafter. In other words, while the FH puzzle is observed before the start of financial deregulation, it subsequently disappears. This suggests that financial deregulation may have loosened the link between <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} domestic <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment and measures the international mobility of capital in the United States. The long-run model, “with” and “without” structural breaks, is estimated using several single-equation and system estimators to assess the robustness of results and take an exhaustive account of the methodological and measurement issues. The results provide dominant support for the long-run relationship between domestic <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment. The estimates of the slope parameter on <b>saving</b> above zero <b>and</b> the dominant support for cointegration between <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment across estimators vindicate the validity of intertemporal budget constraint and suggest the sustainability of current account deficits. The numerical magnitude of the slope parameter on saving is consistently low across estimators. The results showing the low slope parameter on saving resonate with the observed high mobility of capital. The estimates of the model with structural breaks reinforce the dominant support for the long-run relationship between domestic <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> investment. The inclusion of these structural breaks in the model generally reduces the numerical magnitude of the slope parameter on <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> suggests the high mobility of capital.
