Abstrac: Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) have traditionally {{focused on their}} domestic markets. However, {{in the last few}} decades, SMEs have become increasingly active in international markets. SMEs have benefited immensely from a worldwide process of economic, financial, cultural and technological integration. From a holistic perspective, internationalisation is both an inward and outward process. This research focuses on the <b>SME</b> <b>manager,</b> who is the key decision-maker in the SME and the driving force in its internationalisation. Most literature on internationalisation is based on trade-related activities. However, this research uses the notion of awareness. The <b>SME</b> <b>manager</b> needs to be alert and well informed about his surroundings in order to cope with international threats and overseas market opportunities. The empirical work consisted of face-to-face interviews, followed by a large postal survey conducted in five countries: the UK, France, Finland, Australia and Mexico. A total of 2, 500 questionnaires was sent with a response rate of 22 %. Remarkable similarities were found in the characteristics of the <b>SME</b> <b>manager.</b> He {{is likely to be a}} middle-aged, well-educated male, with a degree in engineering or business. He speaks a foreign language, is well travelled and may well have lived abroad. Most SMEs were found to be engaged, directly or indirectly, in some sort of international activity, usually importing products and parts. SMEs do not necessarily follow a pattern of incremental internationalisation as they have a wide range of options and many of these managers pursue opportunistic strategies. The information acquisition of the <b>SME</b> <b>manager</b> was analysed, as information is a prerequisite in the internationalisation of the SME. The manager gathers and acquires external information that needs to be internalised, and integrated with that which the manager already has to create new knowledge. SME managers prefer informal means to acquire the information they need, often from customers, suppliers and competitors. SME managers, wherever they are, have very similar needs and problems, have similar education, apply similar management theories and have access to similar information. Similarities outweigh the differences; it seems the business culture has become as international as the English language. Other research has focused on the differences, perhaps missing the similarities. For most SME managers, market considerations, such as customer preferences, are far more important than cultural considerations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{perceived}} information needs and information behaviours of manager of UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As technology advancement and innovation are changing rapidly affecting organisations in different ways, organization executives are introducing new technologies for their operations and business environment becomes more complex and dynamic, government introducing different policies to guide the use of these emerging ICTs. As a result, information becomes significant during adoption decision-making process for <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> to make an inform decision. To achieve this aim, a framework is developed based on existing literature, using the technology organization environmental (TOE) model as the theoretical underpinning for empirical investigation on information behaviour of <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> in this study. This study is qualitative in nature, and semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with twenty <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> in the UK service sector. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Following Myers and Newman’s (2007) guidelines for qualitative interview and triangulation method were used to validate the conceptual framework and established the research rigour and quality. The research findings explained information behaviours of <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> in the contexts of technology organisation environment as information behaviour triggered and perceived information needs during the adoption decision in SMEs. These findings provide further insight into ICT adoption in SMEs through information behaviours and highlighted the significant of sources of information and pre-information needed during the decision-making process. The research also contributes to theory in the information systems field by using relevant literature from information science field to explore information behaviours of <b>SME</b> <b>managers.</b> Future research can be done in other sectors of the economy to show more holistic behaviours of <b>SME</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{unresolved}} issues plague {{the field}} of academic research and practitioner debate surrounding the role and value of planning in the small firm, though a recognized obstacle {{to the introduction of}} any formal system is the simple lack of time and resources. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that planning can be a powerful lever in pursuing change and growth, in small firms as in larger ones. The main thesis of this paper is that the scientific debate on SME planning should not only concern the planning activity per se, but also the rationale upon which decision making process is based. In also questioning the value of traditional planning approaches in the precarious situation of the growing small firm, this paper proposes a learning-oriented modeling approach to small business planning. This approach can build the critical bridge between the informal planning and entrepreneurial thinking of the <b>SME</b> <b>manager,</b> and the formal plans upon which many growth ambitions are predicated. 1...|$|E
40|$|Several {{papers and}} books {{can be found}} in the {{literature}} on "cooperation", "co-ordination", and "collaboration" concepts in the industrial area. However, to the authors' experience deriving from the involvement in an EU-funded project on collaborative demand and supply networks, each research line seems to push its own vision which counters others. For an <b>SME</b> <b>manager,</b> however, it would be useful to provide a structural and integrated model in order to evaluate the potentiality of forming a new network or the inclusion of his/her SME in an existing network. This paper proposes a survey of the existing methods and models of SME networks, that forms the basis for their profitability evaluation. The survey analyzes the different approaches proposed in the literature through a common model of an SME network in terms of both a functional and a structural representation. A small number of network types are subsequently identified. Managers/owners of SMEs can use this classification to analyze if it is convenient to participate in a network or not. This decision depends on a comparison of the main SME features and the network structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{contribution}} that a business school can make to the development of marketing competencies in SME managers. Literature reveals that in comparison to undergraduate marketing learning, less attention is paid to the <b>SME</b> <b>manager.</b> The primary research here is based on workshops run by tutors from the University of Lincoln’s Business school marketing group. Workshops were organised around an entrepreneurial marketing theme and based on a philosophy of participative learning. Course member’s responses to the workshops were gathered via a questionnaire that allowed for the collection of qualitative and quantitative data. The results of both tutor and course participant evaluation suggests that models from entrepreneurial marketing, as opposed to traditional marketing, provide a sound basis for the development of SME managers skills. The positive course evaluation also suggests a good degree of satisfaction with the learning methods used in the workshops. Further research should be undertaken to assess the degree to which workshop thinking has become embedded in the actual practices of managers who attended the course. Finally, it is posited that there exists considerable scope for future workshops of this nature at both a national and local level...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a computerassisted performance analysis and optimization (CPAO) to help a <b>SME</b> <b>manager</b> which is considered in this paper as an inexperienced user in applying a simulation project without using explicitly the ARENA ® software. After the design of the suitable simulation model with ARENA ® software by an expert simulation modeler, the inexperienced user of CPAO can operate the process of simulation and optimization easily and simply. Major manipulations include the following. (1) The setting of possible configurations. (2) The statistical analysis and graphical analysis of simulation results. (3) The improvement and the optimization of some criteria. The developed CPAO application is carried out in two steps. Firstly, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is employed for the CPAO design phase.

40|$|E-commerce {{adoption}} among SMEs {{has been}} much discussed in management information technology and technological innovation literature. However, most of these prior studies focused mainly on e-commerce awareness or factors that influence e-commerce adoption. This study, on the other hand, attempts to develop a holistic insight into e-commerce adoption by SMEs. It investigates why some SMEs adopt e-commerce readily, and others do not. In addition, this study investigates the appropriateness of government support for SMEs encouraging them to adopt e-commerce. There is very little research that assesses e-commerce adoption by SMEs, certainly none as extensive as this, {{and there is also}} very limited empirical investigation of government support for SMEs to adopt e-commerce. This study helps to fill this gap by exploring these issues relating to e-commerce and SMEs. The framework model proposed in this study was developed out of an integration of various perspectives using the technological innovation literature, specifically the DOl and TOE frameworks. This model considers internal factors (the demographic characteristics of managers and their organisations), external factors (particularly government support), and reasons for, benefits of, and inhibitors to e-commerce adoption. Data for this study were collected through a questionnaire survey of over three thousand SMEs in Malaysia and forty face-to- face semi-structured interviews with SME managers and government officials.., Results show there is a low level of adoption of e-commerce by SME managers whether or not they received government e-commerce supports. E-commerce usage hardly extends beyond e-mail. Online buying and complex websites, such as websites with online ordering and online payment facility are not common. Websites are used to provide contact details and information about the firm and information about its goods and services only, without displaying prices. The SME and <b>SME</b> <b>manager</b> demographic characteristics show significant association with e-commerce adoption. Two important factors that facilitate e- commerce adoption emerge from these characteristics namely SME location and the manager's experience of living abroad. To encourage e-commerce adoption, SMEs in developing countries need not only to have appropriate technology infrastructure installed, but also to be in a location with good public transportation services and efficient delivery methods. SME managers also need experience of buying and selling on the Internet, which they might gain while living abroad. The interviews raise a number of questions about the effectiveness of government support programmes, and the ulterior motives of SMEs. The benefits of e-commerce are more often perceived than achieved. Interestingly, the reason that SMEs adopt e-commerce is to enhance company image, rather than its efficiency. From the research findings, a series of recommendations for e-commerce adoption among SMEs in Malaysia emerges, providing guidance for policymakers, practitioners, and academics. Many recommendations, such as the need to evaluate e-commerce initiatives, may perhaps be extended to government K'T policies in the developing world as a whole. The study exposes many gaps, often overlooked, between the rhetoric of e-commerce adoption and the reality. The model proposed in this study may be comprehensive for e-commerce adoption in firms. Future research can build on and extend the proposed integrated model by including other potential factors from different contexts. It will be helpful to explore other statistical analysis, either in the current model or in an enhanced one. The findings will help towards a better understanding for firms and government and suggest a quantitative basis for them to determine favourable policies and conditions for expanding their e-commerce. This study provides the impetus for future research on many issues. ...|$|E

40|$|Different {{stakeholders}} are now {{showing a}} higher interest in organisations’ social responsibility than ever before, creating an increased pressure on organisations' sustainability performance. Various researchers (e. g. Emerson, 2003; Lingane & Olsen, 2004) stress {{that in order}} to meet this pressure and to achieve a true sustainable development, organisations need to fully incorporate social values through social accounting. Although numerous organisations report on their social impacts (Hahn & Kühnen, 2013), it is often said that small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are lagging behind in terms of sustainability performance (Cassells & Lewis, 2011). A few studies have addressed this by investigating difficulties for social enterprises to conduct social accounting but a research gap is evident regarding practical implications for SMEs in the for-profit sector. Through an embedded case study design of a sustainability network of for-profit SMEs on Gotland, we sought to explain <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> perception of difficulties and benefits associated with social accounting, and how such attitudes relate to their sustainability practices. Through a triangulation design, surveys and qualitative interviews were applied to determine the relationship between attitudes and actions. A theoretical framework by Thomas and Lamm (2012), based on Ajzen’s (2005) theory of planned behaviour and Suchman’s (1995) typology of legitimacies was used for analysis. The <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> were found to have a neutral attitude towards social accounting and they all engaged in practical actions rather than social impact measurement or social reporting. Thus, the results reflect consistency between attitudes towards social accounting and actions, i. e. the intention to perform social accounting. The <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> perceived the difficulties of social accounting to outweigh the benefits of it, and were insecure about their abilities to perform social accounting. The findings of this study could confirm previously found implications of social accounting and further found that the <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> expected additional difficulties for companies in the service sector and for those without employees...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{competing}} strategic {{demands and}} limited resources, small-to-medium sized enterprise (<b>SME)</b> <b>managers</b> struggle to integrate sustainability comprehensively into their firms' strategy, while increasingly being targeted as significant contributors of unsustainable practices that compromise environmental services and societal wellbeing. Studies on why managers struggle to integrate sustainability strategies into their firms suggest managers face interrelated yet competing demands that surface {{a diversity of}} sustainability tensions that go beyond the traditional triad of economic, social and environmental agendas. The literature has primarily focused on the conscious cognitive sensemaking processes of managers in larger corporations as they face sustainability tensions. This lens does not surface the range of other inner experiences like emotions, values, and intuition that influence individuals' sensemaking process. The resulting research question for this study asks how SME managers' experience of strategic sustainability tensions influences their sustainability decision-making process. This research aimed to surface {{the full range of}} conscious and unconscious inner experiences managers had during their sustainability sensemaking processes. SMEs were a favourable research context in which to delve into the significance of managers' internal experiences because managers have a high degree of decision-making control in their firms, and there is scarce empirical evidence on what leads <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> to make sustainability decisions. Over a one-year period in an inductive qualitative and exploratory research process, I interviewed twelve <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> from the Western Cape's metals and manufacturing sector twice through two rounds of interviews. This study finds that <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> undergo a range of emotions that influence their sustainability sensemaking experience. Conflicting emotional sustainability triggers cause unconscious internal sustainability tensions for managers between their personal values and managerial responsibilities. The SME resource-constrained context causes managers to instinctually prioritise managerial responsibilities to keep their firm afloat and maintain their pride through the legacy of the company. This study contributes to the literature by unearthing and legitimising the range of experiences and tensions that influence SME managers' sustainability sensemaking processes. It prompts further examination into managers' experience of sustainability tensions in the SME context and what experiences lead to integrative sustainability decisionmaking in highly volatile SME environments...|$|R
40|$|There is {{intensive}} {{research in}} international business studies exploring strategic decisions {{relating to the}} choice of entry mode. As a frontier issue the choice of entry mode has been widely recognised as {{being one of the}} critical decisions in a firm's internationalisation. However, most of the research primarily focuses upon Western multi-national enterprises (MNEs) rather than small-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Recently, interest in the international business activities of SMEs has been increasing. Nevertheless, little has been done in light of the choice of entry mode in the SME sector, especially for SMEs from developing countries. This study explored how Chinese <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> make their strategic market entry choices when entering the UK {{to address the issue of}} whether Western MNEs' foreign investment theories are applicable to Asian SMEs. The decision making of entry mode choices involves complicated social processes such as social relationships both in and outside the firm. This research takes a social constructionist paradigm, trying to understand and interpret the Chinese SMEs decision maker's unique experiences, perceived values and embedded Chinese culture that can have great impact on their choice of entry modes. Cohering with this philosophical stance, 10 Chinese <b>SMEs</b> <b>managers</b> in the North East of the England were involved in qualitative interviews and data was analysed through template analysis. The findings of this thesis offer a more holistic picture of SME managers' decision making in terms of their entry mode choices. This study is inconsistent with the more classic motives of firms' internationalisation, such as securing raw materials and seeking low-cost labour as it reveals 2 previously unrecognised motives of Chinese SMEs' internationalisation, namely `seeking entrepreneurial freedom' and 'building their own international teams'. Moreover, 4 entry modes were used by the Chinese SMEs' entering the North East of England markets, including direct exporting, joint venture and wholly-owned subsidiary and internet entry mode. Interestingly, the joint venture mode used by Chinese SMEs in this study is operationally different from traditional joint ventures. Furthermore, a number of influencing factors emerged from the Chinese SME managers' accounts: firm-specific factors, strategy-factors, product-specific factors, networks and social culture factors and the decision maker's personal characteristics. In drawing upon their motives, influencing factors, and entry modes a 3 -stage decision making process was discovered which combined rational and cybernetic strategic approaches that have been adopted by Chinese <b>SMEs</b> <b>managers</b> at different levels. Contributively, this study offers alternative understandings of the choice of entry mode. By drawing upon experiences of Chinese <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> it extends the foreign investment theories based on Western-MNEs and offers a contribution to practice grounded in an Asian-SME context. Significantly, this thesis develops a practice-based framework by integrating factors into the whole decision making process, providing practical guidance for <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> to inform their entry mode choices...|$|R

It has investigated the waste management practices that these SMEs employ, what motivates <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> to recycle, and about their relationship with their Waste Service Provider (WSP). This survey has shown good intentions of SME owner-managers to engage in environmental issues. These intentions could be capitalised upon if systems were in place (with their WSP) that would ‘nudge’ them to transform their intentions into actions, leading to better waste management practices...|$|R
40|$|Background: Given {{the limited}} {{available}} time of in-service professionals, {{the balance between}} the perceived importance of the course content and training needs {{is essential for the}} acceptance and attractiveness of training courses aimed at them. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to {{contribute to the development of}} entrepreneurship and business training programs for European <b>SME</b> <b>managers.</b> Methods/Approach: In six European countries a survey focusing on SME managers’ views on the importance of individual items from a list of potential course content items, and their training needs was carried out, and followed by an analysis using exploratory and multivariate techniques. It was aimed at identifying homogeneous groups of managers with common training needs and perceptions of content importance. Results: Homogeneous groups of managers who assign the same importance to certain competences and who have common training needs are identified. Conclusions: Results of our research could help training institutions to develop courses aimed at <b>SME</b> <b>managers.</b> The balancing approach proved to be an interesting method of combining conflicting requirements for the training course curriculum development...|$|R
30|$|We {{examined}} {{the recognition of}} service robots among <b>SME</b> <b>managers</b> and engineers to deepen mutual understanding {{with the aim of}} filling any gaps by matching seeds from academic research with the needs of industry. In parallel to this project, we established a local community-based collaboration system, which benefits from the resources of the Kanagawa Industrial Technology Center. Therefore, we aimed to spread the robotic technology to society from both soft- and hard-infrastructure support.|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the role of trust in SMEs’ ac-cess to a sufficient amount of bank credit to finance growth. The paper focuses on the SME per-spective, and measures trust and credit access as the <b>SME</b> <b>manager’s</b> subjective view. The empiri-cal analysis aims to find a link between an <b>SME</b> <b>manager’s</b> perception of the bank’s trustworthi-ness and the SME’s perceived access to a sufficient amount of credit for growth investments. Data and methodology The data collection was conducted through a survey among SMEs in Finland, identified from the Orbis database. The final sample consisted of 344 Finnish SMEs. The analysis was performed using binomial logistic regression, where the dependent variable was iden-tified as a dummy indicating whether or not the SME has access to enough bank funding for growth. The predictor variables consisted of a categorical measure of trust between the SME and the bank, as well as a set of control variables to account for the potential impact of traditional transaction lending and relationship lending indicators, as well as demographic factors. Empirical findings The results indicate that there is a statistically significant, positive rela-tionship between the level of trust between the bank and the SME and the SME’s access to a suffi-cient amount of credit to fund growth. The regression analysis shows that a one-unit increase in the <b>SME</b> <b>manager’s</b> perception of the bank’s trustworthiness leads on average to an 18. 6 % increase in the probability that the SME will have access to enough funding. Combined with the evidence from previous research, the findings suggest that SMEs should focus on developing and strength-ening the level of trust in their bank relationships, in order to improve their future credit access...|$|R
