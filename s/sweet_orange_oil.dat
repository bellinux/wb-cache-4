25|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> is a {{by-product}} of the juice industry produced by pressing the peel. It is used for flavoring food and drinks {{and also in the}} perfume industry and aromatherapy for its fragrance. <b>Sweet</b> <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> consists of approximately 90% D-limonene, a solvent used in various household chemicals, such as wood conditioners for furniture and—along with other citrus oils—detergents and hand cleansers. It is an efficient cleaning agent with a pleasant smell, promoted for being environmentally friendly and therefore, preferable to petrochemicals. D-limonene is, however, classified from slightly toxic to humans, to very toxic to marine life in different countries.|$|E
40|$|Female Mediterranean {{fruit flies}} (medfly) Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) {{perceive}} both {{qualitative and quantitative}} aspects of citrus fruit chemistry. However, the behavioural and biological adjustments of this response remain largely unknown. In the present study, the ovipositional responses of gravid female medflies to essential oils (i. e. the most critical resistance factor to medfly infestation) of various citrus fruits are investigated. In dual-choice (treatment versus distilled water control) experiments, females lay significantly more eggs into pre-punctured hollow oviposition hemispheres (domes) provided with 1 mu L of citrus peel oil from sweet orange, satsuma mandarin, bitter orange, grapefruit and lemon compared with odourless domes. No-choice tests show a weak effect of lemon essential oils in stimulating oviposition. The female ovipositional response to <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> (the most active in eliciting oviposition) is dose-dependent. Additionally, limonene, the most abundant chemical in all citrus oils, stimulates oviposition, whereas linalool, a representative compound of immature citrus fruit associated with high toxicity against immature stages of fruit flies, has a significant deterrent effect. In further no-choice tests, females lay approximately 23 % fewer eggs in limonene (93 %) (amount found in orange oil) and 60 % fewer eggs in limonene 93 % plus linalool 3 % (approximately 10 -fold the amount found in orange oil) mixtures, relative to <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> <b>oil.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} limonene content accounts largely (but not completely) for the ovipositional responses observed in <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> whereas high linalool proportions are capable of significantly masking and/or disrupting its stimulatory effects in citrus oils. The importance and practical implications of these findings with respect to understanding how citrus fruit chemistry influences the ovipositional responses of medfly is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} fraction composition of commercially produced sweet and bitter orange oil from fruit peels was studied using GC-MS. More than fifty components {{were identified in}} the oils using their mass spectra and linear retention indices. The monoterpene limonene was the most abundant component even though not in a quantity expected for a fresh orange essential oil. Aldehydes, followed by alcohols and esters, were the main components in the oxygenated fraction.

40|$|In 2014, {{global demand}} for {{essential}} oils was 165 kt {{and it is}} expected to grow 8. 5 % per annum up to 2022. Every year Australia produces approximately 1. 5 k tonnes of essential oils such as tea tree, orange, lavender, eucalyptus oil, etc. Usually essential oils come from non-fatty areas of plants such as the bark, roots, heartwood, leaves and the aromatic portions (flowers, fruits) of the plant. For example, orange oil is derived from orange peel using various extraction methods. Having similar properties to diesel, essential oils have become promising alternate fuels for diesel engines. The present study explores the opportunity of using <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> in a compression ignition engine. Blends of sweet orange oil-diesel (10 % <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> 90 % diesel) along with neat diesel fuel were used to operate a six-cylinder diesel engine (5. 9 litres, common rail, Euro-III, compression ratio 17. 3 : 1). Some key fuel properties such as: viscosity, density, heating value, and surface tension are presented. Engine performance (brake specific fuel consumption) and emission parameters (CO, NO X, and Particulate Matter) were measured to evaluate running with the blends. The engine was operated at 1500  rpm (maximum torque condition) with different loads. The results from the property analysis showed that sweet orange oil-diesel blend exhibits lower density, viscosity and surface tension and slightly higher calorific value compared to neat diesel fuel. Also, from the engine test, the sweet orange oil-diesel blend exhibited slightly higher brake specific fuel consumption, particulate mass and particulate number; however, the blend reduced the brake specific CO emission slightly and brake specific NO X emission significantly compared to that of neat diesel...|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that exposure to the commercial essential <b>oils</b> of bitter <b>orange,</b> mandarin orange, lemon and grapefruit confer to males a significant mating advantage as well. Likewise, exposure to peel-wounded mandarin oranges and lemons, and to peel-wounded <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> of the Merlin, Newhole and Naveline varieties, also conferred a significant mating advantage. Exposure to peel-wounded grapefruits and bitter oranges {{as well as to}} <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> of the local Greek variety Xino Artas enhanced mating success, however, not significantly. These results suggest that the chemicals responsible for mating enhancement in C. capitata are present in several citrus fruit species and varieties. In an experiment involving different doses of commercial <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil,</b> males exposed to medium doses of 12. 5 or 25 l achieved significantly higher numbers of matings with virgin females than control males. Lower doses did not increase mating success, whereas higher doses killed a number of males. In another experiment we tested the effect of the seven most abundant individual chemical compounds of citrus oil (some of them also existing in the pheromone of males) and detected compounds with some potential for further trials. In a final experiment we created a mixture of those compounds (geraniol, -pinene, limonene, -myrcene and linalool) and found that wild or sterile males exposed to it achieved over 70 % of all matings when competing with non-exposed males. Since the mixture did not contain -copaene (an expensive compound that is often invoked as responsible for the phenomenon of mating enhancement) our data could lead in a more cost-effective and efficient implementation of sterile insect technique (SIT) programmes against C. capitata...|$|R

The main vector of S. citri in Iran is the leafhopper Circulifer (Neoaliturus) haematoceps. For survey of <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> cul-tivars for citrus stubborn disease resistance, an experiment was conducted as factorial using randomized complete block design with three replications.

40|$|Protoplast fusion between <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> and mandarin/mandarin hybrids scion cultivars was {{performed}} following the model "diploid embryogenic callus protoplast + diploid mesophyll-derived protoplast". Protoplasts were isolated from embryogenic calli of 'Pera' and 'Westin' <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> cultivars (Citrus sinensis) and from young leaves of 'Fremont', Nules', and 'Thomas' mandarins (C. reticulata), and 'Nova' tangelo [C. reticulata x (C. paradisi x C. reticulata) ]. The regenerated plants were characterized {{based on their}} leaf morphology (thickness), ploidy level, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers. Plants were successfully generated only when 'Pera' <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> {{was used as the}} embryogenic parent. Fifteen plants were regenerated being 7 tetraploid and 8 diploid. Based on SSR molecular markers analyses all 7 tetraploid regenerated plants revealed to be allotetraploids (somatic hybrids), including 2 from the combination of 'Pera' <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> + 'Fremont' mandarin, 3 'Pera' <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> + 'Nules' mandarin, and 2 'Pera' <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> + 'Nova' tangelo, and all the diploid regenerated plants showed the 'Pera' <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> marker profile. Somatic hybrids were inoculated with Alternaria alternata and no disease symptoms were detected 96 h post-inoculation. This hybrid material {{has the potential to be}} used as a tetraploid parent in interploid crosses for citrus scion breeding.
