These stresses are alternating {{in nature and}} are caused by forces acting on the ring and by thermal gradients. The most significant stresses are caused by Hertzian contact pressure between the ring and <b>supporting</b> <b>roller.</b> Their highest value {{is not on the}} surface but slightly below it. These stresses are responsible for subsurface cracking and pitting damage of kiln ring and roller.

30|$|As for the R 2 R NIL process, {{an imprint}} roller with a {{patterned}} surface (or wrapped with a flexible mold) {{is used to}} imprint onto a flexible substrate on a <b>supporting</b> <b>roller</b> instead of a flat plate in R 2 P NIL processes. The entire process {{is based on the}} roll-to-roll manufacturing concept, which has the advantages of continuous process and high throughput [39, 40] and, hence, provides a highly promising solution for industrial-scale applications. While R 2 P methods have great advantages over conventional P 2 P NIL in terms of imprint force, throughput, and size of equipment, it still has several limitations in realizing a continuous imprinting process [36]. Even though studies have been conducted to allow continuous imprinting in R 2 P systems as observed in [36, 37], the throughput of the process remains lower in R 2 P NIL since time is needed to lift and return the imprint roller in position. This also requires an additional high-precision linear drive system for positioning and alignment, which makes it less favorable compared to R 2 R NIL.|$|E
40|$|The project {{which is}} {{presented}} in this report {{is focused on the}} positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> connected to the Kiln in one of the pelletizing plants in Kiruna at LKAB. Kiln is a rotating oven where the pellets are sintered, {{which is one of the}} steps in the pelletizing process. The <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are used to position Kiln in an axial or vertical direction, by either skewing the rollers or positioning the whole center of the rollers towards or away from the Kiln. The plan for this project is to be used as a preparatory work for a construction of an atomized system for adjustment of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> for Kiln at LKAB in Kiruna. An atomized adjustment system can possibly simplify the procedure of Kiln positioning, increase the lifespan of the system and increase the reliability of the whole system. This report can also lead to improvements by being used as a support during positioning of <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> A <b>support</b> system for Kiln positioning can contribute to avoid production disturbances. Product disturbances can occur because of damaged components such as damaged support wheels or parts of the Kiln driveline. Less production disturbances increases the availability of the Grate-Kiln plant and thereby increases the profitability for LKAB. The aim of this project has been to develop a calculation model which can show the reactions of Kiln when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted. The assignment was also to include the heating and cooling of Kiln and to have considerations regarding the gear contact in the driveline. One part of the assignment was also to document the damages that can occur because of inaccurate positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> The final step in this project was to propose optimized positions for the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> This project is the final assignment before examination from the M. Sc Student in Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Technology in Luleå LTU in Sweden. The main part of this project has been to develop a calculation model. The calculation model is built in a Matlab script. In this Matlab script there are essentially six parts of the script that can be varied, and these parts are:- The temperatures in the system- The dimensions of components- The load, with or without pellets- The positioning of the pellets in the Kiln - The skewing of the support rollers- The positioning of the center of the support rollersWhen these parameters are varied a result for over 170 parameters can be collected. The calculation model is mainly focused on how the forces in the system reacts when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted and also how the Kiln reacts to thermal expansion and contraction. It is essentially the center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> which is analyzed. The calculations of the forces which occur because of the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> was too complicated and time consuming to be able to be finished during this project. The calculations regarding the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been started and future work has been recommended. The calculation model, which is one of the results of this project has been used to analyze the reactions from positioning the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> By examine how great the height differences are for the Kiln, a maximum center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been recommended. This recommended maximum positioning is to protect any damages to the gear contact in the drive line. The thermal effects does not have a major impact on the forces in the system. Height differences that occur during heating and cooling of the Kiln has been noted up to about 9 mm. There is no great impact on the forces in the system during the interval which the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> can be adjusted without exceeding the maximum height differences. A validation of the results in this report is planned to be performed during the summer 2015. Validerat; 20150615 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} continuous transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered.

In particular, both conveyor and <b>supporting</b> <b>rollers</b> being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation.

40|$|Key words: {{continuous}} casting; round bloom; minimum mould exit {{shell thickness}}; foot roller designing Abstract: The minimum mould exit shell thickness (MEST) {{is one of}} key factors to consider for continuous casting machine design. Based on the shell strength at elevated temperatures, a concept of shell integral average strength, from its very top surface to the solidus frontier, has been introduced to judge its bulging tendency under ferrostatic pressure. Considering the contribution for the foot roller designing, a mathematic model for {{the determination of the}} minimum MEST has been brought forward. It is shown that, when the minimal foot roll pitch is fixed, the minimum MEST is steady. But at the same time, when the MEST does not exceed the minimum value, the round bloom off-round would happen, it is worse for the round bloom than the bulging for the normal strand. And there is the cross point with the curve of the minimum MEST by the minimum roll pitch and the minimum MEST by the fluting include angle of the <b>support</b> <b>roller</b> and the lateral <b>support</b> <b>roller</b> against the cross section...|$|R

Other dimensions are possible, but some dimensional requirements (on thickness, width and distance between <b>supporting</b> <b>rollers)</b> need to be fulfilled. In this research, to investigate the thickness effect further, in relation to stone structure and heterogeneity, eight different stones were tested: four with anisotropic features and four homogeneous. The distance between the <b>supporting</b> <b>rollers</b> was proportional to the specimens' length.

Transport {{of ground}} and coal {{at the surface}} coal dig in Kostolac, Serbia, is done using {{transportation}} belts (3 - 5 kilometres in length) using the systems of BTR (Bagger-Transporter-Remover) and BTM (Bagger-Transporter-Mill). The transporter belt during circular movement is suspended on carry-rollers (during transport of weight) and on support-rollers (without weight). Two or three carry-rollers, or three support-rollers make a garland. Garlands (5 carry and 3 supporting) are built into a section and they enable the movement of belt over them.
