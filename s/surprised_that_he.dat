Some were <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not pick the Ole Miss Rebels, for whom his father Archie played. He became Tennessee's all-time leading passer with 11,201yards and 89touchdowns and won 39 of 45 {{games as a}} starter, breaking the Southeastern Conference (SEC) record for career wins.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April The Observer (the Guardians sister paper) {{published}} the first photograph of Tomlinson {{lying on the}} ground next to riot police. Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base coach Steve Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome {{to come back to the}} Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent at the end of the 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
25|$|He awakens in a {{beautiful}} glade, which he recognizes {{as a place where}} he and Ann traveled. Understanding now that he has died, he is <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looks and feels alive, with apparently a physical body and sensations. After exploring the place for a while, he finds Albert, his cousin, who reveals himself as the unidentified man he had been seeing.|$|E
25|$|Another option {{available}} to the committee was to have allowed Collins to take his potential game-winning kick at a later date. Although the modern laws of the game allow a match to be abandoned after a delay of thirty minutes, this provision {{was not included in}} the laws of 1967. Collins himself said that he was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not allowed to return to take his kick the following day.|$|E

500|$|The 1985 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in Toronto, Ontario on June 15. [...] The Flames used their first round pick, 17th overall, on American defenceman Chris Biotti. [...] The team was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had fallen to them, believing Biotti {{to be the best}} defenceman {{available}} and expressing confidence he would be a star in the NHL. Their predictions ultimately proved unfounded. After spending two seasons at Harvard University, Biotti played three seasons for their minor league team in Salt Lake and another two in Europe before retiring. [...] He never appeared in a National Hockey League game.|$|E
500|$|... "Too Dizzy" [...] was {{the first}} song Bowie and new {{collaborator}} Erdal Kizilcay wrote together for the album, and was written in homage to the 50s. Bowie said [...] "a real Fifties subject matter was either love or jealousy, so I thought I’d stick with jealousy because it’s a lot more interesting". Bowie at the time called the song a [...] "throwaway" [...] and seemed <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> included it on the album. The song has been deleted from subsequent reissues of Never Let Me Down. Despite Bowie's dislike for the song, EMI briefly considered it for release as a fourth single from the album, and in fact it did appear as a promo release in the US.|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions {{announced}} that the next film {{would be based on}} an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. In June 2007 Marc Forster was confirmed as director. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen Casino Royale prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been humanised in that film, arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Forster found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be [...] "tight and fast... like a bullet".|$|E

500|$|Since the Reinanzaka House, Raymond {{had been}} {{interested}} {{in the work of}} Swiss architect Le Corbusier. He acknowledged that further contribution of Corbusier's ideas to the practice came in 1930, when Kunio Maekawa (who had just returned from two years working for Le Corbusier in his Paris Office) joined. He later applied Le Corbusier's ideas to vernacular Japanese architecture. Based upon Le Corbusier's unbuilt residential scheme for Mr. Errazuris in Chile, he designed a summer house for himself in Karuizawa, Nagano. Where Corbusier had used rough masonry and a tiled butterfly roof, Raymond used cedar with larch thatch. Although the design was criticised by an American reviewer for being a copy of Le Corbusier's design, the Frenchman was so flattered and <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> included a photo of it in the third volume of his Oeuvre complète: ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2007, Marc Forster was {{confirmed}} as director.

Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon. The director collaborated strongly with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, noting they only blocked two very expensive ideas he had. The director found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be [...] "tight and fast... like a bullet." ...|$|E
500|$|Raimi and {{the studio}} clashed {{several times during}} production. The first {{disagreement}} between the director and the executives stemmed from the latter's insistence on casting a [...] "Hollywood" [...] actor in the lead role instead of Raimi's long-time collaborator and friend Campbell. In his 2002 autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor, Campbell commented about {{how difficult it was}} working with more established producers; [...] "jumping into the big time meant dealing with the excruciatingly specific and alternately vague demands of a studio,... Hollywood executives took an interest in everything." [...] Campbell was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had to audition for the lead role, as {{he did not have to}} test for The Evil Dead. [...] Campbell and his photographer friend Mike Ditz used a 16 mm film camera and shot a scene to show to the producers. Upon viewing it, the producers asserted that [...] "Campbell will not star in this film". [...] In retaliation, Raimi lengthened a supporting role and gave it to Campbell: the character of Renaldo [...] "The Heel". This allowed for Campbell to be present through the production.|$|E
50|$|Zach Woodlee {{spent his}} early {{life in his}} mother’s dance studio in Mesquite. It should be no <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is now {{pursuing}} a career in acting. In the past year, he’s made some impressive progress.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to see him," [...] {{interrupted}} May, recovering herself, [...] "though I confess to some <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have forsaken Ireland so soon, after saying {{to me that it}} was a perfect paradise." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{came as a}} <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{should use}} the words [...] "it does n't pay," [...] for he {{had a kind of}} {{partially}} enamelled look, like that modern jewellery which really seems unconscious of its market value.|$|R
500|$|Pip, a {{chipmunk}} who {{can talk}} in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech {{in the real world}} so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from [...] "every conceivable angle", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, Maya and Furrocious. When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage. To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have. During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.|$|E
500|$|Shooting Schindler's List {{was deeply}} {{emotional}} for Spielberg, {{the subject matter}} forcing him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He {{was one of many}} crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz. Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker – he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie. Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp. Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Kraków for the duration of filming. He later thanked his wife [...] "for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row... when things just got too unbearable". Robin Williams called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set. Spielberg spent several hours each evening editing Jurassic Park, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.|$|E
500|$|Several themes {{ran through}} the reviews, {{one of which was}} the lack of focus on adult characters. IGN's Robert Canning—who rated [...] "Duets" [...] 8.5/10, {{signifying}} a great episode—felt that this contributed to its success, as it [...] "allowed for small but interesting character development to take place, even with some of the minor characters." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not miss the presence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester, but Hankinson, Semigran and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman all lamented her absence. The gay-centered storylines also attracted much commentary. Christie Keith of lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com suggested that [...] "Duets" [...] was [...] "the queerest episode of any series that's ever been on television". Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack wrote that Kurt [...] "stole the show in terms of pure emotional power" [...] and called him [...] "the most important character on television right now". USA Today Ann Oldenburg questioned whether Glee had gone [...] "too far" [...] by depicting a physical relationship between Santana and Brittany. Several reviewers appreciated the resultant development of Brittany's character: Poniewozik enjoyed the exploration of her [...] "basic loneliness", E! Online's Jenna Mullins was pleased to see more than her usual [...] "deadpanning and one-liners", and Wieselman called it a [...] "wonderful moment" [...] when she and Artie broke up, which led to the depiction of [...] "real feelings" [...] in Brittany for the first time. Canning found Brittany and Artie's coupling [...] "uneven" [...] and preferred her with Santana, as their development made them [...] "uniquely interesting and a blast to watch." [...] VanDerWerff conversely deemed Brittany's pairing with Artie [...] "one of the most resonant things the show's ever done".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, in 1909, Hogan {{relocated to}} Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he replaced local ball club manager Clarence [...] "Pop" [...] Foster, who had managed the Red Roses since 1907. [...] Once Hogan signed a contract, Foster {{moved on to}} lead another club in Trenton, New Jersey. [...] The Lancaster team's momentum escalated during the 1909 season, and in July of that year, Sporting Life reported that the Red Roses club was drawing positive attention. [...] "The fast pace at which the Lancaster bunch has been going lately has been {{the talk of the}} league", the paper stated. [...] "Marty Hogan was not given much consideration as a pennant aspirant when the season opened, but the plucky Red Roses manager has been 'sawing wood' and not talking". [...] Indeed, by the close of the 1909 season, the Lancaster Red Roses had worked up a 7539 record, seizing the championship of the Tri-State League. [...] As Spalding's Baseball Guide (1910) reported: [...] "Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting". [...] Sporting Life indicated that Hogan was confident of the outcome early in the season. [...] "After his return from the first trip around the circuit", wrote reporter G. H. Hartley, [...] "Marty said to your correspondent that he saw nothing in the league that was better than his team". [...] Hartley noted that, on the closing day of the season, Hogan accepted the Farnsworth Cup, [...] "the Tri-State trophy", on behalf of his team. [...] "Between the first and second innings the [...] players presented Manager Marty Hogan with a beautiful silver set and a silver loving cup", he added. [...] The inscribed silver cup reportedly left Hogan [...] "so <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unable to respond". [...] On September 7, 1909, one day after the contest, the Reading Eagle stated, [...] "A great crowd witnessed the final game, in which Hogan's gallant band trimmed the Trenton wanderers". [...] The newspaper added, [...] "The real enthusiasm was awakened, however, by the floating of the championship pennant, awarded by a Phila. [...] paper". [...] A key participant in the team's successful performance was a young pitcher named Stan Coveleski, who went on to post a record of 53 wins and 38 losses during his three seasons with Lancaster. He made his professional debut with the Philadelphia Athletics three seasons later. [...] Indeed, the Ogden Standard had praised Hogan as a [...] "live wire" [...] back in February 1909, when he [...] "grabbed up the three brothers of Harry Coveleski of the Phillies, and had them all sign contracts". [...] Highlights of the season may have included an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Phillies, which was scheduled to be held in Lancaster on April 2, 1909.|$|E
2500|$|Williams left Juilliard {{during his}} junior year in 1976 at the {{suggestion}} of Houseman, who said there was nothing more Juilliard could teach him.

No one was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left.|$|E
2500|$|Weizmann met Churchill on 4 November 1944 to {{urgently}} {{discuss the}} future of Palestine. [...] Churchill agreed that Partition was preferable for Israel over his White Paper.

However, when Lord Moyne, the British Governor of Palestine, met Churchill, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had changed his views in two years. Eleven days later Moyne was assassinated for his trenchant views on immigration in November 1944; the immigration question was put on hold.|$|E
