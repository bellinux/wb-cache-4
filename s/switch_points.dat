2500|$|The NTSB {{also stated}} that a {{railroad}} switch showed evidence of damage consistent with the Metrolink passenger train [...] "running through" [...] the trailing <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> while they were set to allow the freight train to proceed onto the adjacent track, forcing {{them out of the}} way. [...] "The switch bars were bent like a banana. It should be perfectly straight," [...] according to the NTSB official. The NTSB member in charge of the investigative team said they were also concerned with possible fatigue issues related to the engineer's split shift. The engineer worked an 11.5-hour shift split with a 3.5-hour break, leaving only nine hours away from work between workdays.|$|E
2500|$|While most DTC blocks {{are laid}} out back-to-back, the blocks {{actually}} do not touch at sidings. Instead, there is a [...] "gray area" [...] over the siding's switches, and the main track's and siding's DTC blocks begins at approximately the clearance point of the switch. The area over the switch must not be occupied unless authority is granted in blocks {{on both sides of}} the switch. For example, a train authorized only in Anna block must stop at the End Anna Block sign, which is a short distance from the <b>switch</b> <b>points.</b> A train authorized in Anna through Bess or in Anna through Bess Siding may proceed past the End Anna Block sign, over the switch, and then past the Begin Bess (or Bess Siding, as applicable) Block sign.|$|E

50|$|In a point {{gauntlet}} track, {{the rails}} {{for the two}} tracks {{do not need to}} cross, so no frog is required. The train taking the gauntlet runs over a set of <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> onto the parallel rails, passes through the gauntlet area, and passes over another set of <b>switch</b> <b>points</b> to return to the original line.

40|$|Abstract — Adaptive {{switching}} between multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission schemes like {{diversity and}} spatial multiplexing yields significantly higher capacity gains over fixed transmission schemes. Previous work {{has shown the}} impact of channel correlation and SNR on the switching between different schemes like beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper explores the influence of antenna geometry on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> between these transmission schemes. Closed-form expressions for the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> for a two element uniform linear array (ULA) {{as a function of}} antenna geometry and channel statistics are derived. The impact of the channel parameters and antenna geometry on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> is also shown by simulations. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the impact of varying antenna array configurations on the <b>switching</b> <b>points</b> between beamforming and spatial multiplexing. I...|$|R

50|$|Part of the {{internal}} mechanism involves a spring-loaded slider operating a set of <b>switch</b> <b>points.</b> As the film-advance lever is operated, this slider shoots up to its original position, hitting a small rubber pad at the top.

50|$|In Sweden, {{the passing}} loops are {{generally}} 750 m long, made for cargo trains. Passenger trains are usually much shorter, {{at least on}} most single track lines, less than 200 m.

50|$|Signals were {{originally}} controlled by levers {{situated at the}} signals, and later by levers grouped together and connected to the signal by wire cables, or pipes supported on rollers (US).
