5|$|When the {{reconstruction}} of Denmark's capital was begun a number of changes were introduced. A commission was appointed to regulate the streets. After surveyings among the ruins this commission submitted a suggestion to create 12 to 15-metre wide main <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> 10-metre wide side <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> none of the surrounding houses being half-timbered.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March, {{violence}} {{erupted in}} the Bekkersdal township in Gauteng, the scene of violent service delivery protests in 2013. Residents staged a protest over a planned ANC campaign in the area, barricading the <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> rocks and burning tyres and pelting ANC officials and police vehicles with stones. Police responded to the volatile situation by firing rubber bullets at residents.|$|E
5|$|On Monday morning, {{the storm}} had moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E
5|$|The chanté mas (masquerade song) {{tradition}} is based around pre-calypso Carnival music {{performed in a}} responsorial style by partygoers. The Dominican Carnival masquerade lasted for two days of parading through the <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> a singer dancing backwards {{in front of the}} drummer on a tanbou lélé. Chanté mas lyrics are traditionally based on gossip and scandal, and addressed the personal shortcomings of others.|$|E

5|$|Today, the {{existence}} of kulintang music is threatened by the influence of globalization, {{and the introduction of}} Western and foreign ideals into the region. Younger generations would rather listen to American music, or bike in the <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> other children than spend time practicing and imitating on the traditional instruments of their parents.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E

5|$|Columbia City station {{consists}} of two at-grade side platforms in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way between Edmunds and Alaska streets. The station is accessible from crosswalks at both <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> the platforms running the entire length between the two. At both of the station's entrances are ticket vending machines and an ORCA card reader; beyond that lies the partially covered platform and waiting area, which includes seating and public art. The station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson, and incorporates references to Craftsman-style homes that populate the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Heroes for Sale was {{directed}} by prolific pre-Code director William Wellman and featured silent film star Richard Barthelmess as a World War I veteran cast onto the <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> a morphine addiction from his hospital stay. In Wild Boys of the Road (1933), the young man played by Frankie Darrow leads a group of dispossessed juvenile drifters who frequently brawl with the police. Such gangs were common; around 250,000 youths traveled the country by hopping trains or hitchhiking in search of better economic circumstances in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In early 1855, {{less than}} twenty years after the colony was founded, South Australia's first horse tram began {{operating}} between Goolwa and Port Elliot on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams, and eventually the last to discard them for more modern public transport. Although two trials of street level trains were run, the state of Adelaide's <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> mud in winter and dust in summer, led to the decision {{that they would not}} be reliable.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan for}} {{gateways}} into the Jewellery Quarter was revived {{at the turn}} of the 21st century and three metal sculptures designed by Anuradha Patel, a local freelance artist, were unveiled on lamp posts at strategic location on Hall <b>Street</b> <b>with</b> Great Hampton <b>Street,</b> Newhall <b>Street</b> <b>with</b> Lionel <b>Street,</b> and Vyse <b>Street</b> <b>with</b> Great Hampton <b>Street</b> on 13 February 2003. The sculptures themselves were manufactured in the Jewellery Quarter by Form Fabrications (Birmingham) Limited. They are made from a variety of steel tubes and rods, which are rolled, bent and then welded together.|$|R

The station is accessible from crosswalks at both <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> the platforms running the entire length between the two. At both of the station's entrances are ticket vending machines and an ORCA card reader; beyond that lies the partially covered platform and waiting area, which includes seating and public art. The station also includes two public plazas at the northeast corners of both cross-streets, as well as eight public bicycle parking spots. Othello station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Princes Street was {{developed}} during Dunedin's 1860s boom from the Central Otago gold rush, and consequently {{is one of}} New Zealand's most historic <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> about 70 buildings in close proximity listed on the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Register. Originally {{the site of the}} city's wharf, a substantial area of land to the east of the street was formerly part of Otago Harbour, much of it reclaimed via rock removed during the lowering of Bell Hill which separated Princes Street from northern Dunedin {{in the early years of}} settlement. In the years following the gold rush, Princes Street was the heart of Dunedin's central business district, but much of the city's main retail area has now shifted north to George Street.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie prefers open {{areas such}} as grassland, fields and {{residential}} {{areas such as}} parks, gardens, golf courses, and <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly {{on the ground in}} these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E

5|$|The District {{is divided}} into four {{quadrants}} of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building. All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond {{with the number of}} blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.|$|E
5|$|The cult members, squeamish about {{committing}} acts of violence, {{decide that}} Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, they let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. The assassin chases {{her through the}} darkened <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> a switchblade, but she eludes him and returns to her apartment above Dante's. She briefly encounters her neighbor, Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), {{a young woman with}} a terminal illness. Mimi confesses to Jacqueline that she's afraid to die, and plans to have one last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself. The thud of the chair falling over is heard, but the sick woman does not recognize the sound as she leaves for the evening.|$|E

Church is seen throughout the video either playing with his band in a garage, {{in the middle of}} the street on a piano, or walking through the <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> an American flag around his shoulders while singing. The video ends without showing whether the girl and boy ended up together.|$|E
