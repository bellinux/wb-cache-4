5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|In 1191, monks at {{the abbey}} {{claimed to have}} found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere {{to the south of}} the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of {{contemporary}} historians including Giraldus Cambrensis. The remains were later moved and were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> this discovery was a pious forgery to substantiate the antiquity of Glastonbury's foundation, and increase its renown.|$|E

5|$|Some flower-feeding thrips {{pollinate}} {{the flowers}} they are feeding on, and some authors <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{they may have}} been among the first insects to evolve a pollinating relationship with their host plants. Scirtothrips dorsalis carries pollen of commercially important chili peppers. Darwin found that thrips could not be kept out by any netting when he conducted experiments by keeping away larger pollinators.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E

5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), was old enough to assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E

He began to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Both Allied and Japanese {{naval forces}} {{continued}} to converge on 22 August {{and both sides}} conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, however neither side spotted its adversary. The disappearance {{of at least one}} of their scouting aircraft (shot down by aircraft from Enterprise before it could send a radio report), caused the Japanese to strongly <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S., however, was unaware of the disposition and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces.|$|E

5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Fantasy Records {{had failed}} to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although {{it is reasonable to}} <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{a further}} 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E
