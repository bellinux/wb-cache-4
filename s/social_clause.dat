50|$|A {{solution}} that is widely talked about by some trade unionists {{and human rights}} groups is the incorporation of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> into the WTO Agreement.

50|$|Within the {{international}} system {{it is difficult to}} enforce international law, particularly with regard to human rights. So using trade sanctions as a coercive measure is an appealing prospect to ensure cooperation. However, there are many reasons why trade sanctions are an inappropriate mechanism for enforcing labour standards. They are generally against WTO principles, and can only be used in very limited circumstances that are authorized by the WTO agreements, such as anti-dumping and countervailing measures. Politically, it is unlikely that unilateral action would be allowed for breaches of labour standards. Even assuming that labour standards are able to be enforced through trade measures within the WTO, either through amendments to GATT XX, the introduction of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> or any other measure, they do not provide a solution to the complexity of the labour standards issue and should not be used to deal with disputes over labour standards.|$|E

The analysis suggests that the ILO’s shift to ‘promotional principles’ and the formal acceptance of voluntary self-regulation from the late- 1990 s has not significantly improved the situation for workers, but was a pragmatic response driven in part by US policy and the increasing marginalization of the ILO within the global system of economic governance. It is argued that even if the many political obstacles could be overcome, the result of including <b>social</b> <b>clauses</b> in WTO trade agreements may not be straightforward.

40|$|Competition between {{countries}} has rapidly {{increased in the}} current context of economic globalization. Both indirect competition (through trade) and direct competition (through illegal immigration) can breed social dumping, exerting downward pressure on labor conditions in developed countries. In this paper we show {{the need for a}} <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in order to prevent firms from illegally obtaining a comparative advantage. The adoption of a <b>social</b> <b>clause,</b> based on agreed labour rights by all signatories to ILO Conventions and on the compliance by multinationals, would eliminate social dumping. Linking labor standards and trade at the multilateral level has received a lot of criticism. Some claim that this is just another strategy to masquerade the protectionist ambitions of developed countries. We believe that it should be adopted at the multilateral level in order to favor an ethical behavior in both trade and investment. This is particularly crucial for less developed countries that have inserted themselves in the international economy. A balanced analysis of the arguments in favor and against the adoption of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> reveals that there is a patent need for an international harmonization of workers' rights regardless of the instruments. ...|$|E
40|$|Trade and labour standards: Child labour. This report, {{commissioned}} by Save the Children, Norway, discusses the main economic arguments {{for and against}} the incorporation of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in World Trade Organization (WTO). Part one presents a historical review of how the question has been addressed in ILO and WTO, and {{the positions of the}} main actors involved are stated. ILO is generally disinclined to imposing trade sanctions against countries not fulfilling their obligations in terms of ILO regulations, and the ILO Convention 138 on Minimum Age is not included in ILO's core labour standards. The second part of the report analyses the main arguments in favour of including a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in WTO. It is argued that international coordination of labour standards, in contrast to their harmonisation, may improve welfare in developing countries. However, trade sanctions against countries violating the rules will probably not be credible since such sanctions would most likely damage the target group as well as the legitimacy of WTO. Without the credible enforcement of the rules, a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> would most likely be merely symbolic. The report argues that it would probably be more efficient to strengthen ILO...|$|E
40|$|The Authors are {{grateful}} to Heinz Hauser and participants of a doctoral workshop at the World Trade Institute The integration of core labour standards into the WTO has been demanded mostly on either humanitarian or fair trade grounds. While both reasons can be justified theoretically, the case for integration remains unclear. Whereas the humanitarian integration of core labour standards {{is a question of}} means, the fair trade reasoning is a question of empirical relevance. This paper contributes to both questions by estimating the effects of a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in a standard computable general equilibrium model of world trade (GTAP). Our finding is that developed countries have little incentive for protectionist misuse of a <b>social</b> <b>clause,</b> since humanitarian trade sanctions hardly reduce their import pressure. Furthermore, even a drastic reduction of child labour in developing countries only has a marginal effect on north-south trade flows. Therefore, calls for a better enforcement of labour standards in the south to correct vertical distribution effects of world trade in the north are not supported by our findings. However, in light of possible trade liberalization-enhancing effects and only a limited danger of protectionist misuse, a multilateral humanitarian <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> could be a...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article aims {{to catch}} some aspects {{regarding}} {{the evolution of}} Romanian labour force occupation in the last 24 years {{in the context of}} ownership restructuring. In Romania, this process proved to be a particular problem, with major impact in all areas such as economic, social, environmental, cultural, education. The ownership restructuring process results were the basic premise of the acknowledgement of market economy in Romania, of the market and its mechanisms. The transition from a centralized, planned economy based on control principles to an economy based on market principles meant radical changes of the entire inherited building structures, thus on the labour force occupation. Once Romania joined the European Union, we had to get in line with the European standards and social policies, the first steps requiring the abandon of the <b>social</b> <b>clauses</b> included in the shares selling contracts of the Romanian state-owned companies. We will try to analyze what were the effects of ownership restructuring over the economic activities of privatized companies, if the maintenance of <b>social</b> <b>clauses</b> lead to labour force distortion with effects on the labour force occupation, to a deficiency in implementing effectiveness in economic activities or even business closures...|$|R

40|$|An {{agreement}} on {{the inclusion of a}} <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the World Trade Organization‟s (WTO) multilateral trade agreements largely depends on reassuring objecting member states that such inclusion will contribute to an improved recognition of core labour standards in trade, without altering the competitive advantage of one trading partner over another. Reassurance must be given to the effect that incorporating a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO legal framework would not be used as a trade restricting mechanism which might have direct, negative effects on the development of countries worldwide. Such an argument may not be won easily from a legal and economic perspective. There is an omnipresent conflict at the international level between the basic values underlying multilateral trade agreements and principles governing the protection of core labour standards. On the one hand, supporting the stance of free trade is the fundamental force of profit maximization while on the other hand, and in direct opposition to this market driven value system, are human rights-based calls for recognising core labour standards in employment matters related to trade. Increased international trade is a powerful tool for tackling poverty and social misery worldwide. It could thus be important to adopt a legal framework in the multilateral trade system to harness potential opportunities a trade-labour linkage could provide. In that case, the legal questions of whether or not there should be a tradeoff between the right to trade and compliance with core labour standards and whether a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO would achieve this purpose had to be addressed. However, without a compatible underpinning legal framework of universally accepted trade-labour standards, incorporating a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO would be a misplaced legal objective which is unachievable as it could lead to a conflict between the WTO and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and at most could create a legal fiction whose results may not be positively measurable. Setting two international legal norms at conflict with each other is systematically studied as a conflict in which the values of the global market economy are in a supposed confrontation with those protecting core labour standards as human rights. Therefore, this study undertook a contemporary legal analysis of the possibilities and challenges of incorporating a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO for purposes of entrenching the protection of core labour standards. It put forward arguments and tentative proposals for a trade-labour linkage legal framework which could dispel calls for excluding a <b>social</b> <b>clause</b> in the WTO...|$|E
