Clearly, the stock market is not a sideshow. Second, the time series variation in the investment cash flow sensitivity is affected more by changes in monetary policy than by shifts in collateral values. Third, asset price shocks primarily affect firms that rely more on bank financing and not necessarily those that use equity financing. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{if there}} is a {{different}} impact from changes in "new" and "old" economy <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> on private consumption. Estimating a reduced-form VAR for seven OECD countries for the 1990 s, it is found that the impact from changes in old economy <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> on consumption is in general larger in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom than in continental Europe. Furthermore, the impact from changes in new economy valuations to consumption is roughly the same in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom and in continental Europe. Finally, the results suggest that in continental Europe the impact on consumption from changes in the valuation of new economy stocks is bigger than from the old economy stocks, whereas for the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom the impact is {{more or less the same}} between the two sectors. ...|$|R

Specifically, the worse that firms perform, the higher are their valuation ratios. Given the significance of the stock market for allocating investment funds in China, the findings from this paper suggest that China's stock market development might produce an inefficient resource allocation and cause detrimental effects on the real economy.

40|$|What is {{the driving}} force behind the {{cyclical}} behavior of unemployment and vacancies? What is the relation between job creation incentives of firms and <b>stock</b> market <b>valuations?</b> This paper proposes an explanation of labor market volatility based on time-varying risk, modeled as a small and variable probability of an economic disaster. A high probability of a disaster implies greater risk and lower future growth, which lowers the incentives of firms to invest in hiring. At these times, <b>stock</b> market <b>valuations</b> are low and unemployment rises. The presence of disaster risk generates a realistic equity premium, while time-variation in the disaster probability can generate the correct magnitude for volatility in vacancies and unemployment. The model can thus explain the comovement of unemployment and <b>stock</b> market <b>valuations</b> present in the data...|$|R
