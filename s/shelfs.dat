40|$|The {{physical}} and biological structure of coral reef habitats vary {{in relation to}} depth and {{the profile of the}} reef, from vertical walls to gentle slopes. The differing roles of depth and reef profile on fish distribution and abundance, and the role of habitat structure in explaining these patterns, have received little attention. Here these effects were distinguished by surveying reef fish species and benthic habitat in quadrats on three aspects (shelf, slope and wall) at each of two depths (5 m and 15 m) in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Both depth and reef profile accounted for considerable variation in reef fish communities. Species diversity and richness was highest on the shelf profile and lowest on the wall profile at 5 m. Whereas, at 15 m the opposite was true with the wall profile being the most diverse and species rich profile and the shelf being the least. Wall habitats were the most different from the other two profiles in terms of community structure. Depth had a greater influence on fish communities on slope and shelf habitats, with shallow slopes and <b>shelfs</b> similar to one another, and deep slopes and <b>shelfs</b> also similar. Some rare species, such as Chromis delta and Pictichromis paccagnellae, were restricted only to walls. The relative effects of depth and reef profile on benthic habitat structure were similar to the fish communities, with the sponge and encrusting coral dominated wall habitats being the most dissimilar to the other aspects, with clear depth patterns also. There was a significant correlation between the fish communities present and the habitat availability at the depths and on the reef profiles studied. The correlation was best explained by sand, branching coral, encrusting coral, massive coral and rubble. Depth and reef profile had a significant interaction, which suggests that, clearly, both depth and profile are important factors affecting reef fish communities.

40|$|The last {{deglaciation}} {{was characterized}} by rising concentration in atmospheric CO 2 (CO 2 atm) {{and a decrease in}} its radiocarbon content (Δ 14 Catm). Mobilization of 14 C-depleted terrestrial organic carbon, which was previously frozen in extensive boreal permafrost soils, might have contributed to both changes, and was potentially caused by coastal erosion during deglacial sea-level rise and warming. Since parts of this potentially mobilized organic carbon was reburied in marine sediments, records of accumulation of terrigenous biomarkers and their compound-specific radiocarbon ages can provide insights into the timing and controls on permafrost decomposition. We present data from three marine sediment cores, two cores off the Amur River draining into the Sea of Okhotsk, and one core from the Northeastern Bering Sea adjacent to the Bering shelf (one the largest shelf areas flooded during the deglaciation) receiving input from the Yukon River. During the Last Glacial Maximum all catchments were completely covered with permafrost. Today, the Amur drainage basin is free of permafrost while the Yukon catchment is covered by discontinuous permafrost. All sites show three distinct deglacial maxima (at 16. 5, 14. 5, 11. 5 ka BP) in accumulation of old terrigenous biomarkers (5 - 20 kyr old at the time of deposition). The peaks occurred during meltwater pulses suggesting that sea-level rise remobilized old terrestrial carbon from permafrost on the flooded <b>shelfs.</b> In the Bering Sea fossil, mature organic matter, mobilized by erosion of organic rich rocks during the retreat of Brooks Range glaciers and the Laurentide ice sheet additionally contributed to the first peak via increased fluvial runoff. Deglacial changes in abundance ratios of long-chain n-alkanes record gradual changes in vegetation type and wetland extent in the Amur-river catchment. Since wetland expansion is closely linked to permafrost thaw this implies that permafrost decomposition in the Amur drainage basin was a gradual process. By contrast sea-level rise caused abrupt decomposition events across the Okhotsk and Bering <b>Shelfs.</b> We extrapolate our localized findings to an overall potential carbon release during deglaciation of 285 PgC from coastal erosion in the Arctic Ocean and the related permafrost decomposition. By analysing some idealized scenarios using the global carbon cycle model BICYCLE we estimate the impact of such a release on the atmosphere. We find that it might have accounted for a deglacial rise in CO 2 atm of up to 15 ppm, and to a decline in ∆ 14 Catm of 15 ‰. These results, if restricted to the three peak events connected to rapid sea-level rise, as supported by our data, might have contributed particularly to abrupt changes in CO 2 atm and ∆ 14 Catm, corresponding to 15 - 20 % of both, the observed rise in CO 2 atm of ~ 90 ppm, and the residual in ∆ 14 Catm that is unexplained by changes in the 14 C production rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: The {{ability of}} {{internal}} tides to resuspend and advect sediment over continental <b>shelfs</b> and slope regions is investigated by applying an internal wave and sediment transport model. Numerical experiments are carried out, firstly, with {{the ratio of}} bathymetry and internal waves characteristics creating critical, subcritical, and supercritical conditions, and secondly, for an observed section of the Australian North West Shelf. In the former cases, the model is forced with an internal tide propagating through the model domain. The latter application involves forcing by a barotropic tide which in turn generates internal waves at the shelf slope. Internal wave generated bottom layer shear stresses are large enough to resuspend sediment. The application of a turbulence closure scheme results in the creation and maintenance of a thin nepheloid layer. The thickness of the suspended sediment layer is controlled by vertical diffusion which is large within the bottom boundary layer, but very small outside. The residual velocity and the asymmetry associated with the velocity field, result in both down- and upslope net suspended sediment fluxes, and deposition of resuspended material onto the shelf. These suspended sediment fluxes are largest for critical bottom slopes. The parting point between down- and upslope net sediment flux {{is found to be}} sensitive to the formulation of vertical mixing with the parting point moving downslope for increased mixing. At the Australian North West Shelf, near the shelf break and upper slope, the net flux of resuspended material is influenced by both the barotropic and internal tide. The phase relationship in bottom layer shear stresses generated from those two tides causes regions of both enhancement and reduction in the resuspension rates and net suspended sediment fluxes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractComprehensive {{studies of}} rigid {{structure}} responses to seismic ground excitations have been reported. It {{was found that}} the rocking and sliding response of a rigid structure is highly nonlinear. The structure stability depends on the structure slenderness, as well as the ground motion amplitude, frequency and duration. Compared to an earthquake ground motion, ground shock induced by underground or surface explosion has very large amplitude, high frequency and short duration. Moreover, vertical component of a ground shock may be substantially larger than the gravitational acceleration g. This will cause the unanchored rigid structure jump or fly into air. Therefore, the responses and stability regions of a rigid structure to blast induced ground shock will be very different from those under seismic ground motions. No study of rigid structure response to ground shock of amplitude more than 1. 0 g {{can be found in the}} literature. As there might be many rigid structures such as computers, document <b>shelfs,</b> and other important equipments in a building or a military command center close to an explosion center, understanding rigid structure response to ground shock is essential for protection of such equipments.

Particular attentions are paid to the case when the vertical ground shock is more than 1. 0 g and the rigid structure flies into the air.

Northern and southern phytoplankton communities on the <b>shelf</b> were approximately 15 % dissimilar while there was no latitudinal gradient for stations along the slope current, suggesting this current provided south to north connectivity. Fitting environmental data to phytoplankton ordination showed a significant relationship between phytoplankton community dissimilarities and nutrient concentrations and light availability on the <b>shelf</b> compared to <b>shelf</b> break and oceanic stations in the study area...|$|R
