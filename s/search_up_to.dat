500|$|Revised {{estimates}} of the radar track and the aircraft's remaining fuel led to a move of the search [...] north-east of the previous area on 28 March, which was followed by another shift on 4 April. Between 2 and 17 April an {{effort was made to}} detect the underwater locator beacons (ULBs; informally known as [...] "pingers") attached to the aircraft's flight recorders, whose batteries were expected to expire around 7 April. Australian naval cutter ADV Ocean Shield equipped with a towed pinger locator (TPL); China's Haixun 01 equipped with a hand-held hydrophone; and the Royal Navy's HMS Echo equipped with a hull-mounted hydrophone; were utilized in the search. Operators considered it a shot in the dark, when comparing the vast search area with the fact that a TPL could only <b>search</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...] per day. Between 4–8 April several acoustic detections were made that were close to the frequency and rhythm of the sound emitted by the flight recorders' ULBs; analysis of the acoustic detections determined that, although unlikely, the detections could have come from a damaged ULB. A sonar search of the sea-floor near the detections was carried out between 14 April and 28 May without any sign of Flight 370. In a March 2015 report, it was revealed that the calendar life of the battery for the ULB attached to Flight 370's flight data recorder had expired in December 2012 and may not have been as capable.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the likely}} {{presence}} of a significant force nearby the Australians remained cautious as they searched for the Viet Cong. Over {{the next two days}} they continued to clear the battlefield, uncovering more dead as they did so. Yet with up to two Viet Cong battalions still believed to be in the area and the continued vulnerability of Nui Dat to attack from the 274th Regiment, Jackson lacked the resources to pursue the withdrawing force. Company patrols continued to <b>search</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...] east, and to the north of Nui Dat 2. The search area was subsequently expanded to include that contested during Operation Hobart. Several tracks were found with telephone cables running along them, as well as further drag marks, blood stains, discarded equipment, fresh graves and evidence of use by heavy cart and foot traffic. The main Viet Cong withdrawal route was discovered after midday on 19 August, moving east away from the scene of the fighting. Townsend requested permission to follow it believing he had sufficient forces, but Jackson would only permit 6 RAR to advance a further [...] to remain within artillery cover, and would not allow the guns to move forward to increase the range of their protective fire. By 20 August the Australians had counted 245 Viet Cong dead, while scores more were found later. Up to four weeks after the battle decomposed bodies were found in the area, while numerous graves were also located, none of which were included in the estimates of Viet Cong losses. The bodies found later brought the total to about 300 dead. D Company, 5 RAR returned to Nui Dat early on 21 August, while D Company, 6 RAR was also withdrawn for two days leave in Vung Tau.|$|E

50|$|Fruit bats are an {{extremely}} popular type of bat {{that can also}} be called megabats. The bats originate from tropical regions of the Old World. They don't hibernate and since they dislike the cold, tropical regions suit them best. Fruit bats diet includes fruit and nectar. During their Circadian flight, fruit bats gather 1.5 to 3 times their body weight in food. Certain types of fruit bats have short jaws and powerful teeth to pierce into fruit. Others have long tongues and snouts to reach pollen and nectar. They can <b>search</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30 mi to find food. Some types of fruit bats can have a 5 feet wing span, the largest of all bats. Other fruit bats only have a 6 centimeter long wing span. All but a few types of fruit bats are nocturnal. The ones occupying The Monfort Bat Sanctuary are nocturnal. These bats are quite rare because they are killed for food. Other predators include crows, rats, 10 ft-long pythons, and lizards. Usually fruit bats can survive these creature attacks. Their major predators are feral dogs and cats.|$|E
