They also needed to chase down the target set by Zimbabwe within 40.5 overs to ensure a slot in the Finals {{on the basis of}} Net run rate. India managed to chase the target within 40 overs thereby, moving into the Finals. South Africa beat India in the Finals to clinch the trophy.|$|E

Atlantis: Scenarios and Variants was published in 2005. Atlantis is a boxed set which collected a number of scenarios and variants published in gaming magazines and at conventions, such as The Volcano and The Great River.

25|$|The title-winning team owed {{a lot to}} the midfield. The {{side had}} little {{international}} talent in attack or defence (although full backs Tony Dorigo and Mel Sterland were both full internationals) and so much of the onus was on Strachan, McAllister, Wales international Speed and England's Batty to provide that required class. The quality of the midfield was that any of the four could <b>slot</b> <b>into</b> whichever area they needed to be in, be it left, right or centre, though Batty tended to be the holding midfield player whilst McAllister, Strachan and Speed provided the creativity. McAllister's dead-ball skills were also utilised by top-scorer Lee Chapman, who scored the majority of his goals from headers and thrived off the service provided by McAllister and Strachan's free kicks.|$|E
25|$|A {{charging}} grip {{is available}} for the Joy-Con, which provides a means to attach a USB-C cable for power. Alongside that, Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy-Con via embedded AA batteries. Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can <b>slot</b> <b>into,</b> allowing it {{to be used for}} racing games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch supports the wireless Pro Controller, which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller. As of Switch System Software 3.0.0 a setting can be turned on to use the controller in wired USB mode, however currently this will disable the NFC touchpoint. Standalone Docks are available, which include the power adapter and HDMI cable. Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors. The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers attached via USB with the Wii U GameCube adapter.|$|E
25|$|Applications for car stereos varied widely. Auto {{manufacturers}} in the U.S. typically would fit a cassette <b>slot</b> <b>into</b> their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation {{would have a}} Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track cartridge obsolete in car installations because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, {{as the cost of}} building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered a CD player. The CD player eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket cassette players, and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable cassette players, but 2011 was the first model year for which no manufacturer offered factory-installed cassette players.|$|E

500|$|The 37-inch {{cyclotron}} at Berkeley was dismantled on 24 November 1941, and its magnet used {{to create}} the first calutron. Its name came from California University and cyclotron. The work was initially funded by the Radiation Laboratory from its own resources, with a $5,000 grant from the Research Corporation. In December Lawrence received a $400,000 grant from the S-1 Uranium Committee. The calutron consisted of an ion source, {{in the form of}} a box with a slit in it and hot filaments inside. Uranium tetrachloride was ionized by the filament, and then passed through a [...] <b>slot</b> <b>into</b> a vacuum chamber. The magnet was then used to deflect the ion beam by 180°.

2500|$|For centuries, {{through the}} 19th century, {{the common law}} {{recognized}} only specific forms of action, and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a writ) to <b>slot</b> <b>into</b> exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment. To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific [...] "magic words" [...] encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a pro se ("for oneself," [...] without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting {{at the outset of}} a case over minor wording issues.|$|E
2500|$|These {{are stored}} in pockets built into the {{buoyancy}} control device. Often a velcro flap or plastic clip holds the weights in place. The weights may also be contained in zippered or velcroed pouches that <b>slot</b> <b>into</b> special pockets in the BCD. [...] The weight pouches often have handles, which must be pulled to drop the weights in an emergency or to remove the weights when exiting the water. Some designs also have smaller [...] "trim pouches" [...] located higher in the BCD, which may help the diver maintain neutral attitude in the water. Trim pouches typically can not be ditched quickly, and are designed to hold only 1-2 pounds (0.5–1kg) each. Many integrated systems cannot carry as much weight as a separate weight belt: a typical capacity is 6kg per pocket, with two pockets available. This may {{not be sufficient to}} counteract the buoyancy of dry suits with thick undergarments used in cold water.|$|E

2500|$|Meigle 2 stands nearly [...] high. It has a {{cross on}} one side and depicts Daniel in the lions' den on the other. The form of the head of the cross is {{possibly}} based on that of a jewelled metal cross and is unique. The projecting boss at the centre of the cross has eight smaller bosses around it that probably symbolise the eight days of Passion Week running from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday inclusive. The shaft of the cross contains three pairs of sculpted animals facing each other, with interlaced tails and tongues, while other beasts fill the space between the cross and the outer border of the monument. The monument is the work of a master sculptor with the figures being cut in deep relief and arranged in an orderly fashion. Meigle 2 has projecting tenons on its top and sides and was probably intended to <b>slot</b> <b>into</b> a screen or wall. Local folklore holds that the representation of Daniel in the lions' den depicts King Arthur's wife Guinevere, known locally as Vanora. She was abducted by King Mordred and condemned by Arthur to be torn apart by wild beasts. The monument was said to mark her grave. Meigle 2 was originally located {{on the east side of}} the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 1, and in front of a mound identified in local folklore as Vanora's Grave. Apart from the scene representing Daniel (or Vanora), the back of the monument also contains various other sections. These include a mounted huntsman with two hounds at the top, with an angel hovering above the dogs. Below this there is a procession of four horsemen, with three leading the fourth, who is distinguished by a large saddlecloth. The next row down is the Biblical Daniel scene, below this is a centaur holding an axe in each hand and branches trailing behind him. The lowest section depicts a beast grasping an ox, a club-wielding human figure is positioned behind the aggressor. The stone has lost some detail due to erosion, although this is concentrated at the lower part of the cross itself and suggests that some form of human activity regularly caused abrasion of that portion - the opposite side being less worn.|$|E
