40|$|Children with {{spina bifida}} (SB) often require special education. To date, little {{information}} is available about the educational career of these children. This study focuses on educational career and predictors of attending special education of young adults with SB, using a cross-sectional study including 178 young Dutch adults with SB aged from 16 - 25. The main outcome was attending regular versus special education. For searching predictive power we selected age, gender, type of SB, level of lesion, hydrocephalus (HC), number of surgical interventions, ambulation, continence and cognitive functioning. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression {{were used in the}} data analysis. Participants with HC attended special primary education more often (59 %) than participants without HC (17 %). For those participants with HC, the necessity of special primary education was associated with below average intelligence (75 % versus 35 %), wheelchair dependence (82 % versus 39 %) and surgical interventions (74 % versus 44 %). Only half of the participants with HC followed regular secondary education, whereas for participants with SB without HC, the outcome in secondary education was {{similar to that of the}} general population (92 %).

40|$|Chapter 1 {{introduces}} the key concepts {{and the broader}} context of this thesis and presents its aims, research questions and the methodology of the studies. The studies originate from the need of schools for practical training and schools for <b>special</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> {{to know more about}} the chronic diseases of their pupils with ID and about the impact of these diseases on their emotional and behavioural functioning. Schools for practical training and schools for <b>special</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> prepare pupils for entering the labour market and for participation in society. They need information on whether and to what degree ID-adolescents have additional chronic diseases because both ID and chronic diseases can lead to limitations in adolescents’ capacities. Capacities seem to be particularly limited in case of emotional and behavioural problems. In addition, limited capacities can have a profound effect on participation of ID-adolescents in educational programs, occupational opportunities and societal participation. However, evidence on the prevalence rates of chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and the impact on their emotional and behavioural functioning was limited. The aims of this thesis were: (1) to explore the prevalence of chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and the impact on their behaviour; and (2) to assess the knowledge about chronic diseases in ID-adolescents among teachers working in schools for practical training and special secondary schools. These goals were translated in the following five research questions: 1. What is known in the literature on the prevalence rates of chronic diseases in populations of children with ID? 2. What is the prevalence of chronic diseases in ID-adolescents aged 12 – 18 years in two provinces in the north of the Netherlands, Groningen and Drenthe (total population of about 1. 1 million people) ? 3. What is the concordance between the knowledge teachers have on the presence of chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and the knowledge of parents and healthcare professionals? 4. What is the association between chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and their emotional and behavioural functioning? 5. What is the association between chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and the full range of pervasive developmental disorder behaviour?...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyCurriculum and InstructionJeong-Hee KimThis phenomenological {{case study}} focuses on three <b>secondary</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> students’ {{perceptions}} {{of themselves and}} their lived experiences. The {{purpose of this study is}} twofold: First, to understand how <b>secondary</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> students perceive themselves as literate beings; and second, to illuminate how <b>secondary</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> students understand what it means to be literate and how their lived experiences have shaped their perceptions of being literate. Based on qualitative data, such as, interviews, observations, questionnaire, and a qualitive analysis method, called Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis, I have identified three themes of the lived experiences of the participants: 1) Students’ stability and/or instability of their lived experiences influenced their literacy practices; 2) Being identified as special education students did not prevent them from being literate; and 3) Different lived experiences led to different literacy practices. Based on these themes, I provide implications for educators and policy makers including: understanding <b>secondary</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> (SSE) students as literate beings; valuing the varied experiences that SSE students bring to classrooms; capitalizing on SSE students’ self-efficacy and resilience to promote students’ literacy; respecting SSE students’ literacy skills on out-of-school literacy; paying attention to the personal dimensions of literacy practices to meet the needs of the diverse learners; allowing SSE students to demonstrate their literacies in multiple ways; and collaborating between general education and special education teachers to benefit all students. The significance of this study resides in that it focuses on the literacy practices of <b>secondary</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> students, whose voices have been largely missing in the literature. This understanding of the voice and the lived experiences that <b>secondary</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> students bring to the classroom will help educators, policy makers, and curriculum writers find ways to better serve special education students. In so doing, this study reconceptualizes the power of literacy that needs to be fostered in SSE students, so that they can succeed not only in college and career but also in their personal lives...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the bi-directional prospective link between automatic alcohol-approach tendencies and alcohol use {{in a group of}} young adolescents (mean age = 13. 6 years). The adolescents {{in the present study were}} assumed to be at-risk of early alcohol use and later problem drinking. It was hypothesized that alcohol use and automatic approach tendencies would reinforce one another particularly in the absence of well-developed inhibition skills. Methods: A total of 347 adolescents (N = 279 at follow-up) from <b>special</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education,</b> a risk group for the development of substance use problems, participated in the study. Automatic approach tendencies were assessed with the alcohol-approach avoidance task, inhibition skills were assessed with the Stroop task, and alcohol used was measured using a self-report measure. Results: Zero-inflated Poisson analysis revealed a significant effect of automatic approach tendencies predicting alcohol use 6 months later, although only for adolescents with weaker inhibition skills. Conclusions: Automatic approach tendencies predict future drinking behavior of young adolescents with relatively weak inhibition skills. The findings of the present study have important implications for alcohol interventions for adolescents. Results are discussed in terms of risk factors for the development of problematic alcohol use in young adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} participation {{restrictions of}} young adults with spina bifida (SB) in relation to health condition and activity limitations. Method. A total of 179 persons aged 16 - 25 years and born with SB participated in a cross-sectional study. The main outcome on four domains of participation (independent living, employment, education and partner relationships) was assessed using a structured questionnaire. Results. At {{the mean age of}} 21 years only 16 % were living independently, {{more than one-third of the}} participants went to <b>special</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education,</b> 53 %, of those who finished education did not have a regular job and 71 %, did not have a partner. Health condition variables (type of SB, hydrocephalus and level of lesion) and to a lesser extent activity limitations (wheelchair dependence and incontinence) were significant determinants for having participation restrictions. Perceived hindrances in participation included long-distance transportation (19 - 36 %), accessibility (10 - 42 %), physical impairments (22 - 40 %), emotional barriers (20 - 32 %) and financial limits (3 - 17 %,). More severe SB, defined as hydrocephalus, high level of lesion and wheelchair dependence, was related with more experienced hindrances clue to long-distance transportation accessibility of buildings. Conclusions. Many young adults with spina bifida experience participation restrictions. Severity of SB was negatively related to participation. Social integration should be a major focus in the professional guidance of youngsters with physical disabilities...|$|E
30|$|Bottom-up {{methodology}} {{was used}} to calculate total direct medical costs; that is, {{the total number of}} medical contacts was multiplied by the reference prices based on the Dutch manual for cost studies (prices were updated to 2012 prices) (Hakkaart-van Roijen et al. 2011). A visit to ‘RIAGG’ (Dutch mental health facility: a combination of 1 st and 2 nd line care) was assumed to have similar costs as 1 st line mental health care in case of ADHD. Unit costs for a visit to a school doctor and a company doctor were assumed to be similar to a general practitioner visit as costs for a school doctor and a company doctor were not defined in the costing manual. These assumptions were confirmed by a specialist in costing studies (LH). Costs for individual and group trainings were not specified in the costing manual. For individual sessions, costs for ambulatory 2 nd line care were assigned based on communication by the Dutch mental health association ‘GGZ Nederland’. For group trainings, the association estimated time used by the expert divided by the number of clients per session. For day-care, a weighted average of day-care treatment (8  h a day) and half-time treatment (4  h a day) was used (day-treatment € 183.70 [*]+[*]half-time treatment € 163.53). For parents, the average number of days of medication use in the entire group of parents per month was multiplied by mean public Dutch costs of medication use in adults (€ 0.66 per day) (Stichting Farmaceutische Kengetallen 2012). Direct non-medical costs related to weekend care and care after school were based on several sources as these were not defined in the costing manual. Weekend care was estimated based on productivity costs (Hakkaart-van Roijen et al. 2011). For remedial teaching, average price per hour for remedial teaching were used for cost calculation (Landelijke beroepsvereniging remedial teachers 2014). Care after school was rated based on average costs for baby-sitting (Nibud 2013). For diets, parents were asked to define costs below € 25, between € 25 and € 50 or above € 50 in one month if a special diet was indicated. For indirect non-medical costs, the agency for child welfare and police were assumed to have the same cost price since costs for police was not defined in the costing manual (Hakkaart-van Roijen et al. 2011). Prices for special education were based on prices of the Dutch Ministry of Education with a yearly additional cost of € 4700 (Ministerie van Onderwijs 2012). This led to extra monthly costs for special primary and <b>special</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> of € 392 compared to regular education. For the questions on child’s health-related school absence and failure to participate in sports due to ADHD no costs were assigned. Cost of absence from work of the parent related to their child with ADHD was calculated by multiplying the number of days off work with predefined productivity costs per hour of absence with a specification to age group and gender (Hakkaart-van Roijen et al. 2011). Costs of presenteeism was determined by the Osterhaus method (Osterhaus et al. 1992). Parents were asked about the number of days of hindrance due to ADHD of their child and their estimated efficiency on these days in comparison to usual efficiency. Linear extrapolation (LE) was applied as it was in a former ADHD study as well (Hakkaart-van Roijen et al. 2007). Applying LE, all costs were extrapolated to one year by multiplying the monthly costs by twelve assuming the monthly costs to reflect usual costs. There is no specific reason to assume that the cost distribution is non-linear, although there might be small variations during the year.|$|E
