40|$|Overview A draft {{assessment}} of widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas) off the United States West Coast was {{reviewed by the}} <b>STAR</b> <b>panel</b> during July 13 - 17, 2009. The assessment assumes a single coastwide stock given that there is currently no biological or genetic information to suggest the presence of multiple stocks. Northern and southern areas are modeled with different growth in each area. Recruits are produced from a common pool of spawners, and are assigned to each area according to year-invariant proportion (estimated by the model). No mixing is assumed to occur post recruitment. This assessment uses the Stock Synthesis platform (version 3. 03 a) and incorporates a variety of data sources into the base model. Catch and age-frequency data from four fisheries {{are used in the}} assessment, including Washington and California fisheries (all gears combined), and Oregon midwater and bottom trawl fisheries.
