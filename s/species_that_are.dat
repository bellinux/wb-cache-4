5|$|Plant <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> genetically {{compatible}} may not hybridize {{in nature}} for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators. <b>Species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that {{have some of}} the characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{participates in}} the Species Survival Plan (SSP) for 29 species with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The goal of the SSP is to engage in animal {{husbandry}} and research projects for selected <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in need of conservation efforts.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} more {{mushroom}} <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> harvested from the wild for personal consumption or commercial sale. Milk mushrooms, morels, chanterelles, truffles, black trumpets, and porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis) (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. They are often used in gourmet dishes.|$|E

5|$|There {{are only}} a few species of Rhytismatales known to have anamorphs that do not {{function}} as spermatia (non-motile cells that function as a male gamete). Coccomyces dentatus is one of only two <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> known to have both a spermatial and a non-spermatial state (the other is Ascodichaena rugosa).|$|E
5|$|A Covenant army {{attacks the}} academy causing {{confusion}} and panic. Although not made clear in Forward Unto Dawn, the Covenant are a theocratic collection of alien <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> religiously offended by Humanity {{and seek to}} eradicate it. The events portrayed in Forward Unto Dawn {{are some of the}} earliest encounters with the Covenant, and the characters other than Master Chief were unaware of their existence.|$|E
5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. <b>Species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E

50|$|In 2016, she {{documented}} {{the efforts to}} help {{the recovery of the}} Kankakee mallow, an endangered <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> endemic to Illinois. As the only floral <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> only found in that state, she has started an effort to make it the official Illinois state flower, proposing that it replace the more generic Violet.|$|R
5|$|Apicomplexa is a {{major group}} of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes that encompasses several important parasites, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Three species are known from the marsh rice rat, all of which belong to the Eimerina clade. Two are in the genus Eimeria, members of which cause the economically significant disease coccidiosis in poultry. The third {{is a member of}} Isospora, which includes <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> pathogenic in humans and pigs.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. <b>Species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|Lontra canadensis {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. They have been {{virtually}} eliminated through many parts of their range, especially around heavily populated areas in the midwestern and eastern United States. Appendix II lists <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.|$|E
50|$|Angophora paludosa <b>is</b> a tree <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{native to}} eastern Australia.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a locally}} common <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not facing major threats.|$|R

5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from {{others of the}} same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. <b>Species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E
5|$|Nematodes {{are among}} the largest animal phyla and include at least 12,000 known <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> parasites of vertebrates. In Kinsella's 1988 study in Florida, species {{diversity}} was higher in the saltwater marsh (Cedar Key) than the freshwater marsh (Paynes Prairie), but nematodes at Paynes Prairie occurred more commonly and made {{up the bulk of}} the parasites found in rice rats there.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> less {{commonly}} affected include {{cats and}} horses, {{as well as}} other large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is usually the result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and has been linked with the mother's diet.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybe pelliculosa {{is found}} in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or {{clusters}} along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC), {{established}} in 1959, {{is the national}} bird rarities committee for Britain. It assesses claimed sightings of bird <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> rarely seen in Britain, based on descriptions, photographs and video recordings submitted by observers. Its findings are published in an annual report in the journal British Birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of <b>species</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
