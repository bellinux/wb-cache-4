The interference of gravity waves with other gravity waves and tides can be recognized in the altitudes of occurrence and the structure of the layers.

30|$|Dynamical, electro-dynamical and {{electrical}} coupling processes originating from upward propagation of atmospheric waves, and magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction {{are responsible for}} the large degree of variabilities observed in the low latitude ionosphere. One of the most outstanding aspects of its phenomenology is related to the sunset electrodynamical processes responsible for the evening enhancements in zonal and vertical electric fields and the associated spread of F/plasma bubble irregularity development. Recent observational results have provided evidence of significant contribution to their quiet time variability arising from thermospheric wind patterns, upward propagating planetary waves and possibly <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layers.</b> This paper provides an overview and some new results on planetary wave coupling with the equatorial F region, the <b>E</b> <b>layer</b> conductivity as key connecting mechanism, a possibly interactive role by <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layers,</b> and the resulting day-to-day variability in the evening prereversal electric field enhancements with consequences on spread F development.|$|R

40|$|Meteorological {{processes}} (cold fronts, mesoscale convective complexes, thunderstorms) in the troposphere {{can generate}} upward propagating {{waves in the}} neutral atmosphere affecting the behaviour of the ionosphere. One type of these waves are the internal atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) which are often generated by thunderstorms. Davis & Johnson (2005) found in low pressure systems that a localized intensification of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layer</b> (Es) {{can be attributed to}} lightnings. To confirm this result, we have performed two different statistical analysis using the time series of the critical frequency (foEs), the virtual height of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layer</b> (h’Es), and meteorological observations (lightnings, Infrared maps) over the ionospheric station of Rome (41. 9 ◦ N, 12. 5 ◦ E). In the first statistical analysis, we separated the days of 2009 into two groups: stormy days and fair-weather days, then we studied the occurrence and the properties of the Es separately for the two different groups. No significant differences have been found. In the second case, a superposed epoch analysis (SEA) was used to study the behaviour of the critical frequency and virtual height 100 hours before and after the lightnings. The SEA shows a statistically significant decrease in the critical frequency after the time of the lightnings, which indicates a sudden decrease in the electron density of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layer</b> associated with lightnings...|$|E

The measurement of the Doppler shift is carried out continuously on a frequency of 3. 6 MHz, thus the radio wave is reflected predominantly from the ionospheric F layer.

40|$|Abstract. Radio {{remote sensing}} of the ionospheric E region can be difficult, {{particularly}} in the nighttime E region valley which lies between two regions of higher electron density. We show that extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves launched from below penetrate this region because of their low attenuation and can be reflected from both the D region {{and the top of}} the E region valley. This double reflection, also caused by <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layers,</b> produces a measurable effect on the subionospheric propagation of ELF waves, which we demonstrate with numerical Earth-ionosphere waveguide simulations. This sensitivity opens the possibility of remotely sensing the E region and detecting <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layers</b> with broadband ELF propagation measurements using lightning discharges as the source. From nighttime observations of ELF lightning radiation over the same propagation path on different days, we extract E region electron density profiles that show significant variability not only from day to day but {{over the course of a}} single night. This technique is inherently a path-integrated measurement, enabling tomographic large-scale ionospheric remote sensing with multiple sources and receivers. 1...|$|R
30|$|At high latitudes, the E region {{electron}} densities {{are often}} enhanced by auroral precipitation. Very large changes {{are caused by}} narrow <b>layers</b> known as <b>sporadic</b> <b>E.</b> <b>Sporadic</b> <b>E</b> (<b>Es)</b> <b>layers</b> are thin horizontal layers with a vertical extent of 0.5 – 5  km and densities at least two-three {{times higher than the}} background plasma. Their sources are metallic ions, formed by ablating meteors. Much of the progress in understanding high-latitude <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> comes from studies made with the EISCAT radars (see the review by Kirkwood and Nilsson 2000). An important generation mechanism for <b>Es</b> <b>layers</b> at mid-latitudes is the wind shear mechanism, but at high latitudes, the electric field mechanism, vertical convergence of ionospheric plasma by the magnetospheric electric field (Nygrén et al. 1984), becomes important.|$|R
40|$|A {{connection}} between thunderstorms and the ionosphere has been hypothesized since the mid- 1920 s(1). Several mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to explain this connection(2 - 7), and evidence from modelling(8) as well as various types of measurements(9 - 14) demonstrate that lightning can interact with the lower ionosphere. It has been proposed, {{on the basis of}} a few observed events(15), that the ionospheric 'sporadic E' layer - transient, localized patches of relatively high electron density in the mid-ionosphere E layer, which significantly affect radio-wave propagation - can be modulated by thunderstorms, but a more formal statistical analysis is still needed. Here we identify a statistically significant intensification and descent in altitude of the mid-latitude <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layer</b> directly above thunderstorms. Because no ionospheric response to low-pressure systems without lightning is detected, we conclude that this localized intensification of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layer</b> can be attributed to lightning. We suggest that the co-location of lightning and ionospheric enhancement can be explained by either vertically propagating gravity waves that transfer energy from the site of lightning into the ionosphere, or vertical electrical discharge, or by a combination of these two mechanisms...|$|E
30|$|GWs {{propagating}} in the ionosphere {{cause an}} undulating electron density profile, which causes a {{variation in the}} reflection height, and thus {{a variation in the}} Doppler shift. If the radius of curvature of the perturbation is smaller than its mean height, three echoes with different Doppler shifts are observed at the same time, corresponding to three different points of reflection. In the spectrogram, these events form a characteristic “S” shape (Davies and Baker 1966). Such signals require manual approach or approximations. If the radius of curvature of the perturbation is larger than its mean height, the Doppler shift forms a narrow trace with a wavelike shape in the Doppler shift spectrogram. The signals are single-valued functions of time and can be analyzed directly. In the case of spread F, the Doppler shift traces become very diffusive {{with a wide range of}} Doppler shifts present at the same time, corresponding to multipoint reflections from many small-scale irregularities. In the case of a <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layer,</b> the reflected wave has nearly zero Doppler shift and forms a straight line in the Doppler shift spectrogram.

40|$|The diurnal and semidiurnal {{atmospheric}} tides {{are known}} to be of fundamental importance in the formation of midlatitude <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layers,</b> acting through their vertical windshear forcing of the long-living metallic ions in the lower thermosphere. Also, recent studies suggested that planetary waves play a role on <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> generation as well, a fact that went unnoticed in the long-going research of sporadic layers. In this paper a methodology is employed to investigate the tidal and planetary wave periodicities imprinted onto <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> critical frequencies foEs. In this approach, standard analysis techniques used in neutral atmospheric dynamics are applied on foEs time series obtained during summertime when <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> occurrence is nearly continuous. It is shown that besides the dominant and known 24 -hour and 12 -hour tidal periodicities in foEs, there is often a weaker terdiurnal (8 -hour) oscillation present as well. In addition, there are planetary wave periodicites in foEs with periods near the normal Rossby modes, that is, 2, 5, 10, and 16 days. It is also found that the tidal oscillations in foEs undergo a strong amplitude modulation with periods comparable to the dominant planetary wave periodicities present in the data. Our results are in line with recent findings based on a single event study which suggested that <b>sporadic</b> <b>E</b> <b>layers</b> are affected indirectly by planetary waves through their nonlinear interaction and modulation of the atmospheric tides at lower altitudes.

Moreover, the radio wave absorption (below 5 – 8  MHz) occurred in the D region that happened some minutes before the abnormal enhancement of the E layer density is attributed to the additional X-ray ionization due to solar flare events.|$|E
