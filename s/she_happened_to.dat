5|$|In London, he {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1881 to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel. <b>She</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be visiting Dublin in 1884, when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington in London. Constance's annual allowance of £250 was generous for a young woman (equivalent to about £ in current value), but the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes, and they had preached to others for so long {{on the subject of}} design that people expected their home to set new standards. No. 16, Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886.|$|E

She congratulated the winner, Bernd Rosemeyer, who seemed smitten with her. They danced together that night and were married on 13 July 1936. A true celebrity couple – an adventurous aviator and the fearless racing driver – they were the toast of Nazi Germany. Heinrich Himmler ordered a reluctant Bernd to {{become a member of the}} SS.|$|E

25|$|Kanin {{longed to}} move to Los Angeles to get into {{pictures}} and her parents indulged her. Her father moved to California first to secure a job, then {{she and her mother}} packed everything and followed by train. Kanin spent her senior year at the University of Southern California where she became active in college radio. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she wangled an interview with Sam Marx who thought she was much too young to hire; but her next interview was with story editor Bob Sparks at RKO who sent her to producer Al Lewis, who then hired her as a story editor at $75 a week. RKO released Lewis, but Sparks kept Fay on as scriptreader to write one-page summaries for $25 a week. Kanin proceeded to teach herself everything she could about the movie industry at RKO's expense. During the lunch hour, she talked to anyone <b>she</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> find – whether they were art directors, editors, or cinematographers.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Washington Post, Khalifa said the controversial scene was satirical and should be taken as such, claiming that Hollywood films depicted Muslims in a far more negative light than any pornographer could. Among those who publicly spoke out to defend her decision to become an adult performer was British-Lebanese author Nasri Atallah, who stated, [...] "The moral indignation ... is wrong for two reasons. First and foremost, as a woman, she is free to do as she pleases with her body. As a sentient human being with agency, who lives halfway across the world, she {{is in charge of}} her own life and owes absolutely nothing to the country where <b>she</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be born." [...] Khalifa herself said of the controversy: [...] "Women's rights in Lebanon are a long way from being taken seriously if a Lebanese American porn star that no longer resides there can cause such an uproar. What I once boasted to people as being the most Westernized nation in the Middle East, I now see as devastatingly archaic and oppressed." ...|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I {{fell in love with}} it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for {{somebody}} when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E

500|$|Whitney had {{no further}} {{involvement}} with Star Trek until 1976, when <b>she</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> meet DeForest Kelley at an unemployment office in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. He informed her about a Star Trek convention coming up that was organised by Bjo and John Trimble called Equicon. She received such a reception upon making an appearance there {{that she was}} inspired to think more about the series and wanted to appear at more events. In 1977, after reading the back cover of the book Letters to Star Trek by Susan Sackett and finding that [...] "Whatever happened to Grace Lee Whitney?" [...] {{was one of the}} ten most frequently asked queries, Whitney got in touch with Sackett and was invited to meet at Roddenberry's office at Paramount. When he entered, he was happy and excited to see her and immediately offered to bring back Rand for the new television series [...] Roddenberry told her that removing Rand was the biggest mistake he'd made, saying that the character should have stayed so that [...] "when Captain Kirk came back from having affairs with all these other women on all these other planets – he'd have to deal with [...] What a great plot-thickener that would have been!" [...] Instead, he blamed the decision on executives at NBC, but apologized for it to Whitney.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Moulton {{began to}} publish the work which she had written {{for the past eight}} years. It would be {{difficult}} to say what it was that inclined her to a literary life as she had no literary friends. She felt her movements had to be secret as if she were committing a crime when she sent off her first verses to a daily paper published in Norwich, Connecticut. It was on her way from school one day that <b>she</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> take the paper from the office; and, when she opened it, there were the lines she had written. Three years later, Messrs. Phillips, Sampson and Company, of Boston, published for her [...] "This, That, and the Other," [...] a collection of stories and poems which had appeared in various magazines and newspapers.|$|E

At such times she would sit down beside whomever <b>she</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be near, or beside a nun whom she had observed to be downcast, disregarding the tacit and sometimes expressed sensitivity and even jealousy of her biological sisters. [...] "We must apologize to the others for our being four under one roof", {{she was in the}} habit of remarking. [...] "When I am dead, you must be very careful not to lead a family life with one another...I did not come to Carmel to be with my sisters; on the contrary, I saw clearly that their presence would cost me dear, for I was determined not to give way to nature." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{footnote}} to her ten-week tenure as caretaker {{leader of the}} Labour Party is that <b>she</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be the leader {{at the time of}} that year's 1994 European parliament elections which were held just four weeks after ill-fate placed her in the position. [...] Labour's election campaign had naturally been long in the planning under John Smith, whose sudden death led to a [...] "sympathy rise" [...] in opinion polls for Labour, compounding what had already been a strong lead over the Conservatives. [...] Consequently, Labour had a commanding victory in what was its best result in any of the eight European elections held since 1979. [...] The two Labour leadership elections followed just six weeks later on 21 July 1994 and the Labour electorate did not appear to attribute any credit for the successful European election result to Beckett's chance-ordained position as acting leader in the four weeks immediately prior to the election.|$|E
2500|$|A week or {{two after}} graduating, <b>she</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> see a US Civil Service ad in The Philadelphia Inquirer looking for women with degrees in mathematics. During World War II, the US Army was hiring women to {{calculate}} bullet and missile trajectories at Ballistic Research Laboratory, which had been established at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, with staff from both the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the Moore School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania [...] She immediately called her two fellow math majors, Frances Bilas and Josephine Benson about the ad. Benson couldn't meet up with them, so Kathleen and Fran met in Philadelphia one morning in June 1942 for an interview in a building on South Broad Street (likely the Union League of Philadelphia Building). One week later, they were both hired as human [...] "computers" [...] at a pay grade of SP-4, a subprofessional civil service grade. The starting pay was $1620 annually. Kathleen stated the pay was [...] "very good at the time". They were notified to report {{to work at the}} Moore School of Engineering. Their job was to compute ballistics trajectories used for artillery firing tables, mostly using mechanical desk calculators and extremely large sheets of columned paper. The pay was low, but both Kathleen and Fran were satisfied to have attained employment that used their educations (having had no prior employment experience) and that served the war effort.|$|E
