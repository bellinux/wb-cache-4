40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the combination of water and membranes for temporary architectural applications. Water as a construction material, can be useful for three different purposes: first of all, thanks to its thermal mass, it can be used as a medium for cooling down or heating up buildings (Pronk et al [6]); secondly water is uncompressible and, in combination with air, can be used as part of a structural element; thirdly the mass of water could work as a sound barrier so it can be used as <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> (Rodrigues and Coutinho [7]). This paper shows the result of the structural behaviour. There is another paper about sound insulation properties of water. The research in both structural and sound insulation fields was carried out in the laboratories of Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The prototype is a "waterbeam" of 2 m span. Starting from the Tensairity(R) technology principle (Luchsinger et al [8]) developed by Airlight, the purpose of this experiment is to replace the iron struts with a second membrane chamber filled with water. Water works well in compression and air prevents buckling. The result is a rigid structural element made by non-rigid material (water, air, membranes and cables) with a significant reduction of weight and cost of transportation compared to the traditional iron beam but also compared with the Tensairity(R) system.

40|$|Research and {{practice}} {{have shown that}} alongside with the natural fibres used in textiles {{they can also be}} used successfully as composite reinforcements, compounds of building materials, as heat and <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>materials.</b> Fibre slabs as well as three-dimensional pressed parts can be produced for application in the construction and furniture industry. The main raw materials are aerobically aged hemp stalks. The samples are made of hemp chips, fastened together using the UF and PF glue. The use of preserved chopped hemp to produce slabs allows using all the stalks and also the leaves and seeds without waiting for their full maturity. That makes harvesting of the raw material independent of the weather. The material can be stored compactly, decreasing changes in the properties of the material, significantly shortening the recycling period and accordingly reducing the energy demand and simplifying the technological process. Research was done to find an innovative production technology of a heat and sound insulating material to be used in construction. During the research a technology was created for a mixture of hemp which involved finding an optimal mulching degree of the hemp stalks, testing the best suited glue (including natural glues) for this operation, testing the impact of the slab thickness on the quality parameters –sound (not described in this article) and heat insulation. The hemp mass for the slab was created from two components – wet (fermented) and dry mass to get a certain degree of moisture. To achieve this result, hemp was cut in the flowering stage, which gave certain advantages, e. g., lower energy consumption and reduced risk of hemp harvesting...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{building}} acoustics is the prediction of airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> between rooms to determine the quality of sound protection. In many practical cases, however, the objective measures of the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> using procedures in standards are not {{in agreement with the}} subjective assessment. This paper, therefore, after reviewing the conventional model to calculate airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation,</b> introduces a calculation scheme based on loudness level linked with specific fluctuation strength, yielding a weighted normalised loudness level difference, Lnor,w. By analysing the difference between standard airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> values and the introduced weighted normalised loudness level difference, it is revealed that the sound pressure level that is transmitted through a partition decreases with increasing frequency, and this is independent of the type of signal and of the airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> values (View the MathML source-values), whereas if the transmitted signal is converted into a loudness level, it tends to rise with increasing frequency. Moreover, it is found that, whereas a simple level difference does not exhibit the effect of a given signal to the frequency-dependent airborne <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> curve, using Lnor,w, a significant change can be observed, in terms of both computed and measured results.

High porosity foams were obtained from zein thermoplasticized with polyethylene glycol, and from starch thermoplasticized with urea/formamide. Zein foams had a higher porosity than starch foams (88 % and 85 %, respectively) and a narrower and more evenly distributed pore size. Starch foams exhibited a wider span of pore sizes and a larger average pore size than zein (208. 84 vs. 55. 43 μm 2, respectively).
