50|$|Flagfall or flag fall is {{a common}} Australian {{expression}} for a fixed start fee, especially in the taxi and haulage and railway industries. From the Australian mobile phone industry, the expression has recently begun to spread to other English language countries, as business jargon for an initial fixed fee for establishing each phone call. The logic behind {{is believed to be}} a method used by Australian mobile phone companies to recover a component of the carriage charges they incur in completing a call to a <b>subscriber</b> being the <b>termination</b> rates, based on the price terms and conditions for the mobile terminating access service (MTAS). The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission is reviewing these arrangements.|$|R
50|$|The {{first task}} of the {{electronic}} control was to detect when a new call arrived. For this purpose each <b>subscriber's</b> line <b>termination</b> was examined {{for a period of}} 280 microseconds every 224 milliseconds, a process known as scanning. Junctions were scanned at eight times this rate. The scanning was carried out by a magnetic drum, each track of which is divided into 100 sections or words, one for each line. Parallel tracks were used for each 100 lines, one track providing the permanent (IDF) information (that is, directory number and class of service), another track gave a semi-permanent information (that is, whether the line was already engaged or parked because of PG conditions). Since the tracks are switched in sequence the information relating to each line could be read sequentially as the drum rotated, the angular position of the word together with the track number defining the equipment position that is, the line apparatus number of the line being scanned. The groups of 800 lines (junctions and subscribers) at Highgate Wood were divided into eight sub-groups, one sub-group for each track of the drum. In each sub-group the line units was arranged in ten columns of ten rows so that any line position could be defined by a ZXY code, Z for the sub-group, X for the column and Y for the rows.|$|R
40|$|Absfracf-An {{approach}} {{to the implementation of}} asynchronous and timing jitter insensitive data echo cancellation is described. This approach introduces a small amount of jitter in the transmitted data signal, or alternatively in the received signal sampling, and uses a simple digital phase-locked loop together with the storage of two sets of echo canceler coefficients. The effect of derived timing jitter on the echo cancellation accuracy is completely eliminated for a loop timed transceiver (as in a digital <b>subscriber</b> loop network <b>termination</b> transceiver), and is easily reduced to negligible levels for a nonloop timed transceiver (as in a digital subscriber loop line card transceiver or a voiceband data modem). In the case of a voiceband data modem, this approach is one method to achieve asynchronous echo cancellation without the need to recover and resample a continuous-time far-end data signal. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} regulating termination for interconnected telecommunications networks. We develop two models, the first that involves fixed market shares and the second, {{based on the work}} of Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998 a), which allows for subscriber competition. We show that if a dominant network (i. e., one with the greatest market share) has its termination charges regulated then this will tend to lower the average price of calls. It is also likely to lead to other networks raising their termination charges. If market shares are fixed, then extending termination regulation to non-dominant networks lowers call prices and is unambiguously welfare improving. However, if networks actively compete for <b>subscribers</b> then extending <b>termination</b> charge regulation to a non-dominant network may lead to higher call prices. This is most likely if the non-dominant network has a very low market share relative to the dominant network. Journal of Economi...|$|R
40|$|Firms {{in mobile}} {{telephone}} markets charge {{one another for}} delivering calls to <b>subscribers.</b> These so-called <b>termination</b> charges are controversial from a policy perspective since they are fairly high and stable. We present a model of consumer and firm behavior in mobile markets {{in order to identify}} the role of termination charges in determining the market equilibrium. We analyze three segments of the mobile market: termination, calling, and subscribing. Our model predicts a “waterbed effect”, that is, high termination rates will be associated with low subscription prices, if preferences are the primary source of variation in termination rates. If costs are the main driver of termination rates our model predicts a “tide ” hypothesis in which high termination rates exist alongside high subscription prices. We test these and other predictions from our model using international data on mobile subscriptions per person. We find results which are broadly consistent with our model. More specifically, we find evidence that mobile termination rates are positive and significantly related to mobile phone adoption. This result is robust to the inclusion of a variety of other structural, institutional, demographic, and income controls. We also find that competition, internet subscriptions, and a free press are positively associated with mobile phone adoption while fixed termination rates and inequality slow the adoption of mobile technologies...|$|R
40|$|When {{a person}} uses the {{traditional}} wireline telephone network to call another person {{on his cell}} phone, the fixed network must transfer the call to the mobile network to which the recipient subscribes. The fixed network provides originating access for the call, and the mobile network provides terminating access. This paper provides an economic analysis of the regulation of fixed-to-mobile termination rates. Mobile party pays (2 ̆ 2 MPP 2 ̆ 2) creates better incentives than calling party pays (2 ̆ 2 CPP 2 ̆ 2) for mobile network operators to place downward pressure on termination rates. Cellular telephone use in the United States and Canada has continued to increase at a significant pace despite the MPP regime and now far exceeds mobile telephone use in countries with CPP regimes. Multiple factors, including substitution possibilities for the callers of mobile subscribers, constrain the market power of mobile operators in setting mobile termination rates under CPP regimes. It is unrealistic for regulators to attempt to set mobile rates, including termination rates, at marginal cost. If large fixed network costs and customer acquisition costs must be recovered from variable charges, then marginal-cost-based pricing is not feasible. Also, the value to callers {{of being able to}} reach mobile <b>subscribers</b> justifies mobile <b>termination</b> charges that exceed marginal cost because of network externalities in mobile telecommunications. Finally, mobile termination rates that exceed marginal cost (or its proxy, long-run average incremental cost) are consistent with Ramsey (quasi-efficient) pricing. To the extent that high termination rates are a problem in countries that have embraced CPP, it is because customers are poorly informed of the charges they pay for their terminating calls. Consumer education would solve the potential market failure without the need to impose price regulation on otherwise competitive markets...|$|R
