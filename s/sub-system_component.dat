40|$|Servo-actuated {{mechanisms}} are increasingly substituting fully mechanical drives {{in order to}} increase flexibility and reconfigurability of modern automatic machines. The overall servomechanism performance, {{especially in the case of}} high-dynamic motions, is the direct consequence of several interacting factors, namely electric motor and linkage dynamics, controller efficacy, and requested motion law. In particular, Point-To-Point (PTP) trajectories are usually designed in order to comply with technological constraints, imposed by the required interaction with the handled product, and to maximize some optimality criterion such as, for instance, energy efficiency or limited actuation torques. In this context, the present paper proposes a novel method for generating either energy-optimal or torque-optimal PTP motions described by piecewise fifth-order polynomials. The optimization cost functions are based on a virtual prototype of the system, which comprises behavioral models of power converter, controller and electric motor coupled with the mechanical system. Results are then compared with experimental data obtained on a physical prototype. The comparison quantitatively shows that betterbehaved PTP trajectories can be designed by including the dynamic contribution of each <b>sub-system</b> <b>component...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} {{supplier industry}} {{and the relationship between}} car manufacturers and suppliers has been confronted with major changes resulting from OEMs' strategy of stronger product integration and the building of so-called systems, sub-systems and components and segmentation of the supplier industry. Former valid work processes, division of work, organisational structures and also, the general manufacturer-supplier relationship has been subject to intensive evaluation and appropriate adaptation to the changed circumstances. This research project aims to investigate these changes in the European car industry in greater detail, particularly: The OEMs' system-building strategy What requirements OEMs must meet at the individual supplier levels (system, <b>sub-system,</b> <b>component)</b> and The main factors involved {{in the development of a}} more efficient relationship between OEMs and suppliers. To achieve this object, various activities were undertaken including the collecting of information from previous studies, preparing standardised questionnaires and performing investigations within the European car industry and also at a major automotive supplier. The work is based on empirical investigations and personal interviews conducted with key persons in automobile companies and automotive suppliers with the aim of painting a picture of the future situation and developing a proposal based on the information compiled. Finding answers to the above-mentioned issues may be very important and useful in determining internal organisational structure and resource allocation and in making strategic decisions in respect of alliances and collaborations when preparing one's own business for the even fiercer competition that will face automobile suppliers in the future...|$|E
40|$|Effective system {{integration}} requires strict adherence to strong software engineering standards, a practice not much favoured in many collaborative research projects. We argue that component-based software engineering (CBSE) {{provides a way}} to overcome this problem because it provides flexibility for developers while requiring the adoption of only a modest number of software engineering practices. This focus on integration complements software re-use, the more usual motivation for adopting CBSE. We illustrate our argument by showing how a large-scale system architecture for an application {{in the domain of}} robot-enhanced therapy for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been implemented. We highlight {{the manner in which the}} integration process is facilitated by the architecture implementation of a set of placeholder components that comprise stubs for all functional primitives, as well as the complete implementation of all inter-component communications. We focus on the component-port-connector meta-model and show that the YARP robot platform is a well-matched middleware framework for the implementation of this model. To facilitate the validation of port-connector communication, we configure the initial placeholder implementation of the system architecture as a discrete event simulation and control the invocation of each component’s stub primitives probabilistically. This allows the system integrator to adjust the rate of inter-component communication while respecting its asynchronous and concurrent character. Also, individual ports and connectors can be periodically selected as the simulator cycles through each primitive in each <b>sub-system</b> <b>component.</b> This ability to control the rate of connector communication considerably eases the task of validating component-port-connector behaviour in a large system. Ultimately, over and above its well-accepted benefits for software re-use in robotics, CBSE strikes a good balance between software engineering best practice and the socio-technical problem of managing effective integration in collaborative robotics research projects.  European Commission, Project 611391 : DREAM — Development of Robot-enhanced Therapy for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder...|$|E

But {{this is not an}} easy task, given the various design trade-offs, and it has been difficult, historically, to achieve. Over time it has been found that successful control of spacecraft acoustic levels is achieved by levying firm requirements at the system-level, using a systems engineering approach for design and development, and then validating these requirements with acoustic testing. In the systems engineering method, the system-level requirements must be flowed down to <b>sub-systems</b> and <b>component</b> noise sources, using acoustic analysis and acoustic modelling to develop allocated requirements for the <b>sub-systems</b> and <b>components.</b> Noise controls must also be developed, tested, and implemented so the <b>sub-systems</b> and <b>components</b> can achieve their allocated limits.

The methodology determines a hierarchical top-down test case development process including test case specification, validation, partitioning and implementation. The test case development process addresses the functional validation {{of the system and}} its components such as ASICs, boards, HW and software modules; it does not facilitate timing or performance verification. The system functions are used to define test cases at the system level and to derive sub-functions for the system components. Test cases are specified, using a special purpose formalism, and validated before they are applied to the system under test. Furthermore, we propose a technique to partition test cases corresponding to the partitioning of the system into <b>sub-systems</b> and <b>components.</b> This technique can significantly reduce system simulation time because it allows the full validation of system functions by simulation at the <b>sub-system</b> and <b>component</b> level.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate an integrated system design optimization approach for space system networks. The decisions made during the initial design phases for a complex system, will drastically affect the final product at the architectural level. Traditionally, the design process for a complex system involves the sequential design of the <b>sub-system</b> <b>components,</b> which may lead to a sub-optimal system design. In systems with a high degree of sub-system coupling, the ordering of the sub-system design decisions indirectly determines the priority of the sub-systems to the system. In addition, with the announcement of the space exploration initiative, the goal is to design a sustainable space exploration system that can accomplish multiple missions in an environment of uncertainty. As such, we can no longer consider each mission separately, and therefore must integrate the multiple missions into the initial design of the system. By viewing the set of missions as an integrated space network, we add another sub-system to the system design space.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{capture and}} storage (CCS) into {{geological}} formations {{is regarded as}} an important strategy for achieving {{a significant reduction in}} anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. An increasing emphasis on the industrial-scale implementation of CO 2 storage in geological formations has {{led to the development of}} whole-system models to evaluate the performance of candidate geologic storage sites and the environmental risk associated with them. The United States Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Risk Assessment Partnership (NRAP) Program, is conducting research to develop science-based methods to quantify the likelihood of risks associated with the longterm geologic storage of CO 2. A key component of this research is the development of an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), which simulates the geologic storage system by integrating the primary <b>sub-system</b> <b>components</b> of the system for the purpose of elucidating the relationship between CO 2 injection into the subsurface and the short- and long-term containment of the stored CO 2. The <b>sub-system</b> <b>components</b> of that engineered geologic storage system include the storage reservoir, overlying aquitards (primary caprock and secondary seals) and aquifers (including the above zone monitoring interval, or AZMI, which directly overlays the primary seal), and potential leakage pathways including wells, fractures, and faults, to name a few. The subsystems are modeled using simplified reduced order models (ROMs), which are then coupled together to characterize the entire storage system. The construction of the IAM permits the quantification and assessment of the storage risks in a more computationally efficient manner as compared to the use of full physics-based models. This Ph. D. research was initiated with a review of the IAM development efforts of NRAP and an assessment of the current status of the ROMs for each of the <b>sub-system</b> <b>components</b> of the storage system. In addition, gaps in the development in the IAM structure were identified. The research also investigated the potential migration of subsurface fluids (i. e., CO 2 and formation brine) in geologic storage sites. Leakage of CO 2 and brine through the primary seal to the overlying porous and permeable formations, such as the AZMI, may occur due to the intrinsic permeability of the seal and/or the presence of natural fractures or induced perforations or fractures. Pressure modeling of the AZMI provides a useful source of information regarding seal performance and the subsurface pressure response to CO 2 leakage from the reservoir. As part of this research, a ROM for the AZMI, a missing component of the current IAM of NRAP, was developed. This AZMI ROM simulates fluid flow above the primary seal and predicts spatial changes in pressure over time due to this fluid migration from the reservoir. The performance of the AZMI ROM was verified using full physicsbased models of the zone. A data-driven approach of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos (aPC) Expansion was then used to quantify the uncertainty in the pressure predictions in the AZMI based on the inherent variability of the different geologic parameters such as the porosity, permeability, and thickness of the AZMI, and the caprock permeability and thickness. The aPC approach, which represents the models as a polynomial-based response surface, was then used to perform stochastic model reduction. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis was performed with Sobol indices based on the aPC technique to determine the relative importance of the different system parameters on pressure prediction. The research results indicate that there can be substantial uncertainty in pressure prediction locally, around the leakage zones, and that the degree of the uncertainty depends on the quality of the site-specific information available for analysis. The research results confirm the need for site-specific data for the efficient predictions of risks associated with geologic storage activities. Lastly, the research investigated the use of the AZMI model outputs as a basis for the Bayesian design of a monitoring framework for this zone of a geologic carbon storage system. Monitoring of reservoir leakage requires the capability to intercept and resolve the onset, location, and volume of leakage in a systematic and timely manner. The results of this research suggest that an optimal monitoring system with these capabilities can be designed based on the characterization of potential CO 2 leakage scenarios that are determined using an assessment of the integrity and permeability of the caprock inferred from pressure measurements in the AZMI...|$|R

40|$|A general {{methodology}} for the decomposed optimization of highly coupled, highly dynamic energy systems is presented. The approach {{is based on}} the physical division of the system into units (<b>sub-systems,</b> <b>components</b> or disciplines) subject to functions describing the energy, cost and other couplings between them. Two versions of the approach are proposed. The first approach is called the Local-Global Optimization (LGO) Approach. LGO requires unit optimizations to be carried out with respect to purely local decision variables for various combinations of the functions that connect the units. The results are used to create an Optimum Response Surface (ORS) for the entire problem. The ORS is then searched by a system-level optimizer to find the values of the coupling functions that lead to an optimum system-level solution. The second approach proposed is an iterative version of LGO (ILGO). In this case, the ORS is closely approximated using a linear Taylor series expansion. The partial derivatives resulting from such an approximation are seen to correspond to the shadow prices (or marginal costs) typically used in the thermoeconomic literature. ILGO effectively and significantly reduces the number of unit optimizations required. The properties used to describe the coupling functions {{play a critical role in}} the convergence of ILGO to a global system-level optimum.
