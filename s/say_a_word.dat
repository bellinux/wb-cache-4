5|$|In the 1995 film GoldenEye, Bean portrayed James Bond's nemesis Alec Trevelyan (MI6's 006). He {{played the}} weak-stomached Spence in Ronin (1998), a wife-beating ex-con in Essex Boys (2000), and a malevolent kidnapper/jewel thief in Don't <b>Say</b> <b>a</b> <b>Word</b> (2001). He was also widely {{recognised}} as villainous treasure hunter Ian Howe in National Treasure, {{and played a}} villainous scientist in The Island (2005). In the independent film Far North, he plays a Russian mercenary who gets lost in the tundra and is rescued by an Inuit woman and her daughter, whom he later pits against one another.|$|E
25|$|In the Convention {{session of}} 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor of Year II), Robespierre {{and his allies}} hardly managed to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> as they were {{constantly}} interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Barère and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak.|$|E
25|$|Officers {{remarked that}} Lo Piccolo’s face was entirely {{different}} from the identikit photo of him (see images on this page). Lo Piccolo did not <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> and just smiled when prosecutors noted {{that he did not}} resemble the photofit released earlier this year. The elder Lo Piccolo was in fact betrayed by his son of whom police did have a recent photograph.|$|E

25|$|His name is the {{synonym for}} the {{faithful}} discharge of duty. In his business regulations {{he has won}} the respect and admiration of all who know him. As a public officer, when fortunes were within his grasp, not a thought of seizing them entered his mind. He is a man vigorously positive, determined, honest, generous and able. Not a stain has been cast on his name. Not a man can <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> against him to impeach his qualifications for the Mayoralty of New York.|$|E
25|$|After beating Mars Bar in a foot {{race and}} goading him into {{crashing}} Piper's birthday {{party at the}} McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen, and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him as if by coincidence, and they never <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.|$|E
25|$|Sequoyah first {{taught the}} syllabary to his six-year old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), {{because he could}} not find adults willing to learn it. He {{traveled}} to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansaw Territory where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah asked each leader to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.|$|E

500|$|... "Hush, Little Baby" [...] is a {{traditional}} lullaby, {{thought to have been}} written in the Southern United States, its key first lines, [...] "Hush, little baby, don't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird. And if that mockingbird don't sing, Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring." ...|$|E
500|$|As Hornsby {{recalled}} later, Ruth [...] "didn't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> He didn't {{even look}} around or up at me. He just picked {{himself up and}} walked away". Ruth's failed attempt to steal second base ended {{the game and the}} 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2016, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.|$|E
500|$|The trip to America is approaching. [...] {{is not yet}} complete. Terrible haste... {{the score}} is only half-ready. The copyist, Mr. Kauppi, is staying with us and writing night and day... It is only because of Janne's [...] energy that we are making progress... We lit a lamp in the dining room, a {{chandelier}} in the living room, it was a festive moment. I didn't dare <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> I just checked that the environment was in order. Then I went to bed and Janne stayed up. All night long I could hear his footsteps, alternating with music played quietly.|$|E

500|$|Schur {{said his}} {{favorite}} {{scene in the}} episode was when Leslie arrives at her secret meet-up spot with Ben, only to find Ron waiting there, and awkwardly tries to insist there is no affair. Schur said: [...] "The scene that unfolds is my favorite Leslie Knope moment of the whole year. [...] almost doesn't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> for the entire scene, but still makes you laugh 50 times." [...] Immediately after [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] first aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC.com website, which included an additional six minutes of material.|$|E
500|$|In a reply {{published}} on 22 June 1861, a Mr F. FitzHenry {{claimed to have}} known the Pig-faced Lady's sister, stating that [...] "Lady C.B. lived in Chelsea: her sister, Lady H.W., was much admired as a beauty. I was at a dinner-party forty years ago with Lady H.W., when all the party were cautioned previously not to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> about pigs, out of delicacy to Lady H.W." [...] In the same issue, a George Lloyd claimed to have seen the Pig-faced Lady in Wakefield in around 1828–29 [...] "but {{was too young to}} take a note further than a mental one, which has haunted me ever since".|$|E
500|$|Kevin Fuller {{was cast}} as Walter Crane, {{the man with}} the bomb. The {{character}} did not <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> throughout the entirety of the episode, yet had such a strong presence, which the producers felt was unique for a guest star in the series. Fuller did [...] "a lot of getting into the part," [...] director Sam Miller felt that Fuller {{was one of the most}} influential actors he ever worked with. Elsewhere, Peter Sullivan, who plays Sarkisiian, never spoke Russian before. Since most of his dialogue would be in Russian, Sullivan was trained how to speak it phonetically before he would play the part.|$|E

500|$|In August 1969 Drake {{recorded}} five songs, {{only three}} of which ("Cello Song", [...] "Three Hours", and [...] "Time of No Reply") were broadcast – for the BBC's John Peel show. Two months later, he opened for Fairport Convention at the Royal Festival Hall in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Remembering the performance in Hull, folk singer Michael Chapman commented:The folkies did not take to him; [...] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point. He didn't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig! ...|$|E
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> about it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] moves at a {{tempo of}} 123 {{beats per minute}} for 5:32, running {{slightly}} above the average song length of the album. It begins with a clean guitar intro similar to the main riff; an E minor chord on a guitar using the wah-wah pedal is then introduced, followed by heavy use of tom-tom drums. Distorted guitars then build up to the main riff, which starts 56 seconds into the song and utilizes variations of the E/B tritone. P. J. Howorth, in The Wah Wah Book, characterized the main riff as [...] "sinister". The song then follows a common structure, playing two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. On the chorus and pre-chorus, the song modulates one whole tone, up to F, and after the second chorus, Hammett plays a guitar solo with the main, pre-chorus, and chorus riffs in the background. Hammett makes use of the wah-wah pedal and {{a wide range of}} scales, including e minor pentatonic, B minor, F minor, E minor, and the E dorian mode. One of the final licks of the solo was inspired by the Heart song [...] "Magic Man" [...] as used in Ice-T's [...] "Personal". Just a few seconds before the solo ends, the breakdown starts, in which the clean drum intro starts, then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk's solo echo over it into the background, are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the [...] "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" [...] bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme [...] "Hush Little Baby" [...] where he is heard saying [...] "Hush little baby don't <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> and never mind that noise you heard. It's just the beasts under your bed, in your closet, in your head". After building again to a chorus, the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "nightmares and all that come with them", according to Chris True of Allmusic. The title is a reference to the sandman, a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep.|$|E

As early as 1964, Aleksandr Asarin at the Hydroproject Institute {{pointed out that the}} lake was doomed, explaining, [...] "It was part of the five-year plans, approved by the council of ministers and the Politburo. Nobody on a lower level would dare to <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> contradicting those plans, even if it was the fate of the Aral Sea." ...|$|E
