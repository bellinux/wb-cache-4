40|$|Abstract Background Research {{shows that}} obesity {{prevention}} {{has to start}} early. Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2 – 6 [*]years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity. Methods/Design Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n[*]=[*] 5, 902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a <b>shadow</b> <b>control</b> group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21 % agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n[*]=[*] 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the <b>shadow</b> <b>control</b> group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 1 ½[*]year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4 – 7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements. Discussion If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was part of}} a collaborative brief to create a 3 D animation visualising Benjamin Britton’s, Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra orchestral (1946). Funded by the Orchestra Network for Europe Network, the short film ‘Red and the Kingdom of Sound’ has been screened at a series of live events alongside orchestras across Europe and was shared with schools as a learning tool. To visualise the music, a two dimensional ‘UPA style’ was chosen to match the era of the music’s conception and established a research path exploring two-dimensional aesthetics/rules in 3 D production. UPA (United Pictures of America / founded 1943) used a mix of an abstract /graphical 2 D design style and character animation. Titles such as ‘Gerald McBoing Boing (1950) ’ and the Mr Magoo series personify this approach. Replicating this kind of two-dimensional logic and applying it using 3 D software is a core problem for studio production. In 2012 Disney Studios produced ‘Paperman’ using bespoke software as a response to this problem. The animation ‘Rob ‘n Roy’ (2013) by Tumbleweed Studios explored this problem further by creating two and half dimensional rigs that allowed characters to work on both two dimensional and three dimensional planes at the same time. In ‘Red and the Kingdom of Sound’, a series of possible solutions were explored in response. These included techniques, such as flattening the 3 D world, replicating texture/ noise (paper), creating three-dimensional shape definition in two dimensions, <b>shadow</b> <b>control,</b> and allowing three-dimensional characters to adhere to two-dimensional line/paint logic whilst moving. A series of tests were undertaken and solutions established. These were shared with project artists and animators as the ‘rules’ for the production, including the creation of a bespoke software plug-in for use with a cast of animated characters.

40|$|Abstract – According to ASTER TIR data around big cities, surface {{temperatures}} on urban centers are often {{lower than those}} on the surrounding suburbs. Generally, such patterns are caused by evapotranspiration by vegetation and water, higher heat capacity of buildings, and shadows of buildings. However, 90 -m spatial resolution of ASTER TIR limits to analyze contribution of these factors. In order to analyze influence of shade of buildings on surface temperature in urban areas, surface temperature in Tokyo for 20 days during 2000 to 2009 derived from ASTER were compared with shaded fraction estimated from PRISM DEM data. Shaded areas were estimated from DEM and information on solar position recorded with ASTER observation. The deviations of surface temperature were smaller in the places with larger shaded fraction because the land surface was less exposed by solar radiation. This result implies that <b>shadow</b> <b>controls</b> surface temperature equally {{in spite of the}} surface types...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} and presents {{a framework for}} an under‐used evaluation technique {{in the context of}} an evaluation of a programme for disaffected young people. Shadow controls—the use of expert judgement to estimate the success of a programme—are often dismissed in research design as an unreliable form of comparison, but can be useful in situations where there is limited scope for a control group or to enhance the causal inference attributable to non‐experimental evaluations. The exercise described uses a practice tool as a structure for making predictions about the situations of the young people on the programme, assuming they do not receive an intervention. These predictions (<b>shadow</b> <b>controls)</b> are then compared to outcome data for the young people at the end of the programme. The results of the exercise provide some important messages about the programme’s effectiveness and the potential for strengthening non‐experimental evaluation methods. The article also discusses how the method can usefully inform evaluations of social programmes and encourage agency and user collaboration...|$|R

50|$|For {{more than}} 20 years, Cantonese gangs based on Mott Street terrorized Chinatown. The Ghost Shadows made this street their {{territory}} once the On Leong Tong Gang, {{also known as}} the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association, that dominated the street, gave their approval. The approval was not easy obtained, since it involved a bloody battle over the territory. Nicky Louie, who immigrated from Hong Kong to Manhattan's Chinatown in the late 1960s, ran the Ghost Shadows gang with 50 or more members also originating from Hong Kong. With the Ghost <b>Shadows</b> <b>controlling</b> Mott Street during the 1970s, they affiliated with the On Leong Tong. The On Leong Tong were the wealthiest and most influential gang organization in Chinatown. Working with the On Leong earned the Ghost Shadows a portion of money earned by the Tong's activities. The gangs were the guards of the gambling houses in the On Leong territory that operated in the poor conditions of lofts and basements along Mott Street. During the period of the 1980s and 1990s, the gangs also ran a protection racket, whereby shopkeepers paid the gangs a negotiated cash fee for protection. The negotiations often involved drinking tea and were often very peaceful.|$|R
