5|$|Toriyama enjoyed {{designing}} and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. He finds {{the most fun}} in designing original mecha, thinking about how a pilot enters and where the engine is. With real world items {{he would have to}} look at references, and being off even a little would be noticeable. He goes against whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball, most cars were very square, so he drew only round car designs. He drew square ones later on when cars in reality started to become <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> aerodynamic.|$|E

It was long, low and <b>sleek,</b> <b>and</b> was built on a Chevrolet Impala chassis. The Tim Burton Batmobile is now housed at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|The C4 Corvette {{was known}} for its evolved, <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> modern look. In a {{departure}} from the fiberglass panels of its forebearers, the C4's rear bumpers and panels were made from molding plastics, a sheet molding compound. The C4 fastback coupe was the first general production Corvette to have a glass hatchback (the limited edition 1982 Collector Edition being the first Corvette equipped with this feature) for better storage access. The Corvette C4 came standard with an electronic dashboard with a digital liquid crystal display dash, with graphics for speed and RPM and digital displays for other important engine functions.|$|E
25|$|The F3D was not {{intended}} to be a typical <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> nimble dogfighter, but as a standoff night fighter, packing a powerful radar system and a second crew member. It originated in 1945 with a US Navy requirement for a jet-powered, radar-equipped, carrier-based night fighter. The Douglas team led by Ed Heinemann designed around the bulky air intercept radar systems of the time, with side-by-side seating for the pilot and radar operator. The result was an aircraft with a wide, deep, and roomy fuselage. Instead of ejection seats, an escape tunnel was used, similar to the type used in the A-3 Skywarrior.|$|E
25|$|The Toyota 86 Shooting Brake Concept was {{displayed}} in Sydney, Australia in 2016. Toyota’s global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay {{model of the}} car {{during a trip to}} the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept that demonstrates the passion within Toyota for cars that are fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E

5000|$|Virgil Exner {{working in}} Chrysler's Advanced Styling Group {{developed}} lower, <b>sleeker,</b> <b>and</b> more aggressive looking automobiles for Chrysler in the 1950s.

25|$|In {{addition}} to different backgrounds and histories, {{each of the}} races have characteristic philosophies of starship design. Minmatar ships tend to be quite fast but fragile, and rely on their high speed maneuverability to evade the tracking systems of heavier weapons, while themselves using projectile weapons such as artillery or autocannons, more sophisticated kin to today's munitions technology. Amarr ships are ponderous and densely armored and pack batteries of powerful laser-based energy weaponry. Gallente ships are <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> well designed and armored and specialize in deploying fleets of robotic drones while mounting hybrid weapons that operate using superconducting magnets to accelerate mass toward targets at great speed (see Railgun). Finally, Caldari ships are typically poorly armored and not particularly fast but utilize powerful energy shields, and make extensive use of torpedo/missile launchers and hybrid guns, favoring engagement at extreme ranges. However, there are exceptions to these general rules in each race.|$|E
500|$|The {{addition}} of the Hunter in Episode Two was particularly well received by critics; Computer and Video Games stated that they were challenging to fight and were [...] "a very welcome addition" [...] to the series, while IGN stated that the Hunters were [...] "impressively designed... <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> powerful all at once and reek of malicious alien intelligence." ...|$|E

[...] Other notable artists of the era include Curt Swan, Gene Colan, Steve Ditko, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby and Joe Kubert.|$|E
50|$|For some holidaymakers, the {{distinction}} between the working boats and pleasure wherries was not strong enough, <b>and</b> the <b>sleeker</b> <b>and</b> more genteel 'Wherry Yacht' was developed. The main distinguishing features are a smooth, white yacht-like hull and a large counter-stern providing a quiet seating area away from the sail winch and any quanting activity.|$|R

500|$|The single {{version with}} Damian Marley {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog conveyed it as a [...] "perfect case" [...] of Stefani making songs which are <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> {{tough on the}} outside, but have a middle which is pure and vulnerable, ultimately rating it {{four out of five}} stars.

In contrast to the sleek Elite-based designs of the Covenant at large, the Brutes were given their own visual design distinct from the other Covenant. Weaponry was designed to reflect the Brute's [...] "souls" [...] distilled to its purest form—conveyed by dangerous shapes, harsh colors, and objects that looked [...] "dangerous to be around". A UNSC weapon designed for Combat Evolved in 1999 that was discarded {{at the time was}} re-purposed as the Brute's [...] "Mauler" [...] weapon.|$|E

Justin Chang of Variety said the film [...] "feels swift, <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> remarkably coherent", and that [...] "the visual effects designed by John Dykstra are smoothly and imaginatively integrated..." [...] Frank Lovece of Film Journal International lauded [...] "a wickedly smart script with a multilayered theme that ... never loses sight of its ultimate story, and makes each emotional motivation interlock, often shockingly playing for keeps with its characters.

500|$|Concept artist Tully Summers {{commented on}} Nolan's style of {{cinematography}} {{when asked about}} the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: [...] "The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One {{of the things that makes}} his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very <b>sleek</b> <b>and</b> product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film." [...] Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that [...] "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film." ...|$|E
