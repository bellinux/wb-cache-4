5|$|On December 1, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama {{announced}} {{his choice of}} Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. Senator from New York, as Secretary of State. Clinton was confirmed {{by a vote of}} 94-2 on January 21, 2009. Just hours before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton resigned her <b>senate</b> <b>seat,</b> effective immediately. This began a two-month search process to fill her vacant <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement. A special election would then be held in November 2010 {{for the remainder of the}} full term, which ended in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 1874, he was {{nominated}} as the West Virginia Democratic Party candidate for the West Virginia <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> at the party's Eleventh Senatorial District Convention in Petersburg. In November 1874 Clayton won his election to the <b>senate</b> <b>seat</b> and represented the district alongside R.B. Sherrard of Hardy County. Clayton first served in the West Virginia Legislature's 12th Legislative Session, which convened in Charleston on January 13, 1875, and adjourned on December 23, 1875. He served in the 13th Legislative Session of 1876, and in the 14th legislative session of 1877 when he served as senator from the Eleventh Senatorial District alongside David Pugh of Hampshire County. Clayton served {{in the state senate}} until 1879.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a clear {{majority of}} the House of Representatives were pledged to Crittenden for the open <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> However, Clay allies pressured Crittenden to step aside and allow Clay to be the Whig nominee. Crittenden obliged, and Clay was elected {{by a margin of}} nine votes over Richard M. Johnson. Crittenden went on to manage both the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of Richard Aylett Buckner and the campaign to help Clay win Kentucky in the 1832 presidential election. After Clay's defeat in 1832, he offered to resign his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> and allow Crittenden to succeed him, but Crittenden refused the offer. Later that year, Crittenden retired from the General Assembly.|$|E

5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat in a stunning upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.|$|E
5|$|Both House of Representatives seats {{have mostly}} been held by Labor, usually by {{comfortable}} margins. The Labor Party has polled {{at least seven}} percentage points more than the Liberal Party at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points. The ALP and the Liberal Party have always held one <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> each.|$|E
5|$|Following Brown's {{defeat in}} the 2012 U.S Senate race there was wide {{speculation}} that he would run again in 2013 due to John Kerry resigning from the other Massachusetts <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> to become Secretary of State. However, on February 1, 2013, he ruled out undertaking a third U.S. Senate campaign {{in less than four}} years.|$|E

50|$|The United States Senate elections, 2006 {{were held}} on November 7, 2006, with all 33 Class 1 <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> being contested. The {{term of office}} for those elected in 2006 ran from January 3, 2007, to January 3, 2013. Prior to the election, the Republican Party {{controlled}} 55 of the 100 <b>Senate</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{three classes}} of United States Senators {{are made up}} of 33 or 34 <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> each. The purpose of the classes is to {{determine}} which <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> will be up for election in a given year. The three groups are staggered so that one of them is up for election every two years, rather than having all 100 seats up for election at once. For example, the 33 <b>Senate</b> <b>seats</b> of Class 1 were elected in 2012, the 33 seats of Class 2 were up for election in 2014, and the 34 seats of Class 3 were up for election in 2016.|$|R
5|$|In 1874, Parker was {{the caucus}} nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> However, the {{political}} tide had shifted in Missouri; it seemed unlikely {{that he would}} be elected to the Senate, so he sought a presidential appointment as judge for the Western District of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E
5|$|In early 1843, Honório Hermeto {{became the}} head of the cabinet, and so long as the saquaremas {{remained}} in power, Caxias was secure in his position. After Honório Hermeto quarreled with PedroII a year later, he and the saquaremas resigned. The Liberals replaced the saquaremas in government, but Caxias was retained in his command. The War of the Ragamuffins took far longer to put down than had previous rebellions, but through careful negotiation and military victories, Caxias finally managed to pacify the province. The end of the armed conflict was declared on 1 March 1845. He was made a permanent field marshal on 25 March, and raised to the rank of count on 2 April. Caxias ran for a <b>Senate</b> <b>seat,</b> and being among the three candidates with the most votes, he was selected by the Emperor in late 1845 as the senator representing Rio Grande do Sul. He took his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> on 11 May 1846.|$|E

5|$|Jackson, {{leading the}} new Democratic Party, won the 1828 presidential election, and in March 1829 Eaton {{resigned}} his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> to accept appointment as Jackson's Secretary of War. The appointment was seemingly made because of Jackson's {{desire to have}} a personal friend in the Cabinet in whom he could confide.|$|E
5|$|Minton ran for {{re-election}} to his <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in 1940.

5|$|Tillman {{had long}} seen a <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> as a logical next step once he {{concluded}} {{his time as}} governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and {{did not support the}} forces trying to prevent Tillman's re-nomination in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did not bother to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's <b>Senate</b> <b>seat)</b> to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.|$|E
5|$|After {{being forced}} from Goldman Sachs in January 1999, Corzine campaigned for a New Jersey <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> after Frank Lautenberg {{announced}} his retirement.
