An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E

Emerald ash borer kills young trees several years before reaching their seeding age of 10 years. In both North America and Europe, the loss of ash from an ecosystem can result in increased numbers of invasive plants, changes in soil nutrients, and effects on species that feed on ash.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the {{previous}} Bond film, Licence to Kill, in July 1989, pre-production work for the third James Bond film starring Timothy Dalton, fulfilling his three-film contract, began in May 1990. A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, The Sunday Times reported that producer Albert R. Broccoli had parted company with writer Richard Maibaum, who had worked on the scripts of all but three Bond films <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>and</b> director John Glen, responsible for the previous five instalments of the series.

5|$|The {{match at}} Lord's was the {{following}} Monday, 10 June, {{and this time}} a full match could take place over three days. The North won by 3 wickets after scoring 180 and 226–7 in reply to the South's 202 and 203. Although his team lost, Grace could take consolation from his best batting performance of the season <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>and</b> his first half-century, as he scored 45 and 77. He had 9 wickets in the match with 5–60 and 4–89. The match was played {{for the benefit of}} the Marylebone Professional Cricketers' Fund and drew an attendance of 10,858 on the first day, which was Whit Monday.|$|E
5|$|The Big Four, {{along with}} Rod Laver, Tony Roche and Ivan Lendl, {{are the only}} men in Open Era history to reach the semifinals at all four Majors in a single {{calendar}} year.

Similarly, the Big Four make up four of the ten players to have made the semi-finals twice or more {{at each of the}} four Grand Slam events. Additionally, the Big Four make up four of the ten players to have reached the final at each of the four Grand Slam events. Finally, prior to 2003, no man had ever made 20 grand slam singles finals, with Ivan Lendl leading the way with 19 grand slam singles finals. However, since then, Federer (29), Nadal (23) and Djokovic (21) have each surpassed this mark.|$|E

5|$|The Russian forces, however, kept advancing. The Polish army, {{under the}} command of Józef Poniatowski, was still {{retreating}} in order, yielding to the more powerful enemy as necessary to avoid annihilation, according to the Prince's judgement. In early July, near Dubno, Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko were betrayed by Michał Lubomirski, who was tasked with King Poniatowski with resupplying the troops; instead Lubomirski joined the Russian side, and either hid the supplies for the Polish army, or outright passed them to the Russians. Lubomirski, however, was a powerful magnate, and it took until late May for the King to officially relieve him of his command. Within about a month of the Russian invasion, the Poles have mostly retreated from Ukraine. On 7 July Kościuszko's forces fought a delaying battle with the Russians at Volodymyr-Volynskyi (Battle of Włodzimierz). Meanwhile, Poniatowski's army retreated to the Bug River, where Kościuszko's units fought the Battle of Dubienka on 18 July to a draw. With about 5,300 troops Kościuszko defeated the attack of 25,000 Russians under General Michail Kachovski. Kośicuszko then had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians begun flanking his positions crossing the nearby Austrian border. Although the Poles had to retreat from the Bug River line, they were not defeated <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>and</b> a decisive battle or battles at more favorable locations closer to Warsaw were expected.|$|E
5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy {{said that it was}} worth it to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>and</b> suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E
5|$|The high scoring game set several {{school and}} conference records: the 132-point {{combined}} score was the highest-scoring {{game of the}} year in major college football (<b>so</b> <b>far),</b> <b>and</b> the highest in both the 131-year history of Michigan football and {{in the history of the}} Big Ten. The Illini's 65 points were the most ever allowed by Michigan. They also established Michigan records for combined points in a half (62) and combined points in a quarter (49). Michigan's previous records in those categories were: 130 points (vs. West Virginia, 1904), 55 points (vs. Chicago, 1939) and 39 points (vs. Penn State, 2005), respectively. This game was the highest scoring FBS game since Navy and North Texas met on November 10, 2007, which Navy won 74–62. Robinson threw a career-high 305 yards, as well as a school record 262 yards in the first half. Michigan's 419 passing yards broke the previous single game record of 396 yards, which was set against Michigan State in 1999. Roy Roundtree had a school-record 246 yards receiving, breaking the previous mark of 197 yards by Jack Clancy. The two teams combined for a total of 1,237 yards of offense, breaking the record of 1,189 set against Northwestern in 2000. With the win, Michigan became bowl eligible for the first time since Rich Rodriguez began his tenure as head coach.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} Kronan lie {{at a depth}} of 26m (85ft), 6km (3.7mi) east of Hulterstad, off the east coast of Öland. Since her rediscovery in 1980, there have been annual diving expeditions {{to the site of the}} wreck from June to August. By Baltic Sea standards, the {{conditions}} are good for underwater archaeological work; the wreck site is far from land, away from the regular shipping lanes, and has not been affected by pollution from the land or excessive growth of marine vegetation. The visibility, especially in early summer, is good and can be up to 20m. The seabed consists of mostly infertile sand that reflects much of the sunlight from the surface, aiding the surveying and documentation of the site with underwater cameras. Around 85% of the wreck site has been charted <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>and</b> Kronan has become one of the most extensive and well-publicized maritime archaeological projects in the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Under Grace's {{leadership}} at Lord's, the Gentlemen batted {{very well and}} totalled 310 {{on the first day}} before reducing the Players to 39–4 at the close. Grace scored 90, his highest score of the season <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>and</b> was well supported by Alfred and Edward Lyttelton. The Players recovered on Tuesday morning, thanks to a seventh wicket century stand by John Selby and Tom Emmett, to reach 231 all out which left the Gentlemen with a first innings lead of 79. Grace took 2–31. In the second innings, Grace was bowled by Shaw for 2 with the score at 6–1 but his opening partner A. P. Lucas steadied the innings with 91 and was well supported by Ridley, Edward Lyttelton and Steel. The Gentlemen finally amassed 326 to leave the Players needing 406 to win. They were never in the hunt and, although Selby was defiant with another half-century, Grace took 4–55 to lead the Gentlemen to victory.|$|E
