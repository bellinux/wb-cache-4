40|$|Probably, {{one test}} of the {{stability}} of the banking system is to evaluate how risky assets are distributed across banks’ portfolios and the implications for the contagion via interbank relations. This paper explores theoretically a bank sector with <b>risks</b> <b>concentration</b> and the functioning of interbank markets. It employs a simple model where banks are exposed to both credit and liquidity risk that suddenly correlate over the business cycle. We show that <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> makes interbank market breakdowns more likely and welfare monotonically decreases in <b>risk</b> <b>concentration...</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>concentration</b> <b>risk.</b> These types are based on the sources of the <b>risk.</b> <b>Concentration</b> <b>risk</b> can arise from uneven {{distribution}} of exposures (or loan) to its borrowers. Such a risk is called name <b>concentration</b> <b>risk.</b> Another type is sectoral <b>concentration</b> <b>risk,</b> which can arise from uneven distribution of exposures to particular sectors, regions, industries or products.|$|R

Logistic regression model was fitted to predict the Coronary Artery Disease with the help of <b>significant</b> <b>risk</b> factors and the odds ratios were computed for each <b>significant</b> <b>risk</b> factor.

40|$|Abstract: In {{financial}} conglomerates and insurance groups, enterprise risk management {{is becoming increasingly}} important in controlling and managing the different independent legal entities in the group. The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess and relate <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> and joint default probabilities of the group’s legal entities in order to achieve a more comprehensive picture of an insurance group’s <b>risk</b> situation. <b>Risk</b> <b>concentration</b> is measured using the con-cept of economic capital. We further examine the impact of the type of dependence structure on results by comparing linear and nonlinear dependencies using different copula concepts under certain distributional assumptions. Our results show that even if financial groups with different dependence structures do have the same <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> factor, joint default probabilities of different sets of subsidiaries can vary tremendously...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantification}} of diversification benefits due to risk aggregation plays {{a prominent}} role in the (regulatory) capital management of large firms within the financial industry. However, the complexity of today's risk landscape makes a quantifiable reduction of <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> a challenging task. In the present paper we discuss {{some of the issues that}} may arise. The theory of second-order regular variation and second-order subexponentiality provides the ideal methodological framework to derive second-order approximations for the <b>risk</b> <b>concentration</b> and the diversification benefit.

We use monthly balance-sheet and interest rate data for the Colombian banking system from 1997 to 2006. The evidence shows that, {{in the face of}} high risk, banks transfer a larger share of risk to customers through higher intermediation margins. The result suggests that systemic risk acts as a collusion" device for banks: while high concentration is not enough to have collusion, the true effects of high market concentration on interest rates´ mark-ups emerge when the system is under stress.
