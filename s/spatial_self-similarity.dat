40|$|The {{relative}} configurational entropy per cell as {{a function}} of length scale is a sensitive detector of <b>spatial</b> <b>self-similarity.</b> For Sierpinski carpets the equally separated peaks of the above function appear at the length scales that depend on the kind of the carpet. These peaks point to the presence of self-similarity even for randomly perturbed initial fractal sets. This is also demonstrated for the model population of particles diffusing over the surface considered by Van Siclen, Phys. Rev. E 56 (1997) 5211.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a wavelet-based watermarking method for copyright protection of still images. Watermarks are structured {{in such a}} way to attain <b>spatial</b> <b>self-similarity</b> with respect to a cartesian grid. Embedding and detection are performed in the wavelet domain allowing thus multiresolution detection. The novelty of the current approach is the use of self-similar watermarks (quasi scaleinvariant), which are expected to be robust against geometric transformations, especially scaling. The approach proves rather efficient against many kinds of distortions, such as linear and nonlinear filtering, JPEG compression, scaling, cropping and rotation. 1. INTRODUCTION Copyright protection of multimedia content is nowadays an allincreasing demand especially with the drastic expand of Internet and web-based services. To address this demand, watermarking methods have been developed. They are distinguished in two classes according to the domain where embedding is performed: the spatialdomain [...] ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Spatial</b> {{aggregation}} and <b>self-similarity</b> are {{two important}} properties in species spatial distribution analysis and modeling. The aggregation parameter k {{in the negative}} binomial distribution model and fractal dimension are two widely used measures of <b>spatial</b> aggregation and <b>self-similarity,</b> respectively. In this paper, we attempt to describe <b>spatial</b> aggregation and <b>self-similarity</b> using nearest neighbor methods. Specifically, nearest neighbor methods are used to calculate k and box-counting fractal dimension of species spatial distribution. First, five scaling patterns of k are identified for tree species in a tropical rainforest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Based on the scaling patterns and {{the means of the}} nth nearest neighbor distance (NND), the mean NND of higher ranks can be accurately predicted. Second, we describe how to use the theoretical probability distribution model of the nth NND for a homogeneous Poisson process on regular fractals to estimate the fractal dimension. The results indicate that the fractal dimensions estimated using the nearest neighbor method are consistent with those estimated using the scale-area method for 85 tree species on BCI (abundance a parts per thousand yen 100 individuals and a parts per thousand currency sign 5000 individuals). For other tree species, the breakdown of self-similarity in estimates of fractal dimension causes these two methods to be inconsistent. The applicability of the nearest neighbor method is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} on {{the interface}} modes in a heterostructure consisting of a semi-infinite metallic layer and a semi-infinite Fibonacci quasi-periodic structure. Various properties of the interface modes, such as their <b>spatial</b> localizations, <b>self-similarities,</b> and multifractal properties are studied. The interface modes decay exponentially in different ways and the modes in the lower stable gap possess highest spatial localization. A localization index is introduced to understand the localization properties of the interface modes. We found that the localization index of the interface modes in the upper stable gap will converge to two slightly different constants according to the parity of the Fibonacci generation. In addition, the localization-delocalization transition {{is also found in}} the interface modes of the transient gap. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the spatial deployment of base stations (BSs) {{is the first}} step to facilitate the performance analyses of cellular networks, as well as the design of efficient networking protocols. Poisson point process (PPP) has been widely adopted to characterize the deployment of BSs and established the reputation to give tractable results in the stochastic geometry analyses. However, given the total randomness assumption in PPP, its accuracy has been recently questioned. On the other hand, the actual deployment of BSs during the past long evolution is highly correlated with heavy-tailed human activities. The α-stable distribution, one kind of heavy-tailed distributions, has demonstrated superior accuracy to statistically model the spatial density of BSs. In this paper, we start with the new findings on α-stable distributed BSs deployment and investigate the intrinsic feature (i. e., the <b>spatial</b> <b>self-similarity)</b> embedded in the BSs. Based on these findings, we perform the coverage probability analyses and provide the relevant theoretical results. In particular, we show that for some special cases, our work could reduce to the fundamental work by J. G. Andrews. We also examine the network performance under extensive simulation settings and validate that the simulations results are consistent with our theoretical derivations...|$|E
40|$|Two {{complementary}} methodologies {{are described}} {{to quantify the}} effects of crack-tip stress triaxiality (constraint) on the macroscopic measures of elastic-plastic fracture toughness, J and CTOD. In the continuum mechanics methodology, two parameters, J and Q, suffice to characterize {{the full range of}} near-tip environments at the onset of fracture. J sets the size scale of the zone of high stresses and large deformations while Q scales the near-tip stress level relative to a high triaxiality reference stress state. The material's fracture resistance is characterized by a toughness locus, Jc(Q), which defines the sequence of J-Q values at fracture determined by experiment from high constraint conditions (Q=O) to low constraint conditions (Q < 0). A micromechanics methodology is described which predicts the toughness locus using crack-tip stress fields and critical J-values from a few fracture toughness tests. A robust micromechanics model for cleavage fracture has evolved from the observations of a strong, <b>spatial</b> <b>self-similarity</b> of crack-tip principal stresses under increased loading and across different fracture specimens. The micromechanics model employs the volume of material bounded within principal stress contours at fracture to correlate Jc values for different specimens and loading modes. This report explores the fundamental concepts of the J-Q description of crack-tip fields, the fracture toughness locus and micromechanics approaches to predict the variability of macroscopic fracture toughness with constraint under elastic-plastic conditions. Computational results are presented for a surface cracked plate containing a 6 : 1 semi-elliptical, a=t/ 4 flaw subjected to remote uniaxial and biaxial tension. Crack-tip stress fields consistent with the J-Q theory are demonstrated to exist at each location along the crack front. The micromechanics model employs the J-Q description of crack-front stresses to interpret fracture toughness values measured on laboratory specimens for fracture assessment of the surface cracked plate. The computational results suggest only a minor effect of the biaxial loading on the crack tip stress fields and, consequently, on the propensity for fracture relative to the uniaxial loading. U. S.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} large {{networks}} of limit cycle oscillators. A limit cycle oscillator is a dynamical {{system that has}} a periodic attractor in phase space, and is defined in continuous time. To each such oscillator one can associate a natural frequency. Virtually all biological systems that show periodic oscillations {{can be seen as}} limit cycle oscillators. The same is true for oscillating mechanical or electrical systems that are driven and damped. We study lattices of limit cycle oscillators in the thermodynamic limit where the number of oscillators goes to infinity. The natural frequencies are assigned randomly in the lattice from a given density function. If the width s of this density function is small enough, and the coupling strength g between the oscillators is large enough, it may happen that a non-zero portion r of the oscillators attain the same frequency. A phase transition towards temporal order takes place when a system parameter (e. g. s or g) is changed so that r becomes non-zero. Such a phase transition can be seen, for example, in an applauding theatre audience. Suddenly everyone may find themselves clapping in unison. Another example is the onset of an epileptic fit. Then an abnormally large portion of the brain cells synchronise their electrical activity. We study one-dimensional oscillator chains for two different types of oscillator models. One type applies generally in the limits of small s and small g. The other type applies for many kinds of oscillators that interact with short pulses. In both cases we prove analytically that there is a critical coupling strength g (at a given s), at which the system switches from no frequency order (r = 0) to perfect order (r = 1). We also study two-dimensional oscillator lattices numerically. The oscillators interact with short pulses. We find that there is one phase transition to partial frequency order (0 < r < 1) as g increases, and a second transition to perfect frequency order (r = 1). Between these phase transitions the system seems critical, with <b>spatial</b> <b>self-similarity</b> and infinite transient time. A more applied part of the study deals with the sinus node. The sinus node is the natural pacemaker of the heart. It consists of millions of cells, each of which is a limit cycle oscillator that fires electrical signals with its own natural frequency. All these cells attain the same working frequency in the healthy heart, and thus stimulate the cardiac muscle to contract regularly. By means of simulations we investigate which cardiac arrhythmias may arise from a backward phase transition at which this perfect frequency order is lost. We find that most cardiac rhythm disorders associated with a malfunctioning sinus node can be produced by this condition. We also put forward the hypothesis that some features of the sinus node have evolved to protect it from going through such a backward phase transition. We support this hypothesis by means of simulation and argumentation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{performance}} of a new packet trace compression method based on clustering of TCP flows. With our proposed method, the compression ratio that we achieve is around 3 %, reducing the file size, for instance, from 100 MB to 3 MB. Although this specification denes a lossy compressed data format, it preserves important statistical properties present into original trace such as <b>self-similarity,</b> <b>spatial</b> and temporal locality. In order to validate the method, memory performance studies were done using Commbench and Netbench benchmarks. To give support to these studies, measurements were taken of memory access and cache miss ratio. For the time, the results have showed that the decompressed traces represent a good aproximation of original traces...|$|R
40|$|Fractal {{geometry}} is {{a potentially}} valuable tool for quantitatively characterizing complex structures. The fractal dimension (D) {{can be used}} as a simple, single index for summarizing properties of real and abstract structures in space and time. Applications in the fields of biology and ecology range from neurobiology to plant architecture, landscape structure, taxonomy and species diversity However, methods to estimate the D have often been applied in an uncritical manner, violating assumptions about the nature of fractal structures. The most common error involves ignoring the fact that ideal, i. e. infinitely nested, fractal structures exhibit self-similarity over any range of scales. Unlike ideal fractals, real-world structures exhibit self-similarity only over a finite range of scales. Here we present a new technique for quantitatively determining the scales over which real-world structures show statistical self-similarity. The new technique uses a combination of curve-fitting and tests of curvilinearity of residuals to identify the largest range of contiguous scales that exhibit statistical self-similarity. Consequently, we estimate D only over the statistically identified region of self-similarity and introduce the finite scale-corrected dimension (FSCD). Mie demonstrate the use of this method in two steps. First, using mathematical fractal curves with known but variable <b>spatial</b> scales of <b>self-similarity</b> (achieved by varying the iteration level used for creating the curves), we demonstrate that our method can reliably quantify the <b>spatial</b> scales of <b>self-similarity.</b> This technique therefore allows accurate empirical quantification of theoretical Ds. Secondly, we apply the technique to digital images of the rhizome systems of golden rod (Solidago altissima). The technique significantly reduced variations in estimated fractal dimensions arising from variations in the method of preparing digital images. Overall, the revised method has the potential to significantly improve repeatability and reliability for deriving fractal dimensions of real-world branching structures...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} Stochastic Space Random Cascade (SSRC) {{approach}} to downscale precipitation from a Global Climate Model (hereon, GCM s) for an Italian Alpine watershed, the Oglio river (1440 km 2). The SSRC model is locally tuned upon Oglio river for spatial downscaling (approx. 2 km) of daily precipitation from the NCAR Parallel Climate Model. We use a 10 years (1990 – 1999) series of observed daily precipitation data from 25 rain gages. Scale Recursive Estimation coupled with Expectation Maximization algorithm {{is used for}} model estimation. Seasonal parameters of the multiplicative cascade are accommodated by statistical distributions conditioned upon climatic forcing, based on regression analysis. The main advantage of the SSRC is to reproduce <b>spatial</b> clustering, intermittency, <b>self-similarity</b> of precipitation fields and their spatial correlation structure, with low computational burden...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of the basic physical parameters of vacuum arc cathode spots is very difficult due to their small dimensions and short existence times. Values given in the literature for the spot diameter range from less than 10 micrometer up to some hundred micrometers, and spot existence times vary from nanoseconds to some microseconds, caused {{by the use of}} different measuring techniques. Using specially designed optical equipment for emission photography, we found structures of cathode spot clusters (short exposure times) and cathode spot traces (long exposure times) which are similar on different spatial scales covering the range from hundreds of micrometers down to 10 micrometer. The light spot traces were found to be similar to scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures of cathode spot craters, the latter having a higher <b>spatial</b> resolution. The <b>self-similarity</b> over three ranges of magnitude in spatial resolution shows the fractal nature of vacuum arc cathode spot traces...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne big {{challenge}} in computer vision is to extract robust and discriminative local descriptors. For many {{applications such as}} object tracking, image classification or image matching, there exist appearance-based descriptors such as SIFT or learned CNN-features that provide very good results. But for some other applications such as multimodal image comparison (infra-red versus color, color versus depth, [...] .) these descriptors failed and people resort to using the <b>spatial</b> distribution of <b>self-similarities.</b> The idea is to inform about the similarities between local regions in an image rather than the appearances of these regions at the pixel level. Nevertheless, the classical self-similarities are not invariant to rotation in the image space, so that two rotated versions of a local patch are not considered as similar {{and we think that}} many discriminative information is lost because of this weakness. In this paper, we present a method to extract rotation-invariant self similarities. In this aim, we propose to compare color descriptors of the local regions rather than the local regions themselves. Furthermore, since this comparison informs us about the relative orientations of the two local regions, we incorporate this information in the final image descriptor in order to increase the discriminative power of the system. We show that the self similarities extracted by this way are very discriminative...|$|R
40|$|Our goal is {{to explore}} the {{relationship}} between two traditionally unrelated concepts, fractal structure and entropy production, evaluating both within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Fractals are temporal or <b>spatial</b> structures with <b>self-similarity</b> across scales of measurement; whereas entropy production represents the necessary exportation of entropy to our environment that comes with metabolism and life. Fractals may be measured by their fractal dimension; and human entropy production may be estimated by oxygen and glucose metabolism. In this paper, we observe fractal structures ubiquitously present in the CNS, and explore a hypothetical and unexplored link between fractal structure and entropy production, as measured by oxygen and glucose metabolism. Rapid increase in both fractal structures and metabolism occur with childhood and adolescent growth, followed by slow decrease during aging. Concomitant increases and decreases in fractal structure and metabolism occur with cancer vs. Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis, respectively. In addition to fractals being related to entropy production, we hypothesize that the emergence of fractal structures spontaneously occurs because a fractal is more efficient at dissipating energy gradients, thus maximizing entropy production. Experimental evaluation and further understanding of limitations and necessary conditions are indicated to address broad scientific and clinical implications of this work...|$|R
