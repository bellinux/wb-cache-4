50|$|The {{original}} FT101 Series (1971-1977) had dual conversion, with 5 MHz Receiver first IF, a {{very stable}} and linear 9 MHz VFO and 3.2 MHz 2nd IF. They had a 12BY7A tube driver feeding two 6JS6C television sweep tubes providing a nominal output power of 130 watts {{peak envelope power}} in single sideband, 90 watts continuous wave and 40 watts amplitude modulation. The 6JS6C tubes are matched to the antenna through a conventional pi network. This transforms 3000 ohm output impedance of the tubes to a low impedance, typically 25 to 200 Ohms. These tubes were common to television <b>sweep</b> <b>circuits</b> in the day, and were in practice just as rugged and reliable in amateur service as genuine transmitter tubes such as the 6146.|$|R
50|$|The timebase is an {{electronic}} circuit that generates a ramp voltage. This is a voltage that changes continuously and linearly with time. When it reaches a predefined value the ramp is reset and settles to its starting value. When a trigger event is recognized, provided the reset process (holdoff) is complete, the ramp starts again. The timebase voltage usually drives the horizontal amplifier. Its {{effect is to}} sweep the screen end of the electron beam at a constant speed {{from left to right}} across the screen, then blank the beam and return its deflection voltages to the left, so to speak, in time to begin the next <b>sweep.</b> Typical <b>sweep</b> <b>circuits</b> can take significant time to reset; in some CROs, fast sweeps required more time to retrace than to sweep.|$|R

Scott held in excess of 100 patents in electronics. In 1957, the company moved to Maynard, MA. In 1985, the company was purchased by Emerson Electronics.

50|$|During World War II, a few {{oscilloscopes}} {{used for}} radar development (and a few laboratory oscilloscopes) had so-called driven sweeps. These sweep circuits remained dormant, with the CRT beam cut off, until a drive pulse from an external device unblanked the CRT {{and started a}} constant-speed horizontal trace; the calibrated speed permitted measurement of time intervals. When the sweep was complete, the <b>sweep</b> <b>circuit</b> blanked the CRT (turned off the beam), reset itself, {{and waited for the}} next drive pulse. The Dumont 248, a commercially available oscilloscope produced in 1945, had this feature.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{waveform}} monitors {{were entirely}} analog devices; the incoming (analog) video signal was filtered and amplified, {{and the resulting}} voltage was used to drive the vertical axis of a cathode ray tube. A sync stripper circuit was used to isolate the sync pulses and colorburst from the video signal; the recovered sync information was fed to a <b>sweep</b> <b>circuit</b> which drove the horizontal axis. Early waveform monitors differed little from oscilloscopes, except for the specialized video trigger circuitry. Waveform monitors also {{permit the use of}} external reference; in this mode the sync and burst signals are taken from a separate input (thus allowing all devices in a facility to be genlocked, or synchronized to the same timing source).|$|E

The resistance furnaces are capable to reach temperatures of 25 OO°C. The diversity of the safety design of the cooling system and an automatic temperature setting render possible long-term tests without operating personnel. Depending upon the scope, various operation sequences can be chosen. Fission gas annealing tests at irradiation temperatures to determine failure quota are normal experimental routine.

Actually, the CRT is a specially modified unit based on a standard Tektronix oscilloscope modified to only be driven by D-A converters and an intensifier interface; there are no <b>sweep</b> <b>circuits</b> as found in conventional oscilloscopes. Most of the modifications involve custom highly stripped down plug in modules, which also house the actual knobs hooked to the lowest A-D channels. Arguably, this is the precursor to the modern mouse interface; some software utilized knob twirling in a manner that would later suggest the two-dimensional form of a mouse; these are knobs controlling only one parameter at a time, etc.|$|R

40|$|One way of {{performing}} indoor localization of objects is {{by means of}} Angle of Arrival (AoA). This technology {{is based on a}} phased antenna array which estimates the angle of arrival of an incident wave transmitted by a mobile node. This is achieved by measuring the relative phase shifts between the received signals. This paper presents the construction of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) which synchronizes on the carrier transmitted by the mobile node in order to provide a carrier at exactly the same frequency and a reference phase to the receiving antenna elements. The PLL is designed to operate at 2. 4 GHz which holds additional challenges. Since, at this frequency, the most commonly available phase detectors are of the frequency insensitive EXOR type, the PLL will, besides the standard PLL building blocks, such as phase detector, a loop filter and a voltage controlled oscillator, need a <b>sweep</b> <b>circuit.</b> On top of that, sufficient amplification and filtering of the received signal will be mandatory. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 16, 1986 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaIn this paper, the 70 MHz IF {{differential}} binary {{phase shift}} keying (DBPSK) modem is designed and implemented. At the transmitter, the data are first differentially encoded, and then sent to the binary phase modulator, which {{is followed by a}} delicatedly designed band pass filter to suppress the undesired sideband spectrum. At the receiver, the DBPSK signal is coherently demodulated by a Costas loop which is carefully analyzed and designed in this paper. In order to maintain the overall loop gain within a desired range for keeping a better loop performance, an IF preconditioning AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit is added in the demodulator to keep the IF amplifier output level almost constant even at low signal to noise ratio. In order to improve the false lock due to the data sideband, especially for low rate modems, and to enhance acquisition, a modified Costas loop and an automatic <b>sweep</b> search acquisition <b>circuit</b> are included in the demodulator. Besides the carrier recovery, the bit rate clock must be recovered from the received DBPSK signal. Instead of serial processing, i. e., clock recovery comes after carrier recovery, a parallel processing of the received DBPSK signal is employed, i. e., clock recovery is parallel to carrier recovery. In other words, the carrier and clock recovery circuits independently process the same received DBPSK signal at the same time. The advantages obtained from the parallel processing are faster overall system acquisition and reduction of information loss. The recovered clock is derived from a bandlimited DBPSK signal by an envelope detector followed by a phase-locked loop (PLL). The key features of this suboptimum clock recovery circuits are simplicity and low cost for practical hardware implementation. An example for modem design will be given and the modem will be implemented and then tested. Parameters selection and hardware implementation of important building blocks in the modem circuit are all given careful consideration. Furthermore, the block of the IF AGC, modified Costas loop scheme and <b>sweep</b> search <b>circuits</b> will also be described with emphasis on their key functions.

40|$|THIS thesis {{explores the}} {{development}} of a very high frequency DC-DC resonant boost converter. The topology examined features low parts count and fast transient response but suffers from higher device stresses compared to other topologies that use a larger number of passive components. A new design methodology for the proposed converter topology is developed. This design procedure - unlike previous design methodologies for similar topologies - is based on direct analysis of the topology and does not rely on lengthy time-domain simulation <b>sweeps</b> across <b>circuit</b> parameters to identify good designs. Additionally, a method to design semiconductor devices that are suitable for use in the proposed VHF power converter is presented. When the main semiconductor switch is fabricated in a integrated power process where the designer has control over the device layout, large performance gains can be achieved by considering parasitics and loss mechanisms that are important to operation at VHF when designing the device. A method to find the optimal device for a particular converter design is presented. The new design methodology is combined with the device optimization technique to enable the designer to rapidly find the optimal combination of converter and device design for a given specification. To validate the proposed converter topology, design methodology, and device optimization, a 75 MHz prototype converter is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The performance of the prototype closely matches that predicted by the design procedure, and achieves good efficiency over a wide input voltage range. by Justin Burkhart. Thesis (S. M.)
