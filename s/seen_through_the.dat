5|$|The band {{recorded}} …And Justice for All {{during early}} 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Musically, {{the album is}} progressive, with long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It is noted for its sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the mixing process. The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close {{personal}} friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of a northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, a Flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden {{offered a}} £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a {{magazine}} advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in {{a body of water}} such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{adaptation}} to the screen has continued with the trend of including new scenes to flesh out characters that in the book are only superficially <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> point of view characters. These include the dialectical confrontation between Littlefinger and Varys, and the conversation between King Robert and Queen Cersei, and the young lovers Renly and Loras. The show's writers used this opportunity to make explicit Loras and Renly's ongoing assignations, which were only hinted at in the books.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{which acts}} as a {{companion}} to Type-0, was set {{in the world of}} Orience during a time of war between its four nations. The story is <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of a player-created Cadet entering the Rubrum Magical Academy during a time of war, and chosen to become the Agito, a figure destined to save Orience from destruction. The original protagonists of Type-0 appear in different roles and act as secondary characters. The story was intended to be played repeatedly, tying into the nature of the game's world and the eventual culmination of a player becoming the Agito.|$|E

5|$|At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin {{began work}} {{related to her}} {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in {{the expansion of the}} Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. The effect is now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.|$|E
5|$|Each holiday season, from Light Up Night in November through Epiphany in January, the Pittsburgh Crèche delights {{visitors}} to downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh Creche, a larger-than-life nativity scene, is the world’s only authorized {{replica of the}} Vatican’s Christmas crèche, on display in St. Peter’s Square in Rome. Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Art also displays a Neapolitan presepio. Handcrafted between 1700 and 1830, the presepio has lifelike figures and colorful details that re-create the Nativity within a vibrant and detailed panorama of 18th-century Italian village life. More than 100 superbly modeled human and angelic figures, along with animals, accessories, and architectural elements, cover 250 square feet and create a memorable depiction of the Nativity as <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of Neapolitan artisans and collectors.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Centurion was {{transferred}} to the Eastern Fleet and was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet in May–June to escort Convoy M.W. 11 from Alexandria to Malta in June as part of Operation Vigorous. She was assigned in the hopes of deceiving the Axis about the presence of an operational battleship; the Italians seem to have <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> deception by the time the convoy sailed on 13 June, although the Germans were deceived. Two days later, the ship was slightly damaged by near misses when attacked by nine dive bombers; her Oerlikon cannon shot one of them down. Centurion was scuttled as a breakwater during the Invasion of Normandy off Omaha Beach on 9 June 1944 to protect a mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.|$|E

The {{timeline}} of the Dream arc has been reset, {{although it is}} now <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal. Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E
5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> prism of domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{structure}} {{influenced the}} biographical films Lawrence of Arabia and —which {{begin with the}} subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller Mr. Arkadin. Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to Mr. Arkadin, {{as well as the}} theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with Citizen Kane and including The Magnificent Ambersons, Mr. Arkadin and Chimes at Midnight. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in Citizen Kane.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E

5|$|The way Caracalla {{wanted to}} be portrayed to his people can be <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> many {{surviving}} busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins, Caracalla was shown with laureate after becoming Augustus in 197 while Geta is bareheaded until he himself became Augustus in 209. Between 209 and their father's death in February211, both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready {{to take over the}} empire. Between the death of the father and the assassination of Geta towards the end of 211, Caracalla's portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a long beard with hair strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Geta's effort to be seen as the true successor to their father, an effort that came to naught when he was murdered. Caracalla's presentation on coins during the period of his co-reign with his father, from 198 to 210, are in broad terms in line with the third-century imperial representation; most coin types communicate military and religious messages, with other coins giving messages of saeculum aureum and virtues. During Caracalla's sole reign, from 212 to 217, a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages; others had non-specific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracalla's sole rule.|$|E
