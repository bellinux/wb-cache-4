5|$|Helium was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium {{were found in the}} natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of <b>superfluidity</b> in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E
5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of <b>superfluidity)</b> and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Fritz London {{proposed}} BEC as {{a mechanism}} for <b>superfluidity</b> in 4He and superconductivity.|$|E
25|$|Scientists and technologists {{routinely}} achieve temperatures {{close to}} absolute zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as superconductivity and <b>superfluidity.</b>|$|E
25|$|His {{research}} {{focuses on}} cuprate superconductivity, conceptual issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, <b>superfluidity</b> in highly degenerate atomic gases, low temperature properties of amorphous solids and topological quantum computation.|$|E
25|$|The {{coherence}} in <b>superfluidity</b> {{should not}} be attributed to any subset of helium atoms; {{it is a kind}} of collective phenomena in which all the atoms are involved (similar to Cooper-pairing in superconductivity, as indicated in the next section).|$|E
25|$|Generalizations of BCS {{theory for}} {{conventional}} superconductors {{form the basis}} for understanding of the phenomenon of <b>superfluidity,</b> because they fall into the lambda transition universality class. The extent to which such generalizations can be applied to unconventional superconductors is still controversial.|$|E
25|$|Absolute zero {{cannot be}} achieved, {{although}} {{it is possible to}} reach temperatures close to it through the use of cryocoolers, dilution refrigerators, and nuclear adiabatic demagnetization. The use of laser cooling has produced temperatures less than a billionth of a kelvin. At very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero, matter exhibits many unusual properties, including superconductivity, <b>superfluidity,</b> and Bose–Einstein condensation. To study such phenomena, scientists have worked to obtain even lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The Russian physics school {{began with}} Lomonosov who {{proposed}} {{the law of}} conservation of matter preceding the energy conservation law. Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the electric arc, electrodynamical Lenz's law, space groups of crystals, photoelectric cell, <b>superfluidity,</b> Cherenkov radiation, electron paramagnetic resonance, heterotransistors and 3D holography. Lasers and masers were co-invented by Nikolai Basov and Alexander Prokhorov, while the idea of tokamak for controlled nuclear fusion was introduced by Igor Tamm, Andrei Sakharov and Lev Artsimovich, leading eventually the modern international ITER project, where Russia is a party.|$|E
25|$|While quantum {{mechanics}} primarily {{applies to the}} smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale. <b>Superfluidity,</b> the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an electric current) at sufficiently low temperatures. The fractional quantum Hall effect is a topological ordered state which corresponds to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement. States with different topological orders (or different patterns of long range entanglements) cannot change into each other without a phase transition.|$|E
25|$|Protium is a spin 1/2 {{subatomic}} particle {{and is therefore}} a fermion. Other fermions include neutrons, electrons, and the radioactive isotope tritium. Fermions are governed by Pauli's exclusion principle, where no two particles can have the same quantum number. However, bosons like deuterium and photons, are not bound by exclusion and multiple particles can occupy the same energy state. This fundamental difference in 1H and 2H manifests in many physical properties. Integer spin particles like deuterium follow Bose-Einstein statistics while fermions with half integer spins follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Wave functions that describe multiple fermions must be antisymmetric with respect to swapping particles, while boson wave functions are symmetric. Because bosons are indistinguishable and can occupy the same state, collections of bosons behave very differently than fermions at colder temperatures. As bosons are cooled and relaxed to the lowest energy state, phenomena like <b>superfluidity</b> and superconductivity occur.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, Pyotr Kapitsa, John Allen and Don Misener {{discovered}} that helium-4 became {{a new kind}} of fluid, now known as a superfluid, at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the lambda point). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero viscosity (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of quantized vortices. It was quickly believed that the <b>superfluidity</b> was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). Superfluid helium-4 is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that helium-3, a fermion, also enters a superfluid phase (at a much lower temperature) which {{can be explained by the}} formation of bosonic Cooper pairs of two atoms (see also fermionic condensate).|$|E
500|$|At Caltech, Feynman {{investigated}} {{the physics of}} the <b>superfluidity</b> of supercooled liquid helium, where helium seems to display a complete lack of viscosity when flowing. [...] Feynman provided a quantum-mechanical explanation for the Soviet physicist Lev Landau's theory of <b>superfluidity.</b> Applying the Schrödinger equation to the question showed that the superfluid was displaying quantum mechanical behavior observable on a macroscopic scale. This helped {{with the problem of}} superconductivity, but the solution eluded Feynman. It was solved with the BCS theory of superconductivity, proposed by John Bardeen, Leon Neil Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer.|$|E
500|$|Richard Phillips Feynman ( [...] ; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American {{theoretical}} physicist {{known for}} his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the <b>superfluidity</b> of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa {{discovered that}} helium-4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero, a phenomenon now called <b>superfluidity.</b> This phenomenon {{is related to}} Bose–Einstein condensation. In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3, but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson. The phenomenon in helium-3 {{is thought to be}} related to pairing of helium-3 fermions to make bosons, in analogy to Cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity. |author = Osheroff, D.

2500|$|The {{phenomena}} of <b>superfluidity</b> of a Bose gas and superconductivity of a strongly-correlated Fermi gas (a gas of Cooper pairs) are tightly connected to Bose–Einstein condensation.

In this sense, the superconductivity is often called the <b>superfluidity</b> of Fermi gas.

2500|$|Early in {{the study}} of <b>superfluidity,</b> Penrose and Onsager {{proposed}} a metric ("order parameter") for <b>superfluidity.</b> [...] It was represented by a macroscopic factored component (a macroscopic eigenvalue) in the first-order reduced density matrix. [...] Later, C. N. Yang [...] proposed a more generalized measure of macroscopic quantum coherence, called [...] "Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order" [...] (ODLRO), that included fermion as well as boson systems. [...] ODLRO exists whenever there is a macroscopically large factored component (eigenvalue) in a reduced density matrix of any order. [...] <b>Superfluidity</b> corresponds to a large factored component in the first-order reduced density matrix. [...] (And, all higher order reduced density matrices behave similarly.) [...] Superconductivity involves a large factored component in the 2nd-order ("Cooper electron-pair") reduced density matrix.|$|E
2500|$|The reduced density {{matrices}} used {{to describe}} macroscopic quantum coherence in superfluids are formally {{the same as the}} correlation functions {{used to describe}} orders of coherence in radiation. [...] Both are examples of macroscopic quantum coherence. [...] The macroscopically large coherent component, plus noise, in the electromagnetic field, as given by Glauber's description of signal-plus-noise, is formally the same as the macroscopically large superfluid component plus normal fluid component in the two-fluid model of <b>superfluidity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Magnons, {{electron}} spin waves, {{can be controlled}} by a magnetic field. [...] Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of <b>superfluidity.</b> In 1999 condensation was demonstrated in antiferromagnetic TlCuCl3, at temperatures as large as 14 K. The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) {{is due to the}} magnons small mass (near an electron) and greater achievable density. In 2006, condensation in a ferromagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet thin film was seen even at room temperature, with optical pumping.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Anthony James Leggett [...] (born 26 March 1938), {{has been}} a {{professor}} of physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 1983.

He has shaped the theoretical understanding of normal and superfluid helium liquids and strongly coupled superfluids. He set directions for research in the quantum physics of macroscopic dissipative systems and use of condensed systems to test the foundations of quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|An {{inviscid}} fluid has no viscosity, [...] In practice, an inviscid flow is an idealization, {{one that}} facilitates mathematical treatment. In fact, purely inviscid flows are only {{known to be}} realized {{in the case of}} <b>superfluidity.</b> Otherwise, fluids are generally viscous, a property that is often most important within a boundary layer near a solid surface, where the flow must match onto the no-slip condition at the solid. In some cases, the mathematics of a fluid mechanical system can be treated by assuming that the fluid outside of boundary layers is inviscid, and then matching its solution onto that for a thin laminar boundary layer.|$|E
2500|$|Presently known [...] "super" [...] {{states of}} matter are superconductors, {{superfluid}} liquids and gases, and supersolids. Egor Babaev predicted that if hydrogen and deuterium have liquid metallic states, {{they might have}} quantum ordered states that cannot be classified as superconducting or superfluid in the usual sense. Instead, they might represent two possible novel types of quantum fluids: superconducting superfluids and metallic superfluids. Such fluids were predicted to have highly unusual reactions to external magnetic fields and rotations, which might provide a means for experimental verification of Babaev's predictions. It has also been suggested that, {{under the influence of}} magnetic field, hydrogen might exhibit phase transitions from superconductivity to <b>superfluidity</b> and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{they have}} proven useful in {{exploring}} {{a wide range}} of questions in fundamental physics, and the years since the initial discoveries by the JILA and MIT groups have seen an increase in experimental and theoretical activity. Examples include experiments that have demonstrated interference between condensates due to wave–particle duality, the study of <b>superfluidity</b> and quantized vortices, the creation of bright matter wave solitons from Bose condensates confined to one dimension, and the slowing of light pulses to very low speeds using electromagnetically induced transparency. Vortices in Bose–Einstein condensates are also currently the subject of analogue gravity research, studying the possibility of modeling black holes and their related phenomena in such environments in the laboratory. Experimenters have also realized [...] "optical lattices", where the interference pattern from overlapping lasers provides a periodic potential. These have been used to explore the transition between a superfluid and a Mott insulator, and may be useful in studying Bose–Einstein condensation in fewer than three dimensions, for example the Tonks–Girardeau gas.|$|E
2500|$|A Bose–Einstein {{condensate}} (BEC) is {{a collection}} of boson atoms that are all in the same quantum state. [...] In a thermodynamic system, the ground state becomes macroscopically occupied below a critical temperature [...] roughly when the thermal deBroglie wavelength is longer than the interatomic spacing. <b>Superfluidity</b> in liquid Helium-4 is believed {{to be associated with the}} Bose–Einstein condensation in an ideal gas. [...] But 4He has strong interactions, and the liquid structure factor (a 2nd-order statistic) plays an important role. [...] The use of a coherent state to represent the superfluid component of 4He provided a good estimate of the condensate / non-condensate fractions in superfluidity,consistent with results of slow neutron scattering. Most of the special superfluid properties follow directly from the use of a coherent state to represent the superfluid component [...] that acts as a macroscopically occupied single-body state with well-defined amplitude and phase over the entire volume. [...] (The superfluid component of 4He goes from zero at the transition temperature to 100% at absolute zero. But the condensate fraction is about 6% at absolute zero temperature, T=0K.) ...|$|E
