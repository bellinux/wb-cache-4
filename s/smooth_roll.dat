40|$|In Micro-rolling process, {{metal sheet}} is {{imprinted}} with micron level textures by feeding into {{the gap between}} one <b>smooth</b> <b>roll</b> and one textured roll. To enhance the rollability of thin metal sheet and dimensional accuracy, high density current is sent through workpiece to soften the material by increasing temperature. This manufacturing process is called by Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling (EAμR). EAμR, as a high efficiency and environment protection manufacturing process, {{can be used for}} production of key components in Micro-electromechanical Systems and bio-engineering. To control the quality of product, it is essential to monitor the pressure distribution in workpiece-roll interface during micro-rolling process. Comparing with process monitoring in conventional rolling process, sensing method in micro-rolling process monitoring not only demands to maintain surface integrity of roll surface, but also is limited by narrow space for sensors installation. Thus, a new sensing method based on embedded capacitance sensor array has been developed and prototyped for real-time monitoring in Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling process. In the optimal structural design of embedded sensor, Finite element modeling is investigated to study the influence of sensor parameters and electrical current on sensor. To improve the spatial resolution of embedded sensor array mounted in a limited space, a new pressure reconstruction algorithm is presented to retrieve continuous spatial distribution of rolling pressure from a limited number of measured points. In this context, three research tasks has been identified and examined {{during the course of this}} thesis: 1) Design of a new embedded sensing method and its modeling The new sensing method monitors micro-rolling process by an embedded capacitance sensor array integrated into <b>smooth</b> <b>roll</b> of micro-rolling mill. The new embedded sensor using limited sensor installation space provides a new method to measure contact pressure between roller and workpiece without damaging the roller surface. It consists of a cylindrical plastic rod as the physical carrier of sensor array, a group of metal foils attached on cylindrical surface as receiving layer of capacitance array, and a thin plastic film as dielectric material of capacitance. The excitation layer of capacitance sensor is attached on inner surface of mounting hole in <b>smooth</b> <b>roll.</b> When the sensing rod is mounted into mounting hole, a series of capacitance is formed along axial direction of roll. In the design of mechatronics system, multi-physics modeling, based on finite element method, is developed not only to study the relationship between sensor parameters and the sensitivity of sensor, but to understand the thermal and electro-magnetic effect of electrical current passing through workpiece quantitatively as well. 2) Development of prototyping micro-rolling sensing system Micro-rolling sensing system is developed for real-time monitoring of Electrical-Assisted Micro-Rolling process. The whole system consists of one or two embedded capacitance sensor arrays, <b>smooth</b> <b>roll,</b> and capacitance measurement electronic device. Two 1 x 12 pixel capacitance sensor arrays are inserted into sensor mounting holes in <b>smooth</b> <b>roll.</b> Two pieces of printed circuit boards (PCB) are mounted at both ends of <b>smooth</b> <b>roll</b> for capacitance measurement and wireless data transmission. The electronic device measures capacitance in sensing rod using capacitance-to-digital converter chip for stable and precise capacitance measurement. To decrease the noise caused by signal cable, ZigBee communication module is used to transmit the digital signal from circuit to remote PC. In PC receiver, software interface has been developed for real-time monitoring and data analysis. A calibration process on micro-rolling mill has been investigated to calibrate the relationship between capacitance increase of each electrode and rolling pressure. 3) Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal Distribution of rolling pressure Since roll misalignment and unevenness of workpiece can cause unexpected pressure distribution, monitoring of spatio-temporal distribution of rolling pressure at workpiece-roll interface is critical to control the accuracy of channel dimension. During micro-rolling process, micro-rolling sensing system embedded in rolling mill can transfer a set of capacitance data. To convert capacitance increases of one dimensional sensor array to pressure distribution along axial direction of roll, Back-proejection method is investigated to solve the inverse problem. The pressure-to-capacitance transducer is calculated by numerical method. To increase the spatial resolution of pressure-to-capacitance conversion, interpolation method is investigated to estimate the continuous deformation of dielectric layer under rolling pressure from limited number of sensing points. In this context, three interpolation methods (Kriging, Thin Plated Spline, and Bezier interpolation) and four back-projection methods (Tikhonov regularization, iterative Tikhonov regularization, Landweber iteration, and Offline Iteration Online Reconstruction) are discussed. The best combination of interpolation and back-projection method is determined by numerical experiment. In addition to these focal areas, prototyped micro-rolling sensing system has been equipped to micro-rolling mill for pressure monitoring during EAμR. Pressure reconstruction algorithm has also been tested by outputs of micro-rolling sensing system. The experimental verification was utilized for reliability evaluation of embedded sensing method and pressure reconstruction algorithm...|$|E

40|$|A laboratory-scale {{process is}} {{presented}} for {{the manufacture of}} starch and gluten from wheat. Main feature {{of this process is}} that whole wheat kernels are crushed dry between <b>smooth</b> <b>rolls</b> prior to wet disintegration in excess water in such way that gluten formation is prevented and fibres can be removed by sieving. Centrifugation of the endosperm suspension yields a dough which can be separated into starch and gluten using an established batter process. The results suggest that starch recovery is increased in comparison to a conventional wheat flour process without a concomitant decrease in protein recovery. Although starch purification was omitted, a total starch with a low protein content is obtained. On the other hand, the protein content of the gluten fraction is rather low due to difficulties in removing thestarch. Despite this, the effect on dough mechanical properties by the addition of gluten obtained from wet-milled wheat is comparable to the effect of gluten from flour. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

[Morrell, Lim, Tondo, David, 1996. Modelling the high pressure grinding rolls. In: Mining Technology Conference, pp. 169 - 176. ]. Verification of the model is based on results from four data sets that describe the performance of three industrial scale units fitted with both studded and <b>smooth</b> <b>roll</b> surfaces. The industrial units are currently in operation within the diamond mining industry and are represented by De Beers, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. Ore samples from the De Beers and BHP Billiton operations were sent to the JKMRC for ore characterisation and HPGR laboratory-scale tests. Rio Tinto contributed an historical data set of tests completed during a previous research project. The results conclude that the modelling of the HPGR process has matured to a point where the model may be used to evaluate new and to optimise existing comminution circuits. The model prediction of product size distribution is good and {{has been found to be}} strongly dependent of the characteristics of the material being tested. The prediction of throughput and corresponding power draw (based on throughput) is sensitive to inconsistent gap/diameter ratios observed between laboratory-scale tests and full-scale operations.

40|$|YesThis {{experimental}} study of forward gravure coating considers the effects of operating variables on air entrainment, ribbing instabilities and {{the thickness of the}} film formed. The data show that this coating method can yield very thin films of thickness of order of 15 - 20 % at most of the equivalent cell depth of a gravure roller. Air free and non ribbed stable uniform films can however only be obtained in a narrow window of operating conditions at very low substrate capillary number (CaS ~ 0. 02) equivalent to substrate speeds typically less than 20 m/min. The paper draws a similarity with flow features observed with <b>smooth</b> forward <b>roll</b> coating and slide coating. It is shown that the onset of ribbing and the flux distribution between the gravure roller and the substrate at the exit of the nip obey approximately the same rules as in <b>smooth</b> forward <b>roll</b> coating, whereas the onset of air entrainment actually corresponds to a low-flow limit of coatability similar to that observed in slide coating...|$|R
40|$|A {{dry milling}} {{strategy}} has been developed for separating oats into bran-rich and starch-rich fractions. For the first time, this process combined the benefits of oat pearling with the efficiency of break and reduction milling and sifting to allow production of flour and bran fractions from an oat cultivar of high lipid content. The bran-rich fraction complies with the separation ratio and chemical composition of the AACC’s definition for oat bran. Oat cultivars with a lipid content below 10 % (db) can be dry milled by the process developed in this study. The roll disposition, roll gap and the speed differential of the corrugated and <b>smooth</b> <b>rolls</b> together with the aperture size of the sieves for flour separation were the important parameters that determined the milling and separation efficiency of this oat dry milling process. Critical settings of these parameters included a roll disposition of dull to dull, a roll gap of not larger than 0. 1 mm, and a sieve aperture size of 212 μm for flour separation. A pearling step as short as 5 s prior to roller milling effectively removed all the trichomes {{from the surface of}} two cultivars of naked oats. This would significantly reduce the health hazards arising from trichomes during oat dry processing...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} machine, {{it is not}} a desired feature for the {{boundary}} layer flows in the fabric and the roll surfaces to travel into the closing nips, creating overpressure. In this thesis, the aerodynamic behavior of the grooved roll and smooth rolls is compared {{in order to understand the}} nip flow phenomena, which is the main reason why vacuum and grooved roll constructions are designed. A common method to remove the boundary layer flow from the closing nip is to use the vacuum roll construction. The downside of the use of vacuum rolls is high operational costs due to pressure losses in the vacuum roll shell. The deep grooved roll has the same goal, to create a pressure difference over the paper web and keep the paper attached to the roll or fabric surface in the drying pocket of the paper machine. A literature review revealed that the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is not very well known. In this thesis, the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll in interaction with a permeable or impermeable wall is studied by varying the groove properties. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are utilized as the research tool. The simulations have been performed with commercial fluid dynamics software, ANSYS Fluent. Simulation results made with 3 - and 2 -dimensional fluid dynamics models are compared to laboratory scale measurements. The measurements have been made with a grooved roll simulator designed for the research. The variables in the comparison are the paper or fabric wrap angle, surface velocities, groove geometry and wall permeability. Present-day computational and modeling resources limit grooved roll fluid dynamics simulations in the paper machine scale. Based on the analysis of the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll, a grooved roll simulation tool is proposed. The <b>smooth</b> <b>roll</b> simulations show that the closing nip pressure does not depend on the length of boundary layer development. The surface velocity increase affects the pressure distribution in the closing and opening nips. The 3 D grooved roll model reveals the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll. With the optimal groove size it is possible to avoid closing nip overpressure and keep the web attached to the fabric surface in the area of the wrap angle. The groove flow friction and minor losses play a different role when the wrap angle is changed. The proposed 2 D grooved roll simulation tool is able to replicate the grooved aerodynamic behavior with reasonable accuracy. A small wrap angle predicts the pressure distribution correctly with the chosen approach for calculating the groove friction losses. With a large wrap angle, the groove friction loss shows too large pressure gradients, and the way of calculating the air flow friction losses in the groove has to be reconsidered. The aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is based on minor and viscous losses in the closing and opening nips as well as in the grooves. The proposed 2 D grooved roll model is a simplification in order to reduce computational and modeling efforts. The simulation tool makes it possible to simulate complex paper machine constructions in the paper machine scale. In order to use the grooved roll as a replacement for the vacuum roll, the grooved roll properties have to be considered on the basis of the web handling application...|$|E
