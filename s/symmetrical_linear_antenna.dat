40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} problem of the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>linear</b> <b>antenna</b> driven by a two-wire line is presented. Then <b>symmetrical</b> <b>linear</b> <b>antenna</b> and the feeder line are treated as a unique boundary-value problem leading to a system of two simultaneous integral equations containing antenna and line currents as unknown sub-integral functions. The integral equations are approximately solved by the so-called point-matching method. Due to the mutual coupling between the antenna and the line, a new conveniently defined apparent driving-point admittance is to be introduced. The method is applied on several types of linear antennas: Centre driven symmetrical dipole antenna, Centre-driven V-antenna, Cage antenna, H-antenna and System of two parallel non-staggered dipoles antennas, positioned in the air over semi-conducting ground. Then theoretical results for admittances were compared with the experiments and remarkably good overall agreement has been found. On the contrary, a comparison with the corresponding theoretical results obtained with the idealized delta-function generator revealed remarkable discrepancies...|$|E

In this work a flat top beam pattern of sharp transition (T), low Side Lobe Level (SLL) and very little ripple (R) has been achieved. To reduce the design cost of the feed network of the synthesized pattern, only the complex excitation coefficients of the elements with two states [0 or π] of their phase value are considered as the optimization parameters.

In view of the Fourier transform mapping between the element excitations and array factor of uniform <b>linear</b> <b>antenna</b> array, the spectrum of the array factor is first acquired with FFT and its energy distributions are investigated thoroughly. The relationship between the carrier frequency and the element excitation is obtained by the density-weighting theory. In the following steps, the element excitations of interleaved subarrays are carefully selected in an alternate manner, which ensures that similar patterns can be achieved for interleaved subarrays. The Peak Sidelobe Levels (PSLs) of the interleaved subarrays are further reduced by the iterative Fourier transform algorithm.

Hyper beamforming is based on sum and difference beam patterns of the array, each raised {{to the power of}} a hyperbeam exponent parameter. The optimized hyperbeam is achieved by optimization of current excitation weights and uniform interelement spacing. As compared to conventional hyper beamforming of <b>linear</b> <b>antenna</b> array, real coded genetic algorithm (RGA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE) applied to the hyper beam of the same array can achieve reduction in sidelobe level (SLL) and same or less first null beam width (FNBW), keeping the same value of hyperbeam exponent. Again, further reductions of sidelobe level (SLL) and first null beam width (FNBW) have been achieved by the proposed collective animal behaviour (CAB) algorithm.
