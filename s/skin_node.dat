The hyperthermic treatment was carried out for 60 minutes at 43 degrees C with the MHS-SMA and the Sapic SVO 3 ALENIA devices once a week. When the tumor temperature reached 42 degrees C, cisplatin was administered at a dosage of 50 mg/m 2 given by intravenous bolus infusion. The treatment was repeated four times and the tumor response evaluated 4 weeks after the last treatment. Significant systemic or local toxicity was not seen. In terms of results, there were 9 {{patients with}} complete responses (28. 1 %), 13 with partial responses (40. 6 %), 8 with no change (25. 0 %), and two with disease progression (6. 3 %).

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method for}} predicting {{the strength of}} debonded composite skin-stiffener configurations is presented. This method, {{which is based on}} fracture mechanics, models the skin and the stiffener with two-dimensional (2 D) plate elements instead of three-dimensional (3 D) solid elements. The skin and stiffener flange nodes are tied together by two modeling techniques. In one technique, the corresponding flange and <b>skin</b> <b>nodes</b> are required to have identical translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom. In the other technique, the corresponding flange and <b>skin</b> <b>nodes</b> are only required to have identical translational degrees-of-freedom. Strain energy release rate formulas are proposed for both modeling techniques. These formulas are used for skin-stiffener debond cases with and without cylindrical bending deformations. The cylindrical bending results are compared with plane-strain finite element results. Excellent agreement between the two sets of results is obtained when the second technique is used. Thus, from these limited studies, a preferable modeling technique for skin-stiffener debond analysis using plate elements is established...|$|R

Methods: A retrospective review of the Duke Melanoma Database from 1970 to 2004 was conducted that focused on patients who were initially diagnosed without metastatic disease.
