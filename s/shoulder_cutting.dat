The suture is distinct, not appressed. The anal fasciole is adjacent to it with no thickened cord between. The whorls are well rounded but the fasciole is flattish. The spiral sculpture consists of (on the early whorls two, on the body whorl about 15) sharply incised lines {{in front of the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>cutting</b> the ribs into squarish segments which are hardly nodulous. On the siphonal canal there are a few finer closet-set threads. The axial sculpture consists of (on the penultimate whorl about 21) rounded somewhat sigmoid ribs, extending from the suture to the base, feeble on the fasciole and the base of the shell and obsolete on {{the last half of the}} body whorl. The anal fasciole is wide and shows the arcuate posterior ends of the ribs which do not undulate the suture. The aperture is narrow. The anal sulcus is wide and rounded with a slightly flaring edge. The outer lip is thin, sharp and prominently arcuately produced. The inner lip is erased. The columella is strong and attenuated in front. The siphonal canal is distinct, narrow, and somewhat recurved.|$|E
40|$|The pencil <b>shoulder</b> <b>cutting</b> {{device is}} a stepper motor driven {{mechanism}} {{to cut a}} small groove into {{the end of a}} pencil, which is needed for a novel seed-capsule endcap for a new pencil called Sprout. The pencil was developed by a team of MIT graduate students, and the <b>shoulder</b> <b>cutting</b> device is one step in an automated assembly process for Sprout. The device autonomously cuts a 0. 0075 in. deep shoulder into one end of the pencil using a 0. 25 in. end mill. The device includes a stabilizing sleeve that reduces vibration of the pencil during machining, and creates a vacuum seal so that chips from the pencil are cleanly removed. The cutting time for each pencil is 2 s, with an absolute accuracy of 3. 1 x 10 - 4 in. for the depth of cut after ten tests with the machine. The capsules fit correctly onto the shoulders when done by hand, and the design will be confirmed once the entire machine is running autonomously. by Matthew Paul Hohenberger. Thesis (S. B.)

6000|$|... 87. A Highland {{scene is}} beyond doubt {{pleasant}} enough {{in its own}} way; but, looked close at, has its shadows.[34] Here, for instance, is the very fact of one--as pretty as I can remember,--having seen many. It is a little valley of soft turf, enclosed in its narrow oval by jutting rocks, and broad flakes of nodding fern. From one side {{of it to the}} other winds, serpentine, a clear brown stream, drooping into quicker ripple as it reaches the end of the oval field, and then, first islanding a purple and white rock with an amber pool, it dashes away into a narrow fall of foam under a thicket of mountain ash and alder. The autumn sun, low, but clear, shines on the scarlet ash-berries and on the golden birch-leaves, which, fallen here and there, when the breeze has not caught them, rest quiet in the crannies of the purple rock. Beside the rock, in the hollow under the thicket, the carcase of a ewe, drowned in the last flood, lies nearly bare to the bone, its white ribs protruding through the skin, raven-torn; and the rags of its wool still flickering from the branches that first stayed it as the stream swept it down. A little lower, the current plunges, roaring, into a circular chasm like a well, surrounded on three sides by a chimney-like hollowness of polished rock, down which the foam slips in detached snow-flakes. Round the edges of the pool beneath, the water circles slowly like black oil; a little butterfly lies on its back, the wings glued to one of the eddies, its limbs feebly quivering; a fish arises, and it is gone. Lower down the stream, I can see over a knoll the green and damp turf roofs of four or five hovels, built {{at the edge of a}} morass, which is trodden by the cattle into a black Slough of Despond at their doors, and traversed by a few ill-set stepping stones, with here and there a flat slab on the tops, where they have sunk out of sight;--and at the turn of the brook I see a man fishing, with a boy and a dog--a picturesque and pretty group enough certainly, if they had not been there all day starving. I know them, and I know the dog's ribs also, which are nearly as bare as the dead ewe's; and the child's wasted <b>shoulders,</b> <b>cutting</b> his old tartan jacket through, so sharp are they.|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{operations}} and processing of natural product require accurate {{presentation of the}} target area {{in order to achieve}} precise incisions. An excellent example is the deboning automation for chicken breast meat, for which the pose of the wing can greatly affect the cutting efficiency, ability to fix the structure, and product yield. In contrast to engineering objects, biological products present difficulties such as variation in size, shape, and material properties. Unlike past research, which generally found ways to emulate the manual cutting motion, this thesis investigates the effects of wing manipulation on incision tasks. The objective of this thesis is to develop an analytical model for characterizing the manipulation for pose presentation of a musculoskeletal structure for a specified incision. The manipulation model consists of joint kinematics, the mechanics of bio-materials, and a grasping mechanism to determine the joint pose and forces for a given manipulation trajectory. The model provides a basis for monitoring the cutting of bio-material via non-visual information, as well as for design of a compliant mechanism {{that can be used in}} an industrial automation application. To gain a better understanding, a wing manipulation test-bed consisting of a force/torque sensor at the point of wing manipulation has been developed. Two specific examples are investigated. The first is needle insertion into bio-materials, and the other is the <b>shoulder</b> <b>cutting</b> operation associated with chicken breast meat deboning. The effects of manipulation on needle insertion forces are used to quantify improvements in insertion point accuracy and required insertion force. Force signatures are also developed for insertion into the biomaterials located within the shoulder joint. The information gathered from both the manipulation model and needle insertion experiments provide a basis for successful implementation of the automation of the shoulder cut. While the experimentation presented in this thesis is developed in the context of poultry processing, which has immediate contributions as a tool that would facilitate the design of the automated cutting mechanisms in poultry industry, we expect that the development of the models will find a broad range of applications ranging from general meat processing, to surgical simulation, and physical therapy.

40|$|Parasito intracelular obrigatório de animais homeotérmicos, o Toxoplasma gondii esta distribuído amplamente pelo mundo, e somente nos Felídeos realiza a reprodução sexuada. Nos ovinos causa prejuízos econômicos, principalmente devido ao aborto. As formas de contaminação são por oocistos em água ou alimentos, cistos teciduais em vísceras e tecidos, por taquizoítos em fluidos e congenitamente. A transmissão do parasito pelo consumo de carne crua é umas das mais importantes, sendo assim, utilizou-se um cordeiro, infectado naturalmente, com titulação de anticorpos de 1 : 256, avaliada pelo teste de RIFI. Este animal foi abatido {{conforme}} a legislação e após abate foram coletadas amostras de cérebro, diafragma, fígado e coração para exame histopatológico e para PCR, e coletado aproximadamente 50 g dos cortes da paleta, costela e pernil e 16 g do coração sendo esta a coleta in natura (T 0), para realização do bioensaio em camundongos e PCR. Após a primeira coleta, a carcaça foi encaminhada a refrigeração, permanecendo inteira na câmara de resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h, juntamente com o coração. Após este período, nova coleta foi realizada (T 1), assim como descrito e foram divididos os cortes e estes passaram para o congelamento a - 10 °C, e as coletas foram realizadas com 12 h (T 2), 60 h (T 3) e 120 h (T 4) nesta temperatura. Em cada tempo de tratamento, as amostras coletadas passaram pela digestão péptica e inoculadas em dois camundongos por amostra, o restante da digestão, era utilizada para PCR. Os camundongos foram eutanasiados com oito semanas e seus órgãos como pulmão, coração, fígado, baço, rins e amostra de tecido muscular esquelético da coxa foram coletados para histopatológico, já o cérebro era coletado para PCR e para técnica de squash. Sangue dos camundongos foram coletados para realização do teste de RIFI. Na PCR das amostras oriundas do ovino, o cérebro e amostra do corte da costela in natura (T 0) foram positivas, já na PCR do cérebro dos camundongos, somente o animal inoculado com amostra do corte da paleta in natura (T 0) foi positivo. Após a realização da PCR, as amostras positivas foram sequenciadas, que demonstrou mais de 97 % de identidade com o T. gondii. Na técnica do squash, o camundongo inoculado com o corte da costela após o resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h (T 1) apresentou cisto cerebral. Na RIFI do soro dos camundongos, um animal inoculado com o corte da costela in natura (T 0) e um com a costela após o resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h (T 1) apresentaram titulação 1 : 64, os demais negativos. No exame histopatológico dos órgãos do ovino e dos camundongos, somente o camundongo inoculado com o corte da costela após o resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h (T 1) apresentou cisto, sendo estes presentes no coração, pulmão e tecido muscular da coxa.

Portanto, somente o resfriamento de cortes comerciais desta espécie não inviabiliza o parasitoAn obligatory {{intracellular parasite}} of warm-blooded animals, Toxoplasma gondii is widely distributed around the world, {{and only in}} the feline species it performs sexual reproduction. In sheep it brings economic losses, mainly due to abortion. Contamination ways are from oocysts in water or food, tissue and visceral cysts, by tachyzoites in fluids and congenitally. The most important parasite transmission occurs through raw meat consumption, so we used a lamb, naturally infected with antibody titer of 1 : 256 as measured by IFA test. This animal was slaughtered {{according to the law}} and after slaughter brain, diaphragm, liver and heart samples were collected for histopathology and PCR, and it was collected approximately 50 g of shoulder, rib and leg cuts and 16 g of heart was an "in natura " collection (T 0), for bioassay in mice and PCR. After the first collection, the carcass was kept cooling down, remaining whole in the cooling chamber at 7 °C for 24 hours, along with the heart. After this period, a second test was performed (T 1), as previously described and the cuts were divided and they went to freezing at - 10 °C, samples were taken with 12 hours (T 2), 60 h (T 3) and 120 h (T 4) at this temperature. In each treatment period, the collected samples went through peptic digestion and were inoculated in two mice per sample, the rest of the digestion was used for PCR. The mice were sacrificed at eight weeks and their organs like lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle tissue sample from the thigh were collected for histopathology, since the brain was collected for PCR and "squash" technique. Blood of mice was collected to perform the IFA test. PCR of samples derived from the sheep, the brain and rib cut sample "in natura" (T 0) were positive, as in the PCR of the mice brain, only the inoculated animal with <b>shoulder</b> <b>cutting</b> sample "in natura" (T 0) was positive. After completion of the PCR, positive samples were sequenced, which showed over 97 % identity with T. gondii. In "squash" technique the mice inoculated with the ribs cutting after cooling at 7 °C for 24 hours (T 1) presented brain cyst. IFA in mice serum, an animal inoculated with the rib cut "in natura" (T 0) and one with rib after cooling at 7 °C for 24 hours (T 1) presented titration 1 : 64, the others were negative. In histopathological examination of sheep and mice organs, only the inoculated mice with the rib cut after cooling at 7 °C for 24 hours (T 1) presented cysts, which were present in the heart, lung and muscle tissue of the thigh. The lamb consumption "in natura" and after cooling is capable of transmission to those who consume.

5000|$|The Santoku {{design is}} shorter, lighter, thinner, and more {{hardened}} (to compensate for thinness) than a traditional Western chef's knife. Standard Santoku blade length is between 6 and 7 in, {{in comparison to}} the typical 8 in home cook's knife. Most classic kitchen knives maintain a blade angle between 40 and 45 degrees (a bilateral 20 to 22.5 degree <b>shoulder,</b> from <b>cutting</b> edge); Japanese knives typically incorporate a chisel-tip (sharpened on one side), and maintain a more extreme angle (10 to 15 degree shoulder). A classic Santoku will incorporate the Western-style, bilateral cutting edge, but maintain a more extreme 12 to 15 degree shoulder, akin to Japanese cutlery. It is critical to increase the hardness of Santoku steel so edge retention is maintained and [...] "rolling" [...] of the thin cutting edge is mitigated. However, harder, thinner steel is more likely to chip, when pushing against a bone for example. German knives use slightly [...] "softer" [...] steel, but have more material behind their cutting edge. For the average user, a German-style knife is easier to sharpen, but a Santoku knife, if used as designed, will hold its edge longer. With few exceptions, Santoku knives typically have no bolster, sometimes incorporate [...] "scalloped" [...] sides, called kullens, also known as a Granton edge, and maintain a more uniform thickness from spine to blade.|$|R

In thus moving along the line, however, I never deemed it important to stay long with Sherman. Although his troops were then under fire for the first time, their commander, by his constant presence with them, inspired a confidence in officers and men that enabled them to render services on that bloody battle-field worthy of the best of veterans. McClernand was next to Sherman, and the hardest fighting was in front of these two divisions. McClernand told me on that day, the 6th, that he profited much by having so able a commander supporting him.

40|$|This article {{contains}} {{analysis of the}} main problems concerning social reconstruction opportunities of Early Sarmatian society according to the funeral rite. The evidence of written sources is scarce and forced to rely on just archaeological materials involving ethnographic parallels and anthropological data. The mound-specificity of the cemetery was revealed as a cemetery for the burial of the clan community. The archaeological reflection of these relations may be the presence of various burial structures (simple rectangular pits, rectangular <b>shouldered</b> pits, <b>cuttings</b> and the catacombs) {{in the framework of}} total planigraphy, the tradition of the position of a decedent’s body and a standard set of tools. It was concluded that the tribal groups that participated in the rituals were relatively small, because, when the Sarmatians themselves built the mound, it was usually little-sized, if they chose a ready mound, a large mound was appreciated. There were some identifiers of different social groups, including those related to higher status and retinue aristocracy. The first group includes gold, jewelry, imported utensils, ceremonial weapons, bronze caldrons. The second group stands out for a set of weapons in the form of long and short swords with the obligatory quiver. Most of the ordinary population is defined as the mass of freemen, that in case of any necessity, could turn into warriors. Not only men but also young women, and even children are sometimes found with a quiver of arrows and a sword. Female warriors should not be treated as a separate social stratum because of their fewness. At the same time, women’s participation with their husbands and themselves in attacks, raids, defense and hunting were quite common. Therefore, some women, known in society for their military success, could be observed at the burial of weapons in the accompanying inventory of the burial. The lowest cell of the traditional nomadic society was a small family, who buried their members in the chambers for collective burials. We can make conclusion about the level of the social hierarchy inherent in the society at the stage of a complex chiefdom...|$|R
50|$|The {{parts of}} a {{straight}} razor and their function are described as follows:The narrow end of the blade rotates on a pin called the pivot, between two protective pieces called the scales or handle. The upward curved metal end of the narrow part of the blade beyond the pivot is called the tang and acts as a lever to help raise the blade from the handle. One or two fingers resting on the tang also help stabilize the blade while shaving. The narrow support piece between the tang and the main blade is called the shank, but this reference is often avoided {{because it can be}} confusing since the shank is also referred to as tang. The shank sometimes features decorations and the stamp of the brand. The top side and the underside of the shank can sometimes exhibit indentations known as fluting, or jimps for a more secure grip. The curved lower part of the main blade from the shank to the cutting edge is called the shoulder. The point where the <b>shoulder</b> joins the <b>cutting</b> edge is called the heel. The endpoint of the cutting edge {{at the front of the}} blade, opposite to the heel, is called the toe.|$|R
60|$|When Uncas had brained {{his first}} antagonist, he turned, like a hungry lion, to seek another. The fifth and only Huron {{disengaged}} {{at the first}} onset had paused a moment, and then seeing that all around him were employed in the deadly strife, he sought, with hellish vengeance, to complete the baffled work of revenge. Raising a shout of triumph, he sprang towards the defenceless Cora, sending his keen axe, as the dreadful precursor of his approach. The tomahawk grazed her <b>shoulder,</b> and <b>cutting</b> the withes which bound her to the tree, left the maiden at liberty to fly. She eluded the grasp of the savage, and reckless of her own safety, threw herself on the bosom of Alice, striving with convulsed and ill-directed fingers, to tear asunder the twigs which confined the person of her sister. Any other than a monster would have relented at such an act of generous devotion to the best and purest affection; but the breast of the Huron was a stranger to sympathy. Seizing Cora by the rich tresses which fell in confusion about her form, he tore her from her frantic hold, and bowed her down with brutal violence to her knees. The savage drew the flowing curls through his hand, and raising them on high with an outstretched arm, he passed the knife around the exquisitely moulded head of his victim, with a taunting and exulting laugh. But he purchased this moment of fierce gratification {{with the loss of}} the fatal opportunity. It was just then the sight caught the eye of Uncas. Bounding from his footsteps he appeared for an instant darting through the air, and descending in a ball he fell on the chest of his enemy, driving him many yards from the spot, headlong and prostrate. The violence of the exertion cast the young Mohican at his side. They arose together, fought, and bled, each in his turn. But the conflict was soon decided; the tomahawk of Heyward and the rifle of Hawkeye descended on the skull of the Huron, at the same moment that the knife of Uncas reached his heart.|$|R

(These restrictions {{do not apply to}} military and police departments.) In addition, some firearm types that would normally be considered to fall into the Short Barrel Shotgun (SBS) category are not legally considered to be a SBS. A shotgun is legally defined as a shoulder-mounted firearm that fires shot. Shotguns and shotgun receivers that have never had a buttstock of any type installed are not shotguns, as they cannot be <b>shoulder</b> mounted. Therefore, <b>cutting</b> one of these below the 18" [...] barrel and/or 26" [...] overall length cannot produce a SBS as the firearm was never a shotgun. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives recognizes these firearms as being a smooth bore handgun which is an Any Other Weapon (AOW). Unlike an SBS, an AOW only carries a $5.00 tax and can be moved interstate without Federal approval. To maintain its AOW status, it must not have a buttstock (making it a SBS) or a rifled slug barrel (making it a Destructive Device (DD) if the bore is over 0.5"). Firearms of this type are typically over 100 years old. These weapons produced with a barrel length under 18" [...] are not considered sawed-off shotguns because they were not produced with a shoulder buttstock. Weapons with these specifications fall under the category of smooth bore handguns produced in heavy rifle calibers and 12/20 gauge shotgun calibers, contrary to illegal sawn-off shotguns and are not considered destructive devices. Any firearms capable of shooting shotgun style cartridges produced after the 18" [...] minimum barrel restrictions were set into place are considered illegal sawed-off shotguns.|$|R
