5|$|The Pro-Line {{series was}} durable and fault-tolerant, with many models lasting for years. However, because they used {{solid-state}} amplifiers, {{they are not}} as highly regarded as the older tube-based Leslies, because they lack the characteristic <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> the amp is overdriven.|$|E
5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E

5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> fed.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a {{relatively}} quiet bird, {{but it has a}} warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or displays of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} several recipes, each listing preparation times, {{ingredients and}} courses.

5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its <b>sound.</b> <b>When</b> pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman {{tried to}} {{reinforce}} his offensive, {{not knowing what}} had happened in the valley, but then Stephen, with the full support of his boyars, ordered a major attack. All his troops, together with peasants and heavy cavalry, attacked from all sides. Simultaneously, Moldavian buglers concealed behind Ottoman lines started to sound their bugles, and in great confusion some Ottoman units changed direction to face the <b>sound.</b> <b>When</b> the Moldavian army hit, Suleiman lost control of his army. He desperately tried to regain control, but was later forced to signal a retreat. The battle lasted for four days, with the last three days seeing the fleeing Ottoman army being pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2,000-strong Polish cavalry until they reached the town of Obluciţa (now Isaccea, Romania), in Dobruja.|$|E
50|$|All monorails are {{equipped}} with Grover 1056 horns. The horn must be <b>sounded</b> <b>when</b> departing a station, at one point where the track parallels the currently unused PeopleMover/Rocket Rod track, and when approaching the Matterhorn. They are also <b>sounded</b> <b>when</b> a bird lands on the track, and as a greeting to passing Disneyland Railroad trains near the switch to the barn. The original monorails were equipped with horns that sounded more like real ground-level trains.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations of {{cockatoos}} are {{loud and}} harsh. They serve {{a number of}} functions, including allowing individuals to recognize one another, alerting others of predators, indicating individual moods, maintaining the cohesion of a flock and as warnings when defending nests. The use of calls and number of specific calls varies by species; the Carnaby's black cockatoo has as many as 15 different calls, whereas others, such as Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have fewer. Some, like the gang-gang cockatoo, are comparatively quiet but do have softer growling calls when feeding. In addition to vocalisations, palm cockatoos communicate over large distances by drumming on a dead branch with a stick. Cockatoo species also make a characteristic hissing <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> threatened.|$|E
5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E

5|$|Through the Wilderness is {{a tribute}} album with {{contributions}} {{from a variety of}} artists dedicated to American singer Madonna. It was released on November 27, 2007 by Los Angeles-based Manimal Vinyl Records. According to label head Paul Beahan, the idea for the album was conceived by him in a dream. He enlisted multiple artists to work on the project, including Giant Drag, Lavender Diamond, Winter Flowers and Chapin Sisters. Although not a fan of Madonna, Beahan wanted to see how her songs would <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> covered by different musicians.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations {{of the two}} martins {{are quite}} different. Mascarene martin has a warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or {{displays}} of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent. The song of Brazza's martin consists {{of a series of}} short notes increasing in frequency which are followed by a complex buzz and sometimes completed by a number of clicks. The song becomes increasingly loud, although the final clicks are quite soft. The song {{is similar to that of}} the banded martin, and does not resemble that of the Mascarene martin, suggesting unresolved taxonomic problems.|$|E

25|$|In Slovenia, level {{crossings}} (nivojski prehod in Slovenian) {{are similar to}} Swiss crossings, as in they have a normal warning sign triangle but with two red lights inside it. The crossings have half barriers (mainly) and alarms that <b>sound</b> <b>when</b> a train approaches.|$|E
