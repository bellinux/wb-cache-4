50|$|The Ballester-Molina was {{predominantly}} used by Argentina's security forces. The Argentine Army adopted this {{weapon in}} 1938. The Ballester-Molina {{is a short}} recoil-operated semi-automatic locked breech pistol. The locking system is a near identical copy of the Colt M1911A1, with the <b>swinging</b> <b>lock</b> used to unlock the barrel from the slide. The trigger is single action, two stage, but pivots rather than slides like the 1911 trigger. The spring housing system is integrated to the pistol frame rather than being a separate part. The hammer is locked by the frame-mounted manual safety, and most notably there is no grip safety. Overall quality is excellent. Many examples for sale on the surplus market have seen heavy use but show little internal wear.|$|R

50|$|The MK 115 (German: Maschinenkanone 115—"machine cannon 115") was an autocannon {{developed}} in Germany in late World War II by Rheinmetall-Borsig {{for use in}} aircraft. It was an unusual development in that although it employed a locked breech, it also used a funnel to allow some of the propellant gases to escape out the rear {{in order to reduce}} recoil when firing, essentially being an automatic recoilless rifle. The MK 115 was chambered for a 5.5 cm round (in common with a few other late-war German designs), but used a partially combustible cartridge, leaving only the base of the cartridge to eject. The MK 115 was a gas-operated, belt-fed weapon, and its breechblock used a <b>swinging</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism. It had a rifled barrel with an 8°30′ twist. A single prototype in the late stages of development was captured by the Western allies.|$|R

2500|$|The ship sailed from Dover to Calais on {{a private}} trial in April 1875. On arrival, it {{sustained}} damage to a paddle-wheel when it hit the pier at Calais, due to its failure to answer to the helm at slow speed. The first and only public voyage took place on 8 May 1875, the ship sailing with the <b>swinging</b> cabin <b>locked</b> (some observers suggested due to its serious instability., although Bessemer ascribed it to insufficient time to fix the previous damage). The ship was operated by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. After two attempts to enter the harbour, it crashed into the Calais pier again, this time demolishing part of it.|$|R
50|$|Throstles Nest Lock was {{the highest}} on the navigation. It was {{followed}} by Mode Wheel lock. Lock 3 was at Barton-upon-Irwell, next to James Brindley's original Barton Aqueduct. The remains of the lock island appear to be situated in the same location as the island presently used for the <b>swing</b> aqueduct. Stickins <b>Lock</b> followed, located in a 600 yd cut. There were further locks named Holmes Bridge, Calamanco, Holmes Bridge and finally Howley Tidal.|$|R
50|$|To {{mount the}} optics, a side-rail is {{permanently}} {{attached to the}} left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail rail mount with a clamping lever to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by <b>swinging</b> the <b>locking</b> lever open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give {{easy access to the}} receiver cover and bolt carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} bridges along the {{abandoned}} route also remain {{to this day}} as well, the most notable {{of which is the}} causeway over Gasparilla Sound that connected the line to the island. The southernmost trestle is now a fishing pier as is the northernmost trestle up to the abandoned drawbridge tower. [...] The rest of the causeway and trestles, which remain just to the south of the Boca Grande Causeway, are now completely abandoned. The bascule span on the northernmost trestle was removed and the center trestle's <b>swing</b> span is <b>locked</b> open to facilitate boat traffic.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} locking and {{unlocking}} the barrel differentiates the {{wide array of}} short recoil designs. Most common are the John Browning tilting barrel designs based on either the <b>swinging</b> link and <b>locking</b> lugs as used in the M1911 pistol or the linkless cam design used in the Hi Power and CZ 75. Other designs are the locking block design found in the Walther P38 and Beretta 92, rollers in the MG42, or a rotating barrel used in the Beretta 8000 and others. An unusual variant is the toggle bolt design of the Borchardt C-93 and its descendant, the Luger pistol.|$|R
50|$|The LPS {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} LPS rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail similar in design to the mounting used for Russian SVD rifles and PSO-1 optical sights and positions the {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver and bore center axis.The Warsaw Pact mount has a castle nut that screws {{into the bottom of the}} locking lever. The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed.The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by <b>swinging</b> the <b>locking</b> lever open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy access to the receiver cover which needs to be removed for cleaning.Due to the offset to the left and the relative height of the mounting, the PSL iron sights can be used with a LPS scope mounted, though the positioning of the scope’s optical center axis may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|R
50|$|Train {{motion is}} {{simulated}} according to train type and loading, and is controlled via {{the use of}} timetables. With a keyboard and mouse, the player sets routes and operates level crossings as necessary as well as simulations/timetable specific tasks such as operating ground frames. Solid State Interlockings (SSIs), the main electronic technology in use at present on British railways, along with approach <b>locking,</b> <b>swinging</b> overlaps, shunt routes, warner routes and call-on routes are all available. The simulations may be played in real time or sped up. The aim of play is to achieve a good score by overcoming problems and ensuring on-time train running. Points are accumulated for good operation and deducted for errors or late running.|$|R
40|$|Suspended {{resonant}} optical cavities {{are basic}} {{building blocks for}} several experimental devices. An important issue is the control strategy required to bring them in the resonant or slightly detuned configuration needed for their operation, the so-called locking procedure. This can be obtained with a feedback strategy, but the error signal needed is tipically available only when the cavity is near the resonance with a precision of the order Δ L≃λ_ℓ F^- 1, where F is the cavity finesse and λ_ℓ is the laser's wavelength. When the mirrors are freely <b>swinging</b> the <b>locking</b> can be attempted only {{in the short time}} windows when this condition is verifyed. Tipically this means that the procedure must be repeated several times, and that large forces must be applied. In this paper we describe a different strategy, which tries to take advantage {{by the fact that the}} dynamics of the mirrors is known at least in an approximate way. We argue that the locking procedure considered can be more efficient compared with the naive one, with a reduced needed maximal feedback. Finally we discuss possible generalizations and we point to future investigations. Comment: 21 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} project, {{which was}} {{presented}} to the team by Kevin Maher (President of Advanced Therapeutic devices), was to develop a product prototype for safe, vestibular stimulation for children with developmental disabilities. Vestibular stimulation is a form of therapy that increases muscle coordination. It works by stimulating the canals and sacs within the inner ear that detect accelerations. The project targeted children from ages two to seven years old, under 48 inches tall, and less than 100 lbs. The production device also sought to differ from stimulation devices found in hospitals in a few respects: it would cost under $ 5000, reside in a patient’s home, be hand-powered, and be controlled by an average person. The final device needed to support a 200 lb. load {{at the edge of the}} structure and adjust for the center of gravities for the range of children. After sessions of brainstorming, the team produced three workable layouts, only one was adequate. The final setup had a structure of ¼ in. aluminum structural pipe similar to a football field goal. This structure mounted on a single bearing housing and steel shaft. The final design had two bars to mount weights in order to adjust the center of gravity. The prototype, however, used a <b>swinging</b> bar, <b>lock,</b> and a sliding weight. The final prototype had an adjustable footrest and a five-point restraint harness. The final cost and weight was $ 1700 and no more than 500 lb. The design met all of the requirements and had adequate safety for any child’s needs, but the team thought the design needed significant changes before it became a final product...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{requirements}} for the Degree of Masters of Science in Fire Protection Engineering from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, a prescriptive and performance based design analysis was conducted for the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center building (Cal Poly campus). The purpose of this analysis was to review the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center’s compliance with applicable and recognized fire and building codes with regards to its fire protection systems and features. The fire protection systems and features analyzed in this report include: 1) Egress Systems, 2) Structural Fire Protection, 3) Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, 4) Fire Suppression Systems. Prescriptive analysis of the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center was performed {{in order to determine}} if the building adhered to standards set forth within applicable standards and codes. Analysis was based primarily upon both the International Building Code 2009 Edition and NFPA 101 : Life Safety Code 2012 Edition. Where required, other NFPA codes and standards were utilized, including the 2010 Editions of NFPA 13 : Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems and NFPA 72 : National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. The egress systems in the building largely met prescriptive code requirements except for a few issues related to room 104 and its change in occupancy use (door <b>swing</b> direction, <b>locks</b> without panic hardware, etc). The structural system is a Type II-B classification and was found to meet prescriptive code requirements. Some shortcomings with the detection and alarm systems were discovered during the analysis, mainly with respect to spacing gaps. Several visible notification devices on the second floor did not meet prescriptive code due to gaps in required coverage. Additionally, it was determined that detailed measurements of the average ambient sound level should be taken in order to better analyze the audible notification systems. Lastly, the sprinkler system was found to meet prescriptive code requirements, both for water demand and bracing. Performance based design analysis was performed in order to gain understanding on the ability of the building to safely egress occupants during various fire scenarios when built to the prescriptive approaches set forth in the codes and standards. This performance based design analysis was based upon standards set forth in Chapter 5 of the Life Safety Code. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Pathfinder computer simulators were utilized to carry out the performance based design. ASET vs. RSET analysis solidified the code requirements which prohibit highly combustible materials from within atrium spaces...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{aim is to}} show {{theoretically}} {{the feasibility}} and efficiency of a passive exoskeleton for human walking and carrying a load. Human is modeled using a planar bipedal anthropomorphic mechanism. This mechanism consists of a trunk and two identical legs; each leg consists of a thigh, shin, and foot (massless). The exoskele-ton is considered also as an anthropomorphic mechanism. The shape and the degrees of freedom of the exoskeleton are identical to the biped (to human) -the topology of the exoskeleton {{is the same as}} of the biped (human). Each of models of human and of exoskeleton has seven links and six joints. The hip-joint connects the trunk and two thighs of the two legs. If the biped is equipped with an exoskeleton, then the links of this exoskeleton are attached to the corresponding links of the biped and the corresponding hip-, knee-, and ankle-joints coincide. We compare the walking gaits of a biped alone (without exoskeleton) and of a biped equipped with exoskeleton; for both cases the same load is transported. The problem is studied in the framework of ballistic walking model. During the ballistic walking of the biped with exoskeleton the knee of the support leg is locked, but the knee of the swing leg is unlocked. The locking and unlocking can be realized in the knees of the exoskeleton by any mechanical brake devices without energy consumption. There are not any actuators in the exoskeleton. Therefore, we call it passive exoskeleton. The walking of the biped consists of alternating single-and double-support phases. In our study, the double-support phase is assumed as instantaneous. At the instant of this phase, the knee of the previous <b>swing</b> leg is <b>locked</b> and the knee of the previous support leg is unlocked. Numerical results show that during the load transport the human with the exoskeleton spends less energy than human alone. For transportation of a load with mass 40 kg, the economy of the energy is approximately 28 %, if the length of the step and its duration are equal to 2 0. 5 m and 0. 5 s respectively...|$|R
