40|$|For {{some time}} now, a {{reduction}} in ‘quality time’ {{between parents and children}} has been viewed as a deprivation – ‘quality time poverty’. A quick glance at the photograph may suggest that there is no ‘quality time deficit’ here – a young dad spending <b>snatched</b> <b>time</b> with his daughter. However, closer scrutiny reveals that the daughter is holding some sort of mobile device which is not only engaging her attention but also her dad (although his view is a mirror image of hers). Can the sharing of media delivered through mobile telephony be seen as quality time? Well, this depends on what is being viewed; is it educational or simply irrelevant entertainment? This is something that the photograph does not reveal and is therefore kept secret forever...|$|R

60|$|There is a {{great deal}} of work on the trail,--cooking, care of the horses, {{together}} with almost ceaseless packing and unpacking, and the bother of keeping the packhorses out of the mud. We were busy from five o'clock in the morning until nine at night. There were other outfits on the trail having a full ton of supplies, and this great weight had to be handled four times a day. In our case the toil was much less, but it was only by <b>snatching</b> <b>time</b> from my partner that I was able to work on my notes and keep my diary. Had the land been less empty of game and richer in color, I should not have minded the toil and care taking. As it was, we were all looking forward to the beautiful lake country which we were told lay just beyond the Blackwater.|$|R

[...] She left the vibrant New York art scene for a 19th-century {{farmhouse}} on the rural Buskirk property of Eugene Goossen. Her first son, Alvar, was born in 1973 (followed by Gerrit in 1978 and Nathaniel in 1980). Here she was in constant touch with the natural seasons, but childrearing left only <b>snatches</b> of <b>time</b> to work.|$|R

He is the only weightlifter to clean and jerk 10 kilos more than triple his bodyweight. Suleimanov set his first world record at the age 16 but missed his first chance at Olympic success in 1984 when Bulgaria joined the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.|$|R

60|$|A German was {{standing}} near Bradley--just {{in front of}} him. The Englishman struck the fellow a frantic blow upon the neck {{and at the same}} <b>time</b> <b>snatched</b> his pistol from its holster. Von Schoenvorts had recovered from his first surprise quickly and had turned toward the main hatch to investigate. I covered him with my revolver, and at the same instant the torpedo struck the raider, the terrific explosion drowning the German's command to his men.|$|R
60|$|I {{snatched}} a cutlass {{from the}} pile, and someone, {{at the same}} <b>time</b> <b>snatching</b> another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt.

Right in front, the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face.|$|R

The maid came in complaining, [...] "I can't get no extra milk to make chipped beef for supper." [...] Hugh was sleepy, {{and he had been}} spoiled by Aunt Bessie. Even to a returned mother, his whining and his trick of seven <b>times</b> <b>snatching</b> her silver brush were fatiguing. As a background, behind the noises of Hugh and the kitchen, the house reeked with a colorless stillness.|$|R

6000|$|She had {{no place}} to go this holiday afternoon, and she longed to join a noisy, excited party. Of Walter Babson she did not think. She stubbornly {{determined}} to <b>snatch</b> this <b>time</b> of freedom. Why, of course, she asserted, she could play by herself quite happily! With a spurious gaiety she patted her small black hand-bag. She skipped across to the Sixth Avenue Elevated and went up to the department-store district. She made elaborate plans for the great adventure of shopping. Bessie Kraker had insisted, with the nonchalant shrillness of eighteen, that Una [...] "had ought to wear more color"; and Una had found, in the fashion section of a woman's magazine, the suggestion for exactly the thing--"a modest, attractive frock of brown, with smart touches of orange"--and economical. She had the dress planned--ribbon-belt half brown and half orange, a collar edged with orange, cuffs slashed with it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} such <b>snatches</b> of <b>time</b> that Felix could give to home affairs, for {{his hands were}} full of arrears of business, and the {{excitement}} respecting Mr. Smith necessarily occupied him. Pending the arrival of letters from the Rector, every tongue was in commotion, and the reading-room was a focus of debate and centre of intelligence. So many letters, either in assault or defence, were addressed {{to the editor of}} the Pursuivant, that only a supplement as big as the Times could have contained them. Every poor person who had not had every demand supplied from the charities was running about, adding to the grievance at every encounter with tender-hearted lady or justice-loving gentleman, whose blood boiled over into a letter for the Pursuivant, which, when sifted and refused, was transferred to the Dearport Hermes, or Erms, as most of its supporters termed it.|$|R
50|$|Between November 1942 and March 1943 {{on direct}} orders from Heinrich Himmler, 116,000 Polish {{men and women}} were {{expelled}} in just a few months during Action Zamość.

The expulsions encompassed the districts of Hrubieszów, Tomaszów Lubelski, Zamość and Biłgoraj, and were completed in March 1943. In total 297 Polish villages were depopulated.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} matchday of the season, United were hosted by Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. A first half goal from Rooney saw United {{take the first}} initiative, and City's failure to defend their lead saw them fall behind 2-1 at home to relegation haunted Queens Park Rangers. No further goals at Sunderland saw United claim a 1-0 victory, and at full-time, {{appeared}} to have clinched them the league title, however two late goals for Manchester City saw the title <b>snatched</b> in injury <b>time,</b> with United ultimately finishing the season in second place based on their inferior goal difference to champions City.|$|R

50|$|From 1818 to 1824 he was {{professor}} of law and general politics in the East India Company's College at Haileybury. While there, on 12 August 1823, Mackintosh wrote a two-sheet letter from Cadogan Place, London to James Savage asking for source material for Savage's edition of The History of Taunton by Joshua Toulmin.In the midst of the attractions of London society and of his parliamentary avocations Mackintosh felt that the real work of his life was being neglected. His great ambition was to write a history of England; he also cherished the idea of making some worthy contribution to philosophy. It was not till 1828 that he set about the first task of his literary ambition. This was his Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy, prefixed to the seventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. The dissertation, written mostly in ill-health and in <b>snatches</b> of <b>time</b> taken from his parliamentary engagements, was published in 1831. It was severely attacked in 1835 by James Mill in his Fragment on Mackintosh. About the same time he wrote for the Cabinet Cyclopaedia a History of England from the Earliest Times to the Final Establishment of the Reformation.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} individuals to do so was the American Matilda Joslyn Gage, a writer who was {{deeply involved in the}} first-wave feminist movement for women's suffrage. In 1893, she published the book Woman, Church and State, which was [...] "written in a tearing hurry and in <b>time</b> <b>snatched</b> from a political activism which left no space for original research." [...] Likely influenced by the works of Jules Michelet about the Witch-Cult, she claimed that the witches persecuted in the Early Modern period were pagan priestesses adhering to an ancient religion venerating a Great Goddess. She also repeated the erroneous statement, taken from the works of several German authors, that nine million people had been killed in the witch hunt.|$|R
5000|$|Not all reviews {{were entirely}} positive, though. Sputnikmusic writer Robin Smith was more {{ambivalent}} to the album, writing [...] "Parallax, unrealised masterpiece or not, {{sounds like the}} man in his bedroom with a thousand songs to leave unexplained." [...] Jonathan Donaldson of The Phoenix wrote [...] "Yet even when relying less on atmospheric synths and playing with a full-band set up ("The Shakes"), Parallax misses early rocks tautness and grit." [...] Daniel Becker of Dusted Reviews felt the album was [...] "sparer than usual, flimsier, subtler," [...] writing [...] "These songs aren’t weighty enough, individually or cumulatively, to leave an imprint — they fail to make a world out of themselves, leaving instead <b>snatches</b> of place, <b>time</b> of day, lighting conditions." ...|$|R
50|$|Still out of favour for the 2015-16 season, Holman {{was sent}} out on loan to Woking for a month's loan on 15 August 2015. He scored Woking's second goal on his debut as they {{defeated}} Altrincham 2-0, {{in addition to}} providing the assist for Giuseppe Sole's opener. In his third game for the club, Holman scored his second goal during the 5-2 home win over Chester as well as winning a penalty for the games opening goal. After five appearances and two goals for Woking, Holman's loan was extended by Colchester until 2 January 2016 on 1 September.

5000|$|Corrupting Dr. Nice is set {{mainly in}} three eras: the twenty-first century, 40 AD and the Cretaceous Period. In 2063 AD, time travel is commonplace. Time {{travelers}} {{feel free to}} exploit the past without fear of changing their own history because each visit creates an alternate history called a [...] "moment universe". The Saltimbanque Corporation uses it for tourism and to exploit {{the resources of the}} past. Famous historical figures are <b>snatched</b> from their <b>time</b> and brought to the twenty-first century (these include Amadeus Mozart, Sigmund Freud, Abraham Lincoln, and Jesus Christ from several different times in his life). After visitors leave a moment universe, it continues with its new history. In a few of them, permanent installations are created that can be revisited and used as way stations for time travel. One is set up in the Jerusalem of 40 AD, complete with hotels.|$|R
500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom, in November 2012, by Quercus, a London-based independent publishing house. The review in The Daily Telegraph concluded that [...] "while there are flashes of brilliance here, there's also a nagging sense that he's <b>snatching</b> at snowflakes. <b>Time</b> and time again one comes across statements that look, and sound good - these pieces were originally delivered as lectures - but which just don't stand up to analysis." [...] The reviewer cited examples, like the illustrations of the theatrics people display when coming in from the cold and the isolated feelings of downhill skiers which the reviewer rebutted with similar examples of the same that occur in temperate climates. Nick Rennison reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, writing that [...] "any writer who can take subjects as diverse as ....and find something original and interesting to say about each of them, has to be worth reading." ...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, various feminist {{interpretations of}} the witch trials have been made and published.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{am going to}} examine {{the role of the}} fiction writer/academic in {{university}} writing programs, especially {{the way in which they}} wear numerous research hats. Multi-skilled in every sense of the word, they range over university research restlessly - research for a novel one day, pedagogical research the next, <b>time</b> <b>snatched,</b> if they 2 ̆ 7 re lucky, to pursue their 2 ̆ 7 formal 2 ̆ 7 research projects, to apply for funding not just from the ARC but from the Literature Board and other community funds available to writers. They find the time to give conference papers and meet other researchers in their fields. While researchers in other disciplines such as science might say this is how it is in the academy today, especially in relation to expected research outcomes, the researcher in a writing program, I would argue, often enters research in a more complex and diverse manner, doffing one hat to replace it with another - sometimes deliberately crossing over into different research styles and genres, sometimes forgetting which hat they 2 ̆ 7 re actually wearing...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, André Éric Létourneau {{received}} the Media Art Award from the Pépinières Européennes. A {{book about his}} work P/ACT, was published by the Academy of Fine Arts in Enschede, the Netherlands. [...] Since 1999, he received several grants from the Canada Council for the Arts and the Conseil des Arts et des Lettres du Québec and from several private foundations. At {{the opening of the}} XVe Biennale de Paris in 2008, it appointed director Mr Alexandre Gurita, declared about Letourneau's work : [...] "La démarche d'André Eric Letourneau s'inscrit dans le spectre de l'invisibilité opérante, qui constitue l'axe de l'économie de l'immatériel et de la connaisance vers lesquelles nos sociétés évoluent. Dans sa pratique, le temps de l'art se fait avoir par le temps réel." [...] (The work of André Éric Létourneau is created within the spectrum/ghost of the principle of operative invisibility, which is the axis of the dematerialized world we are now living in - because of its ways of storing knowledge and memory. In his art, the time of art is <b>snatched</b> by the <b>time</b> of reality.") In 2010, Létourneau's work is presented at the biennale [...] "Madrid abierto" [...] in Spain.|$|R
5000|$|In retaliation, Hon E. T. Hogan {{ordered the}} arrest by two sheriffs of Ward {{and one other}} judge from Roop after they {{continued}} to exercise jurisdiction over Lake Honey Valley. When the Plumas County sheriff E.H. Pierce and his deputy J.D. Byers arrived, they were at first confronted by the Roop County deputy sheriff, who held in his hand an injunction restraining them. Byers wasted no <b>time</b> <b>snatching</b> it from him, {{for which he was}} arrested (and later set free thanks to the sympathy of a local lawyer and the negligence of the judge who didn't sign the warrant) In the end, Pierce and Byers were both successful in their arrests and on their way out of town. However, Deputy Sheriff Byers was late to depart, allowing former Governor Isaac Roop to overtake him. Neither was particularly pleased with the sight of the other and they almost reached a shooting point when Francis Langiar, owner of the property, said (or so he claims), [...] "Gentlemen, remember that you are both Masons." [...] With this, Roop allowed Byers up the road, but not long later he was back with seven armed men to capture the deputy (prisoner still in tow) and haul them back to town.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the father}} of Charles Lloyd you are of course in some measure {{interested}} in any alteration of my schemes of life; and I feel it a kind of Duty to give you my reasons for any such alteration. I have declined my Derby connection, and determined to retire once for all and utterly from cities and towns: and am {{about to take a}} cottage and half a dozen acres of land in an enchanting Situation about eight miles from Bridgewater. My reasons are--that I have cause to believe my Health would be materially impaired by residing in a town, and by the close confinement and anxieties incident to the education of children; that as my days would be dedicated to Dr. Crompton's children, and my evenings to a course of study with my admirable young friend, I should have scarcely a <b>snatch</b> of <b>time</b> for literary occupation; and, above all, because I am anxious that my children should be bred up from earliest infancy in the simplicity of peasants, their food, dress, and habits completely rustic. I never shall, and I never will, have any fortune to leave them: I will leave them therefore hearts that desire little, heads that know how little is to be desired, and hands and arms accustomed to earn that little. I am peculiarly delighted with the 2ist verse of the 4th chapter of Tobit, [...] "And fear not, my son! that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin and do that which is pleasing in His sight." [...] Indeed, if I live in cities, my children (if it please the All-good to preserve the one I have, and to give me more), my children, I say, will necessarily become acquainted with politicians and politics--a set of men and a kind of study which I deem highly unfavourable to all Christian graces. I have myself erred greatly in this respect; but, I trust, I have now seen my error. I have accordingly snapped my squeaking baby-trumpet of sedition, and have hung up its fragments in the chamber of Penitences.|$|R
25|$|On {{a flight}} home from America, he came under mental {{attack by the}} demonic Necromon, causing Brian to leap out of the plane; he spent two years as a hermit on the Cornish coast, {{repairing}} his psyche. He was eventually called to Merlyn's service again, fighting alongside the Black Knight and the elf Jackdaw to defend Otherworld from Necromon. With his memories partially restored Brian and the Knight, allied with Vortigen the Proud Walker, battled Mordred the Evil. Both the Black Knight and Captain Britain were <b>snatched</b> out of <b>time</b> to join the Grandmaster’s Contest of Champions, where Captain Britain fought against the Arabian Knight, but they were soon returned to resume their quest. At the entrance to Otherworld Brian was slain by the spectral White Rider, and his corpse claimed by Mandrac, Nethergod Lord of the Slain and the Rider’s master, though Merlyn and the Knight swiftly recovered it. Merlyn reunited Captain Britain’s departed spirit with his body, resurrecting him. While the hero healed, Merlyn restored his remaining memories and informed him of the Nethergod’s involvement with his early foes. Now recalling Arthur’s location, the Black Knight, Captain Britain and Jackdaw were sent to awaken the King. Succeeding in this quest, Arthur then sent Brian and Jackdaw magically away through the dimensions, stating Brian had a destiny to fulfill elsewhere. As a reward, he and Jackdaw were sent back to Earth.|$|R
