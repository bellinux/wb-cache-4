5|$|The {{wings are}} {{modified}} when gliding {{so that they}} rise from the body at an angle, but are closer to horizontal further along the wingspan. In silhouette, the comparatively long neck, head and beak <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> from the front almost {{as far as the}} tail does behind. For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of gliding.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloring}} of the addax's coat {{varies with}} the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders. In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, 1993, Jordan {{announced}} his retirement, citing {{a loss of}} desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that {{the death of his}} father three months earlier also shaped his decision. Jordan's father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked the luxury vehicle. The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone. The two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket. In 1996, he founded a Chicago area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of the 2007 season, the Red Sox were helped out and {{sometimes}} carried by rookies. Five rookies <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> in particular. Dustin Pedroia, Jacoby Ellsbury, Clay Buchholz, Daisuke Matsuzaka, and Hideki Okajima all had their moments and left their mark of this season in Red Sox history.|$|E
25|$|True {{leg length}} {{inequality}} may sometimes {{be caused by}} improper implant selection. The femoral component may be too large and <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> of the femur farther than needed. The head ball selected may sit too proud on the stem. Stiffness in the lower back from arthritis or previous fusion surgery seems to magnify the perception of leg-length inequality.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{important}} to avoid snakes that appear to be dead, as some species will actually roll over on their backs and <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> their tongue to fool potential threats. A snake's detached head can immediately act by reflex and potentially bite. The induced bite can be just as severe as that of a live snake.|$|E

25|$|Linen shirts had deep cuffs. Shirt sleeves became fuller {{throughout}} the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> horizontally, called a whisk, was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular falling band {{lying on the}} shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter Anthony van Dyck, were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well.|$|E
25|$|While most cryptozoologists {{recognize}} {{that at least}} some reports are simple misidentifications, they claim that many of the creatures described by those who have seen them look nothing like the known species put forward by skeptics and claim that certain reports <b>stick</b> <b>out.</b> For their part, the skeptics remain unconvinced, pointing out that {{even in the absence of}} outright hoaxes, imagination has a way of twisting and inflating the slightly out-of-the-ordinary until it becomes extraordinary.|$|E
25|$|In a nanorecording application, {{a certain}} rotaxane is {{deposited}} as a Langmuir-Blodgett film on ITO-coated glass. When a positive voltage is applied {{with the tip}} of a scanning tunneling microscope probe, the rotaxane rings in the tip area switch to {{a different part of the}} dumbbell and the resulting new conformation makes the molecules <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> 0.3 nanometer from the surface. This height difference is sufficient for a memory dot. It is not yet known how to erase such a nanorecording film.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 the Vartiokylä dumping ground was closed, but not because of its {{environmental}} impact. The official story was that the place was full and could not accommodate further waste materials. Since it had originally been a hole from which gravel had been taken, it did not <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> from the surrounding areas, such as the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Vuosaari dumping ground did and still do. (These two dumping grounds now replaced the Vartiokylä dumping ground.) Thus, when {{the construction of the}} Myllypuro neighbourhood was begun, the new residents most likely were oblivious {{to the fact that there}} had once been such a site there.|$|E
25|$|Like other archosaurs, {{crocodilians}} are diapsid, {{although their}} post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The {{walls of the}} braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues are not free, but {{held in place by}} a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> their tongues. Crocodiles have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} Craig's monodramatic {{interpretation}} {{lay in the}} staging of the first court scene (1.2). The stage was divided sharply into two areas {{through the use of}} lighting: the background was brightly lit, while the foreground was dark and shadowy. The screens were lined up along the back wall and bathed in diffuse yellow light. From a high throne upon which Claudius and Gertrude sat, which was bathed in a diagonal, bright golden beam, a pyramid descended, representing the feudal hierarchy. The pyramid gave the illusion of a single, unified golden mass, from which the courtier's heads appeared to <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> through slits in the material. In the foreground in dark shadow, Hamlet lay slouched, as if dreaming. A gauze was hung between Hamlet and the court, further emphasising the division. On Claudius' exit-line the figures remained in place while the gauze was loosened, so that the entire court appeared to melt away before the audience's eyes, {{as if they had been}} a projection of Hamlet's thoughts that now had turned elsewhere. The scene, and the gauze effect in particular, prompted an ovation from the audience, which was unheard of at the MAT.|$|E

25|$|The feeding {{was done}} {{through the use}} of specially-constructed small wooden boxes, 4cm by 7cm, {{developed}} by Weigl. The boxes were sealed with paraffin on the top which prevented the lice from escaping, and the underside consisted of a screen made of a fabric sieve, adopted by Weigl from sieves that were used by local peasants to separate wheat husks from the seeds. A typical box contained 400 to 800 lice larvae which would mature as the feeding took place. The sieve bottom allowed the lice to <b>stick</b> <b>out</b> their heads and feed on the human flesh. A standard feeding period took thirty to forty-five minutes, and was repeated with the same lice colony for twelve days. Usually, an individual feeder would accommodate from 7 to 11 boxes (of 400 to 800 lice each) on his or her leg, per feeding session. Typically men would place the boxes on their calves, to minimize the discomfort of the bites, while women feeders placed them on their thighs, so that the bite marks could be covered up by a skirt. A nurse had to watch over the feeding process as the lice would feed beyond the point of being gorged on the blood and could burst if left on the human flesh for too long.|$|E
500|$|Dead animals {{may appear}} to have been tipped over.
