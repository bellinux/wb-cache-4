40|$|The basic {{characteristics}} of the broad band noise (BBN) generated from a multi-blade <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> are summarized. As a basic experiment of the BBN, the noise characteristics generated from an arc blade were researched in the wind tunnel experiment, and the distributions of the sound sources of the same blade were visualized by a numerical computation. As the sound sources generating at the separation point moved to trailing edge, {{the scale of the}} sound sources became large. Moreover, the sound sources were not necessarily uniform scale. The sound pressure generated from the multi-blade <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> was proportional to third power of the flow coefficient, and the BBN in the spectrum distribution was in inverse proportion to third power of the frequency. This tendency of the noise of the fan was same as the noise {{characteristics of}} the are blade. In the fan noise of the multi-blade <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan,</b> the influence of the BBN appeared in the flow rate vicinity of the maximum efficiency point...|$|E
40|$|A <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> is a {{centrifugal}} fan with a forward curved blade. It {{is used for}} low pressure but has a large discharge use. In this paper, at first, nine impellers with various blade shapes were tested in the same casing. The measurements of the three-dimensional time variant velocity at the outlet of the impeller were done using four impellers having better performances among them. The relations between fan performance and outlet velocity were considered. The effects of the blade shape on the performance were considered. The blade inlet and outlet angles and blade inclination angles which have the best performance were considered. The design parameters of designing a <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> impeller was described...|$|E
40|$|We made an {{experimental}} and a theoretical investigation on the turbulent noise {{generated by a}} small <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan.</b> One of the impeller in this experiment has unique structure, which is put the upper impeller with the large inner diameter upon the lower one that has smaller inner diameter and same outer diameter as the upper impeller. This impeller was named dual-cascade impeller. It is expected that the fan efficiency with dual-cascade impeller become higher than the general <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> because of controlled the pressure loss by reversed flow at upper side of the span. Moreover, we suggested the theoretical wake characteristics of the blade in order to predict the turbulent noise; the relative velocity and {{the width of the}} wake consisted the separation point on the forward blade. The pressure coefficient and the efficiency of the fan with dual-cascade impeller became higher than the general <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> at the region of high flow rate (φ> 0. 19). In two types of the small sirocco fans, the sound pressure level of turbulent noise with suggested wake characteristics were predicted within 2. 4 dB errors in comparison to measured value...|$|E

When the German fleet was scuttled at Scapa Flow in 1919, {{it was discovered}} that nearly every German ship was equipped with <b>Sirocco</b> <b>fans</b> manufactured before the war. [...] Desperate to use his inventing skills to aid the war effort in World War 1, he designed and made prototypes of a hand-held grenade-launching pistol or 'Hand Howitzer' for use in the trenches where his son Jim was fighting as a machine gun captain. The American military were close to placing a big order for these when the war ended.|$|R

The 16 acre (65,000 m²) site {{is one of the}} last large undeveloped areas in the Laganside area. The Sirocco Ropeworks was once the largest rope manufacturer in the world. It later became Howden <b>Sirocco,</b> producing <b>fans</b> and heat exchangers. In 1999 the company was sold for £23 million, and production moved overseas.|$|R
40|$|A micro-downsized radial-flow fan (<b>Sirocco</b> <b>Fan)</b> was {{designed}} for the local cooling of electronic devices and its performance was tested in order to analyze the scale effect. The outer diameter of the rotor is 8 mm, and the blade chord length, the blade width and the blade thickness were about 2 mm, 8 mm and 0. 2 mm, respectively. The variable parameters to examine the scale effect were the diameter ratio D_ 1 /D_ 2 of the rotor inlet to the outlet (0. 4 ~ 0. 75), the number of blades (8 ~ 20), scroll angles (6 ^o~ 12 ^o) {{and the number of}} rotor revolution (3750 ~ 8500 rpm). It was found that the optimun. D_ 1 / D_ 2 was about 25 % smaller than that of a non-downsized <b>Sirocco</b> <b>Fan</b> and the flow rate was considerably affected by both the blade thickness and the number of blades...|$|E

40|$|Initially in this research, {{effects of}} blade inlet and outlet angles on the {{performance}} were considered by measuring performances. Twelve impellers with various blade angles {{were used for the}} measurements. The most suitable inlet and outlet angles and the inclination angle were acquired. Then, measurements on the inlet and outlet flows and their axial and circumferential distributions were taken for various operating conditions at the various measuring positions. The turning angles through the blade were calculated from these measured results. The inlet and outlet flows of the <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> are not uniform around the circumference. The distributions of the flow have some relations with the development of flow in the inlet part and in the casing. Discussions were made on the flow to have a improved performance...|$|E
40|$|Myung-Il Kim*, Seung-Hae Kim+ A fan is {{the most}} common air flow {{machinery}} and is being used in various different industries such as for heavy machinery, home appliances and automobile. An axial fan has blades that force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. This type of fan is used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, ranging from small cooling fans for electronics to the giant fans used in wind tunnels. An axial fan generating large air volume used to cool equipments, but is less efficient. A <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> is a efficient device for moving air by centrifugal force and can generate high pressure. Fans that affect the performance and noise of a product are important components. It is also a time and budget consuming equipment to develop a fan through physical experiments.

40|$|The simple {{prediction}} of flow characteristics in a <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> is proposed. The prediction estimates {{the scale of}} the separation region near the front side as well as the flow characteristics of the impeller. The prediction is composed of two steps. The first step is the potential prediction that is provided with the source and vortex circle in axisymmetric flow condition and is not considered the blade load. The second step is the correction of the first step. The blade load was considered and the static pressure at the outlet of the impeller was used as the criterion. It was made a experiment for checking the validity of the prediction. The scale of the separation region is well agreed with the experiment. The distributions of the flow characteristics at the outlet of the impeller, pressures and velocities, are relatively good agreed to the experimental results. The span-averaged characteristics are well coincide. The validity of the simple prediction was obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} of a <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan,</b> used {{to supply}} air to a mist sprayer, and a Diesel engine is studied {{in order to}} enhance the performance of the integrated system. In this case, the main problem for the correct design of the fan arises {{from the fact that it}} is not possible to define a priori the operating point. In fact, the rotational speed is not fixed as in the case of an electric motor driven fan, but is determined as an equilibrium of the power supplied by the engine and the power absorbed by the fan to recover the pressure drops of the mist sprayer system. In this paper, the experimental campaign performed to characterize the existent fans is presented. Moreover, the sprayer duct is characterized by using literature correlations and by performing numerical simulations. Then, the collected data are elaborated in order to scale the fans {{in order to enhance}} the performance of the system...|$|E
40|$|The nonuniformity {{flow in the}} meridional {{section of}} a multi-blade <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> has been {{represented}} as two domains. In the one domain, the air accompanied with the wake flows out to outside of impeller, and the vortex flow exists in another domain. In this study, the slip factor and the four pressure losses have been estimated. A pressure loss arose at the upstream side rather than the measurement point, and other losses were produced by {{the expansion of the}} scroll casing, mixing of the wake and the mixing of the vortex flow. As a result of analysis of the internal flow of the fan, it became clear that aerodynamic characteristics of the fan are influenced of the pressure loss produced in the process in which substantial channel reduced by the vortex flow carries out sudden expansion. When the effect on the mixing losses proposed in this study was applied to the estimate of the total pressure coefficient of the fan, the coefficient was able to be estimated within 6 % errors...|$|E
40|$|The flow at {{impeller}} outlet and the {{fan noise}} of dual-cascade centrifugal fan (DC fan) had been experimentally investigated {{with respect to}} the effects of bare ratio and outlet angle of the scroll casing. These design parameters are effective method for the fan that has to send out a large amount of air. It was found that these design parameters were occurred different phenomena of the flow at impeller outlet, accordingly, the each phenomenon was individually concerned to the fan noise. When the outlet angle became large, the flow velocity passing exhaust duct of the scroll casing that of diffuser was decreased. Then the fan noise also could be decreased because of controlled the relative velocity at impeller outlet near the tongue of the scroll casing. Especially, the both characteristics that of the aerodynamics and the noise of DC fan had available properties than the general multi-blade <b>sirocco</b> <b>fan</b> in the case of large bare ratio. It was considered that the improvement of the noise property concerned with comparably large-scale flow that was brought into being lower frequency at upper side of the impeller...|$|E
