5|$|In 2006, the {{concentration}} of sulfates at several points on Kettle Creek was measured. Upstream of Slide Hollow, it was seven milligrams per liter and in Slide Hollow, it was 910 milligrams per liter. The <b>sulfate</b> concentration of Kettle Creek upstream of Short Bend Run was 8 milligrams per liter. In Short Bend Run it was 431 milligrams per liter. Above Twomile Run on Kettle Creek, the <b>sulfate</b> concentration was 16 milligrams per liter and at the mouth it was 11 milligrams per liter. Upstream of the acid mine drainage, the <b>sulfate</b> concentration ranges from under 10 to 17 parts per million.

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that a range of <b>sulfate</b> and halide (primarily chloride and fluoride) compounds are readily mobilised from fresh volcanic ash.; It is considered most likely that these salts are formed {{as a consequence of}} rapid acid dissolution of ash particles within eruption plumes, which is thought to supply the cations involved in the deposition of <b>sulfate</b> and halide salts.|$|E
25|$|The olivine {{abundance}} varies inversely {{with the}} amount of <b>sulfates.</b> This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce <b>sulfates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The HERA project also {{conducted}} an environmental review of alkyl <b>sulfates</b> that found all alkyl <b>sulfates</b> are readily biodegradable and standard wastewater treatment operations removed 96-99.96% of short-chain (12-14 carbons) alkyl <b>sulfates.</b> Even in anaerobic conditions at least 80% {{of the original}} volume is biodegraded after 15 days with 90% degradation after 4 weeks.|$|R

5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent roasting converts the ores to the cobalt <b>sulfate,</b> whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the <b>sulfate</b> together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of copper <b>sulfate.</b> Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{evaluation}} and method optimalization for determination of <b>sulfates</b> in aqueous solutions with application on different kinds of waters. For determination of <b>sulfates</b> were used two different procedures, turbidimetric and volumetric. In turbidimetric procedure was use optimized conditions applicable determination of <b>sulfates</b> in range from 0 – 20 mg. l- 1. For stabilization of the colloid was use glycerine, himself <b>sulfates</b> sedimentation is discharged in BaSO 4 form. By volumetric methods are used titration on the dithizone like indicator while using Pb(NO 3) 2 like volumetric reagent. Other indicator bromsulfonazo III, whitch are used for determination of <b>sulfates</b> by the help of volumetric solutions Ba(ClO 4) 2 and BaCl 2. All volumetric determinations proceeded in acidic medium. During research of interferences ions on the individual titraction was detected substantial effect Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Fe 3 +, which was needing divide off on the exchanger resin.

40|$|Removal of Mg from {{hydrated}} Ni <b>sulfates</b> {{has long}} been a problem in the industrial purification process of hydrated Ni <b>sulfates.</b> In this work, we have investigated this industrial problem using state-of-the-art molecular simulations. Periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) and cluster DFT calculations are used to study the crystal structures and phase stability of the hexahydrated and heptahydrated Ni and Mg <b>sulfates</b> and their mixed phases. The calculated lattice parameters of MSO 4 (H 2 O) (n) (M=Ni, Mg; n= 6, 7) crystals are in good agreement with available experimental data. The relative energy differences of the mixed phase for both hexahydrated and heptahydrated Ni/Mg <b>sulfates</b> obtained from both the periodic and cluster DFT calculations are generally less than kT (25. 8 meV, T= 300 K), indicating that a continuous solid solution is formed. We also investigated the Bader charges and electronic structures of the hexahydrated and heptahydrated Ni/Mg <b>sulfates</b> using the periodic DFT calculations. The energy band gaps of the hexahydrated and heptahydrated Ni and Mg <b>sulfates</b> were predicted by first-principles calculations. Large energy band gaps of about similar to 5. 5 eV were obtained from the DFT-GGA calculations for hydrated Mg <b>sulfates,</b> and band gaps of about similar to 5. 1 eV were obtained by the DFT-GGA+U calculations for hydrated Ni <b>sulfates.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Eleven male {{patients}} with liver diseases were examined for conjugated estrogens in urines, which were fractionated to the estrogen glucuronides by hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase and estrogen <b>sulfates</b> by solvolysis. Both {{of them were}} fractionated further to estrone, estradiol and estriol by modified Brown's method and Salokangas' micromethod. The results were as follows. 1) The ratios of estrogen glucuronides to estrogen <b>sulfates</b> were decreased in all three fractions of estrogen, particularly in estriol in liver diseases, and the extents of decreases of ratios were paralleled with severity of the liver diseases. These decreases came from the relative increases of estrogen <b>sulfates</b> to estrogen glucuronides. 2) Neither levels of estrogen glucuronides and estrogen <b>sulfates</b> in urines, nor ratios of estrogen glucuronides to estrogen <b>sulfates</b> were in distinct correlation {{with the results of}} routine liver function tests. 3) The ratios of estrogen glucuronides to estrogen <b>sulfates</b> fluctuated in accordance with the course of the diseases. In convalescence of acute hepatitis, when the results of routine liver function tests had returned to normal ranges, the ratios of estrogen glucuronides to estrogen <b>sulfates</b> were still sometimes decreased, and returned to their normal levels after some delay to the results of other function tests. 4) No distinct correlation between the ratios of estrogen glucuronides to estrogen <b>sulfates</b> and histological findings of liver tissues could be discerned. 5) In a case of Dubin-Johnson's syndrome, the same disordered conjugation and urinary excretion of estrogens were observed as in liver damages...|$|R

40|$|Calcium, {{magnesium}} and {{ferric iron}} <b>sulfates</b> {{have been detected}} by the instrument suites on the Mars rovers. A subset of the magnesium <b>sulfates</b> show clear associations with nickel. These associations indicate Ni(2 +) co-precipitation with or substitution for Mg(2 +) from sulfate-saturated solutions. Nickel is ex-tracted from primary rocks almost exclusively at pH values less than 6, constraining the formation of these Mg-Ni <b>sulfates</b> to mildly to strongly acidic conditions. There is clear evidence for aqueous alteration at the rim of Endeavour Crater (Meridiani Planum), in the Murray formation mudstone (Gale Crater), and near Home Plate (Gusev Crater).

5|$|Ganymede's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 43%. Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 %, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen <b>sulfate</b> and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown magnesium <b>sulfate</b> (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium <b>sulfate</b> (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E

40|$|Regioselectively {{substituted}} cellulose <b>sulfates</b> in C 2 / 3 -, C 2 / 6 -, or C 6 -position of the anhydroglucose unit {{are accessible}} by certain synthesis routes. Thereby, products with different properties and various application areas are resulted. Important characteristics of cellulose <b>sulfates</b> regarding their applications are solubility (e. g. in water), rheological behavior, different interaction with low or high molecular cations, thermo reversible gel formation, enzymatic degradability, anticoagulant and antiviral activity. In C 6 -position substituted cellulose <b>sulfates</b> can be synthesized in principle by acetosulfation. The acetosulfation is a quasi-homogeneous synthesis proceeding under gradually {{dissolution of the}} cellulose by using different reactivity of the primary and secondary OH-groups as soon as converting cellulose acetate <b>sulfates.</b> After precipitation of the polymer the acetyl groups are cleaved in alkaline solution. The focus of our study was firstly {{the investigation of the}} acetosulfation in different polar aprotic solvents by various <b>sulfating</b> and acetylating agents.

40|$|Urinary polyanions {{recovered}} from the urine samples of kidney stone-formers and normal controls were subjected to preparative agarose gel electrophoresis, which yielded fractions 1 - 5 in a decreasing order of mobility. In both groups, chondroitin <b>sulfates</b> were identified in the fast-moving fractions and heparan <b>sulfates</b> in the slow-moving fractions. Furthermore, two types of heparan <b>sulfates</b> were identified based on their electrophoretic mobility: slow-moving and fast-moving. The fractionated urinary polyanions were then tested in an in vitro calcium oxalate crystallization assay and compared at the same uronic acid concentration, whereby, the chondroitin <b>sulfates</b> of stone-formers and heparan <b>sulfates</b> of normals enhanced crystal nucleation. Fraction 5 of the normals, containing glycoproteins (14 - 97 kDa) and associated glycosaminoglycans, were found to effectively inhibit crystallization. Papainization of this fraction in stone-formers revealed crystal-suppressive effects of glycoproteins, which was not seen in similar fractions of normals. It was concluded that glycoproteins could modulate the crystal-enhancing glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin <b>sulfates</b> of stone-formers but not in normals. The differing crystallization activities of electrophoretic fraction 1 of normals and stone-formers revealed the presence of another class of glycosaminoglycan-hyaluronan. Hence, in the natural milieu, different macromolecules combine to have an overall outcome in the crystallization of calcium oxalate. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
