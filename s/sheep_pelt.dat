50|$|Namibia imports {{almost all}} of its goods from South Africa. Many exports {{likewise}} go to the South African market, or transit that country. Namibia's exports consist mainly of diamonds and other minerals, fish products, beef and meat products, karakul <b>sheep</b> <b>pelts,</b> and light manufactures. In recent years, Namibia has accounted for about 5% of total SACU exports, and a slightly higher percentage of imports.|$|R
50|$|The A4 Sheep Bank Project is {{currently}} in its last phase. The project is working to support the transition of the mobile veterinary unit into a privatized business as well as assist sheep owners to form enterprise groups involved in trading live <b>sheep,</b> <b>pelts,</b> skins and wool. In addition, a wool-processing and yarn-spinning project will be established {{in order to create}} immediate employment opportunities and income for Afghan women to work from their homes. The production of high-quality handspun yarn would be able to add value to sheared sheep wool and link into other downstream industries such as textile, carpets and handicrafts, generating further income and job prospects.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an overview and describes progress on work directed ultimately at developing an automated grading system for pickled <b>sheep</b> <b>pelts.</b> A laser scanner {{has been developed}} which provides simultaneous acquisition of three image types representing transmission, reflectance and fluorescent properties of the pelts. Of particular interest is the fluorescence image which highlights pelt defects not normally apparent with either the naked eye or a camera. The variation of pelt fluorescence with time has been investigated and two mechanisms identified—one due to long term decay of the fluorescent yield from time of slaughter and the other due to rapid decay of fluorescence with time {{of exposure to the}} laser excitation. The feasibility of using light transmission as a measure of pelt thickness has been investigated and preliminary results suggest that this will not be possible without other information also being used. Pattern recognition algorithms which show potential for automating the grading process are currently under investigation. These are briefly introduced. 1...|$|R
50|$|Migration {{would begin}} {{again in the}} late 1980s, centred on Chui Province, Bishkek and its surroundings; people from Xinjiang would come to rent land, and grow vegetables. Others came as {{cross-border}} traders, selling Chinese alcoholic beverages and buying up clothing - especially coats made from Karakul <b>sheep</b> <b>pelts</b> - for sale in Xinjiang. In the early 2000s, the majority of PRC nationals in Kyrgyzstan were of Uyghur ethnicity, but since then, {{an increasing number of}} Han Chinese have been arriving. Kyrgyzstan and other post-Soviet states are popular destinations for people from Xinjiang because they offer the opportunity to learn Russian, which has become important in urban job markets such as Urumqi. Recent migrants state they chose Kyrgyzstan as their destination, rather than join the large numbers of Chinese people in Russia or in Kazakhstan because Kyrgyzstan is cheaper, and because they perceive public safety as being better in Kyrgyzstan than in Russia where there have been cases of attacks on migrant workers.|$|R
50|$|Very {{young or}} even fetal Karakul lambs are prized for <b>pelts.</b> Newborn karakul <b>sheep</b> <b>pelts</b> are called karakul (also spelled caracul), swakara (coined from South West Africa Karakul), {{astrakhan}} (Russian), Persian lamb, agnello di Persia, (Italian), krimmer (Russian) and garaköli bagana (Turkmen). Sometimes the terms for newborn lambs' and fetal lambs' pelts are used interchangeably. The newborn lambs have a tight, curly pattern of hair. The lambs must be under three days old {{when they are}} killed, or they will lose their black color and soft, tightly wound coils of fur. Dark colors are dominant and lambs often darken in color as they age. Fetal karakul lamb pelts are called broadtail, Breitschwanz (German), and karakulcha. Fetal karakul lambs are harvested through miscarriages, induced early delivery or by killing the mother sheep and removing the fetus. Rather than killing healthy female sheep, farmers will kill older sheep that have already given birth many times. People use the lamb pelts to create various clothing items, such as The Astrakhan (hat) or karakul hat. The pelts have also been used in haute couture.|$|R
60|$|And now {{he noted}} that the horse moved to a {{definite}} goal. Where the prairie lay smooth he kept his course straight as an arrow's toward the east. Deflected by hill or arroyo or impractical spinous brakes, he quickly flowed again into the current, charted by his unerring instinct. At last, upon the side of a gentle rise, he suddenly subsided to a complacent walk. A stone's cast away stood a little mott of coma trees; beneath it a jacal such as the Mexicans erect--a one-room house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed with grass or tule reeds. An experienced eye would have estimated the spot as the headquarters of a small sheep ranch. In the moonlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to a level smoothness by the hoofs of the sheep. Everywhere was carelessly distributed the paraphernalia of the place--ropes, bridles, saddles, <b>sheep</b> <b>pelts,</b> wool sacks, feed troughs, and camp litter. The barrel of drinking water stood in the end of the two-horse wagon near the door. The harness was piled, promiscuous, upon the wagon tongue, soaking up the dew.|$|R
40|$|An {{account is}} given of the effect, within the Icelandic <b>Sheep</b> breed, of <b>pelt</b> class of sire and pelt class of {{daughter}} on lambing records of 1270 daughters at i, 2 and 3 {{years of age}} and on carcass score of 1023 daughters at the ages 2 and 3 years. Daughters of 141 sires were included in the study. The pelt classes were: A, pure white lustrous, long and even fleece, B, pure white with lower quality fleece, C, white with tan colour on outskirts of fleece, and D, white with tan fibres in the fleece. Sires in pelt classes A and B had heavier weaning weight of daughters than sires in other pelt classes. Daughters in pelt classes A and B were lighter at weaning than those in other pelt classes due to lowered selection intensity for weaning weight. The pelt class of sire did not significantly affect any of the production traits. No effect of pelt class of sire or pelt class of daughter on ewe fertility could be demonstrated. Daughters in pelt classes A and B had lower score for carcass production than daughters in pelt classes C and D...|$|R
