The majority of foods consumed by Ghanaian women during pregnancy were foods indigenous to Ghanaian diets in general such as green leafy vegetables, meats, fish, fruits, and legumes. They also consume foreign foods such as dairy products, biscuits, and beverages such as tea and powdered mixes. Recommended raw foods during pregnancy include: bananas, oranges, papaya, pineapples, carrots, cabbage, lettuce, honey, and kwawu nsua/nsaman troba. Recommended cooked foods include bean stew with palm oil and boiled white rice, bread, fried anchovies, <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel,</b> snails in soup, stews with eggs and vegetables, palm nut soup with fufu and rice, and Nkontomire stew which is made with palm oil and boiled sweet cassava, or plantain, or yam.

50|$|More festive meals can be loosely {{divided into}} courses: Fish {{toppings}} first (such as herring, shrimp, or smoked salmon) followed by cold cuts and salads, and finally cheese with bread or crackers {{and a little}} fruit. One or several warm dishes are often served with the meats on special occasions: For example breaded plaice filet, fried medister sausage, frikadeller with pickled red cabbage, or mørbradbøf (pork tenderloin with sauteed onions or a creamy mushroom sauce). Toppings change with the seasons and some are mostly associated with Easter or Christmas lunches, like sylte (head cheese) and æbleflæsk (roast pork or bacon in apple sauce).

40|$|Four spices (clove, cinnamon, {{tamarind}} and ginger) {{were combined}} {{and applied to}} produce <b>smoked</b> female <b>mackerel.</b> The use of liquid smoke was compared with redistilled liquid smoke. The result showed that there was lower histamine content in smoked fish treated with spices after the use of liquid smoke and redistilled liquid smoke at (1. 00 – 1. 20 mg/ 100 g) compared with the raw material (1. 55 mg/ 100 g). Histamine content in all treatments increased during storage from 0. 96 – 1. 13 mg/ 100 g to 6. 40 - 20. 29 mg/ 100 g. The phenol content decreased during storage from 2. 19 % - 2. 44 % to 0. 72 % - 0. 84 %. Using of liquid smoke in combination with spice as well as without spice,resulted in decreasing of the free fatty acid (FFA) content until 20 days of storage then increased, whereas using redistilled liquid smoke, resulted decreased of FFA during 10 days storage before increased. Total psychrophilic microbe was not detectable at 0 and 10 days storage but then increased at 20 and 30 days storage to 6. 5 x 103 – 10. 1 x 103 cfu/ml and 7. 5 x 103 – 15. 5 x 103 cfu/ml, respectively.

40|$|Marine and {{fisheries}} resources in Situbondo Regency were potential to supports seafood processing, e. g. traditional smoked processing of mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis Cantor) based on local wisdom. This research was aimed {{to assess and}} analyzes: the processing of <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna based on local wisdom, public perception towards the processing of <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna, {{and the quality of}} <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna. The research carried out on January to April 2014, in Jangkar Village, Situbondo regency. The study included depth interview from key persons with questionnaire and organoleptic test. The public perception on <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna was taken by questionnaire from 85 respondents, whereas the quality of <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna was analyzed with laboratory proximate test. Result of this research showed that <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna processing used traditional smoking instrument and fuel material. The smoking stall used several banana midrib stem above the furnace that made of cement and bricks, while the fuel use coconut coir which created the typical flavors of the <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna. The average organoleptic value of the <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna appearance is 7. 89 (intact, clean, brown, very shiny specific type), flavors of 8. 24 (less fragrant, smoked enough, without additional disturbing odor), taste of 8. 41 (delicious, savory), texture of 7. 40 (solid, compact, fairly dry, tight inter-flesh tissue), and colour of 7. 20 (attractive, specific, shiny brown colour type). Public perception showed that the community knowledge on <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna processing is good, creates good flavors of <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> tuna and favored by the community, thus also encourage the community to support the conservation of this traditional smoked processing. Lab analysis showed that the proximate value of 0. 99 % carbohydrates, 29. 59 % protein, 1. 14 % fat, 2. 89 % mineral, 1. 88 % ash, and 63. 4 % water.

40|$|Fish {{products}} {{contribute significantly}} to protein nutriture, food security, livelihoods and the economy in West Africa. Food safety of processed fish products however remains an important concern. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the safety of traditionally processed fish from Ghana. Microbiological analysis of selected traditionally processed fish products was conducted. Challenge tests were employed to determine the effects of storage temperature on survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The effects of salting, temperature, pH and inoculum size on the survival and enterotoxin production of S. aureus was also determined. Food safety surveys were conducted. Self-reported and observed food safety practices and the role of food safety inspectors were assessed. The pH levels observed in all samples were not at optimum levels to inhibit microbial growth. Water activity (aw) levels were: fried bonga (0. 82 – 0. 95), koobi (0. 53 – 0. 75), kako (0. 55 – 0. 70, smoked catfish (0. 72 – 0. 95), smoked herrings (0. 54 – 0. 94) and <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> (0. 84 – 0. 99). Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens were not detected in 25 g and 1 g, respectively, of any of the samples. Varying levels of Bacillus cereus, S. aureus and yeast and mould were detected in fried bonga and smoked fish samples. Aerobic bacteria and coliforms were present in 50 % and 44. 4 %, of fried bonga. Only yeast and moulds were detected in kako and koobi at levels of < 2 log to 4 log cfu/g in koobi and from < 2 log to 5 log cfu/g in kako. High levels of between 5 log 10 CFU/g and 6 log 10 CFU/g aerobic bacteria were recorded in <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel.</b> On the basis of aw levels and microbial quality, <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> and fried bonga were classified as high risk fish products requiring time-temperature control, and salted koobi, kako, smoked herrings and catfish as low risk products. Challenge tests with S. aureus in salted <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> and catfish showed no growth and no enterotoxin A and B at 4 °C. S. aureus numbers increased in smoked catfish and mackerel samples stored at 30 oC but decreased with increasing NaCl concentration (p< 0. 001; r 2 = 0. 0507). At 30 oC, SEA and SEB were detected in samples formulated with 5 % (w/w) NaCl with high inoculum. Samples formulated with higher than 5 % (w/w) NaCl suppressed growth and enterotoxin production. Food safety knowledge among respondents was good and consumers were concerned with some aspects of food safety in Ghana although not fish in particular. Very few food handlers had received adequate food safety training, the majority of whom overestimated their food safety compliance, evidenced by observed poor hygiene practices. Only 43. 8 % of inspectors had higher professional qualifications and 29. 2 % were trained in HACCP. Inspectors identified lack of information (41. 7 %), support (41. 7 %) and operational costs (39. 6 %) among the barriers to food safety compliance. These findings suggest a need for education at all levels including food safety enforcement professionals. A framework model which integrates all aspects of the findings in developing a national regulatory and policy framework for fish food safety has been proposed. Some of the skills that are missing are identified and suggestions put forward that will benefit traditional fish processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{technological}} process of <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber scombrus) manufacture {{was described in}} detail {{with a focus on}} quality of muscle. The <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> brined in 6 %, 12 % and 15 % of brine was monitored by texture profile analysis (TPA) using a cylindrical probe P 75 and spherical probe P 1 S. Textural properties of muscle, such as hardness, cohesiveness, springiness and chewiness were evaluated. With increasing concentrations of brine muscle hardness and chewiness significantly decreases. In texture measuring, using a cylindrical probe P 75, in 6 % of brine approximately 10. 4 % higher hardness can be achieved, about 1 % higher chewiness and about approximately 5 % lower springiness expect, than when brined in 12 % of brine. When brined in 15 % of brine about 6. 7 % lower hardness, about approximately 11. 2 % lower chewiness and about 6. 5 % lower springiness expect, than when brined in 12 % of brine. When using a spherical probe P 1 S is at brined in 6 % of brine about approximately 6. 5 % higher hardness and about approximately 11 % lower chewiness that brined in 12 % of brine. When brined in 15 % of brine about approximately 13 % lower springiness and approximately 21. 7 % lower chewiness expect, than when brined in 12 % of brine. To a lesser extent springiness was influenced, cohesiveness with increasing concentrations of salt in brine was unchanged. Texture measurements were supplemented by microbiological analysis of the total count of microorganisms (TCM). This analysis confirmed that with increasing concentrations of salt brine the count of microorganisms decreases (on 103 using 6 % of brine and on 102 using 12 % and 15 % of brine) as a result of reduced water activity (aw) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to create a}} {{preliminary}} base from which an Economic Model of EU Seafood Demand can be constructed. This is done through a literature review of existing neo-classical studies of EU seafood demand 1980 - 96. Many demand studies are known, but almost all have been drawn up for market segments in single EU countries. Applied ordinary and inverse demand models are reviewed and it is argued that the inverse model is superior on fish markets, as supply is presumed to be determined by bio-economy, weather and fishery regulations. In the reviewed studies price flexibilities are estimated from – 1 to 0. For example, a 10 % quota reduction causes a 0 - 10 % price increase, 2. 7 % on average. Results differ according to different aggregation levels, different size and share of examined markets and different degrees of market delineation on those markets.

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted in March until April 2015 to determine the correlation of weight reduction by smoking {{to the quality of}} <b>smoked</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Euthynnus affinis) fillet that stored at chilling temperature (7 ± 2 °C). The {{research was}} using correlational-experimental method. The first step is filleting the fish at the size of 1. 5 cm in thickness and 70 g in weight, then soaked it in 30 % salt brine for 5 minutes. Then the fillet was soaked in the liquid smoke at the consentration of 8 % for an hour and then dried until the weight was reducing until several percentages, namely: 0 %, 20 %, 40 % and 60 % from the initial weight. Parameters used were hedonic values (appearance, odor, taste and texture), moisture content, pH, free fatty acid, total phenol, and bacterial total plate counts. The data obtained were tabulated and analyzed using simple linear regression. The result shows that the increase of weight reduction on smoked fillet mackerel stored in chilling temperature (7 ± 2 °C) was significantly correlated to the increase of hedonic values (appearance (R 2 = 0. 665), odor (R 2 = 0. 629), taste (R 2 = 0. 559), and texture (R 2 = 0. 763)), total phenol (the first total phenol (R 2 = 0. 868), the end total phenol (R 2 = 0. 940) and free fatty acid (R 2 = 0. 493) (p< 0. 05). Otherwise, it was significantly correlated to the decrease of moisture content (R 2 = 0. 902), pH (R 2 = 0. 339) and bacterial total plate counts (R 2 = 0. 260) (p< 0. 05) ...|$|E
