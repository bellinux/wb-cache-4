50|$|STS-51-L was the twenty-fifth {{flight in}} the American Space <b>Shuttle</b> program, and <b>marked</b> {{the first time}} a {{civilian}} had flown aboard the Space Shuttle. The mission used Space Shuttle Challenger, which lifted off from launch pad 39B on January 28, 1986, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The mission ended in disaster following the destruction of Challenger 73 seconds after lift-off, because of the failure of an O-ring seal on Challengers right solid rocket booster, which led to the rapid disintegration of the shuttle stack from overwhelming aerodynamic pressures. The seven-member crew was killed sometime after the breakup of the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Completion of {{the final}} Space <b>Shuttle</b> flight <b>marks</b> {{the end of a}} {{significant}} era in Human Spaceflight. Developed in the 1970 s, first launched in 1981, the Space Shuttle embodies many significant engineering achievements. One of these is the development and operation of the first extensive fly-by-wire human space transportation Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) System. Development of the Space Shuttle GN&C represented first time inclusions of modern techniques for electronics, software, algorithms, systems and management in a complex system. Numerous technical design trades and lessons learned continue to drive current vehicle development. For example, the Space Shuttle GN&C system incorporated redundant systems, complex algorithms and flight software rigorously verified through integrated vehicle simulations and avionics integration testing techniques. Over the past thirty years, the Shuttle GN&C continued to go through a series of upgrades to improve safety, performance and to enable the complex flight operations required for assembly of the international space station. Upgrades to the GN&C ranged from the addition of nose wheel steering to modifications that extend capabilities to control of the large flexible configurations while being docked to the Space Station. This paper provides a history of the development and evolution of the Space Shuttle GN&C system. Emphasis is placed on key architecture decisions, design trades and the lessons learned for future complex space transportation system developments. Finally, some of the interesting flight operations experience is provided to inform future developers of flight experiences...|$|R

40|$|Identification of {{innovative}} solutions to unique materials problems is an every-day quest {{for members of}} the aerospace community. Finding a technique that will minimize costs, maximize throughput, and generate quality results is always the target. United Space Alliance Materials Engineers recently conducted such a search in their drive to return the Space Shuttle fleet to operational status. The removal of high performance thermal coatings from solid rocket motors represents a formidable task during post flight disassembly on reusable expended hardware. The removal of these coatings from unfired motors increases the complexity and safety requirements while reducing the available facilities and approved processes. A temporary solution to this problem was identified, tested and approved during the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) return to flight activities. Utilization of ultra high-pressure liquid nitrogen (LN 2) to strip the protective coating from assembled space <b>shuttle</b> hardware <b>marked</b> the first such use of the technology in the aerospace industry. This process provides a configurable stream of liquid nitrogen (LN 2) at pressures of up to 55, 000 psig. The performance of a one-time certification for the removal of thermal ablatives from SRB hardware involved extensive testing to ensure adequate material removal without causing undesirable damage to the residual materials or aluminum substrates. Testing to establish appropriate process parameters such as flow, temperature and pressures of the liquid nitrogen stream provided an initial benchmark for process testing. Equipped with these initial parameters engineers were then able to establish more detailed test criteria that set the process limits. Quantifying the potential for aluminum hardware damage represented the greatest hurdle for satisfying engineers as to the safety of this process. Extensive testing for aluminum erosion, surface profiling, and substrate weight loss was performed. This successful project clearly demonstrated that the liquid nitrogen jet possesses unique strengths that align remarkably well with the unusual challenges that space hardware and missile manufacturers face on a regular basis. Performance of this task within the confines of a critical manufacturing facility marks a milestone in advanced processing...|$|R

40|$|Protein kinase D 2 (PKD 2) {{belongs to}} the PKD family of serine/threonine kinases that is {{activated}} by phorbol esters and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Its C-terminal regulatory domain comprises two cysteine-rich domains (C 1 a/C 1 b) followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Here, we examined {{the role of the}} regulatory domain in PKD 2 phorbol ester binding, catalytic activity, and subcellular localization: The PH domain is a negative regulator of kinase activity. C 1 a/C 1 b, in particular C 1 b, is required for phorbol ester binding and gastrin-stimulated PKD 2 activation, but it has no inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity. Gastrin triggers nuclear accumulation of PKD 2 in living AGS-B cancer cells. C 1 a/C 1 b, not the PH domain, plays a complex role in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling: We identified a nuclear localization sequence in the linker region between C 1 a and C 1 b and a nuclear export signal in the C 1 a domain. In conclusion, our results define the critical components of the PKD 2 regulatory domain controlling phorbol ester binding, catalytic activity, and nucleocytoplasmic <b>shuttling</b> and reveal <b>marked</b> differences to the regulatory properties of this domain in PKD 1. These findings could explain functional differences between PKD isoforms and point to a functional role of PKD 2 in the nucleus upon activation by GPCRs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{equipment}} exposes {{individuals to}} whole-body vibration (WBV) and mechanical shock. This exposure can negatively impact their health, safety, comfort, and working efficiency and performance. Accordingly, proper seat design {{is an important}} consideration in reducing the adverse effects of WBV exposure to vehicle operators. Since {{the human body is}} sensitive to low frequency WBV, ride quality is a basic and important element of good seat design. When designing a suitable seat, it is essential to understand vibration exposure environment of workers and how well they can tolerate this environment [1]. This is particularly true in the mining industry. Mayton et al. [2] reported on a low-coal shuttle car seat design that underwent limited, yet successful underground mine trials. Building on this work, a follow-up study compared NIOSH and existing seat designs on low- and mid-coal seam shuttle cars. The NIOSH seat designs included viscoelastic foam, which has properties similar to those found in a mechanical spring/damper suspension system. The seats also included an adjustable lumbar support and a fore-aft seat adjustment. The NIOSH seat designs contrast with the existing seat design, which have little or no lumbar support and include inexpensive foam padding of the type commonly used in furniture. This paper will focus on the seat designs for the mid-coal seam shuttle car and compare subjective comfort data collected from five vehicle operators with ISO 2631 - based reduced comfort boundary (RCB) analysis of recorded vibration levels. Methods Experimental data were collected using three different tools: triaxial accelerometers, pre-amplifiers, and filters connected to a data recorder; a visual analog scale (VAS); and a short questionnaire. Researchers recorded quantitative or objective vehicle vibration data to determine the input and output acceleration at the operator cab floor and operator seat interface. Qualitative or subjective data, collected with the VAS, allowed researchers to obtain the operators 22 Ì† 0 ac 2 Ì† 122 immediate impressions of shock, vibration, and discomfort levels for the vehicle ride on each of the seat designs. Each shuttle car operator made six round trips with the vehicle each seat. The <b>shuttle</b> car operator <b>marked</b> the VAS on the first, third, and sixth round trip of the trials for each seat. A round trip consisted of traveling to the coal face with no load and returning to the load discharge location with a full load of coal. Results Total overall average ratings for the five vehicle operators of the mid-coal seam shuttle car, showed that operators sensed from 45 to 87...|$|R
