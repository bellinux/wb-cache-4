5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of <b>sensory</b> <b>receptor</b> cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
25|$|A second study, {{conducted}} by Moscovitch and Behrmann, investigated the reference frame of neglect {{with respect to}} the somatosensory system. Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment. A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized, during which the patients were touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist of one hand. The patients were tested both with their palms facing down and with their palms facing up. This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the somatosensory system occurs {{with respect to the}} <b>sensory</b> <b>receptor</b> surface (egocentric) or with respect to a higher-order spatial frame of reference (allocentric). The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space, regardless of hand orientation. These findings suggest that, within the somatosensory system, stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric, spatial frame of reference, in addition to an egocentric, sensory frame of reference. Ultimately, the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple, simultaneously derived frames of reference, which dictate {{the nature and extent of}} neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile fields.|$|E
500|$|From the skin, {{the brain}} {{receives}} information about fine touch, pressure, pain, vibration and temperature. From the joints, the brain receives information about joint position. The sensory cortex is found just near the motor cortex, and, like the motor cortex, has areas related to sensation from different body parts. Sensation collected by a <b>sensory</b> <b>receptor</b> {{on the skin}} is changed to a nerve signal, that is passed {{up a series of}} neurons through tracts in the spinal cord. The posterior column–medial lemniscus pathway contains information about fine touch, vibration and position of joints. Neurons travel up the back part of the spinal cord to the back part of the medulla, where they connect with [...] "second order" [...] neurons that immediately swap sides. These neurons then travel upwards into the ventrobasal complex in the thalamus where they connect with [...] "third order" [...] neurons, and travel up to the sensory cortex.The spinothalamic tract carries information about pain, temperature, and gross touch. Neurons travel up the spinal cord and connect with second-order neurons in the reticular formation of the brainstem for pain and temperature, and also at the ventrobasal complex of the medulla for gross touch.|$|E

25|$|In {{the human}} body a {{stimulus}} refers {{to a form of}} energy which elicits a physiological or psychological action or response. <b>Sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> are the structures in the body which change the stimulus from one form of energy to another. This can mean changing the presence of a chemical, sound wave, source of heat, or touch to the skin into an electrical action potential which can be understood by the brain, the body’s control center. <b>Sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> are modified ends of sensory neurons; modified to deal with specific types of stimulus, thus there are many different types of <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> in the body. The neuron is the primary component of the nervous system, which transmits messages from <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> all over the body.|$|R
50|$|The {{adequate}} stimulus is {{a property}} of a <b>sensory</b> <b>receptor</b> that determines {{the type of}} energy to which a <b>sensory</b> <b>receptor</b> responds with the initiation of sensory transduction. <b>Sensory</b> <b>receptor</b> are specialized to respond to certain types of stimuli.

50|$|Many of {{the sensory}} stimuli are {{categorized}} by the mechanics {{by which they}} are able to function and their purpose. <b>Sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> that are present within the body typically are made to respond to a single stimulus. <b>Sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> are present all throughout the body, and they take a certain amount of a stimulus to trigger these receptors. The use of these <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> allows the brain to interpret the signals to the body which allow a person to respond to the stimulus if the stimulus reaches a minimum threshold to signal the brain. The <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> will activate the sensory transduction system which will in turn send an electrical or chemical stimulus to a cell, and the cell will then respond with electrical signals to the brain which were produced from action potentials. The minuscule signals, which result from the stimuli, enter the cells must be amplified and turned into an sufficient signal that will be sent to the brain.A <b>sensory</b> <b>receptor's</b> adequate stimulus is determined by the signal transduction mechanisms and ion channels incorporated in the <b>sensory</b> <b>receptor's</b> plasma membrane. Adequate stimulus are often used in relation with sensory thresholds and absolute thresholds to describe the smallest amount of a stimulus needed to activate a feeling within the sensory organ.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} the important roles that "sensory" receptors (olfactory receptors, taste receptors, and orphan "GPR" receptors) {{play in a}} variety of tissues, including the kidney. Although several studies have identified important roles that individual <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> play in the kidney, {{there has not been a}} systematic analysis of the renal repertoire of <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors.</b> In this study, we identify novel renal <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> belonging to the GPR (n =  76), olfactory receptor (n =  6), and taste receptor (n =  11) gene families. A variety of reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR screening strategies were used to identify novel renal <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors,</b> which were subsequently confirmed using gene-specific primers. The tissue-specific distribution of these receptors was determined, and the novel renal ORs were cloned from whole mouse kidney. Renal ORs that trafficked properly in vitro were screened for potential ligands using a dual-luciferase ligand screen, and novel ligands were identified for Olfr 691. These studies demonstrate that multiple <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> are expressed in the kidney beyond those previously identified. These results greatly expand the known repertoire of renal <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors.</b> Importantly, the mRNA of many of the receptors identified in this study are expressed highly in the kidney (comparable to well-known and extensively studied renal GPCRs), and in future studies it will be important to elucidate the roles that these novel renal receptors play in renal physiology...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{depressor}} reflexes {{originating in the}} heart was introduced by von Bezold in 1867 and was later revived by Jarisch. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex originates in cardiac <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> with nonmyelinated vagal afferent pathways. The left ventricle, particularly the inferoposterior wall, is a principal location for these <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors.</b> Stimulation of these inhibitory cardiac receptors by stretch, chemical substances or drugs increases parasympathetic activity and inhibits sympathetic activity. These effects promote reflex bradycardia, vasodilation and hypotension (Bezold-Jarisch reflex) and also modulate renin release and vasopressin secretion. Conversely, decreases in the activity of these inhibitory <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> reflexly increase sympathetic activity, vascular resistance, plasma renin activity and vasopressin. Long regarded as pharmacologic curiosities, {{it is now clear}} that reflexes originating in these inhibitory cardiac <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> are important to the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular disorders. This paper reviews the role of inhibitory cardiac <b>sensory</b> <b>receptors</b> in several clinical states including 1) bradycardia, hypotension and gastrointestinal disorders with inferoposterior myocardial ischemia and infarction, 2) bradycardia and hypotension during coronary arteriography, 3) exertional syncope in aortic stenosis, 4) vasovagal syncope, 5) neurohumoral excitation in chronic heart failure, and 6) the therapeutic effects of digitalis...|$|R
