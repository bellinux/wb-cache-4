5|$|A sale of 1,000 coins {{was made}} to an {{executive}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they {{were placed in the}} Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound {{up in the hands of}} a coin dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
5|$|ABC News denied BPI's claims, {{and called}} the lawsuit without merit. ABC News sought to have the case removed from South Dakota state court to federal court. In June 2013, a federal judge sent the lawsuit back to state court. On March 27, 2014, South Dakota state court Judge Cheryle Gering {{rejected}} ABC's motion to dismiss, and allowed the defamation <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> move forward. Diane Sawyer's motion for summary judgment was granted and she was dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players had been kept secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country, {{would not be able to}} participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl. Only when Smith filed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed. Dr. Cecil Lloyd, chairman of the Independence Bowl, announced at the time of the lawsuit that had he known about the restrictions on Smith, he likely would not have invited Tech to play in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Novoselic, Grohl, and Courtney Love {{formed the}} limited {{liability}} company Nirvana LLC to oversee all Nirvana-related projects. A 45-track box set of Nirvana rarities was scheduled for release in October 2001. However, shortly before the release date, Love filed a <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> dissolve Nirvana LLC, and an injunction was issued preventing the release of any new Nirvana material until the case was resolved. Love contended that Cobain was the band, that Grohl and Novoselic were sidemen, and that she signed the partnership agreement originally under bad advice. Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain's estate.|$|E
5|$|In August 1992, Greyhound {{canceled}} its {{bus terminal}} license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed {{the requirement that}} Greyhound be the sole-seller of the tenant's bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a Greyhound terminal. In 1995, The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> stop this practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor interline tickets with competitors.|$|E

5|$|In June 2005, Urlacher filed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} paternity {{of his son}} Kennedy. Genetic testing {{determined that}} he is Kennedy's father. Kennedy's mother, Tyna Robertson, was already well-known to the media, having made claims of sexual assault against famed dancer Michael Flatley and a doctor from Naperville, Illinois. Urlacher and Robertson maintain joint-custody over Kennedy. In 2017, Urlacher appealed to a Cook County court to remove Kennedy from Robertson's custody after her husband, Ryan Karageorge, {{was shot and killed}} in their residence.|$|E
5|$|In March 1904, Beckham {{signed the}} Day Law mandating racial {{segregation}} of all schools in Kentucky. Berea College, a private college in eastern Kentucky {{that had been}} integrated since the 1850s, immediately filed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> challenge the law. The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Berea appealed to the Supreme Court, and in 1908 the court handed down an 81 decision against the college. Only John Marshall Harlan dissented.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2010, {{the state}} of Washington filed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> prevent the closing of Yucca Mountain, since this would slow efforts to clean up Hanford Nuclear Reservation. South Carolina, Aiken County (the {{location}} of Savannah River site) and others joined Washington. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit in July 2011, saying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not ruled on {{the withdrawal of the}} license application. Washington and South Carolina filed another lawsuit on July 29.|$|E

5|$|On July 9, 2013, Morse {{filed suit}} in the Denver District Court seeking an {{injunction}} to block the recall election. At the same time Secretary of State Gessler filed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> force Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper to set a date for the recall election. On July 18, 2013, Denver District Court Judge Robert Hyatt issued a preliminary ruling that the recall process must proceed even while Morse and Giron challenged the process in court. Hickenlooper then set the recall election for September 10.|$|E
5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> {{enforce the}} treaty {{rights of the}} tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E
5|$|The {{developer}} and {{producer of the}} original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R) and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Metroid II. The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus' Varia <b>Suit</b> <b>to</b> differentiate it from her Power Suit, since both looked similar on the Game Boy's limited greyscale display. The updated suit has since been {{a staple of the}} series, appearing in all subsequent games. A unique color palette for Metroid II was added to the Game Boy Color console, a successor to the original Game Boy with a color screen.|$|E

After Gwen and Peter leave, an electrician, Max Dillon, attempts to upgrade the lab's electrical filters, but gets electrocuted and {{is sent to the}} hospital. There, he is found to be emitting strong electrical fields and is placed in quarantine. Max is further angered when a doctor explains that, although he is stable, he must wear a special <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> contain this emitted bioelectricity.|$|E
5|$|The uniform {{made its}} Olympic debut at Sydney's Bondi Beach in the 2000 Summer Olympics amid some criticism. It {{was the fifth}} largest {{television}} audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest {{was because of the}} sex appeal of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even indoor volleyball costumes followed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> become smaller and tighter.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court had allowed the same <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> proceed by {{unanimously}} holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the claim. Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.|$|E

5|$|Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), {{students}} and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The Mayo Foundation filed <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents—recently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, but who are still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Diving at Wookey resumed {{in early}} June 1946 when Balcombe used his {{homemade}} respirator and waterproof <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> explore the region between the resurgence and first chamber, {{as well as}} the underground course of the river between the third and first chambers. During these dives, the Romano-British remains were found and archaeological work dominated the early dives in the cave. The large ninth chamber was first entered on 24 April 1948 by Balcombe and Don Coase. Using this as an advance dive base, the 10th and then 11th chambers were discovered. The way on, however, was too deep for divers breathing pure oxygen from a closed-circuit rebreather. The cave claimed its first life on 9 April 1949 when Gordon Marriott lost his life returning from the ninth chamber. Another fatality was to occur in 1981 when Keith Potter was drowned on a routine dive further upstream.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> {{reclaim the}} lake {{bed for the}} state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
