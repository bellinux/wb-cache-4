40|$|The {{inability}} {{of future generations}} to share risk with current ones causes financial markets to be incomplete en thus inefficient. By using its financial reserves efficiently, a pension fund is able to transfer current equity risk to future generations, thereby alleviating the ”biological ” trading constraint that is faced in financial markets. This paper examines how comovements in stock and labor markets affect the gains from intergenerational risk sharing. If stock and labor markets move together in the long run, the human wealth of unborn generations becomes highly correlated with stock returns, which reduces their risk appetite. I show that shifting risk into the future is not optimal anymore once the long-run dynamics of labor income are taken into account. The risk bearing capacity of a pension fund is dramatically decreased if it is unattractive for risk {{to be transferred to}} future generations.

40|$|Betting {{markets have}} been of great {{interest}} to researchers as they represent a simpler set-up of financial markets. With an estimated Gross Gambling Revenue of 45 bn yearly on betting on outcomes alone (excluding other gambling markets such as Casino, Poker and Lottery), these markets deserve attention on their own merit. This thesis provides simple mathematical derivation of a number of key statements in setting odds. It estimates the expected bookmaker profit as a function of wagers placed and bookmaker margin. Moreover it shows that odds set by bookmakers should have implied probabilities that add up to at least one. Bookmakers do not require the exact probability of an outcome to have positive expected profits. They can increase profitability by having more accurate odds and offering more multiples/accumulators. Bookmakers can lower variation in payouts by maintaining the ratio of wagers and implied probability per outcome. While bookmakers face significant regulatory pressures as well as increased taxes and levies, there is no standard industry model that can be applied to evaluate the minimum reserves for a bookmaker. Hence a bookmaker may be under/over-reserving funds required to conduct business. A <b>solvency</b> <b>regime</b> for bookmakers is presented in this work. Furthermore a model is proposed to forecast soccer results – this focuses on goal differences in contrast to traditional models that predict outcome or goals scored per team. Significant investigations are made on the inefficiencies of betting markets. The likelihood of Brazil reaching different stages of the 2014 World Cup, as perceived by odds, is compared to events on and outside the pitch to imply bias.

40|$|With the {{regulatory}} spotlight on operational risk management, increasing {{attention has been}} devoted to the quantification of operational risk in recent years. The potential devastating power of operational risks has been demonstrated by many large operational losses. Some of the best known examples of major losses caused by lack of operational controls include the € 5 billion loss by Société Générale in 2008, U. S. 9 billion loss of Banco National due to credit fraud in 1995, the U. S. 2. 6 billionloss of Sumimoto Corporation due to unauthorized trading activity in 1996, the U. S. 1. 7 billion loss and subsequent bankruptcy of Orange County due to unauthorized trading activity in 1998, the U. S. 1. 3 billion trading loss causing the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995, the U. S. 0. 75 billion loss of Allied Irish Bank in 2002, the loss of U. S. 2 billion by Prudential Insurance of America in 2002, and the U. S. 1. 107 billion loss (fines and penalty taxes) of Yamaichi International Inc. in 1992. Both the new regulatory framework in the banking sector (Basel II) and the project for the new <b>solvency</b> <b>regime</b> in the insurance sector (Solvency II) recognize the importance of operational risk and require explicit treatment through allocations of specific capital. However, as yet there is no generally accepted definition of operational risk in the financial community. In this paper we refer to the definition proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2001 : “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. ” This definition has also been adopted for the insurance sector until now. In this categorization operational risk includes the following event types: business disruption and system failures; clients, products, and business practice; damage to physical assets; employment practice and workplace safety; execution delivery and process; external fraud; and internal fraud. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive model to quantify the capital charge necessary to cover operational risk within a financial institution. The proposed model is taken from the ‘loss distribution approach’ (LDA), which is a frequency/severity model widely used in many fields of actuarial practice. In this model the frequency and severity of loss distributions is determined for each loss event by identifying the best fitting distribution of empirical data [Moscadelli (2004), De Fontnouvelle (2003) ]. We then apply copula functions to reflect the interrelationships amongst the different events dealing with operational losses [Di Clemente and Romano (2003), Reshetar (2004) ]. The operational risk capital charge is estimated by quantifying the ‘value-at-risk’ (VaR) and ‘expected shortfall’ (ES) of the joint distribution of losses [Rockafellar and Uryasev (2002) ], estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation. In order to better estimate the fat tails of the severity distributions, the ‘extreme value theory’ [Embrechts et al. (1997), (2003), (2004), (2005) ] is also included in the model...|$|E

40|$|Preface INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT IN PENSION FUNDS Marco Micocci, Greg N. Gregoriou, and Giovanni B. Masala The {{world of}} pension funds {{is facing a}} period of extreme changes. Countries {{around the world have}} {{experienced}} unexpected increases in life expectancy and fertility rates, changing accounting rules, contribution reductions, low financial returns, and abnormal volatility of markets. All these elements have led to a fall in funded systems and to an increase in the dependency ratios in many countries. U. K. and U. S. pension funds, which have traditionally had relatively high equity allocations, have been hit hard. Many public pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) systems in Europe are reducing their “generosity” with new calculation rules pointing toward the reduction of the substitution ratios of workers. Europe is moving toward a risk-based approach also for the regulation and the control of the technical risk of funded pension schemes. Risk management is becoming highly complex both in public pension funds and in private pension plans, requiring the expertise of different specialists who are not frequently disposable in the professional market. The world is quite rich with skilled investment managers but their comprehension of the demographic and of the actuarial face of pension risk is often inadequate. On the other hand, you have many specialized actuaries who are able to perform very sophisticated calculations and forecasts of pension liabilities but who are not able to fully understand the coexistence (or integration) of financial and actuarial risks. Also, the international accounting standards introduce new actuarial and financial elements in the balance sheet of the firms that may affect the corporate dividend and its investment policy. In other words, little is being said about the integration of actuarial and financial risks in the risk management of pension funds. We believe the chapters in this book highlight and shed new light on the current state of pension fund risk management and provide the reader new technical tools to face pension risk from an integrated point of view. The exclusive new research for this book can assist pension fund executives, risk management departments, consultancy firms, and academic researchers to hopefully get a clearer picture of the integration of risks in the pension world. The chapters in this book are written by well-known academics and professionals worldwide who have published numerous journal articles and book chapters. The book is divided into four parts— Part I: Financial Risk Management; Part II: Technical Risk Management; Part III: Regulation and Solvency Topics; and Part IV: International Experience in Pension Fund Risk Management. In Part I, Chapter 1 focuses on the correct measurement of risk in pension funds. The author formalizes an intuitive concept of investment risk in providing for pensions, taking it as a measure of the financial impact when the actual investment experience differs from the expected. Investment risk can be explicitly measured and, through a series of case studies, the author estimates the investment risk associated with different investment strategies in different markets over the twentieth century. He shows that within a broad range, the relative investment risk associated with different strategies is not particularly sensitive to how the pension objective is framed. The investment risk associated with equity investment can be of the same order of magnitude as bond investment if the bond duration mismatches those of the targeted pension. He suggests that failure to explicitly measure investment risk entails that pension portfolios might not be optimally structured, holding the possibility that investment risks could be reduced without reducing the expected pension proceeds. In Chapter 2, the authors scrutinize the fund dynamics under a performance- oriented arrangement (i. e., bonus fees and downside penalty), whereby a stochastic control is formulated to further characterize the defined contribution (DC) pension schemes. A five-fund separation theorem is derived to characterize its optimal strategy. When performance oriented arrangement is taken into account, the fund managers tend to increase the holdings in risky assets. Hence, an incentive program has to be carefully implemented in order to balance the risk and the reward in DC pension fund management. Chapter 3 proposes an attribution model for monitoring the performance and the risk of a defined benefit (DB) pension fund. The model is based on a liability benchmark that reflects the risk and return characteristics of the liabilities. As a result, the attribution model focuses the attention of the portfolio managers on creating a portfolio that replicates liabilities. The attribution model allocates differences in return between the actual portfolio and the benchmark portfolio to decisions relative to the benchmark portfolio. In addition, the model decomposes risks according to the same structure by using a measure of downside risk. Chapter 4 investigates an optimal investment problem faced by a DC pension fund manager under inflationary risk. It is assumed that a representative member of a DC pension plan contributes a fixed share of his salary to the pension fund during the time horizon. The pension contributions are invested continuously in a risk-free bond, an index bond, and a stock. The objective is to maximize the expected utility of terminal value of the pension fund. By solving this investment problem, the author presents {{a way to deal with}} the optimization problem, in case of an (positive) endowment (or contribution), using the martingale method. Chapter 5 deals with the study of a pension plan from the point of view of dynamic optimization. Th is subject is currently widely discussed in the literature. The optimal management of an aggregated type of DB pension fund, which is common in the employment system, is analyzed by a mean–variance portfolio selection problem. The main novelty is that the risk-free market interest rate is a time-dependent function and the benefits are stochastic. In Chapter 6, the author highlights the fact that a pension fund is a complex system. Asset and liability management (ALM) models of pension fund problems incorporate, among others, stochasticity, liquidity control, population dynamics, and decision delays to better forecast and foresee solvency in the long term. In order to model uncertainties or to enable multicriteria analyses, many methods are considered and analyzed to obtain a dynamic asset and liability management approach. In Chapter 7, the authors investigate the optimal asset allocation of U. S. pension funds by taking into account the funds’ liabilities. Besides the traditional inputs, such as expected returns and the covariance matrix, the uncertainty of expected returns plays a crucial role in creating robust portfolios that are less sensitive to small changes in inputs. The authors illustrate this with an example of a pension fund that decides on investing in emerging market equities. Chapter 8 explains that most pension funds already manage the different risks they face, but usually from a “single stakeholder” pension fund perspective, typically expressed in, e. g., the risk of funding shortfall. The many different stakeholders in pension funds, such as the employees, retirees, and sponsors, all bear different risks, but there is oft en hardly any insight in the objective market value of these risks. In addition, there is usually no explicit compensation agreement for those who bear the risks. Therefore, a technique that identifies and values these stakeholders’ risks has many useful applications in pension fund management. Chapter 9 focuses on value-at-risk (VaR). VaR has become a popular risk measure of financial risk and is also used for regulatory capital requirement purposes in banking and insurance sectors. The VaR methodology has been developed mainly for banks to control their short-term market risk. Although, VaR is already widespread in financial industry, this method has yet to become a standard tool for pension funds. However, just as any other financial institution, pension funds recognize the importance of measuring their financial risks. The aim of this chapter is to specifyconditions under which VaR could be a good measure of long-termmarket risk. Chapter 10 examines the effects of taxation, risk sharing between theemployer and employees, and default insurance on the asset allocation ofDB pension schemes. These three factors can have a powerful effect on theoptimal asset allocation of a fund. The authors show that the three factorshave the potential to create confl ict between the employer and the employees,particularly when the employer is not subject to taxation. In Part II, Chapter 11 is devoted to examining how uncertainty regarding future mortality and life expectancy outcomes, i. e., longevity risk, affects employer-provided DB private pension plan liabilities. The author argues that to assess uncertainty and associated risks adequately, a stochastic approach to model mortality and life expectancy is preferable because it allows one to attach probabilities to different forecasts. In this regard, the chapter provides the results of estimating the Lee–Carter model for several OECD countries. Furthermore, it conveys the uncertainty surrounding future mortality and life expectancy outcomes by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of the Lee–Carter model. In order to assess the impact of longevity risk on employer-provided DB pension plans, the author examines the different approaches that private pension plans follow in practice when incorporating longevity risks in their actuarial calculations. Chapter 12 analyzes the pension plan of a firm that offers wage-based lump sum payments by death, retirement, or dismissal by the employer, but no payment is made by the employer when the employee resigns. An actuarial risk model for funding severance payment liabilities is formulated and studied. The yearly aggregate lump sum payments are supposed to follow a classical collective model of risk theory with compound distributions. The final wealth at an arbitrary time is described explicitly including formulas for the mean and the variance. Annual initial level premiums required for “dismissal funding” are determined and useful gamma approximations for confidence intervals of the wealth are proposed. A specific numerical example illustrates the non-negligible probability of a bankruptcy in case the employee structure of a “dismissal plan” is not well balanced. Chapter 13 starts from the fact that retirement is being remade owing to the confluence of demographic, economic, and policy factors. The authors empirically investigate major influences on the retirement behavior of older U. S. workers from 1992 through 2004 using survey data from the Health and Retirement Study. Their analysis builds on the large empirical literature on retirement, in particular, by examining how market booms and busts affect the likelihood and timing of retirement, an issue that will be of growing importance given the ongoing shift from traditional DB pensions to 401 (k) s. They comprehensively model all major sources of health insurance coverage and identify their varying impacts, and also reveal the significant policy-driven retirement differences across cohorts that are attributable to the changes in social security full-retirement age. These fundamental retirement changes need to be taken into account when we design corporate and public retirement programs. Chapter 14 deals with a study on occupational pension insurance for Germany—a country where Pillar II pension schemes are (still) widely based on a book reserve system. The insurance of occupational pension schemes is provided for by the Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein Versicherungsverein auf Gegenseitigkeit (PSVaG), which is the German counterpart to the U. S. PBGC. Th is study investigates potential adverse selection and moral hazard problems originating from the introduction of reduced premiums for funded pensions and assesses whether the risk-adjusted risk premiums, as introduced by the U. K. Pension Protection Fund, can be a means to mitigate these problems. Chapter 15 describes the longevity risk securitization in pension schemes, focusing mainly on longevity bonds and survivor swaps. The authors analyze the evaluation of these mortality-linked securities in an incomplete market using a risk-neutral pricing approach. A Poisson Lee– Carter model is adopted to represent the mortality trend. The chapter concludes with an empirical application on Italian annuity market data. In Part III, Chapter 16 highlights that the international trend toward adopting a “fair value” approach to pension accounting has transpired the risks involved in promises of DB pensions. The hunt is on for ways to remove or limit the employers’ risk exposures to financial statements volatility. Th is chapter examines the U. K. firms’ risk management of their pension fund asset allocation over a period when the new U. K. pension GAAP (FRS 17) became effective. The findings suggest that firms manage their pension risk exposure in order to minimize cash contribution risks associated with the adoption of “fair value”–based pension accounting rules, consistent with a risk off setting explanation. Chapter 17 develops and tests a theory of competition among pressure groups over political influence in the context of confl icting U. K. standards concerning the factors affecting the recent development of pension fund accountability rules. The chapter models both sources of pressure affecting the accountability relationship as well as how those factors combined to influence U. K. pension fund managers’ discretion over the adoption and retention of disclosure regulations. The author finds that auditors and pension management groups exerted most political pressure, which translated to political influence during the extended adoption period. The findings are mostly consistent with a capture or private interest perspective on pension accounting regulation. Chapter 18 reviews three useful instruments—notional defined-contribution accounts (NDCs), the actuarial balance (AB), and automatic balance mechanisms (ABMs) —derived from actuarial analysis methodology that can be applied to the public management of PAYGO systems to improve their fairness, transparency, and solvency. The authors suggest that these tools are not simply theoretical concepts but, in some countries, an already legislated response to the growing social demand for transparency in the area of public finance management as well as the desire to set the pension system firmly on the road to long-term financial solvency. In Chapter 19, the authors review the risk-based <b>solvency</b> <b>regime</b> for pension funds in the Netherlands. The supervision of pension funds aims to ensure that institutions are always able to meet their commitments to the beneficiaries. In addition, the pension fund must be legally separated from the employer offering the pension arrangement. Furthermore, the marked-to-market value of the assets must be at least equal to the marked-to-market value of the liabilities at all times (full funding prerequisite). Risk-based solvency requirements are intended as a buffer to absorb the risks from unexpected changes in the value of assets and liabilities. Finally, a key element of the Dutch regulatory approach is the continuity analysis for assessing the pension fund’s solvency in the long run. In Chapter 20, the author addresses the fact that the global financial crisis of 2008 highlighted the importance of shielding pension participants from market volatility. Th is policy concern is of general relevance due to the global shift from DB to DC as main mechanisms for financing retirement income. Policy options being debated in the aft ermath of the crisis include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: (1) the introduction of lifetime minimum return guarantees, (2) the review of default investment options, and (3) the outright reversal to PAYGO earning–related pensions. Th is chapter reviews the performance during the crisis of countries that already rely on mandatory DC plans. The author suggests that important welfare gains can be achieved by requiring the introduction of liability-driven default investment products based on a modified version of the target date funds commonly available in the retail industry for retirement wealth. Such products would reconnect the accumulation with the decumulation phase, improve the hedging of annuitization risk, but avoid the introduction of liabilities for plan managers. In Part IV, Chapter 21 highlights the DB pension freezes in large healthy firms such as Verizon and IBM, as well as terminations of plans in the struggling steel and airline industries that cannot be viewed as riskfree from the employee’s perspective. The authors develop an empirical dynamic programming framework to investigate household saving decisions in a simple life cycle model with DB pensions subject to the risk of being frozen. The model incorporates important sources of uncertainty facing households, including asset returns, employment, wages, and mortality, as well as pension freezes. Chapter 22 is referred to as the Italian experience. In Italy, social security contributions of Italian employees finance a two-pillar system: public and private pensions that are both calculated in a DC scheme (funded for the private pension and unfunded for the public one). In addition to this, a large number of workers have also termination indemnities at the end of their active service. The authors aim to answer the following questions. Are the different flows of contributions coherent with the aim of minimizing the pension risk of the workers? Given the actual percentages of contributions, is the asset allocation of private pension funds optimal? What percentages would optimize the pension risk management of the workers (considering public pension, private pension, and termination indemnities) ? Chapter 24 examines the Greek experience in limiting the opportunity of investments of pension funds in foreign assets. In fact, suffering from inefficient funding, the current imbalance of the Greek social security system, to some extent, was the result of the restrictive investment constraints in the period 1958 – 2000 that directed reserves to low-yielding deposits with the Bank of Greece with little or no exposure to market yields or the stock market. As shown in the 43 year analysis, these investment restrictions incurred a significant economic opportunity loss both in terms of inferior returns as well as lower risks. Chapter 25 examines the effect of a company’s unfunded pension liabilities on its stock market valuation. Using a sample of UK FTSE 350 firms with DB pension schemes, the authors find that although unfunded pension liabilities reduce the market value of the firm, the coefficient estimates indicate a less than one-for-one effect. Moreover, there is no evidence of significantly negative subsequent abnormal returns for highly underfunded schemes. These results suggest that shareholders do take into consideration the unfunded pension liabilities when valuing the firm, but do not fully incorporate all available information. Chapter 26 focuses on the selection of an appropriate style model to explain the returns of Spanish balanced pension plans as well as on the analysis of the relevance of these strategic allocations on portfolio performance. Results suggest similar findings than those obtained in previous studies, providing evidence that asset allocations explains about 90...|$|E

This paper explains how a stochastic model built on basic assumptions {{is used to}} monitor insurance risk {{in order to get}} a clear insight in the aligned economic capital including prudence margins for loss reserves. Method. The incurred loss of an insurer consists of payments on claims and reserves for claims that have been reported. As all claims are settled eventually, the cumulative paid and incurred losses for a given loss period become equal. Therefore, a joint model for the paid and incurred loss arrays is constructed, following a multivariate normal distribution, conditioned on equality of the total paid and incurred losses for a given loss period. A new class of functions is designed specifically to model development curves. Results. A simulation experiment proved that a joint model for both paid and incurred loss arrays as described under Method, leads to a more accurate prediction of loss reserves. While the standard way of estimating percentiles for the reserve is biased, the alternative method of bootstrapping will lead to more accurate outcomes. Conclusions. Modeling paid and incurred losses jointly leads to a considerable improvement in loss reserving in terms of accuracy of predictions, as well as specification of percentiles. Availability. This method is incorporated in software available from the authors...|$|R

One part is concentrated on derivation of <b>Solvency</b> I <b>regime,</b> both for life and nonlife insurance. In addition, we characterize riders of life insurance that are avaliable on the Czech market. In next part of our thesis we set up our own model of risk capital calculation. We consider these risks: mortality, expense, lapse and interest rate risk. For numerical calculations we chose accidental death rider, so we included its risk also into our model...|$|R

In essence, asymmetric distribution of information between policyholder and insurer triggered this new regulation which aims at better protecting policyholders. Its three-pillar model is about to challenge both, insurers as well as policyholders. The first pillar includes quantitative aspects, the second pillar contains qualitative aspects and the third pillar comprises market transparency and reporting obligations. Underwriting risks, the default risk of a bank and market risks can be identified for the dynamic hybrid. Solvency II covers all these risks in the first pillar and insurers shall deposit sufficient risk-bearing capital. In our analysis, we first identify the dynamic hybrid specific risks under the <b>Solvency</b> II <b>regime</b> und then develop product modifications to reduce this risk...|$|R

40|$|For {{some time}} now the International Association of Insurance Supervisors has been working towards the {{harmonization}} of <b>solvency</b> assessment <b>regimes</b> worldwide. Having developed a common structure for solvency assessment, it is now working on more detailed requirements which will {{take the form of}} international supervisory standards. At the same time as this work has been progressing, work has been ongoing at the International Accounting Standards Board on Phase II of its Insurance Contracts Project. This project will result in an international financial reporting standard for insurance contracts. This article discusses the desirability of having a single methodology {{that can be used for}} financial reporting for both solvency assessment and general-purpose financial reporting purposes. It goes on to argue that, while absolute convergence is neither likely nor necessarily desirable, current indications are that the dream that a single model can form the basis for both reporting regimes might still be realized. This in turn would promote greater transparency and therefore enhance credibility in financial reporting by insurers.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{stability of the}} insurers is important to fulfil {{its role as a}} risk transfer mechanism and to protect the purchasers of their products. The European Union is introducing the Solvency II to modernise the current <b>Solvency</b> I <b>regime</b> and to harmonise the different insurance legislation {{of the members of the}} European Union. Solvency II introduces an architecture consisting of three pillars, with Pillar I setting the solvency capital requirements, Pillar II the governance and risk management requirements and Pillar III the reporting requirements. The South African Regulator initiated Solvency Assessment and Management for implementation in 2016 to align the South African prudential regulatory framework to meet the Solvency II requirements for third country equivalence. The problem that this study addressed is the possible effect that the introduction of Solvency Assessment and Management may have on the sustainability of short-term insurers in South Africa. The results of a empirical component of the study indicated that small and medium short-term insurers may be negatively impacted due to the costs incurred to implement and comply with the requirements of the new regulatory framework. The effect on the South African short-term industry can be that cover is concentrated among a few large short-term insurers. Business ManagementM. Com. (Business Management...|$|R

40|$|Reserving {{outstanding}} claims {{is crucial for}} insurance industry, {{in the sense that}} it influences both the cash balance (via pricing) and the solvency of the company. The main objective of this thesis has been to present and compare four well-established and most applied methods Chain Ladder, multiplicative (Bornhuetter-Ferguson), Chain Ladder/multiplicative combined (Benktander) and Bayesian method (Bühlmann-Straub), as well as the model-based Kaminsky approach that has drawn more interest in the academic world. For each method there will be a description of theoretical basis, followed by analysis of workers compensation with data provided by SpareBank 1. In general, the four traditional methods are quite alike. They have similar model assumptions, their estimators can be written in the same form, and in particular they suggest analogous solutions. The Kaminsky method, on the other hand, is built on a more logical setting because it postulates that claim counts are Poisson distributed and delayed with respect to some reasonable probabilities. Assessing estimation risk has been required by the new <b>Solvency</b> II <b>regime.</b> Through comparison of Chain Ladder and Kaminsky reserve uncertainty we will get a better perspective on these two different approaches, in the hope of answering the most challenging question: "Which method is best?". To evaluate the methods qualities, simulated dataset will also be utilized at the end such that future liabilities is not a mystery any more, and we can easily compare the estimates with the true reserve given by the data material...|$|R

In particular we comment and discuss the -ACME study on non-life long tail liabilities; reserve risk and risk margin assessment under Solvency II". In the latter study the reserve risk calculation of non-life long tail insurers is investigated, based on a sample of 45 supervised European insurance companies. We start by giving an overview of risk measures used in a solvency environment. Next, we show that the Value-at-Risk measure is the solution of a general optimization problem. In a way this supports the current regulatory regime for banking supervision established by the Basel Capital Accord and the <b>Solvency</b> II regulatory <b>regime</b> under construction. Indeed, both have put forward a Value-at-Risk-based capital requirement approach.

40|$|The {{concept of}} this paper is to perform the {{improvement}} of the risk function analysis, assessment and management with the aim to ensure a more sensitive and sophisticated risk coverage in accordance with the <b>Solvency</b> II <b>regime</b> requirements. The authors have offered an approach of risk function implementation and management corresponding with the Solvency II directive framework by integrating Analytical Network process into decision – making process of an insurance company. Analytical Network process is the combination of SWOT analysis designed to evaluate an insurance company’s activity and choice of strategy with the purpose to ensure further successful development and financial stability. Analytical Network process allows measuring the dependencies and feedbacks among decision elements and strategic factors in the hierarchical or non-hierarchical structures; thus, it might be used within the analysis of complicated and sensitive interrelationships between decision levels and attributes. The most valuable advantage of using Analytical Hierarchy process, in insurance is the possibility to include tangible and intangible strategic factors and elements into the decision-making process of an insurance company by applying specified functions or fields steering, analysis and management. Moreover, the authors have prepared the case study about the practical usage of Analytical Network process through the example of one non-life insurance company. In the case study the authors have emphasized the most preferable strategy through a detailed analysis of risk function and by using Analytical Network process. According to the authors, Analytical Network process is considered to be a part of the risk culture of an insurance company, since it helps to increase the employees’ knowledge of risk nature and its influence on the development and results of an insurance company. In order to achieve the stated objective, the authors use theoretical and methodological analysis of the scientific literature, as well as analytical, comparative, mathematical and statistical methods with the purpose to study the elements of an insurance company’s risk function evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{development}} within the European regulatory environment, namely the <b>Solvency</b> II <b>regime,</b> causes complex challenges the European insurance industry has to cope with. One of those affects capital structure decisions as sufficient regulatory capital {{has to be}} provided to meet the stringent capital requirements. Hence, insurance companies aim for an efficient as well as, from a regulatory point of view, complying capital structure. In this context, hybrid capital is an increasingly embraced funding source offering attractive features and opportunities. The field of hybrid capital is not sufficiently researched yet, in particular not {{with regards to the}} insurance industry. For this reason, the goal {{of this study is to}} fill an existing research gap that concerns the impact of hybrid capital on performance. Empirical evidence from the European insurance market is the basis for answering the research question which asks for whether the degree of hybrid capital endowment has an impact on insurance companies’ performance. For this purpose, the investigation builds upon a six-year time frame (2009 - 2014) and a population that comprises 39 listed European insurance companies. Several criteria are defined in order to establish a population that allows the authors to conduct this study properly. In addition, two sub-populations are derived in order to extend the investigations. While the first sub-population consists of 22 insurance companies that are headquartered in one of the three largest European (re-) insurance markets, the second one involves 18 insurance companies that are headquartered in a European non-EURO country. In order to examine the correlation between the degree of hybrid capital endowment and performance, different performance indicators are considered and statistically analysed through panel data regression models, namely the fixed effects, random effects and ordinary least square model. Additionally, likelihood ratio tests are performed to reinforce the results. The majority of the outcomes do not reveal the existence of any correlation. However, a negative correlation is observable with regards to the return on assets. This applies for main as well as the two sub-populations. Ultimately, the authors are able to answer the research question in the affirmative and demonstrate that the traditional theories of capital structure are poorly applicable to hybrid capital. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to investigate {{the role of the}} scenario planning methods in the future development of the Baltic non-life insurance market. In order to achieve the stated objective and with the purpose to study the elements and functions of the scenario planning and critical stress testing, the authors use theoretical and methodological analysis of the scientific literature, analytical methods, expert and priority chart’s methods, comparative, statistical and modelling methods. One of the major problems of the research was to find the correlation between the possible impact of the scenario planning methods and the process of managing the development of the insurance market. The stated problem was solved by using a special tool for scenario planning method that can be used by non-life insurance companies. The authors have analysed the theoretical basis of scenario planning methods and prepared the financial analysis and scenario planning tool to evaluate the Baltic non-life insurance market’s development and to investigate its possible future outcomes with the main aim to demonstrate practical issues of scenario planning. In order to test scenarios discovered in the process of financial analysis using scenario planning tool, the authors have also applied critical scenario testing, which simulates possible future outcomes of an insurance company development. The rate of the Baltic non-life insurance market’s development is considered to be rather high, hence it requires analysing, managing and evaluating its financial stability and solvency. The Baltic insurance market faces many challenges due to the requirements of the Solvency II framework, which will establish new rules of risk evaluation for improving the solvency of insurance companies and protecting the interests of policyholders. Since the implementation of the <b>Solvency</b> II <b>regime</b> requires a stable insurance market establishment, it is important to plan and analyse the possible scenarios of insurance market development. The assessment of the Baltic non-life insurance market can be performed through strategic organizational planning – scenario planning methods. Scenario planning methods help evaluating possible short – term future outcomes of stability and solvency of non-life insurance market’s participants’ using the means of simulations...|$|R
40|$|In July, 2013 Malawi {{enacted a}} new Companies Act [Act No. 15 of 2013] {{replacing}} the old Companies Act 19 of 1984. The Companies Act, 1984 was basically an {{adoption of the}} English Companies Act, 1948 and {{in line with the}} English law, it regulated distributions through the classical capital maintenance rule. In contrast, the new Companies Act, 2013 which came into force in May, 2016 has jettisoned the capital maintenance rule. As an alternative to that rule, the Act has introduced {{for the first time in}} Malawian company law edifice, the concept of the solvency test. Jurisdictions that have adopted the solvency test in their company law essentially have done so on the basis that company law should focus on the core risk at stake – company insolvency, and that it is meaningless to state that creditors look to the company's capital as a trust fund out which their debts would be settled. Despite having the same theoretical basis for adopting the solvency test, the manner in which the solvency test is defined and applied in a particular statute has significant effects on whether in its operation, the test affords adequate protection to the interests of creditors. This research examines the definition and application of the solvency test under the Companies Act, 2013 so as to determine whether in its operation as a financial restriction for distributions and other company transactions, it will afford adequate protection to creditors. It follows the approach used by Professor Kathleen Van der Linde in her analysis of the solvency and liquidity approach in the Companies Act, 2008. Thus, it analyses the Malawian law by focusing on the two separate elements of the test (equity solvency and balance sheet solvency) as well as other aspects of the test which are likely to raise legal interpretation issues. The twin solvency test adopted in different jurisdictions ordinarily varies in its balance sheet solvency element. Some jurisdictions such as South Africa and New Zealand utilise the net assets approach in their balance sheet test. Others such as New York and Delaware still emphasise on the trust fund doctrine and thus utilise stated capital in their balance sheet test. Malawi is a stated capital/surplus jurisdiction. Its new <b>solvency</b> based <b>regime</b> still focuses on the meaningless trust fund doctrine. The new solvency test approach in Malawi is incomplete and inadequate to fully protect creditors against opportunistic shareholder behaviour. A number of recommendations are made for an effective solvency test approach that will afford adequate protection to creditors against opportunistic shareholder behaviour...|$|R
