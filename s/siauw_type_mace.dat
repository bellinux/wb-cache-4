Weapons are primarily made of rattan to resemble swords, pikes, spears, axes and other medieval weapon <b>types.</b> <b>Maces</b> and axes have heads made of rubber or stiff foam, and pole weapons (resembling medieval pole-axes, glaives, halberds or bills, etc.) {{may or may not}} be required to be similarly padded, depending upon the regulations in a given SCA kingdom.|$|R

Unique <b>types</b> of <b>maces</b> known as [...] "gada" [...] were used extensively in ancient Indian warfare, and the enchanted talking mace Sharur made its first appearance in Sumerian/Akkadian mythology during the epic of Ninurta.|$|R
50|$|A {{roundhead}} was a <b>type</b> of <b>mace</b> {{used during}} the English Civil War. It is described as having a head about 9 in, a staff 2 yd long inserted into the head, twelve iron spikes round about, with another spike in the end. In 1643 an article in Mercurius Civicus claimed the weapon was called a roundhead by the Cavaliers because {{they were to be}} used to beat the Roundheads into subjection.|$|R

Seeing Carrera bound up and nude, Rati then approached her and seduced Carrera herself but with bad timing, because Carrera was set free soon after and returned the favor to Rati. Rati is shown at one point wielding a <b>type</b> of <b>mace</b> in combat against heaven's guardians. She {{does not appear to}} be very adept as she is still captured.|$|R
50|$|A pernach (перна́ч, пірна́ч, piernacz) is a <b>type</b> of flanged <b>mace</b> {{originating}} in the 12th century {{in the region of}} Kievan Rus' and later widely used throughout Europe. The name comes from the Slavic word перо (pero) meaning feather, referring to a type of pernach resembling an arrow with feathering.|$|R
50|$|Some shorter whips are {{designed}} with a heavy lead or steel ball woven into the pommel, or a shot bag filled with lead shot braided into the body. Other whips have flexible metallic cable or rigid metal rods in the handle. These materials provide mass, making the whip easier to crack during normal use. These weights and rigid pieces also enable the whip to be reversed and used as a bludgeon. As the incorporation of heavy, metallic, sizeable and blunt elements in a whip increases, it shifts towards becoming a flail, morning star or meteor hammer <b>type</b> of <b>mace.</b>|$|R
40|$|The present article {{describes}} different <b>types</b> of <b>maces</b> and axes and their corresponding combat techniques based on Iranian martial arts tradition. Explaining different terms used by Persian manuscripts {{to refer to}} maces, the article then shows different types and expressions that talk about the weight and impact force of maces. Second, the article analyzes combat with maces: the way of carrying and drawing a mace, techniques of attack, offensive techniques against animals carrying the enemy, and defensive techniques. In the same manner, the article explains axes and their related techniques of attack. Some types of axes and maces {{as well as their}} techniques can be seen in pictures and miniatures in the article. </p...|$|R
50|$|Built in a Renaissance-Gothic {{style and}} {{constructed}} over {{the site of}} an older fortification on a rock above the small Zlaști River, the castle is a large and imposing structure with tall towers, bastions, an inner courtyard, diversely coloured roofs, and myriads of windows and balconies adorned with stone carvings. The castle also features a double wall for enhanced fortification and is flanked by both rectangular and circular towers, an architectural innovation for the period's Transylvanian architecture. Some of the towers (the Capistrano Tower, the Deserted Tower and the Drummers' Tower) were used as prisons. The Buzdugan Tower (a <b>type</b> of <b>mace</b> after which it was named) was solely built for defensive purposes and it had its exterior decorated with geometric motifs. The rectangular shaped towers have large openings to accommodate larger weapons.|$|R
50|$|The Pernach was a <b>type</b> of flanged <b>mace</b> {{developed}} {{since the}} 12th {{century in the}} region of Kievan Rus', and later widely used throughout the whole of Europe. The name comes from the Slavic word pero (перо) meaning feather, reflecting the form of pernach that resembled a fletched arrow. Pernachs were the first form of the flanged mace to enjoy a wide usage. It was well suited to penetrate plate armour and chain mail. In the later times it was often used as a symbol of power by the military leaders in Eastern Europe.|$|R
40|$|Objectives This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the outcomes of paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) and sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in a contemporaneous cohort of real-world patients. Background A number of randomized comparisons of PES and SES have shown unequivocal advantages for SES in anglographic end points such as late loss. However, the data on clinical outcomes are less consistent. Methods All consecutive patients successfully treated with only SES or PES in de novo native vessel lesions between March 2003 and March 2005 were analyzed. Our end points were major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR), and target lesion revascularization (TLR). We also analyzed late loss and angiographic restenosis. Results There were 609 patients (1, 064 lesions) treated with PES and 674 patients (1, 205 lesions) treated with SES. Diabetes mellitus was present in 26. 8 % of patients and multivessel disease in 75 % of patients. Bifurcations made up 16. 3 % of lesions, chronic occlusions 9. 5 %, left main 4. 8 %, and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology type B 2 /C 75. 4 %. Despite a higher late loss in the PES group (p = 0. 0001), there were no differences in anglographic restenosis (PES 18 % vs. SES 17. 8 %, p = 0. 95), TLR (PES 11. 9 % vs. SES 11 %, p 0. 47), or MACE (PES 21. 3 % vs. SES 21. 1 %, p = 0. 95). The relative risk of MACE for the PES group was 1. 02 (95 % confidence interval [Cl] 0. 78 to 1. 33). Multivariable analysis confirmed the lack of association of stent <b>type</b> with <b>MACE</b> (odds ratio 1. 03 [95 % Cl 0. 77 to 1. 38], p = 0. 83) and TLR (odds ratio 1. 08 [95 % Cl 0. 81 to 1. 44], p = 0. 61). Conclusions In this complex cohort, both stent platforms demonstrated similar clinical outcomes despite different late loss...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{electrocardiograph}} (ECG) is {{an essential}} tool in initial management and risk stratification of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A six-point reporting criterion has been proposed to facilitate standardized clinical assessment of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected ACS. We set out to evaluate the efficacy of these criteria in identifying patients with major adverse cardiac events (<b>MACE),</b> <b>Type</b> 1 myocardial infarction (T 1 MI), Type 2 myocardial infarction (T 2 MI), and 1 -year mortality in a cohort of emergency patients with chest pain. Methods: This was an analysis of data from 2, 349 patients who presented to the ED with chest pain between 2008 and 2013. Data were collected as part of two prospective trials. ECGs were recorded at presentation and categorized according to the six-point criteria by local cardiologists blinded to all clinical information. The primary outcome was 30 -day MACE, including T 1 MI, T 2 MI, unstable angina pectoris, revascularization, and 30 -day mortality. The outcome was adjudicated by cardiologists {{on the basis of}} all clinical information and test results. Likelihood ratios and odds ratios for 30 -day MACE were reported for each ECG category. Results: Major adverse cardiac events were diagnosed in 264 (11. 3 %) patients. Increasing ischemic abnormalities in ECGs, as categorized by the standardized reporting criteria, were associated with increasing rates of MACE. Within 30 days, T 1 MI occurred in 148 (6. 3 %) patients and T 2 MI occurred in 59 (2. 5 %) patients. Risk for T 1 MI increased with higher classification of ECG abnormalities. T 2 MI rates were highest in patients with ECGs of nonspecific changes. Conclusions: The rates of MACE, T 1 MI, and 1 -year death can be stratified according to standardized ECG criteria in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain. The ECG findings in patients with T 2 MI are variable, and the ECG is less helpful in defining risk in this group...|$|R
