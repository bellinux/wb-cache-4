2500|$|Cincinnati {{was one of}} {{only three}} cities in North America whose streetcars used double {{overhead}} trolley wire (two wires for each track) and twin trolley poles on each streetcar, the only others being Havana, Cuba, and the small Merrill, Wisconsin system.

50|$|Pinhole leaks with pitting {{initiating}} on {{the exterior}} surface of the pipe, can occur if copper piping is improperly grounded or bonded. The phenomenon is known technically as <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> corrosion or electrolytic pitting. Pin-holing due to poor grounding or poor bonding occurs typically in homes where the original plumbing has been modified; homeowners may find that a new plastic water filtration device or plastic repair union has interrupted the water pipe's electrical continuity to ground, when they start seeing pinhole water leaks after a recent install. Damage occurs rapidly, usually becoming obvious about {{six months after the}} ground interruption. Correctly installed plumbing appliances will have a copper bonding jumper cable connecting the interrupted pipe sections. Pinhole leaks from <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> corrosion can result in thousands of dollars in plumbing bills, and sometimes require the replacement of the entire affected water line. The cause is fundamentally an electrical defect, not a plumbing defect; once the plumbing damage is repaired, an electrician should promptly be consulted to evaluate the grounding and bonding of the entire plumbing and electrical systems.|$|E

Although such dc currents are mostly dealt with “after the fact” using protective systems (e.g., low resistance bonds, reverse current switches, cathodic protection), {{some of the}} protection has to be included at the manufacturing stage. This protection may include insulating covers on cable shields, or nonmetallic components or coatings for apparatus.|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} simulations of {{the occurrence of}} <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> {{in the vicinity of}} a SUDOP-type railway platform. <b>Stray</b> <b>currents</b> occur in the vicinity of a railway platform during the passage of a railway vehicle.

In the case of a breakdown of the surge arrester, the full voltage which is on the rail {{at the time of the}} passing railway vehicle may also pass onto the metallic parts. The surge arresters are checked every 6 months during maintenance work on the overhead lines according to Annex No. 1 of SZDC internal regulation E 500. The article, therefore, carries out a simulation of <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> in exactly this type of breakdown.

50|$|Differential TTL {{is used in}} {{preference}} to single-ended TTL for long-distance signaling. In a long cable, stray electromagnetic fields in the environment, or <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> in the system ground, can induce unwanted voltages that cause errors at the receiver. With a differential pair of wires, roughly the same unwanted voltage is induced in each wire. The receiver subtracts the voltages on the two wires, so that the unwanted voltage disappears, and only the voltage created by the driver remains.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>current</b> {{corrosion}} occurs because: 1) {{the piping}} {{system has been}} connected accidentally or intentionally to a DC voltage source; 2) the piping does not have metal-to-metal electrical continuity throughout its length; or 3) if the voltage source is AC, one or more naturally occurring minerals coating the pipe interior may act as a rectifier, converting AC current to DC. The DC voltage forces the water within the piping {{to act as an}} electrical conductor (an electrolyte). Electric current leaves the copper pipe, moves though the water across the nonconductive section (a plastic filter housing, for example), and reenters the pipe on the opposite side. Pitting occurs at the electrically negative side (the cathode), which may happen to be either upstream or downstream with respect to the water flow direction. Pitting occurs because the electrical voltage ionizes the pipe's interior copper metal, which reacts chemically with dissolved minerals in the water, creating copper salts; these copper salts are soluble in water and wash away. Microscopic pits eventually grow and consolidate to form pin holes. When one is discovered, there are almost certainly more that have not yet leaked. A complete discussion of <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> corrosion can be found in chapter 11, section 11.4.3, of Handbook of Corrosion Engineering, by Pierre Roberge.|$|E

5000|$|Electric shock drownings {{are most}} {{commonly}} caused by improper electrical connections on boats and docks. By law, all connections near water {{are required to}} have working ground fault circuit interruption technology, GFCI. These devices break the electrical circuit if any <b>stray</b> <b>current</b> fails {{to return to the}} source connection. If GFCI devices are missing or faulty, it is possible for current to leak into the water. If a system is leaking current into the water, appliances will likely function as normal without any indication of a problem. Correctly functioning GFCI and ELCI devices will instantaneously detect the problem and disconnect the power source.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} {{cause for}} drowning {{is the presence}} of stray electrical power from a boat leaking into the water. This is known as electric shock drowning. Metal surfaces of a boat leaking power into the water can create zones of high-energy potential. <b>Stray</b> <b>current</b> entering salt water is less of a problem than the same situation in fresh water. Salt water is a good conductor and it carries current away to ground quickly. Fresh water is a poor conductor and when alternating current forms an electrical potential near a boat, the current can paralyze a swimmer. Stray electric current has caused many drownings, but post-mortem examinations will not link this problem to the death. The problem can be reduced by prohibiting swimming near boats connected to shore power and ensuring marinas comply with National Fire Protection Association Standard 303 for marinas.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>currents</b> {{are known}} to promote {{corrosion}} of nearby metallic structures. Electrolysis is the responsible phenomenon.

Thus, authorities are extremely reluctant to accept the use of steel piling solutions {{in the vicinity of}} DC-operated systems (railways, tramways, cathodic protection, HVDC lines [...] .). The influence of <b>stray</b> <b>currents</b> on sheet piling structures was assessed using Elsyca 9 ̆ 2 s software CatPro® and CPMaster® initially dedicated to the pipeline and cathodic protection industries. Various steel piling designs were modelled meanwhile parameters such as wall/track distance, soil type, soil stratification, number and position of trains, anchors and track position were varied. Corrosion rates obtained on different piling designs were considerably lower than expected. Moreover, zones of potential corrosion risk could be identified, thus cost-effective and practical countermeasures can be resorted to. A first phase of a common TNO - ArcelorMittal project did present the same trend. Current collaboration with TNO and a consortium of other Dutch companies allows installation of a pilot steel piling project (2009) to put modelling results to test...|$|R
