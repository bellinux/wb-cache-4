40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the negative impacts on the environment of some insecticides, discovery of eco-friendly insecticides and target has received global attention in recent years. Sequence alignment and structural comparison of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) revealed differences between lepidopteran pests and other organisms, which suggested insect HMGR could be a <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> target candidate. Inhibition of JH biosynthesis in vitro confirmed that HMGR inhibitors showed a potent lethal effect on the lepidopteran pest Manduca sexta, whereas there was little effect on JH biosynthesis in Apis mellifera and Diploptera punctata. The pest control application of these inhibitors demonstrated that they can be insecticide candidates with potent ovicidal activity, larvicidal activity and insect growth regulatory effects. The present study has validated that Lepidopteran HMGR can be a potent <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> target, and the HMGR inhibitors (especially type II statins) could be <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> candidates and lead compounds. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sequence alignment, homology modeling and structural comparison may be useful for determining potential enzymes or receptors which can be eco-friendly pesticide  targets...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT House fly (Musca domestica L.) {{control was}} {{determined}} in small-unit, commercial, caged layer poultry houses.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of Triatoma infestans, the main Chagas disease vector in the Gran Chaco region, remains elusive. We implemented an intensified control strategy based on full-coverage pyrethroid spraying, followed by frequent vector surveillance and immediate <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> treatment of detected foci in a well-defined rural area in northeastern Argentina with moderate pyrethroid resistance. We assessed long-term impacts, and identified factors and procedures affecting spray effectiveness. After initial control interventions, timed-manual searches were performed by skilled personnel in 4, 053 sites of 353 - 411 houses inspected every 4 - 7 months over a 35 -month period. Residual insecticide spraying was less effective than expected throughout the three-year period, {{mainly because of}} the occurrence of moderate pyrethroid resistance and the limited effectiveness of selective treatment of infested sites only. After initial interventions, peridomestic infestation prevalence always exceeded domestic infestation, and timed-manual searches consistently outperformed householders' bug detection, except in domiciles. Most of the infestations occurred in houses infested at baseline, and were restricted to four main ecotopes. Houses with an early persistent infestation were spatially aggregated up to a distance of 2. 5 km. An Akaike-based multi-model inference approach showed that new site-level infestations increased substantially with the local availability of appropriate refugia for triatomine bugs, and with proximity to the nearest site found infested at one or two preceding surveys. Current vector control procedures have limited effectiveness in the Gran Chaco. <b>Selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> sprays must include all sites within the infested house compound. The suppression of T. infestans in rural areas with moderate pyrethroid resistance requires increased efforts and appropriate management actions. In addition to careful, systematic insecticide applications, housing improvement and development policies that improve material conditions of rural villagers and reduce habitat suitability for bugs will contribute substantially to sustainable vector and disease control in the Gran Chaco...|$|E

I was also interested in finding if <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides</b> reduced soybean exposure to A. glycines. To test for this I collected population data that would allow us to calculate cumulative aphid days (CAD).

I also collected natural enemy data for 2009 and 2010. I compared the populations of natural enemies between the two years to determine if the natural enemy community differed between years. I also compared a pre- and post-application date for each of the treatments for all of the natural enemies, as well as the two most abundant species for 2009 and 2010.

Collembola-predator ratios were significantly higher following cypermethrin treatment, suggesting that cypermethrin-induced increases in collembolan abundance represent a classical resurgence.

Collembola responses to insecticides differed among species, both in terms of effect magnitude and persistence, suggesting that coarse taxonomic monitoring would not adequately detect pesticide risks.

The tested insecticides were imidacloprid, pirimicarb, cartap and petroleum oil. Three indices were developed to determine the degree of selectivity of studied insecticides and to determine their suitability to WAA IPM program. WAA index {{used to measure the}} efficacy of the insecticides against the WAA and showed that imidacloprid was the most efficient in suppressing WAA. Parasitoid index used to measure the negative impact of insecticides on the sole parasitoid of WAA, Aphelinus mali. This index indicated that pirimicarb was the safest insecticide to WAA parasitoid, while imidacloprid caused drastic effect on mummified aphids. Both the WAA and parasitoid indices were integrated in a selectivity index that was used to determine the IPM compatibility of the tested insecticides.

40|$|Fifty years ago, Stern, Smith, van den Bosch and Hagen {{outlined}} {{a simple but}} sophisticated idea of pest control predicated on the complementary action of chemical and biological control. This integrated control concept has since been a driving force and conceptual foundation for all integrated pest management (IPM) programs. The four basic elements include thresholds for determining the need for control, sampling to determine critical densities, understanding and conserving the biological control capacity {{in the system and}} the use of <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides</b> or <b>selective</b> application methods, when needed, to augment biological control. Here we detail the development, evolution, validation and implementation of an integrated control (IC) program for whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Genn.), in the Arizona cotton system that provides a rare example of the vision of Stern and his colleagues. Economic thresholds derived from research-based economic injury levels were developed and integrated with rapid and accurate sampling plans into validated decision tools widely adopted by consultants and growers.

40|$|Development {{of insect}} {{resistance}} to insecticide {{has been the}} major driving force {{for the development of}} new insecticides. Awareness and demand from public for more environmentally friendly insecticides have contributed in shifting the trend from using broad spectrum to <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides.</b> As a result, scientists have looked for new target sites beyond the nervous system. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are more <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides</b> than conventional insecticides, and ecdysone agonists are the newest IGRs being commercialized, e. g. tebufenozide, methoxyfenozide, and halofenozide. Ecdysone agonists bind to the ecdysteroid receptors, and they act similarly to the molting hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone. The binding provides larvae or nymphs with a signal to enter a premature and lethal molting cycle. In addition, the ecdysone agonists cause a {{reduction in the number of}} eggs laid by female insects. The ecdysone agonists are being developed as <b>selective</b> biorational <b>insecticides.</b> Tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide are used to control lepidopteran insect pests, whereas halofenozide is being used to control coleopteran insect pests.

40|$|AbstractPentatomid stinkbugs are {{important}} predators of defoliating caterpillars in agricultural and forestry systems, {{and knowledge of}} the impact of insecticides on natural enemies is important information for integrated pest management (IPM) programs. Thus, we assessed the toxicity and behavioral sublethal response of the predators Podisus nigrispinus and Supputius cincticeps exposed to deltamethrin, methamidophos, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole, insecticides commonly used to control the velvetbean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis) in soybean crops. With the exception of deltamethrin for S. cincticeps, all insecticides showed higher acute toxicity to the prey than to these natural enemies providing effective control of A. gemmatalis. The recommended field concentration of deltamethrin, methamidophos and spinosad for controlling A. gemmatalis caused 100 % mortality of P. nigrispinus and S. cincticeps nymphs. Chlorantraniliprole was the less toxic and the most <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> to these predators resulting in mortalities of less than 10 % when exposed to 10 × the recommended field concentration for a period of 72 h. Behavioral pattern changes in predators were found for all insecticides, especially methamidophos and spinosad, which exhibited irritability (i. e., avoidance after contact) to both predator species. However, insecticide repellence (i. e., avoidance without contact) was not observed in any of the insects tested. The lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides on natural enemies is of great importance for IPM, and our results indicate that substitution of pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides at their field rates by chlorantraniliprole may be a key factor for the success of IPM programs of A. gemmatalis in soybeans...|$|E

The fields’ structure and the treatments have a significant role in forming the dominance of species. Also the dynamics of each species is highly influenced by the disturbances. These could be explained with different microclimatic and humidity tolerance of the species. The greater mobility of staphylinids may enable them to avoid pesticide treatments in individual fields.

This level of insecticide use presents problems for small growers, particularly for "pick-your-own" operations. Injection of oil into the corn ear silk channel 5 - 8 days after silking initiation {{has been used to}} suppress damage by these insects.

While this methodology is labor-intensive, it requires a single application of insecticide at reduced rates applied similar to 2 wk prior to harvest, compared with potential daily applications at full rates up to the day of harvest with foliar insecticide applications.

40|$|While {{the area}} of organic crop {{production}} increases at a global scale, the potential interactions between pest management in organic and conventionally managed systems have so far received little attention. Here, we evaluate the landscape-level co-dependence of insecticide-based and natural enemy-based pest management using a simulation model for parasitoid–host interactions in landscapes consisting of conventionally and organically managed fields. In our simulations conventional management consists of broad-spectrum or <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> application, while organic management involves no insecticides. Simulations indicate that insecticide use can easily result in lose–lose scenarios whereby both organically and conventionally managed fields suffer from increased pest loads as compared to a scenario where no insecticides are used, but that under some conditions insecticide use can be compatible with biocontrol. Simulations also suggest that the pathway to achieve the insecticide reduction without triggering additional pest pressure is not straightforward, because increasing the proportion of organically managed fields or reducing the spray frequency in conventional fields can potentially give rise to dramatic increases in pest load. The disruptive effect of insecticide use, however, can be mitigated by spatially clustering organic fields and using selective insecticides, although {{the effectiveness of this}} mitigation depends on the behavioral traits of the biocontrol agents. Poorly dispersing parasitoids and parasitoids with high attack rates required a lower amount of organically managed fields for effective pest suppression.

40|$|Conservation {{biological}} control emphasizes the preservation and enhancement of natural enemies {{and is the}} cornerstone of all approaches to {{biological control}}. This review critically examines recent and current research efforts in conservation biological control by predators and parasitoids of Bemisia tabaci worldwide. A large number of natural enemy species have been identified from many agricultural systems. Further research has demonstrated that these natural enemies may act along with other mortality agents to inflict high levels of mortality on populations of B. tabaci. Less effort has been placed on determining the factors constraining or potentially enhancing biological control. The widespread use of broad-spectrum insecticides in many crops has severely hampered the contribution of predators and parasitoids to pest suppression. However, the arsenal of <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides</b> has grown in the past decade and their increased usage may permit the true integration of biological control into IPM systems.

Pirimicarb and vamidathion {{were the most}} selective insecticides for C. sanguinea followed by ethion and dichlorvos (3. 2, 6. 7, 49. 7, and 52. 5 % mortality, respectively). Pirimicarb was the most <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> for E. connexa, followed by ethion and cypermethrin (2, 71. 3, and 81. 9 % mortality, respectively). Males of C. sanguinea were more tolerant to ethion (33 and 66. 5 % mortality, respectively) and permethrin (61 and 100 % mortality respectively) than females. Permethrin toxicity to E. connexa and ethion toxicity to C. sanguinea females were lower when those insecticides were applied at half dose (74. 4 and 25 % mortality, respectively) than when they were applied at their full dose (100 and 66. 5 % mortality, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is a {{cosmopolitan}} insect pest of Brassica crops. In South Africa, {{there are no}} action thresholds for its chemical control which {{makes it difficult for}} growers to make informed decisions on when to apply insecticides and how frequently to apply them in order to achieve optimal crop yield. To contribute towards optimum application of insecticides against P. xylostella, this study compared the impact of weekly and bi-weekly applications of a <b>selective</b> <b>insecticide</b> Dipel® (Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner var. kurstaki) applied at 250 g/ha, and a broad-spectrum insecticide Dichlorvos (an organophosphate) applied at 1 ml/L against biological control (Control) on the pest population density on cabbage during October– December 2011 and March–May 2012. The use of both selective and broad-spectrum insecticides for experiments enables us to understand if efforts to optimise cabbage yield depend mainly on effective suppression of P. xylostella densities. Furthermore, investigations were carried out to determine the impact of these chemicals on parasitism rates of P. xylostella and species richness of its primary parasitoids. During the October–December 2011 growing season, the lowest infestation of P. xylostella occurred on cabbage plots that received weekly application of Dipel and the highest on untreated control plots. Cabbage weights were negatively related to infestation levels, implying that weekly application of Dipel yielded bigger cabbage heads. During March– May 2012, P. xylostella infestations were again higher on the control followed by weekly and bi-weekly treatments of Dichlorvos, then weekly and bi-weekly applications of Dipel. Despite the significant differences observed, infestation levels were much lower ( 80 % of total parasitism levels in all treatments. Parasitism levels were not significantly different among the treatments in both seasons. Parasitoid species richness was highest on the control. Although two parasitoid species were recorded in all Dipel and Dichlorvos treatments during October–December 2011, only one parasitoid species was recorded in the Dipel treatments during March–May 2012 compared to two species in Dichlorvos treatments. Although weekly applications of Dipel ensured good yield and crop quality during October–December, weekly applications of the chemical did not lead to better quality crop during March–May crop growing season. Thus, {{it is not necessary to}} apply insecticides during periods in which natural mortality of P. xylostella is high due to parasitoids. Since P. xylostella abundance was a determining factor of crop quality, these results imply that insect pest management should focus mainly on suppressing its numbers. Furthermore, there was no evidence that application of either insecticide type had a negative impact on parasitism rates of P. xylostella. The lower parasitoid species richness on Dipel treated plots was the consequence of its higher efficiency in suppressing the pest population which substantially reduced availability of potential hosts for parasitoids, hence only the efficient C. vestalis was recorded at low host densitiesAgriculture and  Animal HealthM.

40|$|The pond wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata, an {{important}} natural predatory enemy of rice planthoppers, is found widely distributed in paddy fields. However, {{data on the}} genes involved in insecticide action, detoxification, and response are very limited for P. pseudoannulata, which inhibits the development and appropriate use of <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides</b> to control insect pests on rice. We used transcriptome construction from adult spider cephalothoraxes to analyze and manually identify genes enconding metabolic enzymes and target receptors related to insecticide action and detoxification, including 90 cytochrome P 450 s, 14 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 17 acetylcholinesterases (AChEs), 17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and 17 gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, as well as 12 glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) unigenes. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed the different subclassifications of P 450 s and GSTs, some important sequence diversities in nAChRs and GABA receptors, polymorphism in AChEs, and high similarities in GluCls. For P 450 s in P. pseudoannulata, the number of unigenes belonging to the CYP 2 clade was much higher than that in CYP 3 and CYP 4 clades. The results differed from insects in which most P 450 genes were in CYP 3 and CYP 4 clades. For GSTs, most unigenes belonged to the delta and sigma classes, and no epsilon GST class gene was found, which differed from the findings for insects and acarina. Our results will be useful for studies on insecticide action, selectivity, and detoxification in the spider and other related animals, and the sequence differences in target genes between the spider and insects will provide important information {{for the design of}} <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides...</b>|$|R

The results of these studies demonstrate that these <b>selective</b> <b>insecticides</b> offer melon growers effective foliar management alternatives for controlling whiteflies. Both Oberon and Courier provided economic control of whitefly nymphs and significantly prevented sooty mold contamination when applied after populations exceeded either an adult threshold of 2 adults per leaf or an immature threshold or 0. 5 large nymph per 2 cm² leaf disc.

Light brown apple moth was an economically important pest within the fruit sector in the 1960 s through the 1980 s, and it developed resistance to broad-spectrum insecticides. The increase in its pest status focused research on biological control, and existing native natural enemies were augmented with new introductions from Australia in the late 1960 s. By the early 1990 s, this effort resulted in substantially reduced leafroller populations and fruit damage.
