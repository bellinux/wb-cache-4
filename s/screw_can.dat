25|$|The Acme thread form has a 29Â° {{thread angle}} with a thread height {{half of the}} pitch; the apex (or crest) and valley (or root) are flat. This shape is easier to machine (faster cutting, longer tool life) than is a square thread. The tooth shape also has a wider base which means it is {{stronger}} (thus, the <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> carry a greater load) than a similarly sized square thread. This thread form also allows {{for the use of}} a split nut, which can compensate for nut wear.|$|E
25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|E
500|$|For thermosets, {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. [...] Solidification in the injection barrel and <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the cycle times. These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould closes and the process repeats.|$|E

5000|$|A {{roller screw}} is a {{mechanical}} actuator {{similar to a}} ball screw that uses rollers as the load transfer elements between nut and screw instead of balls. The rollers are typically threaded but may also be grooved depending on roller screw type. Providing more bearing points than ball screws within a given volume, roller <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> be more compact for a given load capacity while providing similar efficiency (75%-90%) at low to moderate speeds, and maintain relatively high efficiency at high speeds. Roller <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> surpass ball <b>screws</b> in regard to positioning precision, load rating, rigidity, speed, acceleration, and lifetime. Standard roller <b>screw</b> actuators <b>can</b> achieve dynamic load ratings above 130 tons of force (exceeded in single-unit actuator capacity only by hydraulic cylinders).|$|R

30|$|As {{the plate}} is pre-contoured, {{it does not}} seat equally well in all {{patients}} and bending the plate can potentially damage the locking hole <b>screw</b> threads and <b>can</b> also change the screw direction to a certain extent. Improperly locked <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> compromise {{the stability of the}} construct, and the change in <b>screw</b> direction <b>can</b> pose a problem in the distal screws which are directed into the capitellum and trochlea. To circumvent this problem, plate bending should be done after blocking the screw holes with locking sleeves and bending the plate only in between the screw holes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{mechanical}} {{linear actuators}} only pull, such as hoists, chain drive and belt drives. Others only push (such as a cam actuator). Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders, or lead <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> {{be designed to}} generate force in both directions.|$|R

50|$|A {{variant of}} the Archimedes <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> {{also be found in}} some {{injection}} molding machines, die casting machines and extrusion of plastics, which employ a screw of decreasing pitch to compress and melt the material. It is also used in a rotary-screw air compressor. On a much larger scale, Archimedes's screws of decreasing pitch are used for the compaction of waste material.|$|E
50|$|Self-tapping <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> {{be divided}} into two classes; those that {{displace}} material (especially plastic and thin metal sheets) without removing it are termed thread-forming self-tapping screws; self-tappers with sharp cutting surfaces that remove the material as they are inserted are termed self-cutting.|$|R
50|$|While {{reducing}} friction, ball <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> {{operate with}} some preload, effectively eliminating backlash (slop) between input (rotation) and output (Linear motion). This feature is essential {{when they are}} used in computer-controlled motion-control systems, e.g., CNC machine tools and high precision motion applications (e.g., wire bonding).|$|R
30|$|PMMA {{reinforcement}} of pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> {{be carried out}} by first injecting the cement into the pedicle and subsequently inserting the screw. This technique, however, risks increasing the pressure inside the borehole, which may cause leakage of the cement, with possible embolism in the venous plexuses or cord damage.|$|R
5000|$|It can be {{seen that}} the {{mechanical}} advantage of a screw depends on its lead, [...] The smaller the distance between its threads, the larger the mechanical advantage, and the larger the force the <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> exert for a given applied force. However most actual screws have large amounts of friction and their mechanical advantage is less than given by the above equation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} {{rotation}} of an accurately made <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> be directly and precisely correlated {{to a certain}} amount of axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the screw's lead (...) [...] A screw's lead is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360Â°). (In most threads is, in all single-start threads, lead and pitch refer to essentially the same concept.) ...|$|E
50|$|Like {{the other}} simple {{machines}} a <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> amplify force; a small rotational force (torque) {{on the shaft}} can exert a large axial force on a load. The smaller the pitch, {{the distance between the}} screw's threads, the greater the mechanical advantage, the ratio of output to input force. Screws are widely used in threaded fasteners to hold objects together, and in devices such as screw tops for containers, vises, screw jacks and screw presses.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon their}} lead angle, ball <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> be back-driven {{due to their}} low {{internal}} friction (i.e., the <b>screw</b> shaft <b>can</b> be driven linearly to rotate the ball nut). They are usually undesirable for hand-fed machine tools, as the stiffness of a servo motor is required to keep the cutter from grabbing the work and self-feeding, that is, where the cutter and workpiece exceed the optimum feedrate and effectively jam or crash together, ruining the cutter and workpiece. Cost is also a major factor as Acme screws are cheaper to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|Stabilization of {{unstable}} thoracic fractures with transpedicular screws {{is widely}} accepted. However, placement of transpedicular <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> cause complications, {{particularly in the}} thoracic spine with physiologically small pedicles. Hybrid stabilization, a combination of sublaminar bands and pedicle screws, might reduce the rate of misplaced <b>screws</b> and <b>can</b> be helpful in special anatomic circumstances, such as preexisting scoliosis and osteoporosis. We report about two patients suffering from unstable thoracic fractures, of T 5 in one case and T 3, T 4, and T 5 in the other case, with preexisting scoliosis and extremely small pedicles. Additionally, one patient had osteoporosis. Patients received hybrid stabilization with pedicle screws adjacent to the fractured vertebral bodies and sublaminar bands at the level {{above and below the}} pedicle screws. No complications occurred. Follow-up was 12 months with clinically uneventful postoperative courses. No signs of implant failure or loss of reduction could be detected. In patients with very small thoracic pedicles, scoliosis, and/or osteoporosis, hybrid stabilization with sublaminar bands and pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>can</b> be a viable alternative to long pedicle screw constructs...|$|R

50|$|The {{recirculating}} type {{of planetary}} roller screw {{is also known}} as a recycling roller screw. A recirculating roller <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> provide a very high degree of positional accuracy by using minimal thread leads. The rollers of a recirculating roller screw move axially within the nut until being reset after one orbit about the screw. Recirculating roller screws do not employ ring gears. Carl Bruno Strandgren was awarded a US Patent for the recirculating roller screw in 1965.|$|E
50|$|This lobular thread {{has other}} {{advantages}} too. It allows the screw {{to be turned}} with lower torque, which also increases the 'strip-to-drive ratio' between the torques needed to drive the screw in or to damagingly strip the threads out. The proportions of the lobular thread can also change over {{the length of the}} screw, so that the tip of the <b>screw</b> <b>can</b> use greater lobulation to form the thread more aggressively and also provide a centring effect.|$|E
