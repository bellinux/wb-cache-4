50|$|A {{variation}} on capacitively coupled plasma involves isolating {{one of the}} electrodes, usually with a capacitor. The capacitor appears like a short circuit to the high frequency RF field, but like an open circuit to direct current (DC) field. Electrons impinge on the electrode in the sheath, and the electrode quickly acquires a negative charge (or <b>self-bias)</b> because the capacitor does not allow it to discharge to ground. This sets up a secondary, DC field across the plasma {{in addition to the}} alternating current (AC) field. Massive ions are unable to react to the quickly changing AC field, but the strong, persistent DC field accelerates them toward the self-biased electrode. These energetic ions are exploited in many microfabrication processes (see reactive-ion etching (RIE)) by placing a substrate on the isolated (self-biased) electrode.|$|E
5000|$|The second hypothesis, DNA as food, {{relies on}} the fact that cells that take up DNA inevitably acquire the {{nucleotides}} the DNA consists of, and, because nucleotides are needed for DNA and RNA synthesis and are expensive to synthesize, these may make a significant contribution to the cell's energy budget. [...] Some naturally competent bacteria also secrete nucleases into their surroundings, and all bacteria can take up the free nucleotides these nucleases generate from environmental DNA. The energetics of DNA uptake are not understood in any system, so it is difficult to compare the efficiency of nuclease secretion to that of DNA uptake and internal degradation. In principle the cost of nuclease production and the uncertainty of nucleotide recovery must be balanced against the energy needed to synthesize the uptake machinery and to pull DNA in. Other important factors are the likelihoods that nucleases and competent cells will encounter DNA molecules, the relative inefficiencies of nucleotide uptake from the environment and from the periplasm (where one strand is degraded by competent cells), and the advantage of producing ready-to-use nucleotide monophosphates from the other strand in the cytoplasm. Another complicating factor is the <b>self-bias</b> of the DNA uptake systems of species in the family Pasteurellaceae and the genus Neisseria, which could reflect either selection for recombination or for mechanistically efficient uptake.|$|E

However, it is demonstrated in present experiment that large area polycrystalline BaM thick films (500 Âµm) with <b>self-biasing</b> (high remanence) and low microwave loss can be successfully fabricated by tape casting.

40|$|The RF-power {{handling}} {{capability is}} an important characteristic for RF-MEMS switching devices. Apart from excessive heat dissipation, the power handling capability is mainly limited by the so-called <b>self-biasing</b> and/or RF-latching. These two phenomena result {{from the fact that}} the available RF-power from the source induces a non-zero electrostatic pulling force on the suspended structure. So far, <b>self-biasing</b> of RF-MEMS switches has always been studied assuming a perfect match of the device to the network in the ON-state (i. e. no reflection) and thus a fixed dc-equivalent rms voltage on the capacitor. If the RF-power exceeds a critical value, pull-in or <b>self-biasing</b> occurs. In practice, however, the assumption of the perfect match is not correct as the switch capacitance increases with increasing RF-power. This will cause a change in the reflected signal and thus a decrease in the dc-equivalent voltage source. This paper gives a new insight into the RF-power handling of RF-MEMS shunt switches and, per extension, of RF-MEMS shunt tunable capacitors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Positive <b>self-bias</b> {{is thought}} to be {{protective}} for mental health. We previously found that the degree of positive bias when learning self-referential social evaluation decreases with increasing social anxiety. It is unclear whether this reduction is driven by differences in state or trait anxiety, as both are elevated in social anxiety; therefore, we examined the effects on the state of anxiety induced by the 7. 5 % carbon dioxide (CO 2) inhalation model of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) on social evaluation learning. METHODS: For our study, 48 (24 of female gender) healthy volunteers took two inhalations (medical air and 7. 5 % CO 2, counterbalanced) whilst learning social rules (self-like, self-dislike, other-like and other-dislike) in an instrumental social evaluation learning task. We analysed the outcomes (number of positive responses and errors to criterion) using the random effects Poisson regression. RESULTS: Participants made fewer and more positive responses when breathing 7. 5 % CO 2 in the other-like and other-dislike rules, respectively (gas Ã— condition Ã— rule interaction p = 0. 03). Individuals made fewer errors learning self-like than self-dislike, and this positive <b>self-bias</b> was unaffected by CO 2. Breathing 7. 5 % CO 2 increased errors, but only in the other-referential rules (gas Ã— condition Ã— rule interaction p = 0. 003). CONCLUSIONS: Positive <b>self-bias</b> (i. e. fewer errors learning self-like than self-dislike) seemed robust to changes in state anxiety. In contrast, learning other-referential evaluation was impaired as state anxiety increased.

40|$|International audienceCapacitively coupled radio {{frequency}} plasmas operated in an electronegative gas (CF 4) and driven by voltage waveforms composed of four consecutive harmonics are investigated for different fundamental driving frequencies using PIC/MCC simulations and an analytical model. As {{has been observed}} previously for electropositive gases, the application of peak-shaped waveforms (that are characterized by a strong amplitude asymmetry) results {{in the development of}} a DC <b>self-bias</b> due to the electrical asymmetry effect (EAE), which increases the energy of ions arriving at the powered electrode. In contrast to the electropositive case (Korolov et al 2012 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 45 465202) the absolute value of the DC <b>self-bias</b> is found to increase as the fundamental frequency is reduced in this electronegative discharge, providing an increased range over which the DC <b>self-bias</b> can be controlled. The analytical model reveals that this increased DC <b>self-bias</b> is caused by changes in the spatial profile and the mean value of the net charge density in the grounded electrode sheath. The spatio-temporally resolved simulation data show that as the frequency is reduced the grounded electrode sheath region becomes electronegative. The presence of negative ions in this sheath leads to very different dynamics of the power absorption of electrons, which in turn enhances the local electronegativity and plasma density via ionization and attachment processes. The ion flux to the grounded electrode (where the ion energy is lowest) can be up to twice that to the powered electrode. At the same time, while the mean ion energies at both electrodes are quite different, their ratio remains approximately constant for all base frequencies studied here...|$|E
