Two kinds of paint materials, <b>solvent</b> <b>borne</b> and water borne paints, both with and without manufactured nanomaterials (pigments), and an industrial spray gun were used. Different aerosol measuring techniques, namely the Spraytec Fraunhofer type particle sizer for micro-sized droplets in the spray jet and the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) for nano particles in paint overspray were applied. It was found, that <b>solvent</b> <b>borne</b> clear <b>coats</b> create significantly higher number concentration of nano-sized droplets than the water borneprimers. Only small differences in PSD between paints with and without manufactured nanomaterials were found. Numerical simulations of droplet trajectories within the spray booth, for both micro and nano sized droplets, were carried out. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a representative particle size distribution (smaller than 1 μm) for the given spray gun was obtained. Effects of turbulence models on the particle deposition on targets, especially for submicron particles, have been analysed in detailed...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{accumulation}} inside wood causes favorable {{conditions for}} decay. Application of a coating alters the moisture sorption {{of wood and}} prevents accumulation of moisture. This paper {{presents the results of}} a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study on the influence of a coating on the moisture absorption of wood. NMR allows to determine both local wood moisture content and rate of water absorption during water absorption and desorption of coated and uncoated wood. In contrast to weighing, both quantities are measured dynamically and non destructively with high spatial and temporal resolution in relatively short experiments. In addition, NMR relaxometry distinguishes between moisture in lumina and moisture in cell walls, which allows to accurately characterize sorption processes in wood. In the present study, samples with a diameter of 20 mm and a height of 10 mm, are studied in a 4. 7 T NMR scanner with a spatial resolution of 33 ± 3 µm. Several commonly used wood-coating combinations are studied. Water is placed on the tangential side of samples equilibrated at 22 % relative humidity while the wood moisture content (MC) is monitored for 24 h. This research shows that the sorption behavior of coated wood depends on the specific combination of wood and coating. Additionally, the amount of water that is absorbed in a coating may have a strong influence on the moisture content of the coated wood. We found that the water absorption of a hardwood dark red meranti sample is diffusion dominated. Application of a waterborne acrylic coating has no influence on this absorption process, which is attributed to the large water uptake of the <b>coating.</b> A <b>solvent</b> <b>borne</b> alkyd <b>coating</b> that absorbs very little water is found to strongly reduce the water uptake of the meranti studied. The waterborne coating reduces the water uptake of pine by preventing capillary water uptake of rays present in this softwood. The <b>solvent</b> <b>borne</b> alkyd <b>coating</b> further reduces uptake. Uncoated spruce also absorbs water by capillary suction. On this wood, the acrylic coating strongly reduces the water uptake; comparable to alkyd coated spruce. This {{is a result of the}} pits of spruce which became aspirated during drying. Application of a coating might fixate the aspirated pits, resulting in a structure with low permeability. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The coater devices of the described embodiments provide two inlet channels and an outlet channel. The first inlet channel carries the coating liquid, and the second channel can be used to pump the carrier fluid, e. g. air, into the coating head to pressurize the chamber and to keep the contact wetting line at the upstream section attached to the substrate. The air layer serves as a carrier fluid removing the wall shear stress on the coating liquid in the channel, and thus the coating flow for the operation of the device may proceed without flow separation from the wall (i. e., in a vortex-free mode) at relatively low flow rates appropriate for commercial applications.
