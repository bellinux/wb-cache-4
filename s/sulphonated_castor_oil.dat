30|$|The {{diversity}} of chemicals and products produced from <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> has proven that castor {{is an important}} and potential non-edible oilseed crop. The great utilitarian value in industry, agriculture, cosmetics and pharmaceutical sectors is a direct proof that <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> is a potential bio-based starting material. The presence of a hydroxyl group, carboxylate and double bonds in the ricinoleic acid, imparts unique properties for the derivatization of <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> into vital industrial raw materials. It has been shown how <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> {{can be used as}} a renewable bio-based raw material for the production a multitude of functional materials. It is equally noted that the diverse possibilities of <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> transformation mainly depend on the presence of the three functional groups. This review has further shown that <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> is a potential alternative to petroleum-based starting materials for the production of wide range of industrial materials. It can also be seen that apart from the oil’s unique chemical structure and environmental considerations, the worldwide growth in <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> demand is due to its easy availability, low cost, non-food competition. It has been observed in the discussion that <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> is more than just a bio-based raw material in great demand by the chemical industries but its use as a fuel is also seen when transesterification is done. The worldwide increase in the production of castor seeds and <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> testifies the huge potential as a green bio-resource for chemical transformations because <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> can be used as the starting material for producing a wide range of end-products.|$|R

40|$|<b>Castor</b> <b>oil</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} drugs. When given orally, it has a {{laxative}} effect and induces labor in pregnant females. The effects of <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> are mediated by ricinoleic acid, a hydroxylated fatty acid released from <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> by intestinal lipases. Despite the wide-spread use of <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> in conventional and folk medicine, the molecular mechanism by which ricinoleic acid acts remains unknown. Here we show that the EP 3 prostanoid receptor is specifically activated by ricinoleic acid and that it mediates the pharmacological effects of <b>castor</b> <b>oil.</b> In mice lacking EP 3 receptors, the laxative effect and the uterus contraction induced via ricinoleic acid are absent. Although a conditional deletion of the EP 3 receptor gene in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect castor oil-induced diarrhea, mice lacking EP 3 receptors only in smooth-muscle cells were unresponsive to this drug. Thus, the <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> metabolite ricinoleic acid activates intestinal and uterine smooth-muscle cells via EP 3 prostanoid receptors.

30|$|<b>Castor</b> <b>oil</b> is {{extracted}} colourless to very pale yellow viscous liquid {{with a distinct}} taste, mild odour and it boils at 586  K [10]. The hydroxyl group in ricinoleic acid (Fig.  4 a) account for the unique properties of <b>castor</b> <b>oil.</b> For instance, the oil has relatively high viscosity and specific gravity; it is soluble in alcohols in any proportion and has limited solubility in aliphatic petroleum solvents [11]. In addition, the polar hydroxyl group in <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> makes it compatible with plasticizers {{of a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic resins, waxes, polymers and elastomers [12]. Notable changes on the properties of the <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> can also be due to several factors such as the method of extraction, seed varieties, weather conditions and soil type. For instance, cold-pressed <b>castor</b> <b>oils</b> have low acid value, low iodine value and a slightly higher saponification value than solvent-extracted oil [1]. It has further been observed that castor seeds from different climatic conditions produce <b>castor</b> <b>oils</b> of different composition and physical–chemical properties [14, 15, 17]. Malaysian castor seeds for instance, contain total lipids (<b>castor</b> <b>oil)</b> reaching up to 43.3  % per dry weight and a saponification value of 182.96  mg KOH/g [14] while for the Nigerian castor seeds, the total lipids (<b>castor</b> <b>oil)</b> is 48  % per dry weight with a saponification value of 178.00  mg KOH/g [15].|$|R
