5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test {{against the}} West Indies cricket team in Brisbane, Davidson showed his all round <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> well as stamina in {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} take ten wickets and accumulate more than a hundred runs in a match. On the eve of the match, Davidson broke the little finger on his bowling hand during catching practice and was unable to move it. However, he decided to play after Bradman gave a motivational speech to the team ahead of the match.|$|E

5|$|Jason McElwain {{was born}} on October 1, 1987, to David and Debbie McElwain, and was {{diagnosed}} with autism {{at the age of}} two years. Jason and his family lived in Greece, New York, a suburb of Rochester, New York. He initially struggled when interacting with other children, but began to develop social <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> he grew older. Although he was placed in special education classes, McElwain enjoyed basketball, to which he was introduced by his older brother Josh, and was appointed manager of Greece Athena High School's varsity basketball team.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 19th century, all {{education}} in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> well as {{social and cultural}} values, including respect for ancestors and elders. The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina {{by members of the}} London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I (1810–28) to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.|$|E

The clinic recruited volunteer doctors, Physician Assistants, medical students, nurses, pharmacists, EMTs, and paramedics from different parts of the United States to volunteer for a week at a time. Medications and medical tools were donated by dozens of organizations including Pfizer, which donated the majority of the medications used. During its three months of operation, the clinic had over 5,500 documented patient encounters.|$|E

The college partnered with Epicurious in running an online cooking school featuring a variety of culinary classes. The CIA also runs a certification program called ProChef, a program to recognize culinary and academic <b>skills,</b> <b>as</b> well as familiarity with business practices.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} {{considered}} using specialised Vietnamese language <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> {{a means of}} gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it, citing that infiltration and clandestine anti-colonial techniques were rendering them irrelevant. The report thus concluded that deeper specialisation would not improve intelligence, and that a degree of expertise – to improve command skills – was all that one would need.|$|E

5|$|When Bounty {{returned}} to Tahiti, on 22 September, the welcome {{was much less}} effusive than previously. The Tahitians had learned from the crew of a visiting British ship {{that the story of}} Cook and Bligh founding a settlement in Aitutaki was a fabrication, and that Cook had been long dead. Christian worried that their reaction might turn violent, and did not stay long. Of the 16 men who had voted to settle in Tahiti, he allowed 15 ashore; Joseph Coleman was detained on the ship, as Christian required his <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> an armourer.|$|E
5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer. At age27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that {{she did have a}} fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it a waste of time.|$|E
5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E

5|$|At L'Ora, De Mauro {{joined a}} group of crack investigative reporters. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s the left-leaning {{newspaper}} often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations about the ties between the Sicilian Mafia and corrupt politicians. These were the golden years of investigations, signed by journalists like Mauro De Mauro, Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. De Mauro could exercise his <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> a successful investigative reporter. He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s {{that led to the}} destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas. He also published articles about the collusion between the Mafia and politics. In 1960 he was among the winners of the Premiolino, {{one of the most important}} Italian journalism awards, for his crime investigations.|$|E
5|$|Baseball was a {{reasonably}} popular sport in Australia {{in the early}} 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life. At the time, baseball was generally played in Australia during the winter months, {{as many of the}} leading players were enthusiastic cricketers who viewed the sport as a means of improving their fielding <b>skills.</b> <b>As</b> with cricket, Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School, where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop, later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching.|$|E
5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> a pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, {{during the early}} 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also made {{a great deal of money}} and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During {{the events of}} Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her {{the ability to read}} Kitana's thoughts. Shinnok sees {{this as an opportunity to}} covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Imogen Holst showed {{precocious}} {{talent in}} composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul's Girls' School, {{she entered the}} Royal College of Music, where she developed her <b>skills</b> <b>as</b> a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable for health reasons to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer, Imogen {{spent most of the}} 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts {{at the start of the}} Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre of music education and activity.|$|E
