40|$|Voltage flicker is a {{power quality}} problem caused by {{regularly}} oscillating active and reactive power either from a load or generator. The regular power oscillations induce a voltage change at the grid connection which {{is proportional to the}} amplitude of the power oscillation and at the same frequency. The impedance of the grid (grid strength) at the point of connection is a factor in the amplitude of the voltage oscillation. The frequency band of interest for flicker evaluation is from 0. 01 - 20 Hz, and is most severe at 8. 8 Hz. The frequency of the primary resource for wave <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> lies within this range. Therefore the coupling of the input resource to the output power of a wave <b>energy</b> <b>converter</b> will cause voltage flicker at the point of connection.

In this part of the research work, the application of the air turbine power take-off (PTO) to the OWC device leads to a coupled model of the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of the OWC wave <b>energy</b> <b>converters,</b> in a manner that under the wave excitation, the varying air volume due to the internal water surface motion creates a reciprocating chamber pressure (alternative positive and negative chamber pressure), whilst the chamber pressure, in turn, modifies the motions of the device and the internal water surface. To do this, the thermodynamics of the air chamber is first examined and applied by including the air compressibility in the oscillating water columns for different types of the air turbine PTOs. The developed thermodynamics is then coupled with the hydrodynamics of the OWC wave <b>energy</b> <b>converters.</b> This proposed assessment method is then applied to two generic OWC wave <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> (one bottom fixed and another floating), and the numerical results are compared to the experimental results.
