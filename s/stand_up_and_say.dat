25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re {{going to have to pay}} it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

Democrats who feared the impact of having the legislation on the November ballot helped override his veto. One Democratic leader in the House said: [...] "I'll vote to override.

[...] According to the Seattle Times: [...] "Lawmakers, eager to be done with the controversial issue, rushed the ban through in minutes and dumped it in the governor's lap.

No one could remember the last time a bill was passed, vetoed and overridden within hours–with almost no discussion and no debate." ...|$|E

60|$|This is Trumbull's argument. Now, Judge Douglas {{does not}} meet the charge at all, but he <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> there was no such {{proposition}} in that bill for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people. Trumbull admits that the language is not a direct provision for submitting it, but it is a provision necessarily implied from another provision. He asks you how it is possible to ratify the land proposition at the election for the adoption of the constitution, if there was no election to be held for the adoption of the constitution. And he goes on to show that it is not any less a law because the provision is put in that indirect shape than it would be if it were put directly. But I presume I have said enough to draw attention to this point, and I pass it by also.|$|R

5000|$|Radisson gives Josh {{twenty minutes}} {{at the end of}} the first three lecture {{sessions}} to argue that God exists. In the first session, Josh presents his evidence that God created the universe. In the second session, Josh argues that macroevolution is not as solid of a theory as it is usually presented. In the first two sessions, Radisson has counter-arguments for some of Josh's points. Ultimately, it comes down to the third and final debate between Radisson and Josh, who again both make compelling points. Josh then halts his line of debate to pose a question to Radisson: [...] "Why do you hate God?" [...] After Josh repeats the question twice more, Radisson explodes in rage, confirming he hates God for his mother's death that left him alone despite his prayers. Josh then casually asks Radisson how he can hate someone that does not exist. In the end, Martin (Paul Kwo), a student from China whose father had forbidden him from even talking about God to avoid jeopardizing Martin's brother's chance at overseas study, <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "God's not dead."

5000|$|A {{quotation}} from Swami Vivekananda, a Vedantist, offers {{a good example}} of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.

To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.

Enrique Salvatore, a pool cleaner and the prosecution's main witness, says that he {{was having an affair with}} Brooke and that they were planning to run off with her husband's money.
