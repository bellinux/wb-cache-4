5|$|Since {{workers are}} {{required}} {{to live with their}} employers, they are vulnerable to working long hours; according to Amnesty International and welfare groups, <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> routinely work 16 to 18 hours a day and have no escape from abuse.|$|E
5|$|Ivan {{begins to}} recount {{the story of}} the Denial of Peter, in which Jesus foretells to Saint Peter that he will thrice deny Him before the next crowing of the cock. Peter follows Jesus upon His arrest and joins <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> in the yard {{standing}} around a fire as He is questioned. Thrice the workers suspiciously ask Peter if he knows Jesus and thrice he denies his acquaintance. A cock crows and Peter, realizing what he has done, weeps.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{compounds}} {{by definition}} contain {{at least one}} carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, ferrocene); and transition metal carbene complexes. Many metal carbonyls exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel); <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment was {{particularly}} heavy in Britain's traditional staple export industries—coal mining, shipbuilding, {{iron and steel}} and textiles—all of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of these industries {{in the north of}} England, in Scotland and in Wales, the percentage of unemployed persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of these industries helped to create pockets of long-term unemployment outside the normal cyclical variations; <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> had no work for years.|$|E
5|$|A new tyrannosaurid {{specimen}} (OMNH 10131), including skull fragments, {{ribs and}} parts of the hindlimb, was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Many later authors have reassigned this specimen, along with a few others from New Mexico, to yet another unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. However, research published in 2010 showed that this species, from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation, is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid, and was classified in the genus Bistahieversor. There is currently disagreement over the age of the Kirtland Formation, with <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> claiming a late Campanian age, while others suggest a younger age in the early Maastrichtian stage.|$|E

5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E
5|$|Rescue {{workers at}} the World Trade Center site began to {{discover}} body fragments from Flight11 victims {{within days of the}} attack. <b>Some</b> <b>workers</b> found bodies strapped to airplane seats and discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands bound, suggesting the hijackers might have used plastic handcuffs. Within a year, medical examiners had identified the remains of 33victims who had been on board Flight11. They identified two other Flight11 victims, including purser Karen Martin, in 2006, while other unrelated body fragments were discovered near Ground Zero around the same time. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E
5|$|The SS {{established}} its own symbolism, rituals, customs, {{ranks and}} uniforms to set itself {{apart from other}} organizations. Before 1929, the SS wore the same brown uniform as the SA, {{with the addition of}} a black tie and a black cap with a Totenkopf (death's head) skull and bones symbol, moving to an all-black uniform in 1932. In 1935, the SS combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey for everyday wear. The SS also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with camouflage patterns. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> being prisoners of war performing forced labor. Many were produced in concentration camps.|$|E

5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2016 {{report by}} Amnesty International, palm oil {{provider}} Wilmar International, the world's biggest palm oil grower in 2016 and supplier {{of raw materials}} to Procter & Gamble, profited from 8 to 14-year-old child labor and forced labor. <b>Some</b> <b>workers</b> were extorted, threatened, or not paid for work. <b>Some</b> <b>workers</b> also suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Labor representatives {{believed}} that wage controls were particularly unfair to <b>some</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>workers</b> had received very high wage increases in 1950 {{prior to the}} imposition of wage controls, while others had yet to negotiate contracts or receive wage increases. Labor representatives demanded a 12 percent wage increase for workers {{who had not yet}} negotiated contracts under the wage stabilization policy, but the public and corporate members of the board held to a 10 percent increase.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic competitive model of mismatch. Workers and jobs are {{randomly assigned to}} labor markets. Each labor market clears at each instant but some labor markets have more workers than jobs, hence unemployment, and some have more jobs than workers, hence vacancies. As workers and jobs move between labor markets, <b>some</b> unemployed <b>workers</b> find vacant jobs, <b>some</b> employed <b>workers</b> lose or leave their job and become unemployed, and <b>some</b> employed <b>workers</b> move to other jobs. The model is quantitatively consistent with two central features of labor markets over the business cycle, the Beveridge curve and the matching function. It can also address a variety of labor market phenomena, including duration dependence in the job finding probability, employer-to-employer transitions, and job creation and destruction...|$|R

25|$|The {{hand tool}} form of router is the {{original}} form. It is a specialized type of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate (gaining it the nickname old woman's tooth). Today the power tool form of router, with an electric-motor-driven spindle, is the more common form, and the hand tool is now often called a router plane. Although the hand tool has a few advantages over the power tool and retains favour with <b>some</b> <b>workers,</b> it has been mostly replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. <b>Some</b> <b>workers</b> consider {{it to be the}} single most versatile woodworking power tool. Becoming more popular is the use of a CNC wood router, which implements the advantages of CNC (Computer Numerical Control).|$|E
25|$|While {{globalization}} has radically increased incomes {{and economic growth}} in developing countries and lowered consumer prices in developed countries, it also changes the power balance between developing and developed countries and affects the culture of each affected country. And the shifting location of goods production has caused many jobs to cross borders, requiring <b>some</b> <b>workers</b> in developed countries to change careers.|$|E
