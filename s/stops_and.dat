The disproportionate number of <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> searches is partly {{accounted for by the}} fact that 54 percent of the black population in England and Wales live in London, where <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> searches are more common for all ethnic groups. In some police-force areas, there were more <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> searches per head of population of white people than of black people.

40|$|In {{numerous}} countries <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search {{powers are}} an open sore upon police-community relations, {{one which is}} increasingly being challenged through the courts. In the USA the discriminatory practices associated with <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search powers led to the coining of terms such as “driving while black” (more recently joined by “flying while brown”). In 2013, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held, inter alia, that the City of New York was liable for their indifference towards the New York City Police Department’s widespread practice of <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> frisk which violated the fourth and fourteen amendments of the Constitution. In England <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search practices were a commonly cited factors in the Tottenham riots <b>and</b> a <b>stop,</b> search <b>and</b> arrest power was the catalyst for the Brixton riots.

40|$|My thesis {{will seek}} to provide an {{overview}} of the relevant arguments that comprise the <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> frisk debate before applying independent research to a more specific research question.

The subsequent section is a literature review that summarizes the scholarship that has sought to answer the following two research questions: 1) is <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> frisk an effective law enforcement tactic? 2) has <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> frisk been implemented fairly in respect to constitutional and minority rights? Following the literature review is a brief research design section that introduces a new research question, case studies, and methodology. The final sections offer an in depth description <b>and</b> analysis of <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> frisk implementation in New York City during two case studies, 1994 - 2001 and 2001 - 2013.

5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E

[...] Its primary target is addressing the significant ethnic dis-proportionality in the use of <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search; however, it also aims to review the use of powers which do not require reasonable suspicion to order a <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> search such as section 60 and to ensure effective monitoring and accountability are employed in conjunction with <b>Stop</b> <b>and</b> Search powers. It also aims to promote more effective methods of policing that {{do not have the same}} impact upon civil liberties and community relations.|$|R
