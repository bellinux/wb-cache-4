5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{come in two}} colors: <b>solid</b> <b>black,</b> and {{a pattern}} called pepper and salt, where banded hairs {{of black and white}} hairs cover the body, giving it the {{appearance}} of having been peppered and salted.|$|E
5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's {{plastron}} (ventral shell) is yellowish in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes speckled with yellowish spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to <b>solid</b> <b>black.</b> The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation in color vibrancy {{have been known to}} occur.|$|E
5|$|They have dense coarse {{coat that}} protects {{them from the}} weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in two color patterns: <b>Solid</b> <b>black,</b> and a color known as pepper and salt, with banded hairs of {{alternating}} white and black, appearing gray hairs at a distance. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.|$|E
50|$|When writing scripts for the story, Yates uses a loose {{scripting}} {{style that}} allows him to make changes as he's creating the artwork. He draws inspiration from anime and cartoons in his open and colorful line art, which contrasts with more common styles that utilize <b>solid</b> <b>blacks.</b> Once the art is finished, he refines the dialogue to remove redundant exposition and enhance humor.|$|R
50|$|Original colors did {{not include}} blue or <b>black.</b> <b>Solid</b> colors <b>black,</b> blue black, black {{with a hint of}} rust brown, red, and fawn. Cream is {{acceptable}} but less desirable. Darker shading or trace mark down the back, different tone of same solid color permissible around shoulder. A distinctive color feature of this breed.|$|R
50|$|Less {{expensive}} PVA panels {{often use}} dithering and FRC, whereas super-PVA (S-PVA) panels all use at least 8 bits per color component {{and do not}} use color simulation methods. S-PVA also largely eliminated off-angle glowing of <b>solid</b> <b>blacks</b> and reduced the off-angle gamma shift. Some high-end Sony BRAVIA LCD TVs offer 10-bit and xvYCC color support, for example, the Bravia X4500 series. S-PVA also offers fast response times using modern RTC technologies.|$|R
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more <b>solid</b> <b>black.</b> The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E

50|$|In late 1968, {{shortly before}} Zap #3 {{was to be}} published, Crumb found Xerox copies of the missing pages from the {{original}} Zap #1, which (according to fellow Zap contributor Victor Moscoso) successfully captured the linework but not the <b>solid</b> <b>blacks.</b> After being re-inked by Crumb, those strips subsequently appeared as Zap #0. Thus Zap #0 became the third in the series (even though it was drawn before #1 in 1967), and Zap #3 the fourth.|$|R
50|$|The fourth layer {{contains}} no regular shapes, but many shard-like <b>solids</b> of <b>black</b> ice with razor sharp edges. The shards fly about in violent motion, {{referred to as}} a bladestorm.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{medium-sized}} dog of square to slightly rectangular build and short coat. The dog has a double coat, a coarse upper {{coat and a}} soft undercoat. The most commonly observed colours are brown, range from dark to reddish-brown, with or without white markings. <b>Solid</b> <b>blacks</b> are rare but some dogs are pied. Shaded coats, brindles, solid white and dalmatian-type spotting are never seen in pure populations. These {{may be a sign}} of mixing with modern breeds as they are only seen in dogs in cities and other sites where non-native dogs have been introduced.|$|R
25|$|Some administrators (NASCAR and IndyCar) do not {{distinguish}} mechanical problems or unsportsmanlike conduct from rules violations and simply use the <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> flag for all violations.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for IGN, Jessica Chobot noted [...] "although focused {{primarily}} {{on the relationship between}} Eimi and Wanibuchi, Beauty is the Beast is a collection of off-kilter love stories, bringing to light all the adventures amongst the students at Seikei Academy in a lighthearted and charming manner." [...] Chobot praised the artwork, [...] "although the lack of <b>solid</b> <b>blacks</b> and overuse of similar toned grays cause the illustrations to look floaty and not solid. However, emotions are well-conveyed through the use of line work." [...] Also, it was listed by IGN as the tenth best shojo manga released in English to 2005.|$|R
50|$|Tuxedo: <b>Solid</b> (usually <b>black)</b> {{with a white}} patch (shirt front) on the chest, {{and white}} on {{some or all of}} the feet (spats.) This pattern is {{sometimes}} called Irish Spotting, Flashy, or Boston.|$|R

25|$|On 21 November 1883, the American Angus Association {{was founded}} in Chicago, Illinois. The first herd book was {{published}} on March 1885. At this time both red and black animals were registered without distinction. However, in 1917 the Association barred the registering of red and other colored animals {{in an effort to}} promote a <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> breed.|$|E
25|$|Chihuahuas come in {{virtually}} any color combination, from solid to marked or splashed, allowing for colors from <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> to solid white, spotted, sabled, or {{a variety of}} other colors and patterns. Colors and patterns can combine and affect each other, resulting in a very high degree of variation. Common colors are fawn, red, cream, chocolate, brown, mixed, white, and black. No color or pattern is considered more valuable than another.|$|E

25|$|But to earn {{a living}} in the {{meantime}} he inquired whether Western Publishing, which had published Pirate Gold, had any need for artists for Donald Duck comic book stories. He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten-page Donald Duck story for the monthly Walt Disney's Comics and Stories. At the publisher's invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks to try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow-up story. This set the pattern for Barks' career in that (with rare exceptions) he provided art (pencil, inking, <b>solid</b> <b>blacks</b> and lettering) and scripting for his stories.|$|R
25|$|One symbol {{described}} in The Urantia Book {{consists of three}} concentric azure circles on a white background. The circles are said to symbolize God's triune nature of Father, Son, and Spirit. When the Creator Son Michael, later incarnated on Earth as Jesus, went to war with Lucifer 200,000 years ago, he used the concentric circles on his banner. Lucifer's emblem was a <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> circle {{in the center of}} a red one.|$|E
25|$|Mantle (in some {{countries}} {{referred to as}} Bostons due to the similar coloration and pattern as a Boston Terrier): The colour is black and white with a <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> blanket extending over the body; black skull with white muzzle; white blaze is optional; whole white collar preferred; a white chest; white on part or whole of forelegs and hind legs; white tipped black tail. A small white marking in the black blanket is acceptable, as is {{a break in the}} white collar.|$|E
25|$|Commerford is {{also known}} for his {{numerous}} tattoos. His first tattoo was a <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> band around his left arm to remember his mother by. He soon had half of a face (a painting by graphic artist Mirko Ilić) tattooed on his back, and various other designs on his arms. In 1993, he began work on an intricate design on his left leg. By 1996 this tattoo covered over 65% of his body (covering his arms, left leg, chest, back, and two swirls on his posterior).|$|E
25|$|Though {{traditionally}} worn {{in white}} and pastels, guayaberas are now available in many <b>solid</b> colors. <b>Black</b> guayaberas, embroidered with colorful flowers and festooned with French cuffs, have for many decades been extremely popular in Mexico and are considered formalwear in some situations.|$|R
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of solid or nearly <b>solid</b> colored <b>black</b> plumage is widespread among avian species. Such phenotypes result mostly from single mutations {{associated with an}} increase of eumelanin deposition. In {{the case of the}} domestic fowl, two genetically different black plumage phenotypes have been described.|$|R
5000|$|Japanese comics author Kentaro Takekuma {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the structure and style of Scott Pilgrim initially did not match the structure and style of Japanese comics, but when he read the battle scenes [...] "it feels very much like a Japanese manga, especially in how you structured the panels. It develops into a very strange, neither American nor Japanese atmosphere." [...] Comics author Koji Aihara added that [...] "I did feel the inspiration from Japanese manga, but it did not strike me as a ripoff of manga style, but a very unique way of expression, I found it a very interesting work. I appreciated you using your own style of expression. Also, I thought your use of <b>solid</b> <b>blacks</b> was very skilled and attractive." ...|$|R
25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the frock coat {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as broadcloth. The standard colour of a frock coat was <b>solid</b> <b>black,</b> but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> flag is used {{to summon}} a driver to the pits. It is usually {{associated}} with a penalty imposed on the driver for disobeying the rules, but may also be used when a car is suffering a mechanical failure, leaking fluid, exhibiting damage such as loose bodywork, loose hood, dragging bumper, or any other damage that could potentially become a hazard to the driver or other competitors. In some cases, the black flag {{may be used to}} call a driver to the pits when their radio is not working.|$|E
25|$|Angus cattle are {{naturally}} polled and <b>solid</b> <b>black</b> or red {{even though the}} udder may be white. The native colour is black, but more recently red colours have emerged. The UK registers both in the same herd book, but in the US they are regarded as two separate breeds– Red Angus and Black Angus. Black Angus {{is the most common}} breed of beef cattle in the US, with 324,266 animals registered in 2005. In 2014, the British Cattle Movement Service named Angus the UK's most popular native beef breed, and the second most popular beef breed overall.|$|E
