50|$|The {{driving gear}} is a {{rotating}} rod spring-loaded 7-roll drive. It consists of five wheels, a guide wheel {{at the rear}} and the front drive wheel. Support rollers are not necessary because of the taut and relatively light chain. In off-road driving, the driver must be careful to keep the chain tension constant. Even with a failed torsion bar the M548 is still roadworthy. The power of the motor drives the transfer gearcase, generator and the cooling of the differential/steering gear. The transfer gearcase {{can be used as}} a <b>separating</b> <b>clutch</b> when towing the vehicle and serves to reduce the motor's speed. The power transmission between the drive follows the torque converter with an automatic lock-up clutch.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{vehicles}} must separate clutch {{during the}} shifting process, which {{will lead to}} clutch wear. Parallel hybrid electrical vehicles introduce a motor which {{makes it possible to}} shift without <b>separating</b> <b>clutch.</b> This paper proposes a control algorithm which combines engine control with motor control to realize shifting control without using clutch based on dynamic analysis for every shifting stage, of which the key technologies are accurate motor torque and speed control to make full use of motor rapid response ability. The simulation result shows this can significantly improve driving comfort, shift transient property and extend service life of clutch...|$|E

50|$|As in {{most other}} jacanas, males build the nests, incubate, and brood the chicks. Both these species are polyandrous, {{at least in some}} circumstances. Females lay <b>separate</b> <b>clutches</b> (of four eggs) for up to four mates, each of which tends his clutch alone.|$|R
50|$|A multi-clutch gearbox {{avoids the}} {{difficulties}} of shifting gear by avoiding the need to shift at all. It operates {{as a number of}} separate gearboxes, each one controlled by a <b>separate</b> <b>clutch,</b> interlocked to avoid multiple selection. Selecting a gear is a matter of selecting the appropriate clutch. An advantage of this type is that it's simple to arrange remote operation, as there is no gear shift linkage as such, merely duplication of a clutch linkage.|$|R
50|$|Toyota Motor Corporation's RC {{family is}} a family of 6-speed RWD/4WD {{transmission}}s. The RC transmission uses and output reduction method to achieve a compact construction. A double overdrive (5th and 6th gears) is used. A multi-cone synchromesh mechanism is used for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears to improve shift feel. Similar in some aspects to the older RA transmission, the RC features a <b>separate</b> <b>clutch</b> housing and uses a steel release bearing sleeve to improve serviceability and service life.|$|R
50|$|Temminck's stints have an {{intriguing}} breeding and parental {{care system in}} which males and female parents incubate <b>separate</b> <b>clutches,</b> typically in different locations. Males establish small territories and mate with a female who lays a first clutch of eggs. She then moves to a second territory and mate, and lays a second clutch that she incubates herself. Concurrently, her first male may mate with an incoming second female, who lays her second clutch on his territory. The male thereafter incubates his first mate's first clutch alone.|$|R
25|$|A dual-clutch transmission, (DCT) (sometimes {{referred}} to as a twin-clutch transmission or double-clutch transmission), is a type of automatic transmission or automated automotive transmission. It uses two <b>separate</b> <b>clutches</b> for odd and even gear sets. It can fundamentally be described as two separate manual transmissions with their respective clutches contained within one housing, and working as one unit. Although usually operated in a fully automatic mode, many also have the ability to allow the driver to manually shift gears in semi-automatic mode, albeit still using the transmission's electrohydraulics.|$|R
50|$|The {{eggs are}} pale yellow, about 2 mm in diameter, and {{strongly}} adhesive. During a spawning event, a female can deposit up to 740 eggs in <b>separate</b> <b>clutches</b> of 10 to 300 eggs at a time. The eggs adhere to plants, algal mats, empty mussel shells, sand, or mud at {{sites that are}} reached by water only at high spring tides. Eggs therefore develop while exposed to moist air, and they hatch when the next high spring tides reach them. The eggs cannot hatch in air, nor can they do so in moving water; hatching is initiated {{by a lack of}} oxygen, something that can happen in the boundary layer of relatively still water surrounding the metabolically active egg at high tide, but not in air or in moving water.|$|R
50|$|The lightest {{prototype}} was the FCM 21 at 15.64 tonnes. It {{resembled a}} scaled-down Char 2C, the giant tank {{produced by the}} same company. It was very elongated with a length of 6.5 metres and width of 205 centimetres. A rather large riveted turret with a stroboscopic cupola, adopted from the Char 2C, brought its height to 252 centimetres. Like the superheavy tank it had no real spring system for the twelve small wheels per side. <b>Separate</b> <b>clutches</b> for each snake track enabled it to horizontally point the 75 mm howitzer {{in the middle of}} the hull. It used the same Panhard engine as the FAHM type and its speed was the lowest of all at 17.4 km/h. However, its five hundred litre reservoirs allowed for the best range at 175 kilometres.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1920s the Armstead Snow Motor was developed. When {{this was}} used to convert a Fordson tractor into a screw-propelled vehicle with {{a single pair of}} cylinders. A machine used in the Truckee,CA area was {{referred}} to by locals as the [...] "Snow Devil" [...] and that name has been erroneously attached to these machines, although no known advertising of the time referred to them as such. A film was made to show the capabilities of the vehicle as well as a Chevrolet car fitted with an Armstead Snow Motor. The film clearly shows that the vehicle copes well in snow. Steering was effected by having each cylinder receive power from a <b>separate</b> <b>clutch</b> which, depending on the position of the steering gear, engages and disengages; this results in a vehicle that is relatively maneuverable. The promotional film shows the Armstead snow motor hauling 20 tons of logs.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} the option of a {{semi-automatic}} transmission - in effect a manual-selection transmission coupled to dry clutch that engaged and disengaged by touching the gearshift - beginning in 1957 with an electromagnetically operated Ferlec <b>clutch</b> and no <b>separate</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal - similar to Volkswagen's Autostick. Beginning in 1963, the Dauphine could be had with three-speed transmission with electro-mechanical control, developed by Jaeger, which functioned as a fully automatic transmission. Renault's [...] "automatic transmission" [...] was controlled by five dash-mounted buttons: R N D 2 1. A Renault advertisement at the time said [...] "out went the stick, in went the pushbuttons - and in stayed the zip, the fun, the economy (35-40 miles a gallon isn't unusual). That's because {{the only difference between}} our shift and shiftless cars is this: an electronic control unit on our pushbutton model shifts the gears for you, automatically." ...|$|R
50|$|All {{configurations}} of the Rhino use a constantly variable transmission (CVT) design with a subtransmission assembly providing two forward gear selections (high and low range), a reverse gear, and a neutral position. Yamaha's unique CVT design differed from most other CVT designs {{at the time}} in that the Ultramatic <b>separated</b> the <b>clutch</b> and drive functions from each other. This design allows the Rhino (and all Yamaha Ultramatic ATVs) to eliminate the problem of belt failure due to excessive slipping.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Psychology: Academic Research, 2013 Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an {{important}} vertebrate model for neuroscience research. Much is known about zebrafish development and neuroanatomy, but less is known about how specific their behavior is affected by cell-type specific ablations which is important for understanding the function of their neural circuitry. Behavioral analysis of the sensorimotor behavior of zebrafish following cell-specific ablations addresses this gap. This study investigated proprioceptive function of the lateral line, {{one of the major}} sources of sensory input from the trunk, in larval zebrafish. Proprioception is a key mechanism for coordinating motor behaviors in response to self-generated cues. The study investigated the effect of removing the lateral line sensory input on the swimming behavior of larval zebrafish. An established method for evoking reflexive motor behavior in zebrafish, the Optomotor Response (OMR), was used to quantify swimming ability. Lateral line mechanosensory hair cells were ablated by bath application of neomycin. The experiments were replicated in two <b>separate</b> <b>clutches</b> of zebrafish larvae, raised to ages 11 - 12 dpf (days post-fertilization). Clutch 1 (n = 47) did not show an effect on swim distance (OMR gain) or speed from the lateral line ablation, whereas Clutch 2 (n = 27) did. This {{may be due to the}} larvae compensating for the lack of neuromast sensory input with other trunk sensory input, such as from the Dorsal Root Ganglion sensory neurons...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological Sciences. Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 50 - 54) Differential {{effects on}} {{behavior of a}} focal tadpole subjected either to the absence or presence of a predator cue were examined when the focal animal was {{in the presence of}} conspecific tadpoles differing in relatedness and familiarity. Tadpoles of the South African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) were reared in full-sibling and mixed sibling groups in order to test an individual tadpole’s response to a predator cue while in the social context of a centralized tadpole group that varied in the degree of relatedness and also familiarity. Three different social contexts examined were as follows: 1) focal tadpole both related and familiar (RF) to a centralized tadpole group of 5 individuals from the same clutch and rearing tank; 2) focal tadpole tested with a mixed-related and familiar (MRF) centralized group of tadpoles from four <b>separate</b> <b>clutches</b> but the same rearing tank; and 3) focal animal unrelated and unfamiliar (URUF) with a group of centralized tadpoles from different <b>separate</b> <b>clutches</b> and rearing tanks. BIOBSERVE Viewer 2 software allowed a variety of behavioral variables (i. e., velocity, track length, activity, and duration in distinct test arena zones) to be simultaneously filmed and quantitatively recorded for each focal animal. The focal animal was given both visual and olfactory, although not physical, contact with the centralized animals. Focal animal behavior was filmed for 10 minutes, either with or without a conspecific alarm cue present in the test arena. Mean and summary behaviors were calculated for each focal tadpole at 20 s intervals for each minute of the test. The tadpoles in the absence of cue showed greater differences in mean behaviors among test groups {{toward the end of the}} ten minute filming period; those in the presence of the cue exhibited a greater number of significant differences in mean values among test groups in the initial part of the films. In the presence of predator cue, test groups responded in a manner that would support the hypothesis of protecting more closely related individuals from the threat of predation and thus increasing inclusive fitness; while in the presence of cue, URUF focal tadpoles tended to expend more time and activity near conspecifics while MRF and RF exhibited behaviors indicating a distancing from center animals. Theoretical expectations for a particular behavior need to be evaluated in the context of the environmental and social conditions. That URUF animals go to the center more in the presence of the cue compared to RF animals suggests that anti-predator strategies are not just a simple response, but may adaptively vary dependent on background conditions. The results of this study support the conclusions that 1) X. laevis tadpoles do respond behaviorally to a conspecific predator cue, 2) the response of the tadpole varies dependent on the potential social interactions available during the predator threat, and 3) these tadpoles behave in manner that can be explained as showing more “altruism” towards related individuals...|$|R
40|$|This study {{tests the}} role of visual {{barriers}} and water depth on levels of agonistic behaviour and growth in hatchling Crocodylus porosus within the first 3 weeks of life. Ninety-six individuals from four <b>separate</b> <b>clutches</b> hatched over 2 days were divided across three treatments containing two groups with 16 individuals each: shallow water with no visual barrier (SW), shallow water with visual barriers (VB), and deep water with no visual barrier (DW). Body mass (BM, g) was measured at introduction and after 21 days, and {{was used as an}} index of growth. Behaviour was described and quantified in the night (17 : 00 – 08 : 00 h), when there is an innate peak in behavioural interactions, for three consecutive nights on two occasions (days 9 – 11 and 18 – 20 post-hatch). Visual barriers in open shallow water (VB: mean 0. 7 interactions/night) nearly eliminated agonistic behaviour relative to SW (mean 10. 8 interactions/night; P < 0. 05). DW did not reduce the frequency of agonistic interactions relative to SW, but did affect the outcome of interactions (P < 0. 05), with both individuals swimming off slowly. The distribution of hatchling growth after 21 days was highly bimodal regardless of treatment, with a group of slow growing (− 3. 6 to < 6 g change in BM) and fast growing hatchlings (6 – 15 g increase in BM). Although this made statistical comparisons difficult, there was no clear effect of any treatment (P < 0. 05) on mean growth rates. The {{results of this study suggest}} that there may be utility in providing hatchling and juvenile C. porosus in captivity with a more complex raising environment in order to reduce negative social interactions, but it is not clear whether this improves growth and survival...|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the advent}} of nuclear marine propulsion, most 20th-century {{submarines}} used batteries for running underwater and gasoline (petrol) or diesel engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline, but this quickly gave way to kerosene (paraffin), then diesel, because of reduced flammability. Diesel-electric became the standard means of propulsion. The diesel or gasoline engine and the electric motor, <b>separated</b> by <b>clutches,</b> were initially on the same shaft driving the propeller. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the submarine dived, so that the motor could drive the propeller. The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called [...] "group down" [...] and [...] "group up", respectively).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Mountain Quail (Oreortyx pictus) {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{in many areas}} of the western Great Basin during the past century. Yet the life history of this species is little known. From 1997 to 2000, I studied radio-marked Mountain Quail in Hell's Canyon in northeastern Oregon, in the Cascade Mountains of southwestern Oregon, and a translocated sample of quail captured in the Cascades and released in Hell's Canyon. I monitored 252 radio-marked quail to determine reproductive characteristics, survival rates, habitat associations, and diets. Mountain Quail employed 2 strategies in selecting breeding sites, they remained in winter ranges to breed or migrated 1. 5 - 30 km to new breeding ranges. Of 34 nests found in northeastern Oregon most were associated with coniferous forests and understories dominated by snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) and mallow ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus). In southwestern Oregon, nests (n = 23) were generally located in early-seral (shrub-sapling) vegetation. Shrub height, shrub density, and canopy closure were greater at nest sites than at random plots. Nearly 50 % of the nests were incubated exclusively by males. In addition to incubation, males appeared to be nearly full partners in brood rearing, and males had similar clutch and brood sizes and earlier hatch dates than females. I observed 6 females that produced 2 simultaneous clutches; males and females of each pair incubated <b>separate</b> <b>clutches.</b> Nest attendance patterns were similar for males and females, but quail in Hell's Canyon were on nests longer before absences, and quail in the Cascade Mountains were more frequently absent during early morning. Survival rates were similar for native and translocated quail in Hell's Canyon and the Cascades, but males had higher survival rates than females. Mountain Quail in Hell's Canyon were mostly located in plant communities found on moderate to steep slopes, with an overstory dominated by conifers {Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesi) and ponderosas pine (Pinus ponderosa) }, and understories dominated by snowberry, mallow ninebark, or dogwood (Cornus spp.). In southwestern Oregon, most Mountain Quail observations were in early-seral, successional shrub/sapling stands. In the Cascades during the fall and winter Mountain Quail used many different food resources, but their diets were composed primarily of legumes...|$|R
50|$|For 1914 a {{completely}} new and more coventional light car was shown at the 1913 London Motor Show with a four-cylinder 1130 cc engine made by Turner but this was soon replaced by a 1286 cc water cooled side valve engine made by themselves. The engine was designed by W L Adams of the Laxtonia Engineering Works of Peterborough who also designed a World War I aero engine. The car had semi elliptic leraf springs, rear wheel only brakes and a wheelbase of 7 feet 9 inches (2362mm) and a track of 3 feet 9 inches (1143mm). Drive was to the rear axle through a cone <b>clutch,</b> <b>separate</b> three speed gearbox and torque tube.|$|R
50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use <b>separate</b> dog <b>clutches</b> instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog clutch, that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages.|$|R

In normal use only one is engaged so that turning is easier. The machines are extremely robust and many from the 1950s are still in regular use.

5000|$|The classic farm tractor is {{a simple}} open vehicle, with two very large driving wheels on an axle below and {{slightly}} behind a single seat (the seat and steering wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine {{in front of the}} driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for reasons of operator safety and comfort. In some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the [...] "Caterpillar" [...] or [...] "crawler" [...] type of tracked tractor became popular in the 1930s, due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and <b>separate</b> track <b>clutches</b> operated by levers rather than a steering wheel.Four-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard [...] "two large, two small" [...] configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the trailing unit is not steered separately.In the early 21st century, articulated or nonarticulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the replacement of wheels or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.|$|R
5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. <b>Separate</b> brake and <b>clutch</b> master cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|R

40|$|Most insects employ non-caring {{strategies}} to safeguard their eggs and offspring from predation. Parental care behaviour is extremely rare in insects, {{but has been}} described in several insect groups {{and particularly in the}} Hemiptera. Given that such behaviour is considered an evolutionary precursor to more complex forms of insect sociality, investigating the dynamics of parental care may inform our understanding of social evolution. In this paper, we describe the oviposition and maternal care behaviour of the egg-guarding cotton or hibiscus harlequin bug Tectocoris diophthalmus (Thunberg, 1783) in the field. We also report the results of experimental manipulations designed to test for egg discrimination mechanisms in this species. Our observations indicate that females lay about 100 eggs in a cylindrical cluster around a branch or leaf petiole. Maternal care is limited to egg straddling and defensive postures and behaviours. These were only displayed when walking invertebrate predators approached the egg clutch; mothers were observed to react to the presence of parasitoid wasps on their clutches. Protective behaviours are only displayed by guarding females and are possibly triggered by oviposition, but will cease permanently if females are <b>separated</b> from their <b>clutch</b> {{for more than a few}} minutes. We found no evidence for clutch discrimination, as females guarded their own clutch as readily as unrelated eggs until hatching.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} female spotted halibut, Verasper variegutus, was examined from 19 specimens sampled in Tachibana Bay, Nagasaki Prefecture during 27 December 1997 to 30 January 1998. The maturity {{stages of the}} ovaries were categorized into three classes based on the histological characteristics and the size-frequency distribution of oocytcs; pre-spawning, spawning and post-spawning. The occurrence rates of the different maturity stages of ovaries during the collection period suggested that the spawning season of spotted halibut in Tachibana Bay extends from late December to early February. Developing oocyte {{in the course of}} vitellogenesis formed a single <b>clutch</b> <b>separated</b> from the pre-vitellogenic oocyte group, which resulted in showing two peaks isolated each other in the size-frequency distribution of oocytes. After the completion of vitellognesis in all oocytcs of the advanced clutch, final oocyte maturation and following ovulalion occurred in a part of oocytes of the clutch. The number of oocytes of the advanced clutch gradually decreased during the spawning season due to serially occurring ovulalion. The ovaries after spawning contained only pre-vitellogenic oocytes scattered among the degenerating postovulatory follicles. Total fecundity (TF) in five fish with the ovaries at the prc-spawning stage was related to total length (TL, mm) as TF= 7. 45 ・ 10 - 6 TL 4. 08 (341 ≦TL≦ 488). 長崎県橘湾で 1997 年 12 月～ 1998 年 1 月に漁獲されたホシガレイの雌親魚 19 尾を用いて, 卵の発達動態を中心とした成熟生態について調査した. 組織学的特徴および卵径頻度分布こ基づき, 卵巣の成熟段階を産卵直前期, 産卵期および産卵終了期の 3 期に区分した. これらの卵巣の出現状況から, 橘湾における本種の産卵期は, 12 月下旬から 2 月上旬であると推定された. 本種の卵の発達様式は, 周辺仁期の卵から一部の卵群が発達する卵群同期発達型に属し, 産卵様式は複数回に分けて成熟・排卵される分割産卵型であると考えられた. また, 総産卵数（TF）と全長（TL in mm) との関係は, TF= 7. 45 ・ 10 - 6 TL 408 （ 341 ≦TL≦ 488 ）の式で表され, 平均全長 427 mmの個体における総産卵数ほ約 45 万粒であった...|$|R
