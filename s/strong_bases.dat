5|$|Many other lithium {{compounds}} {{are used}} as reagents to prepare organic compounds. Some popular compounds include lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), lithium triethylborohydride, n-Butyllithium and tert-butyllithium are commonly used as extremely <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> called superbase.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as <b>strong</b> <b>bases.</b> In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|Organolithium {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used {{in the production of}} polymer and fine-chemicals. In the polymer industry, which is the dominant consumer of these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators. in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins. For the production of fine chemicals, organolithium compounds function as <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides.|$|E
50|$|A <b>strong</b> <b>base</b> is {{one that}} is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For example, sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is a <b>strong</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R
50|$|NaOH (s) (sodium hydroxide) is a <b>stronger</b> <b>base</b> than (CH3CH2)2NH (l) (diethylamine) {{which is}} a <b>stronger</b> <b>base</b> than NH3 (g) (ammonia). As the bases get weaker, the smaller the Kb values become.|$|R
50|$|Imidazolate (C3H3N) is the {{conjugate}} base of imidazole. It is a nucleophile and a <b>strong</b> <b>base.</b> The free anion has C2v symmetry. Imidazole has a pKa of 14.05, so the deprotonation of imidazole (C3H3N2H) requires a <b>strong</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E
25|$|In related reactions, 1,2-dibromocompounds are debrominated by {{zinc dust}} to give alkenes and geminal dihalides can react with <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> to give carbenes.|$|E
25|$|Alcohols {{behave as}} weak acids, {{undergoing}} deprotonation, but <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> are required. The deprotonation reaction {{to produce an}} alkoxide salt is performed with a strong base such as sodium hydride or sodium metal.|$|E

50|$|Sodium {{ethoxide}} is a <b>strong</b> <b>base,</b> and {{is therefore}} corrosive.|$|R
25|$|A weakly basic solvent {{has less}} {{tendency}} than a strongly basic one {{to accept a}} proton. Similarly a weak acid has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a weak acid such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> for protons. This is called the leveling effect. <b>Strong</b> <b>bases</b> are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide {{acts as a}} Lux-Flood acid, {{being able}} to react with bases under certain conditions. As it does not contain any hydrogen, it cannot act as a Brønsted–Lowry acid. While not soluble in water, some <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> will react with glass {{and have to be}} stored in plastic bottles as a result.|$|E
25|$|IUPAC {{recommended}} pKa {{values for}} this equilibrium {{in aqueous solution}} at 25°C are 8.99±0.04 (I= 0), 8.83±0.02 (I= 0.1M NaClO4) and 9.00±0.03 (I= 1.0M NaClO4; I= Ionic strength). Values for mixed solvents are available. Very <b>strong</b> <b>bases,</b> such as organolithium compounds, will deprotonate acetylacetone twice. The resulting dilithio species can then be alkylated at C-1.|$|E

25|$|Alcohols, like water, {{can show}} either acidic or basic {{properties}} at the -OH group. With a pKa of around 16-19, they are, in general, slightly weaker acids than water, {{but they are}} still able to react with <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> such as sodium hydride or reactive metals such as sodium. The salts that result are called alkoxides, with the general formula RO− M+.|$|E
25|$|Analogous to benzene, {{nucleophilic}} substitutions to pyridine {{can result}} {{in the formation of}} pyridyne intermediates as heteroaryne. For this purpose, pyridine derivatives can be eliminated with good leaving groups using <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> such as sodium and potassium tert-butoxide. The subsequent addition of a nucleophile to the triple bond has low selectivity, and the result is a mixture of the two possible adducts.|$|E
25|$|Most LDPE, MDPE, and HDPE grades have {{excellent}} chemical resistance, meaning {{they are not}} attacked by strong acids or <b>strong</b> <b>bases,</b> and are resistant to gentle oxidants and reducing agents. Crystalline samples do not dissolve at room temperature. Polyethylene (other than cross-linked polyethylene) usually can be dissolved at elevated temperatures in aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene, or in chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethane or trichlorobenzene.|$|E

25|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>bases</b> (e.g. sodium hydroxide), strong oxidizers (e.g. perchloric acid), {{and certain}} metals (e.g. aluminum). Violent {{reactions}} and splattering of dangerous chemicals can occur upon mixing H3PO4 {{with a strong}} base. There is {{an increased risk of}} fire or causing an explosion from adding strong oxidizers to phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid will attack many metals and drive the formation of highly flammable and potentially explosive hydrogen gas. If flammable combustion occurs, toxic fumes of phosphorus oxides will form.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{monoxide}} anion (LiO−) is a superbase {{existing in}} the solution state in an aprotic solvent. It was the world's strongest known base until 2008, when Orthodiethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion and Para-diethynylbenzene dianion became the world's strongest known bases. Orthodiethynylbenzene dianion {{is the strongest}} base, followed by Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion and Para-diethynylbenzene dianion. <b>Strong</b> <b>bases</b> like lithium monoxide anion (LiO−) is made in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The deprotonation agent used {{in the creation of}} Lithium monoxide anion is lithium diisopropylamide. The methyl anion CH3− was the strongest known base before lithium monoxide anion was discovered.|$|E
25|$|The N–H {{center has}} a pKa of 21 in DMSO, so that very <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> such as sodium hydride or n-butyl lithium and water-free {{conditions}} {{are required for}} complete deprotonation. The resulting organometalic derivatives can react in two ways. The more ionic salts such as the sodium or potassium compounds tend to react with electrophiles at nitrogen-1, whereas the more covalent magnesium compounds (indole Grignard reagents) and (especially) zinc complexes tend to react at carbon 3 (see figure below). In analogous fashion, polar aprotic solvents such as DMF and DMSO tend to favour attack at the nitrogen, whereas nonpolar solvents such as toluene favour C3 attack.|$|E

25|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>bases</b> attack aluminium. Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{reacts with}} aluminium {{and water to}} release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces hydrogen gas and sodium aluminate. In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction {{can be useful in}} etching, removing anodizing, or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further passivation such as anodizing or alodining the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.|$|E
25|$|Against ARVN opponents, PAVN {{had greater}} success. In the ARVN Lam Son {{operation}} into Laos, ARVN troops were inserted by helicopter, covered by US airmobile, road advance operations and massive aerial firepower. The operation met heavy resistance, including intense antiaircraft fire. ARVN air insertions {{took them to}} the outskirts of Tchepone, but numerous helicopters were shot down or damaged. PAVN flanking tactics and ambushes also mauled the ARVN infantry battalions. US/ARVN reports claimed some 13,000 PAVN deaths and destruction of tons of material, but the ARVN was forced to withdraw, a maneuver that turned into a humiliating rout, salvaged only by unrelenting American airpower. Some 105 US helicopters were lost and an additional 615 damaged. The communist base area at Tchepone was back in business within a week. The vital role of sanctuary areas which could be developed in depth into <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> was again illustrated.|$|E
25|$|Being {{the capital}} of the Madras Province that covered a vast area of the Deccan region, Chennai {{remained}} the centre of politics in the southern region of India during the British colonial era. After Independence, it remained the centre of political activities of the state of Tamil Nadu. Chennai is the birthplace of the idea of the Indian National Congress, commonly known as the Congress Party. Founded by Indian and British members of the Theosophical Society movement, most notably A.O. Hume, the idea was originally conceived in a private meeting of 17 men after a Theosophical Convention held in the city in December 1884. During the first 50 years of the Indian National Congress, the city played host to its conferences seven times in 1887, 1894, 1898, 1903, 1908, 1914 and 1927, becoming one of the <b>strong</b> <b>bases</b> for the Indian independence movement.
