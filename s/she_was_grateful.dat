Deputy attorney general Reed Richards presumed that the media apathy {{was a result of}} Parsons' choice of lethal injection, which was more broadly adopted in the United States than execution by firing squad, which was unique to Utah. Parsons' court-appointed attorney Greg Sanders said that his client called himself [...] "Utah's forgotten inmate". Ernest's widow Beverley, who attended the execution, said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> for the lack of media scrutiny. Ernest's brother-in-law Jonathan Woods stated, [...] "The world is less for having lost Richard.

I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E

Bob Odenkirk, a former SNL writer, explained, [...] "I could see how it wouldn't work at SNL because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time.

She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career. Later, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> that her SNL time was short because it didn't end up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared on The Larry Sanders Show episode [...] "The New Writer" [...] (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers.
