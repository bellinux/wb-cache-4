5|$|Nearly 80 {{species of}} fish and {{shellfish}} are commercially harvested from seamounts, including spiny lobster (Palinuridae), mackerel (<b>Scombridae</b> and others), red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), tuna (<b>Scombridae),</b> Orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), and perch (Percidae).|$|E
25|$|There are 600â€“800 {{species of}} inshore and pelagic finfish, some 200 species of corals and about 1000 species of shellfish. Fishing mostly targets the family <b>Scombridae,</b> {{particularly}} the skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna {{as well as}} flying fish (Cypselurus spp.).|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{material}} acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Tropical Atlantic Biological (TABL) collection consists of western Atlantic fishes from nearshore shallows to moderate depths, with the families Argentinidae, Atherinidae, Balistidae, Batrachoididae, Belonidae, Bothidae, Branchiostomatidae, Caproidae, Carangidae, Clupeidae, Congridae, Cynoglossidae, Dasyatidae, Engraulididae, Exocoetidae, Fundulidae, Gadidae, Gerreidae, Haemulidae, Hemiramphidae, Lutjanidae, Macrouridae, Monacanthidae, Mugilidae, Ogcocephalidae, Ophichthidae, Ophidiidae, Paralichthyidae, Peristediidae, Priacanthidae, Rajiidae, Sciaenidae, <b>Scombridae,</b> Serranidae, Scorpaenidae, Scyliorhinidae, Soleidae, Sparidae, Sphyraenidae, Stromateidae, Squalidae, Syngnathidae, Synodontidae, Tetraodontidae, and Triglidae most common. These collections have been substantially augmented by the field activities of museum personnel and donations made over the last 20 years. Eastern Atlantic collections from the Gulf of Guinea are available in some abundance. The western Atlantic collections acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Pascagoula laboratory and University of Miami are generally from greater depths and represent some of the museum's most valuable resources. Deepwater anguilliform, salmoniform, stomiiform, aulopiform, myctophiform, and ophidiiform families are particularly well represented. For certain families, i.e. searsiidae, alepocephalidae, these collections may be among the best North American holdings from the western Atlantic region.|$|E
