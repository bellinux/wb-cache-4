Although Aβ42 makes up less than 10% of total AB, it aggregates at much faster rates than Aβ40. Aβ42 is the initial and major component of <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> deposits. While the most prevalent hypothesis for mechanisms of Aβ-mediated [...] "neurotoxicity" [...] is structural damage to the synapse, various mechanisms such as oxidative stress, altered calcium homeostasis, induction of apoptosis, structural damage, chronic inflammation and neuronal formation of amyloid has been proposed. Observation of AB42/AB40 ratio has been a promising biomarker for AD. However, as AB42 fails to be a reliable biomarker in plasma, attention was drawn for alternative biomarkers.|$|E

40|$|Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (HSPGs) {{have been}} suggested {{to play an important}} role in the formation and persistence of <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> and neurofibrillary tangles in dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT). We performed a comparative immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of the HSPGs agrin, perlecan, glypican- 1, and syndecans 1 – 3 in the lesions of DAT brain neocortex and hippocampus. Using a panel of specific antibodies directed against the protein backbone of the various HSPG species and against the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side-chains, we demonstrated the following. The basement membrane-associated HSPG, agrin, is widely expressed in <b>senile</b> <b>plaques,</b> neurofibrillary tangles and cerebral blood vessels, whereas the expression of the other basement membrane-associated HSPG, perlecan, is lacking in <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> and neurofibrillary tangles and is restricted to the cerebral vasculature. Glypican and three different syndecans, all cell membrane-associated HSPG species, are also expressed in <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> and neurofibrillary tangles, albeit at a lower frequency than agrin. Heparan sulfate GAG side chains are also associated with both <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> and neurofibrillary tangles. Our results suggest that glycosaminoglycan side chains of the HSPGs agrin, syndecan, and glypican, but not perlecan, may play an important role in the formation of both <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, we speculate that agrin, because it contains nine protease-inhibiting domains, may protect the protein aggregates in <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> and neurofibrillary tangles against extracellular proteolytic degradation, leading to the persistence of these deposits...|$|R
5000|$|Senile plaques (also {{known as}} neuritic plaques) are {{extracellular}} deposits of amyloid beta in the grey {{matter of the}} brain.

Abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. The plaques are variable in shape and size, but are on average 50 µm in size. [...] In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides.

40|$|The {{formation}} of beta-amyloid in {{the brains of}} individuals with Alzheimer disease requires the proteolytic cleavage of a membrane-associated precursor protein. The proteases that {{may be involved in}} this process have not yet been identified. Cathepsins are normally intracellular proteolytic enzymes associated with lysosomes; however, when sections from Alzheimer brains were stained by antisera to cathepsin D and cathepsin B, high levels of immunoreactivity were also detected in <b>senile</b> <b>plaques.</b> Extracellular sites of cathepsin immunoreactivity were not seen in control brains from age-matched individuals without neurologic disease or from patients with Huntington disease or Parkinson disease. In situ enzyme histochemistry of cathepsin D and cathepsin B on sections of neocortex using synthetic peptides and protein substrates showed that <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> contained the highest levels of enzymatically active cathepsin. At the ultrastructural level, cathepsin immunoreactivity in <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> was localized principally to lysosomal dense bodies and lipofuscin granules, which were extracellular.

Two variants of collagen XVIII with both different signal peptides and N-terminal domains have been described and are referred to as the short and long form. To investigate the distribution of these variants we performed an immunohistochemical analysis by using specific well-characterized polyclonal antibodies. Anti-long huXVIII, a polyclonal antibody directed against the long variant of collagen XVIII, weakly stained large cortical and leptomeningeal vessels, whereas small cortical vessels remained unstained. Interestingly, all amyloid-laden vessels and classic <b>senile</b> <b>plaques</b> were strongly stained. Anti-all huXVIII, a polyclonal antibody directed against an epitope common to both collagen XVIII variants, intensely stained all types of cerebral blood vessels, cerebral amyloid angiopathy-affected vessels and classic <b>senile</b> <b>plaques.</b> Collagen XVIII expression was absent in neurofibrillary tangles.

40|$|AbstractWe {{analyzed}} an amino-terminal {{modification of}} β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in brain, using anti-Aβ antibodies that distinguish distinct molecular species. Examination of cortical sections from 28 aged {{individuals with a}} wide range in <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> density revealed that a molecular species distinct from the standard Aβ is deposited in the brain in a dominant and differential manner. This modified Aβ peptide (AβN 3 (pE)) starts at the 3 rd amino-terminal residue of the standard Aβ, glutamate, converted to pyroglutamate through intramolecular dehydration. Because plaques composed of AβN 3 (pE) are present in equivalent or greater densities than those composed of standard Aβ bearing the first aminoterminal residue (AβN 1) and because deposition of the former species appears to precede deposition of the latter, as confirmed with specimens from Down's syndrome patients, the processes involved in AβN 3 (pE) production and retention may play an early and critical role in <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> formation...|$|E

The <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> and cerebrovascular amyloid were strongly immunoreactive to anti-beta protein antibody. Her son manifested erratic and bizarre behavior, and was suspected of having committed suicide at age 52. His brain weight and macroscopic observations were normal; however, Bielschowsky's silver impregnation and methenamine silver stains showed numerous argyrophilic plaque-like lesions in the neocortex.

40|$|The still unsolved {{pathogenesis}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{has been}} the subject of extensive speculation. Some years ago, a local acute phase reaction involving production of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and IL- 6 was proposed as the triggering event in AD. Since it has been reported that these cytokines induce expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), we analyzed AD brain tissue cryosections for the presence of ICAM- 1 by immunostaining and for ICAM- 2 expression as a control. In senile plaques a marked diffuse or granular staining for the ICAM- 1 domains 1, 4, and 5 was observed, whereas ICAM- 2 expression was observed in microglial cells.

To perform a quantitative neuropathologic evaluation of several cortical and subcortical areas {{in a series of}} 29 nonagenarians and centenarians. PATIENTS: Ten patients with no cognitive impairment and 19 patients with clinically overt Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Neuropathologic case series. Severity of Alzheimer's disease was assessed with the Mini-Mental State examination and by postmortem chart review using the extended Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. Comparisons between neurofibrillary tangle and <b>senile</b> <b>plaque</b> densities in demented and nondemented individuals were performed by analysis of covariance controlling for age at the time of death. SETTING: Studies were conducted at the Psychiatric and Geriatric hospitals of the University of Geneva School of Medicine in Geneva, Switzerland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlations between clinical diagnosis and severity of Alzheimer's disease and neuropathologic change densities. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in neurofibrillary tangle densities in the superior parietal, superior temporal, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus basalis of Meynert between nondemented and Alzheimer's disease cases.

In the neocortex of nondemented individuals with senile plaques but spared of neurofibrillary pathology, dystrophic neurites in senile plaques showed only APP accumulation. In contrast, in the brains of Alzheimer patients, virtually all APP-immunoreactive neurites also showed immunoreactivity with ubiquitin, tau, and phosphorylated neurofilaments.
