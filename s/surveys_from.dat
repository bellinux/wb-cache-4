5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a 2003 {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Stainless Steel Studios {{and published by}} Activision. Set in a world-historical period that extends from the Middle Ages to World War II, the game tasks players with guiding one of nine rival great civilizations to victory. Customer <b>surveys</b> <b>from</b> Stainless Steel's previous game, Empire Earth, were used {{as a starting point}} for Empires: these inspired the team to take a more minimalist design approach, and to include civilizations without overlapping styles of play. Empires was positively received by critics, who enjoyed its multiplayer component. However, certain reviewers disliked its single-player mode, and opinion clashed on the game's level of uniqueness compared to competitors such as Rise of Nations. The sales of Empires, when combined with those of Empire Earth, totaled 2.5 million units by 2004.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{was born}} in Wadsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to land {{surveyor}} John Fowler and his wife Elizabeth (née Swann). He was educated privately at Whitley Hall near Ecclesfield. He trained under John Towlerton Leather, engineer of the Sheffield waterworks, and with Leather's uncle, George Leather, on the Aire and Calder Navigation and on railway <b>surveys.</b> <b>From</b> 1837 he worked for John Urpeth Rastrick on railway projects including the London and Brighton Railway and the unbuilt West Cumberland and Furness Railway. He then worked again for George Leather as resident engineer on the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway and was appointed engineer to the railway {{when it opened in}} 1841. Fowler initially established a practice as a consulting engineer in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire area, but, a heavy workload led him to move to London in 1844. He {{became a member of the}} Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1847, the year the Institution was founded, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849. On 2 July 1850 he married Elizabeth Broadbent (died 19 November 1901), daughter of J. Boadbent of Manchester. The couple had four sons.|$|E
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. <b>Surveys</b> <b>from</b> 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E

5|$|The Mekong River {{remained}} free of dams until 1993 {{because of}} its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course {{of some of its}} branches. In 2004, the Thai government made an agreement with China to open the river to commercial navigation by destroying rapids, which Thai Baan research had identified as important fish spawning grounds. On the Chinese side, dams were constructed. Living River Siam gathered additional Thai Baan <b>surveys</b> <b>from</b> 146 villagers in Amphoe Chiang Khong, which determined that the blasting of rapids had made the river water unsuitable for drinking and bathing, washed away many local riverside gardens, and decimated the populations of local plants and fish. In response to the 2004 studies, the Thai government suspended blasting on one of the rapids, the Khon Pi Luang.|$|E

5|$|Žirmūnai's southernmost section, {{which lies}} {{on the bank of}} the River Neris {{opposite}} the Vilnius Castle Complex, was part of the settlement known as Žvejai; another part of that settlement is now located within the elderate of Šnipiškės. According to archaeological <b>surveys</b> <b>from</b> 2005, a fishing village may have been located here as early as the late 14th century, giving the area its name, literally, Fishermen; it was later settled by craftsmen and housed the Orthodox Church of St Barbara. During the 16th century, the only glass factory in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was located in the suburb of Žvejai. In 1563, after the construction of the first bridge over the River Neris (at the approximate location of today's Mindaugas Bridge), the suburb of Žvejai became an integral part of the city of Vilnius. During Tsarist rule in the 19th century, the name of Žvejai was superseded by that of Piramont, originating from the small estate of Piramont in the area (now Kalvarijų 1). Piramontskij Alley can be seen in a 1904 map of Vilnius where today's A. Juozapavičiaus Street in the elderate of Šnipiškės is located, close to the boundary of Žirmūnai. The usage of Piramont as a placename gradually became limited to the southern part of Žvejai.|$|E

25|$|Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} {{disorders are}} caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy. <b>Surveys</b> <b>from</b> the United States have found about 10% of pregnant women have drunk alcohol in the last month, and 20% to 30% drank {{at some point during}} the pregnancy. About 4.7% of North American women who are pregnant are alcoholics. The risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as when during pregnancy the alcohol is consumed. Other risk factors include an older mother, smoking, and poor diet. There is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy. While drinking small amounts of alcohol does not cause abnormalities in the face, it may cause behavioral issues. Alcohol crosses the blood brain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing baby. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in the person.|$|E
25|$|Willow Bunch's {{agriculture}} {{generates the}} most profit from grain yields; {{as a result}} there is much less emphasis on livestock. <b>Surveys</b> <b>from</b> the 1930s show high poultry production, and moderate production of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. Sheep production saw a major drop from 1931 to 1936 and never rose again. The 1950s continued these pre-existing trends with low sheep production, high cattle production, and very high poultry production. The trend has since continued unabated, with far more land dedicated to crops than pasture fields. A 2011 census shows no farms dedicated to animals other than beef cattle ranches and animal combination farms. Furthermore, there are no farms dedicated to general apiculture. The small presence of livestock is characteristic of the farming division, however. While areas like Old Post, Waverly and Excel have many farms dedicated to cattle ranching/farming, these municipalities have few other farms dedicated to animal production.|$|E

25|$|By 1985, traffic had {{increased}} {{so much that}} it became clear that by 1988 all international traffic would have to move to Gardermoen. The areas at Hobøl had been freed up, and a government report was launched recommending that a new airport be built at Gardermoen, although an airport at Hurum had also been surveyed. However, the report did not look into the need of the Air Force that was stationed at Gardermoen, and was therefore rejected by the parliament the following year. In 1988, a majority of the government chose Hurum as their preferred location, and Minister of Transport Kjell Borgen withdrew from his position. In 1989, new weather <b>surveys</b> <b>from</b> Hurum showed unfavorable conditions. There were large protests from meteorologists and pilots who stated that the surveys were manipulated. Two government committees were appointed, and both concluded that there were no irregularities in the surveys.|$|E
25|$|Using several {{data sets}} (including {{breeding}} bird <b>surveys</b> <b>from</b> New York and Pennsylvania and moth collections from Maine, Alberta and Saskatchewan) Frank W. Preston (1948) argued that species abundances (when binned logarithmically in a Preston plot) follow a Normal (Gaussian) distribution, {{partly as a}} result of the Central Limit Theorem (Figure 4). This means that the abundance distribution is Lognormal. According to his argument, the right-skew observed in species abundance frequency histograms (including those described by Fisher et al. (1943)) was, in fact, a sampling artifact. Given that species toward the left side of the x-axis are increasingly rare, they may be missed in a random species sample. As the sample size increases however, the likelihood of collecting rare species in a way that accurately represents their abundance also increases, and more of the normal distribution becomes visible. The point at which rare species cease to be sampled has been termed Preston's veil line. As the sample size increases Preston's veil is pushed farther to the left and more of the normal curve becomes visible(Figure 6). Interestingly, Williams' moth data, originally used by Fisher to develop the logseries distribution, became increasingly lognormal as more years of sampling were completed.|$|E
500|$|The region {{near the}} triple {{junction}} experiences high seismicity, {{with more than}} 60 earthquakes of intensity VI (Strong) or greater or magnitudes ≥ 5.5 since 1853.

While the focal mechanism indicated slip on a thrust fault striking N.10°W with a shallow dip of 13° to the east-northeast, the rupture most likely propagated to the west, based on the mainshock location at the southeastern boundary of the aftershock zone. Investigation of more than 1,200 <b>surveys</b> <b>from</b> the North Coast area led to the assignment of an intensity rating of IX (Violent) on the Modified Mercalli scale for the region near Petrolia.|$|E
