40|$|To {{address the}} needs of a {{population}} of users who are also learners, the learner-centered design of software suggests the need to design scaffolding—fadeable supports—into educational tools. This paper describes a particular approach, Guided Learner-Adaptable Scaffolding (GLAS), in which the learner controls the changing and fading of scaffolding, with guidance and support provided by the system. Using this approach, we have developed a tool, TheoryBuilder, that supports learners in building and testing dynamic models of complex systems. We have conducted extensive classroom testing with ninth grade students who used the tool <b>several</b> <b>times</b> throughout <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> An analysis of the data demonstrates the success of the GLAS approach in developing an adaptable tool to support diversity and the development of expertise...|$|R
