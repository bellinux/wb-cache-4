5|$|Feshbach is most {{well known}} for her stint as Tom Cruise's assistant, and for her {{friendship}} with Katie Holmes during the couple's engagement. In this role she traveled with Holmes during publicity for the actresses's film roles, <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> interviews, and responded to questions about Holmes from journalists. Warner Bros. made special accommodations for Feshbach to accompany Holmes during promotion of Batman Begins, and she attended Holmes' wedding to Cruise in Italy in 2006. Feshbach was later a guest of honor at Scientology's Patron Ball, held at the organization's headquarters in Britain. By 2009, Feshbach had become a high-ranking spokesperson for the Scientology organization.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the time, he could not stay in the bar area of the club; between sets, therefore, he went to another room and did some homework. As a teenager, he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. Still in his teens, Flanagan also <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first residence, at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E

5|$|In July 1985, Schwarzkopf {{began an}} 11-month {{assignment}} as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Pentagon. On July 1, 1986, {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant general, and was reassigned to Fort Lewis as commander of I Corps. He held this post for 14 months before returning to the Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in August 1987. In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army's senior member on the Military Staff Committee at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings with representatives from other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> arms reduction talks with leaders from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In June 1957, Plath and Hughes {{moved to}} the United States, and from September, Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater.

Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evening <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).|$|E
5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Johns of Silverchair {{gave the}} {{induction}} speech, which {{was followed by}} the band playing a short but energetic set of two songs which saw the audience giving them a standing ovation. The three guitarists (Tek, Masuak and Dickson) also participated {{in what appeared to be}} an uncharacteristically rehearsed stage move, each holding up their guitars and saluting the drums as the song New Race ascended into auditory chaos. On a side note, Murray Shepherd (ex- The Screaming Tribesmen and current The Hitmen drummer), <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> drums for this occasion, as then-drummer Russell Hopkinson was touring with You Am I.|$|E
25|$|The munitions {{on board}} a Navy cargo ship {{exploded}} while being loaded during World War II, resulting in {{the largest number of}} casualties among African Americans in any one incident during that war. On the evening of July 17, 1944 a massive explosion instantly killed 320 sailors, merchant seamen and civilians working at the pier. The blast was felt 30 miles away. A subsequent refusal by 258 black sailors to load any more ammunition {{was the beginning of the}} Navy's largest-ever mutiny trial in which 50 men were found guilty. Future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> most of the proceedings and declared that he saw a prejudiced court.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 Clark {{began his}} studies in archaeology, {{which was then}} taught {{alongside}} physical anthropology and social anthropology within the university's anthropology department. The department was run by the Disney Professor Ellis Minns—whose ideas influenced Clark—while the archaeology curriculum was largely organised by Miles Burkitt, an unpaid lecturer of private means. Providing himself with a broad-based grounding in archaeology, Clark <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> lectures given by archaeologists like Gertrude Caton Thompson, Dorothy Garrod, Leonard Woolley, and Childe. Although the Cambridge syllabus did not provide opportunities for excavation, Clark assisted the non-professional archaeologist Eliot Curwen during his excavations of the Whitehawk Neolithic causewayed camp near Brighton and then The Trundle, an Iron Age hillfort and Neolithic causewayed enclosure near Chichester. It was at the latter that he befriended two fellow excavators, Stuart Piggott and Charles Philips, who became lifelong friends. He also visited a number of Mortimer Wheeler's excavations, although never worked on them. Clark graduated in 1930 with a first-class honours degree.|$|E

Senior pastor Clementa Pinckney, who {{also served as a}} state senator, was among those killed during the attack. The deceased also included congregation members Susie Jackson, 87; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59; Cynthia Hurd, 54; Rev. Depayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; and Tywanza Sanders, 26. The attack garnered national attention, and sparked a debate on historical racism, Confederate symbolism in Southern states, and gun violence, in part based on Roof's online postings. On July 10, 2015, the Confederate battle flag was removed from the South Carolina State House. A memorial service {{on the campus of the}} College of Charleston was attended by President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Jill Biden, and Speaker of the House John Boehner.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC was a one-of-a-kind {{design and}} was never repeated. The freeze on design in 1943 meant that the {{computer}} design would lack some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the EDVAC, which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a memory unit (the mercury delay line) which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC) which were intended {{to be used as}} an internal memorandum—describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer Herman Goldstine distributed copies of this First Draft to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in {{the construction of a new}} generation of electronic computing machines, including Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and SEAC at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.|$|E
