However, pediatric outcomes and proper prenatal counseling for this anomaly have not yet been truly defined. We performed this study to determine pregnancy and pediatric outcomes of fetuses with <b>septated</b> CH. We searched records for cases with <b>septated</b> CH and collected data for structural abnormalities, karyotype analysis, and pregnancy outcomes. Fetuses born with <b>septated</b> CH were also evaluated for their pediatric outcomes. Sixty-nine fetuses with <b>septated</b> CH were enrolled in the study. Results showed that chromosomal abnormalities were present in 28 fetuses (40. 6 %), and the most common aneuploidy was Turner syndrome (n= 14, 20. 3 %); 16 (23. 2 %) of the remaining cases, in which aneuploidy was not found, had coexistent structural malformations; 25 (36. 2 %) cases had normal karyotype and morphology. The total number of live births and infants with unfavorable neurologic follow-up were 13 (18. 8 %) and 2 (2. 9 %), respectively. <b>Septated</b> CH is associated with poor perinatal outcomes; therefore, karyotype analysis and ultrasonographic anomaly screening should be performed as initial steps, and expectant management should be offered to couples with euploid fetuses that have normal morphology...|$|R

5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either <b>septate</b> or coenocytic. <b>Septate</b> hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E

The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae.

5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also <b>septate</b> (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E

The effect of this specific binding to PBP- 3 on murein synthesis of elongating and synchronously <b>septating</b> cells was investigated in two thermosensitive division mutants, E. coli BUG 6 and E. coli JE 10730, the latter possessing a thermolabile PBP- 3. Synchronous cell division was induced by shifting the cultures from the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C) to 30 degrees C. Both [14 C]diaminopimelic acid incorporation into murein of intact cells and [14 C]N-acetylglucosamine incorporation into murein of cells permeabilized with ether was inhibited by an average of 42 % in <b>septating</b> cells. In filaments growing at the nonpermissive temperature, we detected no inhibition and, frequently, a 10 to 15 % stimulation of murein synthesis. The two drugs, at concentrations used in the above experiments, bound exclusively to PBP- 3 both in elongating and <b>septating</b> intact cells and in ether-treated cells. These results support the hypothesis that PBP- 3 activity is exclusively required for septal murein synthesis...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} rare liveborn {{case with a}} giant, <b>septated,</b> chest wall lymphangioma that {{underwent}} prenatal expectation treatment. Case report: A case of giant fetal chest wall cystic lymphangioma was diagnosed prenatally at 19 weeks gestation. Expectation treatment was performed, carefully after prenatal counseling, ruling out other structural abnormalities. At 38 weeks gestation, ultrasound showed a multilocular, subcutaneous cystic mass of 12. 3  cm ×  9. 2  cm ×  11. 0  cm located on the left chest wall and left upper arm. The tumor was surgically removed 4 days after birth, and no recurrence was observed in the following 18 months. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that a large, <b>septated</b> fetal lymphangioma may still merit prenatal expectation treatment {{if there is no}} evidence for chromosomal and structural abnormality...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{we showed}} that upon {{transfer}} of growing Mycobacterium smegmatis into saline, the bacilli exited the canonical cell division cycle and formed <b>septated</b> multi-nucleoided cells. Under shock starvation (i. e. in saline without any carbon source), differentiation terminated at this stage with internally remodeled Large Resting Cells, LARCs. Whereas under gentle starvation (i. e. in saline with trace amounts of a carbon source), the <b>septated</b> multi-nucleoided bacilli completed cell division and separated into mono-nucleoided Small Resting Cells, SMRCs. This demonstrated that the non-sporulating mycobacteria are in fact capable of forming morphologically differentiated resting cells when exposed to starvation. Depending on the specific starvation conditions they can form two different resting cell types, LARCs or SMRCs, which share a common cellular differentiation pathway. The mRNA encoding the (p) ppGpp synthetase Rel {{was found to be}} transiently upregulated immediately upon starvation under both conditions, suggesting a role for the stringent response factor in both LARC and SMRC development. Here, we disrupted Rel function by generating two types of mutant M. smegmatis strains: a rel nonsense mutant (relE 4 TAG) in which translation is prematurely terminated at codon 4, and a rel deletion mutant (△rel) in which the entire coding sequence was deleted. Both mutants showed identical phenotypes: sparse septum formation, less DNA compaction and failure in formation of both the <b>septated</b> multi-nucleoided LARCs and the small-cell morphotype SMRC under starvation conditions. All phenotypes were rescued through the introduction of a wild-type copy of rel. Therefore, we conclude that loss-of-function mutations in rel block the development of both LARCs and SMRCs by preventing the first morphogenetic step in mycobacterial resting cell development, the formation of <b>septated</b> multi-nucleoided cells. Interestingly, in contrast to Rel’s role in most other bacteria, starvation survival was not affected by loss of rel function. Our results suggest that Rel may play a starvation-induced morphogenetic role in mycobacteria...|$|R
