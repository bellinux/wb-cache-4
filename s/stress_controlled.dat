Analysis of variance with two factors (p 0. 05) between men in the “bad PAL” / “good PAL” groups and in the “yes stress control” / “no stress control” groups.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the electrical properties of a commonly used <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube for medium voltage heat-shrink joints using non-destructive methods in laboratory. The electrical {{properties of the}} tube were determined by use of dielectric spectroscopy while changing the temperature, AC electric field and humidity level. In order to characterize the material, both differential scanning calorimetry and water uptake measurements was performed on samples of <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube. Two similar test objects were used {{in order to obtain}} a higher electric field strength at the same applied AC voltage. A Raychem <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube was shrunk on the outside of a cylindrical shape consisting of two metal electrodes and a PTFE rod separating them. The length of the PTFE rod was 100 mm for Object L, while only 20 mm for Object S providing a higher field strength. Water uptake measurement was performed {{in order to determine the}} <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube s ability to diffuse water. Measurement results imply that the water uptake is dependent of both the degree of shrinkage and the temperature. The highest water content is observed for a virgin <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube kept at 90 ℃, with a concentration of 8 % after 105 days. None on the test samples reached saturation during the experimental work. Differential scanning calorimetry measurement was performed in order to examine if the <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube had any phase transitions changing the electrical properties of the <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube. Samples of <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube were examined in the temperature range of 20 ℃ to 200 ℃. Results indicate that the <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube, independent of the degree of shrinkage, has an endothermic melting transition in the temperature range of 94 ℃ to 114 ℃. Dielectric response measurements show that the thermal transition of the <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube will provide an increased conductivity. This is likely caused by a change from semi-crystalline to amorphous state, releasing trapped charge carriers and providing the material to become more electrical conductive. Dielectric spectroscopy was performed on both test objects in the electric field range from 0. 025 1. 0 kVpeak/mm for Object S and 0. 005 0. 01 kVpeak/mm for Object L. Frequency was varied from 100 Hz to 1 mHz. A temperature dependence was observed for dielectric loss tangent, in addition to large values up to 1000. At higher temperatures, the dielectric loss tangent was observed independent of the electric field. For measurements at 40 ℃, an electric field dependence is observed for field strengths above 0. 5 kVpeak/mm. The results show that the conductivity is dependent of the temperature. After exposed to 150 ℃, the temperature is decreased to 40 ℃ and a new measurement is performed. Hysteresis effect is then observed as the conductivity attains a higher value than before exposed to high temperatures. The conductivity is found independent at the electrical field at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the electrical field dependence is observed for field strengths above 0. 5 kVpeak/mm. Observations made imply that the conductivity is strongly dependent of the humidity level. When performing dielectric response measurement on a wet test object, the conductivity experienced a significant increase from 10 - 11 to 10 - 5 S/m. Wet <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube was dissected after complete dielectric response measurement.

In strain control, the probe is {{displaced}} and the resulting stress of the sample is measured by implementing a force balance transducer, which utilizes different shafts. The advantages of strain control include a better short time response for materials of low viscosity and experiments of stress relaxation are done with relative ease. In <b>stress</b> <b>control,</b> a set {{force is applied to}} the same and several other experimental conditions (temperature, frequency, or time) can be varied. <b>Stress</b> <b>control</b> is typically less expensive than strain control because only one shaft is needed, but this also makes it harder to use. Some advantages of <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> include the fact that the structure of the sample is less likely to be destroyed and longer relaxation times/ longer creep studies can be done with much more ease. Characterizing low viscous materials come at a disadvantage of short time responses that are limited by inertia. <b>Stress</b> and strain <b>control</b> analyzers give about the same results as long as characterization is within the linear region of the polymer in question. However, <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> lends a more realistic response because polymers have a tendency to resist a load.|$|R

Aims: To examine the relative efficacies of a six week cognitive behavioural adult education evening class, a traditional anxiety management group and a waiting list group {{in the treatment of}} anxiety disorders. Method: Individuals with a DSM IV anxiety disorder were randomized to either a cognitive behavioural therapy adult education evening class (<b>Stress</b> <b>Control),</b> anxiety management group treatment or a waiting list control condition. Both active treatments lasted 2 hours per week for 6 weeks in total. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} any of the groups on the main outcome measure. <b>Stress</b> <b>Control</b> and Anxiety Management showed significantly greater mean reductions on the Fear Questionnaire than the Waiting List group post-treatment but this difference was no longer present at one month follow-up.

They were determined by use of time domain dielectric response test while changing the DC electric field, temperature and level of humidity. In {{order to determine the}} physical and mechanical characteristics of the material at different aging stages and conditions, both differential scanning calorimetry and tensile test measurements were performed on <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube samples. Two types of test samples were prepared. For dielectric response tests, Raychem JSCR 42 / 16 <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube was shrunk on a cylindrical rod, consisting of two metal electrodes, separated by a PTFE (Teflon) insulating rod. For differential scanning calorimetry and tensile tests, the <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube was shrunk on a cylindrical PTFE rod only, with the same diameter as for the dielectric response tests without the presence of metal electrodes. Tensile test measurements were performed in order to characterize and compare the mechanical properties of the <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tube material at different aging stages. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were used to estimate aging degree by assessment of thermal resistivity of the material and antioxidants consumption when exposed to high temperatures for a certain period of time. To calculate the conductivity, dielectric response measurements were performed in time domain at different voltage levels up to 20 kV and charging and discharging time duration of 10800 s. They were conducted by placing the test object in a climate chamber in order to examine the influence of temperature and humidity. The measurements were performed on unaged and thermally aged heat shrinkable <b>stress</b> <b>control</b> tubes. The aging process was obtained in heat cabinets at 98 °C dry air, 98 °C wet air and 150 °C dry air conditions. Results from the analysis show that conductivity has not significant dependency of the electric field up to 0. 2 kV/mm at different temperatures, aging degree and humidity. It was revealed that conductivity is more temperature dependent, as a significant increase was observed when the temperature was elevated at higher values. Conductivity was found out to be strongly dependent on humidity, especially when combined with high aging degree. <br/...|$|R
