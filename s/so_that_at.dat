5|$|Rule 184 can be {{understood}} in terms of ballistic annihilation, a system of particles moving both leftwards and rightwards through a one-dimensional medium. When two such particles collide, they annihilate each other, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> each step the number of particles remains unchanged or decreases.|$|E
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|The {{nighttime}} version initially drew {{in up to}} 30 {{million viewers}} a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television. In the 1999–2000 season, it averaged No. 1 in the ratings against all other television shows, with 28,848,000 viewers. In the next season (2000–01), three nights out of the five weekly episodes placed in the top 10. However, the show's ratings began to fall during the 2000–01 season, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of the}} 2001–02 season, the ratings were only a fraction of what they had been one year before, and by season's end, the show was no longer even ranked among the top 20. ABC's reliance on the show's popularity led the network to fall quickly from its former spot as the nation's most watched network.|$|E

25|$|An {{asymptotically}} flat spacetime is a Lorentzian manifold in which, roughly speaking, {{the curvature}} vanishes at large distances from some region, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> large distances, the geometry becomes indistinguishable {{from that of}} Minkowski spacetime.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, lake {{winds were}} {{so strong that}} water levels dropped substantially, {{sometimes}} {{by as much as}} two feet, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> ports such as Toledo, watercraft could not load coal or depart the port.|$|E

25|$|For {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, mechanical {{motion of the}} ions occurs.

As higher the anode structure is roughned as more the capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. Low voltage types with highly roughened anodes display capacitance at 100nbsp&kHz approximately 10 to 20% of the value measured at 100nbsp&Hz.|$|E

The first Sea Hurricane IA kill was an FW 200C Condor, shot down on 2 August 1941.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{memory is}} usually short-term, lasting between {{a few days}} and several months. Newborn infants have had no prior {{exposure}} to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. In utero, maternal IgG is transported directly across the placenta, <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> birth, human babies have high levels of antibodies, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk contains antibodies (mainly IgA) that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{water system}} however {{was far more}} complex than just the {{reservoirs}} and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system {{was designed to be}} harmonious with the structure <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> places there were central drainage canals {{in the center of the}} columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take the water out of roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure.|$|E
