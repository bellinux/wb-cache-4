40|$|No presente trabalho constam os resultados de uma pesquisa que teve como {{principal}} objetivo apresentar uma ideia de como foi a configuraÃÂÃÂo ambiental na regiÃÂo de Guarapuava Ãââ Pr. Este objetivo se fez diante da escassez e necessidade se ter dados mais acurados sobre o paleoambiente da regiÃÂo. Para tal, se utilizou um testemunho sedimentar coletado da Turfa GuarÃÂ, localizada nas porÃÂÃÂes elevadas do reverso da escarpa da EsperanÃÂa, Terceiro Planalto paranaense. Por meio principalmente da anÃÂlise de dados proxy, no caso fitÃÂlitos, em associaÃÂÃÂo com dataÃÂÃÂes 14 C e dados isotÃÂpicos, foi possÃÂvel estabelecer trÃÂs fases paleoambietais, que compreendem desde o Pleistoceno atÃÂ a atualidade. Pode-se dizer que a turfa GuarÃÂ iniciou a formaÃÂÃÂo de seu depÃÂsito hÃÂ 15. 648 anos AP., sob um ambiente de vegetaÃÂÃÂo mais fechada, fortemente marcada por plantas C 3. Em segundo momento a reduÃÂÃÂo na disponibilidade hÃÂdrica, possivelmente favoreceu a introduÃÂÃÂo de vegetaÃÂÃÂo mais aberta (C 4) e permitiu o avanÃÂo do depÃÂsito turfoso pelo maior acÃÂmulo de material. Ao final deste momento se tem nova introduÃÂÃÂo de plantas C 3. Pode-se dizer que esta fase marcou a passagem do Pleistoceno para o Holoceno e perdurou atÃÂ o Holoceno mÃÂdio. A partir deste ponto, temos a terceira fase. Com ambiente praticamente estÃÂvel no que se refere a umidade e temperatura, porÃÂm com nova tendÃÂncia de introduÃÂÃÂo de plantas C 4. Contudo, a regiÃÂo da Turfa GuarÃÂ, mesmo mostrando duas frentes de abertura da vegetaÃÂÃÂo, nunca chegou a ser conformada por vegetaÃÂÃÂo de campo, propriamente dita, e como a base do depÃÂsito ÃÂ marcada por vegetaÃÂao fechada, ÃÂ sugestivo que a regiÃÂo da Turfa GuarÃÂ possa ter sido uma zona de refÃÂgio florestal durante o Plesitoceno tardio. The present work {{presents the}} results of a survey that aimed to present an idea of how the setting was in the area of environmental Guarapuava Ãââ PR. This goal became the face of scarcity and the need to have more accurate data on the paleoenvironment of the region. To this end, we used a testimony collected from <b>sedimentary</b> <b>peat</b> Guara, located on the elevated portions of the reverse slope of Hope, Third Plateau of ParanÃÂ. Primarily through analysis of proxy data in the case phytoliths, in association with dating by 14 C and isotopic data, it was possible to establish three phases paleoambietais, which range from the lower Pleistocene to the present. You could say that peat Guara initiated the formation of your deposit is 15, 648 years BP. In an environment of more closed vegetation, strongly marked by individuals of type C 3. Second time the reduction in water availability, possibly favored the introduction of more open vegetation (C 4) and allowed the peat deposit advance by greater accumulation of material. At the end of this time has been introducing new elements C 3. You could say that this phase marked the passing of the Pleistocene to the Holocene and lasted until the mid Holocene. From this point, we have the third phase. Practically stable in the environment with respect to humidity and temperature, but with the introduction of new trend element C 4. However the region of Peat Guara, even showing two fronts opening of vegetation, was never formed by vegetation field itself, and as the base of the deposit is marked by closed vegetation is suggestive that the region of peat can Guara have been a safe haven during the forest Plesitoceno late...|$|E
30|$|Mangrove {{ecosystems}} are coastal wetlands that {{are dominated by}} woody plants across a gradient of latitudes (30 °N to 37 °S), tidal heights (> 1  m to < 4  m), geomorphologies (oceanic islands to riverine systems), <b>sedimentary</b> environments (<b>peat</b> to alluvial), climates (warm temperate to both arid and wet tropics), and nutrient availabilities (oligotrophic to eutrophic) (Feller et al. 2010). These diverse {{ecosystems are}} critical not only for sustaining biodiversity but also for their direct and indirect benefits for human activity (Feller et al. 2010; Koch et al. 2009; Walters et al. 2008). Brazil has 7, 408  km of coastline, 6, 786  km of which contain mangrove forests. Brazil’s mangroves cover approximately 25, 000  km 2 (Schaeffer-Novelli et al. 200).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIsoprenoid and {{branched}} glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are archaeal and bacterial polar lipids {{increasingly used}} as environmental biomarkers, and are studied {{in a wide}} range of settings: lacustrine and oceanic sediments, water column particulate organic matter, soils, <b>peats,</b> <b>sedimentary</b> rocks and extracts from archaeal and bacterial cultures. In paleoclimatology, for example, typical work on a sediment core of several tens of m consists of several hundreds to more than a thousand HPLC-MS (high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) analyses. The measurements therefore require purification steps from total lipid extracts. We propose an automated procedure for obtaining the GDGT core lipid fraction. We first evaluate both the yield and efficiency of the separation using different cartridges. We then compare the results from automated and ''classical manual'' procedures for a soil and a marine sediment, as well as for a sedimentary paleosequence...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{structural}} {{features of the}} three main humic fractions (humic acid, fulvic acid and humin) from different depths of a peat bog deposit in Mazago´n (Huelva, Southern Spain) were isolated and analysed by flash pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, solid-state 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. Such techniques demonstrate that the various humic fractions were very different {{not only in terms}} of molecular weight but also in their composition and structural characteristics, showing well differentiated patterns in the relative distribution of alkyl, O-alkyl and aromatic moieties in each humic fraction. To a large extent, selectively preserved lignin accumulates in the humic acid (HA) fraction, whereas the fulvic acid (FA) consists of a colloidal carbohydrate with a substantial peptidic moiety and the humin includes the noteworthy concentration of insoluble, macromolecular polyalkyl structures. A diagnostic lignin signature in the resolution-enhanced infrared spectra of the HA points to processes of selective preservation of macromolecular substances derived from vascular plants. In general, the humic fractions were not extensive sources of chemotaxonomic descriptors of previously documented biodiversity changes along the period of the peat deposit formation. This is in harmony with a substantial homogenising effect of diagenetic transformations throughout the whole <b>sedimentary</b> record with <b>peat</b> stratigraphy recording mostly the authigenic processes of bog formation and development. Anthropogenic perturbations may be also responsible for the loss of information in the humic proxy resulting in the lack of an apparent relationship between any particular input and the composition of the humic fractions from the peat bog.

40|$|Mont Cimone is {{the highest}} {{mountain}} of the Northern Apennines mountain system, feature {{that allowed him to}} be in the past until today an important place of cultural identity for indigenous populations. Mont Cimone is located in the "Parco regionale dell'Alto Appennino Modenese" and is an important spot of biodiversity that is protected in the Natura 2000 network. This territory has a rich and diversified floral heritage due to his geographical position between two great phytogeographic regions: Euro-Siberian and Mediterranean region. In the north-western slope of Mt. Cimone, the summital part between 1600 m and 2100 m a. s. l. is characterized by the presence of heathland dominated by Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium gaultherioides and above 1600 m asl. there is a coppice beech forest. At the scale of the northern Apennines, the palaeoecological records (pollen, wood, organic matter, <b>sedimentary)</b> obtained from <b>peat</b> bogs located in the Apennines Ligure (from 800 to 1500 m a. s. l.) (Branch, 2004; Cruise, 1990 a, 1990 b; Cruise et al., 2009) and Tosco-Emiliano, (from 700 to 1800 m a. s. l.) (Bertolani Marchetti et al., 1994; Bertoldi et al., 2007; Lowe et al., 1994 a, 1994 b; Watson, 1996) have reconstructed the history of the vegetal landscape linked to climatic changes since the Tardiglacial. In Italy, few studies concerning the relationship between societies and environment are developed in mountain systems. The archaeological data concern essentially the plain where the archaeological remains are very frequent. The first survey on the Mont Cimone, has revealed the numerous archaeological remains like charcoal platforms located within the beech coppice and pastoral huts situated at the upper part between 1700 m a. s. l. and 2000 m a. s. l. This fieldwork demonstrates that the Cimone landscape is an anthroposylvosystem transformed by societies since a long time. The aim of this PhD research is to develop an interdisciplinary approach based on geography, archaeology, history and palaeoecology methods. Convince by the role of societies {{in the construction of the}} landscape of the Cimone without discarding the role of the climate change, pedoanthracological transect was applied for the first time on this mountain in order to obtain at a more precise spatial scale, the reconstruction of the ligneous palaeolandscape and the history of fire events since a long time. In this context nine soil profiles were sampled at the north-west slope of Mt. Cimone across an altitudinal transect from 1650 m a. s. l. to 2078 m a. s. l. 8 pits are located in the current grassland and one pit is situated at the limit of the actual limit of the beech forest at around 1650 m a. s. l. The presence of charcoals in all the pits suggest the importance of fire events in the history of the Cimone landscape's. The charcoal assemblages show a strong dominance of Ericaceae (1077 - 1153 cal AD) at higher altitudes (above 1700 m a. s. l.) as occurs in the present. The occurrence of forest species charcoals as Fagus and Abies in the current grassland between 1650 m and 1800 m a. s. l., shows that in the past these trees were well above the present treeline. The radiocarbon dating will provide useful data for the interpretation of temporal vegetational dynamics at the scale of the slope. These new information will be useful for a multiproxy interpretation to refine the knowledge of the vegetation and fire history of this area...|$|R
