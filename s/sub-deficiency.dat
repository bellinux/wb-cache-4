[URL] {{improvement of}} common bean production requires {{the selection of}} effective rhizobia strains and Phaseolus vulgaris genotypes adapted to available soil phosphorus limitations. The interactions between bean genotypes and rhizobia were studied in hydroponic culture using six genotypes and four strains, CIAT 899 as reference and three strains isolated from nodule of farmer's fields in the Marrakech region. The phosphorus (P) <b>sub-deficiency</b> caused a significant reduction on shoot biomass in some bean genotype-rhizobia combinations. Nodule biomass is significantly more reduced under P limitation for several combinations tested. Bean plants inoculated with these local rhizobial strains showed higher nodulation and an increase of nodules phytase and phosphatase activities under phosphorus <b>sub-deficiency</b> especially for RhM 11 strain. It was concluded that the studied bean-rhizobia symbiosis differ in their adaptation to phosphorus <b>sub-deficiency</b> and the nodule phosphatases and phytases activities may constitute a strategy of nodulated bean plants to adapt their nitrogen fixation to P deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Although, cowpea is more {{tolerant}} to phosphorus deficiency than soybean and common bean, whether this better tolerance {{is related to}} a greater P Use Efficiency (PUE) or higher specific nodule activity is not well documented. In this study, we screened different annual legumes in the glasshouse for their genotypic diversity in PUE for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation (SNF) and their proton efflux from roots. After growing 4 weeks in hydro-aeropoonic conditions, the plants were transferred into serum bottles and on soil bags on a Chromic Cambisol soil from France or an Acid Sandy soil from Northeast Thailand until harvested. Almost all V. unguiculata cultivars nodulated on the Chromic Cambisol soil, {{but not on the}} Acid Sandy soil from Thailand. In this experiment, V. unguiculata showed mainly a better growth under P <b>sub-deficiency</b> (75 μmol P week - 1) than P sufficiency (250 μmol P week - 1) and a greater PUE rather than a higher specific nodule activity. V. unguiculata cv. 26 - 73 had the lowest proton efflux among all the cultivars. However, when V. unguiculata was grown on the Acid Sandy soil, we noticed a significant decrease in soil pH and the P applications tended to increase soil pH. According to the results from our trials, V. unguiculata is the most interesting grain legume to grow as it proved to be {{more tolerant}} to phosphorus deficiency. We especially recommend using cv. 26 - 73, since it was responsible for a smaller H + efflux than the other cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is still}} a major health issue in developing countries but remains scarce in western countries. However, vitamin A <b>sub-deficiencies</b> are still observed in western countries, mainly related to pathophysiological deseases (lipid malabsorption, liver diseases...). Seldom cases of hypervitaminosis are also observed after consumption of excessive doses of vitamin A. Signs of vitamin A deficiency or excessive intake only occur very late and early indicators for assessing abnormal vitamin A status have been elaborated. The best indicator is liver vitamin A concentration, nevertheless it is rarely used as it requires a biopsy. The mostly used indicator is blood retinol concentration, {{even if it is}} challenged because of its sensitivity to numerous factors. Indicators are based on i) clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency, e. g. hemeralopia, ii) functional methods, e. g. dark adaptative test, iii) blood and tissue molecular markers, e. g. blood retinol concentration, and iv) vitamin A load tests, e. g. relative dose response test. Interpretation of these indicators results has to be done with an acute knowledge of the sensitivity limits and the interfering factors. Choosing the adequate indicator according to the assumed vitamin A status and the expected confounding factors appears to be essential. It is also recommended to cross the results of several indicators to have a better assessment of vitamin A status...|$|R
