5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E
5|$|Land {{was also}} {{an issue in the}} coming of the war. While the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who {{seasonally}} engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few, there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> end of settlers in the British colonies, who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.|$|E
25|$|But without {{detailed}} {{evidence and}} a force sufficient {{to drive the}} movement, the theory was not generally accepted: the Earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a liquid core, but there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> way that portions of the crust could move around. Distinguished scientists, such as Harold Jeffreys and Charles Schuchert, were outspoken critics of continental drift.|$|E

There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> effort about his work. With a short back-swing he persuaded the ball through the gaps, guiding it with an iron hand inside the velvet glove which disguised his power and purpose.|$|E
25|$|The rumor seemed {{unlikely}} to be true for several reasons: {{the two young men}} came from different states and had never met before being brought to the MacLab; if they were both conspiring with Randi, then the plot had gone on for 21 months. What critic would be so persistent in engaging in fraud and conspiracy on such a time-scale? There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> precedent. Nor was it possible to track down how reliable the rumor might be.|$|E
25|$|MacKaye {{recruited}} ex-Dag Nasty drummer Colin Sears {{and bass}} guitarist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After {{a few months}} of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of Rites of Spring). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate Guy Picciotto dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> place for him.|$|E

25|$|The Ptolemaic {{approach}} of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{end to the}} mushrooming growth in complexity required {{to account for the}} observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler {{was the first person to}} abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomena}} {{for which}} Plato had to account were of three kinds, ethical, epistemological, and ontological. In {{each of these}} spheres there had been developed {{by the end of}} the fifth century doctrines so extremely paradoxical that there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> possibility of reconciling them with one another or any one of them with the observable facts of human experience. The dialogues of Plato, I believe, will furnish evidence to show that he considered it necessary to find a single hypothesis which would at once solve the problems of these several spheres and also create a rationally unified cosmos by establishing the connection among the separate phases of experience.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{advisory}} {{panels in}} both the U.S. and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug {{to return to the}} market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> worse than those from ibuprofenthough the panel stated that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market.|$|E

25|$|Before Solon's reforms, the Athenian {{state was}} {{administered}} by nine archons appointed or elected annually by the Areopagus {{on the basis}} of noble birth and wealth. The Areopagus comprised former archons and it therefore had, in addition to the power of appointment, extraordinary influence as a consultative body. The nine archons took the oath of office while ceremonially standing on a stone in the agora, declaring their readiness to dedicate a golden statue if they should ever be found to have violated the laws. There was an assembly of Athenian citizens (the Ekklesia) but the lowest class (the Thetes) was not admitted and its deliberative procedures were controlled by the nobles. There therefore <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> means by which an archon could be called to account for breach of oath unless the Areopagus favoured his prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} antiquity, an {{unexpected}} {{exception to the}} alteration of an organism's tissues by chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules during fossilization has been the discovery of soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, including blood vessels, and the isolation of proteins and evidence for DNA fragments. In 2014, Mary Schweitzer and her colleagues reported the presence of iron particles (goethite-aFeO(OH)) associated with soft tissues recovered from dinosaur fossils. Based on various experiments that studied the interaction of iron in haemoglobin with blood vessel tissue they proposed that solution hypoxia coupled with iron chelation enhances the stability and preservation of soft tissue and provides the basis for {{an explanation for the}} unforeseen preservation of fossil soft tissues. However, a slightly older study based on eight taxa ranging in time from the Devonian to the Jurassic found that reasonably well-preserved fibrils that probably represent collagen were preserved in all these fossils, and that the quality of preservation depended mostly on the arrangement of the collagen fibers, with tight packing favoring good preservation. There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> correlation between geological age and quality of preservation, within that timeframe.|$|E
500|$|Recent {{writers such}} as William Montgomery Watt and Richard Bell dismiss the idea that Muhammad {{deliberately}} deceived his followers, arguing that Muhammad [...] "was absolutely sincere and acted in complete good faith" [...] and Muhammad's readiness to endure hardship for his cause, with what <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> rational basis for hope, shows his sincerity. Watt, however, says that sincerity does not directly imply correctness: In contemporary terms, Muhammad might have mistaken his subconscious for divine revelation. Watt and Bernard Lewis argue that viewing Muhammad as a self-seeking impostor {{makes it impossible to}} understand Islam's development. Alford T. Welch holds that Muhammad was able to be so influential and successful because of his firm belief in his vocation.|$|E

500|$|Hunters, campers, hikers, {{fishermen}} and some landowners opposed highway construction near the Huron Mountains. Rydholm said, [...] "...there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> groundswell of sentiment {{in favor of}} it, but it looked as the though the die was cast and nothing {{could be done to}} stop it". The Huron Mountain Club members opposed the highway because it would open vast reaches of the back country [...] and might harm the wilderness. Highway construction would also open the possibility of a resort hotel. [...] William C. Weber, a real estate developer from Detroit, owned property along Mountain Lake, in northern Marquette County. A Michigan attorney general's opinion provided a way for blocking the road if two-thirds of the property over which the road would pass was owned by people opposed to the project. The proposed highway was to cross two [...] parcels of Huron Mountain Club property, but that was not enough to halt construction.|$|E
500|$|When she {{was four}} years old, she started {{learning}} the violin, and later commented: [...] "I remember asking for a violin, but I don't remember knowing what one was. I might {{have thought it was}} a kind of pony for all I know, but I don't remember being disappointed." [...] Four years later, Autumn made her musical debut as a solo violinist performing with an orchestra, and won a competition. At the age of nine or ten, she left regular school with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist. On her time at the school, she remarked, [...] "I hated it anyway, what with the status as 'weird,' 'antisocial,' and the physical threats, there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reason to go anymore, so I just didn't." [...] She practiced eight or nine hours a day, had lessons, read a wide range of literature, participated in orchestra practice, and was home-schooled. Growing up, she owned a large CD collection of [...] "violin concertos, symphonies, chamber music, opera, and a little jazz". She began writing her own music and poetry at age thirteen or fourteen, though she never planned to sing any of her songs. She studied under various teachers and attended Indiana University in Bloomington, but left after two years there, because she disagreed with the prevailing views on individuality and classical music. She believed that neither the audience nor the original composer would be insulted by the clothing and appearance of the performer.|$|E

2500|$|At MGM Loos happily {{turned out}} scripts; however, she {{frequently}} {{had to use}} Emerson as a conduit to communicate with directors and other executives who balked at dealing with a woman on equal footing. This worked well to promote the idea they were a writing [...] "team" [...] and a happy couple.

There <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> world or life outside of Hollywood; during {{the day it was}} work, and at night parties given by other MGM folk, like the Thalbergs, the Selznicks and the Goldwyns.
