5|$|Jack Black and Kyle Gass {{initially}} met in Los Angeles in 1985, both {{members of}} the theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang. Black admits the duo did not <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> due to animosity between the two as Gass was the main musician for the Actor's Gang and felt threatened by Black. The Actor's Gang travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland for Edinburgh Fringe in 1989. They were performing Tim Robbins' and Adam Simon's play Carnage. After arriving home from the trip, the two became close friends and Black would regularly visit Gass's Cochran Avenue studio apartment in the deal that Gass would teach Black guitar in return for food, mainly from fast-food chain Jack in the Box.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, {{there was always the}} factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel opened a mission station in Pinyin in 1979. During the time Phillips was there, {{there were no other}} mission stations present in the area. Phillips often did not <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> with missionaries in Pinyin and wished to build a permanent hospital. In 1908, Phillips received permission to build the hospital that she had requested. Phillips opened St. Agatha's Hospital on 5 February 1909 and it was dedicated on 1 May.|$|E
25|$|Nariakira did not <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> {{with his}} father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father’s chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were {{wary of the}} Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho also saw many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had {{a great interest in}} Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with the shogunate.|$|E

500|$|Tracey Frahey of AllMusic {{described}} the band's sound as [...] "an {{extension of the}} alt-metal-fused-with-art rock style popularized by Tool {{in the early to}} mid-'90s. While similar to Tool in intensity and melancholy, A Perfect Circle is less dark and more melodic, with a theatrical, ambient quality that incorporates occasional strings and unusual instrumentation. While Keenan referred to the band first album, Mer de Noms, as more of a hard rock album, for subsequent albums, out of fear of redundancy, he often pushed for a more mellow, atmospheric sound, something he and Howerdel did not always <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> on, creating a sound noted to be similar to merging heavy rock music with Disintegration-era The Cure music. In general, common genre classifications applied to labeling the band's music include alternative rock, [...] alternative metal, hard rock, art rock, art metal, progressive rock and progressive metal. The band has also been lumped in with the nu metal genre, a label that is cited [...] due to the band's rise to fame coinciding with the genre's movement towards more melodic heavy material similar to A Perfect Circle's sound, and its use was contested by many publications.|$|E
500|$|On May 3, 2013, just a {{month before}} the film's premiere, {{producers}} announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life. At the time of his departure, Pacino's character had already been fully voiced and animated. Chris Renaud, co-director of the film, commented on Pacino's departure: [...] "So we don't want an unhappy actor, and we want something that is well-realized on all sides. If you don't <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye,</b> sometimes it's easier to (part company) and move on from there." [...] Benjamin Bratt, who had already been considered before Pacino, stepped in to voice Eduardo. Chris Meledandri, producer of the film, admitted that he was not [...] "aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years that has brought an actor in at such a late stage". Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. Initially, during his five-day recording, he tried to imitate Pacino's voice, but found it impossible, saying [...] "no one can out-Al Pacino Al Pacino". He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration, and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character. His work was commended by Variety, saying: [...] "You'd never guess he wasn't the filmmakers' first choice." ...|$|E

500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't <b>see</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye.</b> But she was respectful.

25|$|However, {{despite these}} {{setbacks}} and the cooling of religious fervor, {{word of the}} Northampton revival and Edwards's leadership role had spread as far as England and Scotland. It was {{at this time that}} Edwards was acquainted with George Whitefield, who was traveling the Thirteen Colonies on a revival tour in 1739–40. The two men may not have <b>seen</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> on every detail. Whitefield was far more comfortable with the strongly emotional elements of revival than Edwards was, but they were both passionate about preaching the Gospel. They worked together to orchestrate Whitefield's trip, first through Boston and then to Northampton. When Whitefield preached at Edwards's church in Northampton, he reminded them of the revival they had experienced just a few years before. This deeply touched Edwards, who wept throughout the entire service, and much of the congregation too was moved.|$|R

5000|$|JT {{began writing}} a script {{for his first}} feature in 2010, with the {{intention}} of making a film reminiscent of 1970s westerns. Deciding to wait until he could cast well known actors, while insisting on using film stock and vintage cameras rather than shooting on conventional digital cameras, Outlaws would be in the development stage for nearly 5 years. When production finally began in 2015, JT was accompanied by cinematographer Matthew Irving, both having <b>seen</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> immediately upon meeting, as they share several cinematic influences. Irving would become instrumental in providing the classic look Mollner wanted to achieve. The duo contacted Kodak about supplying VISION3 500T Color Negative Film 5219, an uncommon film type due to the grain caused by its slower speed, which served Mollner and Irving well in emulating the '70s look. The movie was shot entirely on Kodak film, using two Panaflex Platinum cameras, a Steadicam, and a variety of vintage lenses.|$|R
