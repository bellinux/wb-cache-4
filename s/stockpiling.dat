40|$|Spontaneous heating of coal <b>stockpile</b> {{has long}} been a thermal dynamic hazard during coal storage, processing, and transport. A {{transient}} non-equilibrium thermal CFD model has been developed to study the low-temperature self-heating behaviour of coal in multiple <b>stockpiles</b> under different prevailing wind conditions. Modelling results from the initial steady wind flow simulation indicate that a wake region can be induced on the leeward side of each coal <b>stockpile.</b> Pressure coefficient drops when the wind stream encounters or leaves a <b>stockpile</b> and the pressure coefficient profiles of multiple <b>stockpiles</b> tend to have more resemblance with a wider spacing. The first <b>stockpile</b> acts like a wind barrier to the adjacent <b>stockpiles</b> and the maximum temperature of it tends to be the first approaching the critical temperature. A 2 ̆ 7 hot spot 2 ̆ 7 will develop and then migrate towards deep regions in each of these <b>stockpiles</b> that are loosely compacted under higher wind velocity conditions. Wind velocity and porosity of <b>stockpile</b> have significant influences on self-heating behaviour of the <b>stockpiles</b> and transport pattern of gaseous products liberated by coal oxidation. Compacting <b>stockpiles</b> from loosely packed scenario to slightly packed scenario {{might not be able to}} slow down the temperature rising rate at low-temperature range but could considerably minimize the volume of deteriorated coal. The highest temperature rising profiles of the <b>stockpiles</b> located in downwind side can approach to that of the first <b>stockpile,</b> particularly when they are more widely stacked. Stacking coal <b>stockpiles</b> as close as practically possible is recommended to maximise the 2 ̆ 2 protection 2 ̆ 2 of adjacent <b>stockpiles</b> but would cause undesirable accumulation of carbonic gases. <b>Stockpiles</b> in low height and gentle slope will have a prolonged safe storage period, especially for the first <b>stockpile</b> directly facing the wind direction. However, it may not slow down the self-oxidation process of the adjacent <b>stockpile</b> at very initial stage due to 2 ̆ 2 weakened protection 2 ̆ 2 of the first <b>stockpile.</b> This study has practical reference to coal industry especially where multiple coal <b>stockpiles</b> require to be constructed...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} {{and the wide}} usage of measurement instruments associated with <b>stockpiles,</b> such as weightometers, a smart sensor can be developed to online monitor {{the level of a}} <b>stockpile.</b> Furthermore, the <b>stockpile</b> smart sensor can be used to determine the mixing behaviour of different ores discharged out of the <b>stockpile,</b> by combining the smart sensor technique and element modelling. The mixing behaviour of different materials includes when and how the mixing takes place, and more important, when the mixed materials with a certain portion is discharged out of the <b>stockpile.</b> In this article, only the level function of the <b>stockpile</b> smart sensor will be discussed in detail. The <b>stockpile</b> smart sensor can help estimate accurate residual time for different group of ores charged to the <b>stockpile.</b> The smart sensor makes it possible to monitor the behaviour of different ore types in real time in a <b>stockpile,</b> including when and how the different ores are mixed in the <b>stockpile</b> and when the mixed ores are discharged with certain mixing portion. Using the smart sensor system, the information on ore types can be provided for ores that are discharged from the <b>stockpile.</b> The ore type information includes ore grade, density, hardness, strength, etc. The <b>stockpile</b> smart sensor, developed originally for a diamond mine, can be used for <b>stockpiles</b> of other mines, including iron ore mines, coal mines, copper mines, chromium ore mine, and cement plants...|$|R

40|$|Biosolids {{produced}} by {{wastewater treatment plants}} are often stored in <b>stockpiles</b> and can be {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gases (GHG). Growing trees in shallow <b>stockpiled</b> biosolids may remove nutrients, keep the biosolids drier and offset GHG emissions through C sequestration. We directly measured methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) flux from a large biosolid <b>stockpile</b> and two shallow <b>stockpiles,</b> one planted with Salix reichardtii (willow) trees, from December 2009 to January 2011. All <b>stockpiles</b> emitted large annual amounts of GHG ranging from 38 kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1) dry biosolid for the large <b>stockpile,</b> to 65 kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1) for the unplanted shallow <b>stockpile,</b> probably due to the greater surface area to volume ratio. GHG emissions were dominated by N 2 O and CO 2 whilst CH 4 emissions were negligible (< 2 %) from the large <b>stockpile</b> and the shallow <b>stockpiles</b> were actually a CH 4 sink. Annual willow tree growth was 12 Mg dry biomass ha(- 1), but this only offset 8 % of the GHG emissions from the shallow planted <b>stockpile.</b> Our data highlight that biosolid <b>stockpiles</b> are significant sources for GHG emissions but alternate management options such as shallow <b>stockpiles</b> or planting for biomass production will not lead to GHG emission reductions.

Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the Vbombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at RAF Gan in the Maldives. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for Vbombers, so RAF Butterworth had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the <b>stockpiling</b> of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran into political complications.|$|E

Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire.

5|$|After {{establishing}} {{itself in}} India, XX Bomber Command {{under the command}} of Brigadier General Kenneth Wolfe undertook various tasks to prepare for raids against Japan. Foremost among these was <b>stockpiling</b> fuel at the airfields in China. Until late 1944, USAAF Air Transport Command aircraft did not transport fuel for XX Bomber Command, and this task was instead undertaken by the B-29s. This arrangement proved inefficient, however, as 12 B-29 sorties between India and China were needed to transport enough fuel and other supplies to enable one of the heavy bombers to fly a round trip between China and Japan. As a result, it took longer than expected to build up sufficient stockpiles in China to allow B-29 operations to commence. Moreover, continued technical problems with the Superfortress, and particularly their Wright R-3350 engines, resulted in many of XX Bomber Command's aircraft being unserviceable and in need of modification at all times.|$|E

40|$|The {{wastewater}} treatment process generates {{large amounts of}} sewage sludge that are dried and then often stored in biosolid <b>stockpiles</b> in treatment plants. Because the biosolids are rich in decomposable organic matter they could be a significant source for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet there are no direct measurements of GHG from <b>stockpiles.</b> We therefore measured the direct emissions of methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{on a monthly basis}} from three different age classes of biosolid <b>stockpiles</b> at the Western Treatment Plant (WTP), Melbourne, Australia, from December 2009 to November 2011 using manual static chambers. All biosolid <b>stockpiles</b> were a significant point source for CH 4 and N 2 O emissions. The youngest biosolids (< 1 year old) had the greatest CH 4 and N 2 O emissions of 60. 2  kg of CO 2 -e per Mg of biosolid per year. <b>Stockpiles</b> that were between 1 and 3 years old emitted less overall GHG (∼ 29  kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1)  yr(- 1)) and the oldest <b>stockpiles</b> emitted the least GHG (∼ 10  kg CO 2 -e Mg(- 1)  yr(- 1)). Methane emissions were negligible in all <b>stockpiles</b> but the relative contribution of N 2 O and CO 2 changed with <b>stockpile</b> age. The youngest <b>stockpile</b> emitted two thirds of the GHG emission as N 2 O, while the 1 - 3 year old <b>stockpile</b> emitted an equal amount of N 2 O and CO 2 and in the oldest <b>stockpile</b> CO 2 emissions dominated. We did not detect any seasonal variability of GHG emissions and did not observe a correlation between GHG flux and environmental variables such as biosolid temperature, moisture content or nitrate and ammonium concentration. We also modeled CH 4 emissions based on a first order decay model and the model based estimated annual CH 4 emissions were higher as compared to the direct field based estimated annual CH 4 emissions. Our results indicate that labile organic material in <b>stockpiles</b> is decomposed over time and that nitrogen decomposition processes lead to significant N 2 O emissions. Carbon decomposition favors CO 2 over CH 4 production probably because of aerobic <b>stockpile</b> conditions or CH 4 oxidation in the outer <b>stockpile</b> layers. Although the GHG emission rate decreased with biosolid age, managers of biosolid <b>stockpiles</b> should assess alternate storage or uses for biosolids to avoid nutrient losses and GHG emissions.

The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli.

5|$|Darius, therefore, began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to {{completely}} subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since {{this was to be}} a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, <b>stockpiling,</b> and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Xerxes' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of <b>stockpiling</b> the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers.
