5|$|Although no {{contemporaneous}} {{or nearly}} contemporaneous sources made mention of any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó. Zsuzsa Teke writes {{that they were}} born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless. Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the Illuminated Chronicle, which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that {{she gave birth to}} Charles's two daughters, because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles's two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents' death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth, the wife of BoleslausII of Troppau, was also Charles's daughter. If she was actually Charles's daughter, <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born in about 1330, according to Kristó.|$|E

500|$|Initially, both Charlemagne and Offa {{appear to}} have shared a common {{interest}} in supporting King Æthelred, Offa's son-in-law. Shortly before Æthelred was murdered in 796, an embassy from Francia delivered gifts for the king and his bishops. When Charlemagne learned of Æthelred's killing he was enraged, called the Northumbrians [...] "that treacherous, perverse people...who murder their own lords", and threatened retribution. His ambassadors, who had travelled on to Ireland and were then returning home, were ordered back to Northumbria to recover the presents. Charlemagne in time became a supporter of Eardwulf. Eardwulf is said by the early 12th-century Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham to have married one of Charlemagne's daughters, information not found in other sources. [...] If this is correct <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> illegitimate, as the marriages of all the legitimate daughters are known. Coenwulf, on the other hand, who became king of Mercia shortly after Eardwulf's accession, is recorded as having fought with Eardwulf in 801.|$|E
500|$|Malathi Rangarajan's review [...] (The Hindu) [...] was fair, {{labelling}} {{the film}} an [...] "alluring canvas", praising the opulent sets, [...] locations, rich costumes and imposing cast, yet {{noted that it}} was [...] "too short to negate the many loopholes". Divya Parameshwaran was appreciated in her debut role, while Pooja Chopra was credited as being [...] "attractive too, but [...] expressions needed some honing". Though Prashanth's stunt acts were appreciated, Rangarajan pointed out his character flaws, such as minimal expressions which were [...] "barely a smirk" [...] in the initial scenes, and the distinct lack of distinguishable traits between the twin characters he depicted. He also highlighted the lack of logic in Periyamalai Gounder's (Vijayakumar) animosity towards his daughter Thamarai (Kushboo) and the cheerful appearance of Thamarai when <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sad and heartbroken in the wedding scene with Prakashraj. Vikatan stated that the only good aspects of the movie were its expensive sets and its avoidance of boring archaic Tamil dialogues, common in other period films in Tamil, giving it a rating of 41 points out of 100.|$|E
500|$|Dónde Están los Ladrones? {{comprises}} Latin pop {{and rock}} en Español styles. The album opens with [...] "Ciega, Sordomuda", which is musically filled by typical Mexican trumpets over a disco dance loop and an electric guitar. Second track [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] lyrically depicts an angry Shakira who tells her lover [...] "Si me cambias por esa bruja, pedazo de cuero, no vuelvas nunca más, que no estaré aquí". The next song, [...] "Moscas en la Casa", {{was inspired by}} the singer's troubled relationship with Puerto Rican actor Osvaldo Ríos. Shakira lyrically expresses the sadness that she feels after a broken relationship. [...] "Mis días sin ti son tan oscuros, tan largos, tan grises, mis días sin ti", she sings. In the next track [...] "No Creo", the singer expresses how she believes in nothing and nobody except her lover. The song references popular socially accepted or non-accepted norms such as herself, luck, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Venus and Mars, and Brian Weiss. The fifth song on Dónde Están los Ladrones? is [...] "Inevitable". Lyrically, in the hard rock ballad, Shakira confesses that she does not know how to prepare coffee, does not understand soccer, that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unfaithful at some point and that she never wears watch. The next track [...] "Octavo Día" [...] is a rock-oriented song that refers to God coming to Earth after finishing his work and discovering everything to be in ruins, and decides to quit his job and become a normal man. She also namechecks Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson.|$|E

500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret {{to have to say}} I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E
500|$|Rufus {{was born}} into the Whiskers Mob on 1 February 2007 in a mix litter of eight pups. His litter-mates were Burdock, Rhogan Josh, Amira, Squig, Chiriqui, Etosha and Murray. His mother is unknown, but <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> either Hawkeye, Petra, Flo, Finn or Ella. His father remains unknown as well. His mother and the other females mated during a group split but the {{splinter}} group rejoined a month before he was born. On 25 January 2007 dominant female, and Rufus' grandmother, Flower died from a snake bite. He and his litter-mates survived their first few weeks and started to foraged with the adults. The five males soon joined into the Lazuli Mob. Machu Pichu took male dominance but was ousted by Wollow. Machu Pichu joined Beebop and formed the PK mob along with Rhogan Josh. But Rufus' litter-mate didn't stay in the group and took to roving. Rhogan Josh {{is now in the}} Chuckle Bros group now. It is a group of roving male who are not attached to any breeding clan. Then Axel left the Lazuli with some males and joined Stop it. Only Wollow and Rufus remained in the Lazuli. Rufus took to roving with some of his new Lazuli pals. He lived in the Lazuli for two years and often roved. In February 2010 when Rufus returned from roving he got in a fight with dominant male Wollow. He managed to overthrow Wollow. Life changed for Rufus who took over as dominant male beside dominant female Young. Rufus evicted Wollow from the group in June 2010 but he allowed the former beaten dominant male to return to the group. Young became pregnant and Rufus is most likely the father. Rufus was sadly predated in September [...] He was the only one out of his litter to become a dominant meerkat.|$|E
2500|$|Denys's {{will was}} [...] dated the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel (16 October 1421), {{and he died}} on 24 March 1422. [...] His will is a very short and businesslike document. [...] He {{requested}} {{to be buried in}} Siston Church, near his first wife Margaret Corbet. The fact that he had appointed his daughter Joan, [...] "wife of Thomas Gamage" [...] as his executrix to arrange this burial, suggests <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a daughter of Margaet Corbet, not of his second wife Margaret Russell. This supposition is strengthened by the fact <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an adult to be thus appointed, which would place her date of birth before Denys's 2nd.

[...] Considering that Josephine reported in later life at having first arrived with the Markham Troupe on December 1, 1879, and that Josephine joined Behan in Tombstone that same year, her reference to [...] "my bad experience of a few years ago" [...] means <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in Arizona for some time before 1879.|$|E

From Teplitz to Karlsbad (ca. 100km), the post coach took just one day. Therefore, if it had been {{intended}} for Antonie, she would have received the Letter on Friday morning, the latest.

Now it is established that Antonie is definitely ruled out, it helps to know that the Austrian Emperor was briefly in Franzensbad on 5 July 1812, and given the known fact that Josephine's first husband was a personal friend of the Emperor (to whom she went to ask for help, after becoming a widow), it makes sense to assume that she tried to meet him there (after her encounter with Beethoven on 3–4 July).|$|E
