40|$|The great {{growth of}} the Spanish {{swordfish}} fleet {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s has consolidated its position as the main northern stock swordfish producer, followed far behind by the USA, Canada and other EU countries. The aim of this paper is to analyse the determining institutional and economic factors in said fishery. We study the management instruments, placing special emphasis on the pertinent Spanish regulations and describe in detail the technical characteristics of the fleet, the fishing effort and the landings. We also carry out estimations of the revenues, costs and total income generated by the fleet. The results show the economic profitability of the fishery, with incomes which have increased, on average, by 7 % in the last 15 years. <b>Spain</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> swordfish Economic profitability...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summers}} of 1987 and 1989, large scale {{transect}} surveys were conducted throughout the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> by several national agencies in Denmark (off Greenland), Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway and <b>Spain</b> (<b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Sightings Surveys, NASS- 87 and NASS- 89). This paper analyses the pilot whale (Globicephala melas) survey {{data collected by}} three Icelandic and one Faroese survey vessel in 1987, and four Icelandic, one Faroese and one Spanish vessel in 1989. Norwegian survey vessels operated north and east of this area in both years, but only five groups (three primary sightings) were observed in 1989 and none in 1987. Furthermore, no sightings {{were made in the}} area north and northeast of Iceland, thus indicating that the joint surveys covered the northernmost areas of pilot whale distribution east of 42 °W. The area further to the west was not covered in either survey. The coastal European waters between 42 - 52 °N were covered by the Spanish vessel in 1989. Sightings made in 1989 by the Icelandic vessels tended to be at the southernmost boundaries of the survey area. The present data were examined with respect to several potential stratification factors, namely geographic block, Beaufort (i. e. wind speed), vessel and school size, but sample size precluded stratification by all these factors simultaneously. The encounter rate was generally lower in the 1987 survey than in 1989, but the difference was not statistically significant. The total estimate for the 1989 survey, covering a wider area and further to the south than in 1987, was 778, 000 (CV= 0. 295). This is regarded as the best available estimate of the total stock of long-finned pilot whales in the northeastern <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, although small numbers occur outside the NASS survey areas. The paper discusses potential biases in the abundance estimates, and the problems of estimating pilot whale abundance from sightings data...|$|R

40|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} climate models {{is the large}} sea surface {{salinity}} (SSS) biases in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> In this study, we describe the influences of correcting these SSS biases on the circulation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> {{as well as on}} <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal to multidecadal variability. We performed integrations of the Kiel Climate Model (KCM) with and without applying a freshwater flux correction over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The quality of simulating the mean circulation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal variability is greatly enhanced in the freshwater flux-corrected integration which, by definition, depicts relatively small <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SSS biases. In particular, a large reduction in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cold sea surface temperature bias is observed and a more realistic Atlantic Multidecadal Variability simulated. Improvements relative to the non-flux corrected integration also comprise a more realistic representation of deep convection sites, sea ice, gyre circulation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The results suggest that simulations of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal variability could strongly benefit from alleviating sea surface salinity biases in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> which may enhance the skill of decadal predictions in that region...|$|R

40|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is the {{dominant}} mode of winter climate variability in the Northern hemisphere. It is a complex 'see-saw' between two pressure systems located over Greenland {{and a group of}} Islands known as the Azores. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is most pronounced during the winter season and accounts for more than one third of the total variance in sea level pressure. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is closely related to the position of the storm track. During a positive phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation the average storm track moves across the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> in a <b>North</b> Easterly direction towards Europe and the United Kingdom, During a negative phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation, the storm track moves in a West to East direction towards Southern Europe. Another track associated with the negative phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation moves in a Northerly direction along the coast of North America. The frequency and intensity of storms crossing the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> is also related to the phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation, but to a lesser degree (the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation accoimting for approximately 20 % of their variation). The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation has been experiencing an upward frend over the last thirty years becoming predominantly positive. In can be said that the upward trend is partially attributed to increasing greenhouse gas emissions; including the anthropogenic and human influences on sea level pressvire, however this must be proved by model simulations and further research...|$|R
