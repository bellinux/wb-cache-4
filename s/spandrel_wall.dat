40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>spandrel</b> <b>walls</b> on the {{stiffness}} and ultimate strength of reinforced concrete columns was studied. Twenty-six columns {{are subjected to}} cyclic loading with deflection-control.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{thought that the}} {{strength}} of columns with <b>spandrel</b> <b>walls</b> can be calculated by neglecting {{the effects of the}} walls where the thickness is less than 10 cm and the thickness ratio is less than l/ 6. But it has been reported in some recent papers that the strength with <b>spandrel</b> <b>walls</b> is affected by the ratio of wall height to column height and the ratio of thickness of wall to that of column. The shear force, required to fracture framed walls may differ due to concrete compressive strength and due to reinforcing volume in the wall. As a column with <b>spandrel</b> <b>walls</b> is a kind of framed wall, structural elements of concrete compressive strength and reinforcing bar- volume have to be considered. Accordingly, the authors performed the experimental studies on the effect of above-mentioned structural elements on the strength of columns with <b>spandrel</b> <b>walls.</b> The results were as follows. 1. The strength of columns with <b>spandrel</b> <b>walls</b> must not be calculated by neglecting the effects of the walls where the thickness ratio is less than 1 / 6. 2. The reinforcing bar-volume in the wall and the transverse reinforcing bar-volume in the column have effects on the strength of column with <b>spandrel</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R

Following inspection of the cut-water (nose of pier) at river level, further damage to the sandstone blockwork was identified at this low level. Approximately 15 courses of White Hollington stone have been rebuilt, integrating new stone in and around existing.|$|E
50|$|As {{construction}} continued, several {{decisions were}} made which enhanced the bridge's structural strength. The granite voussoirs in the spans were thickened so that each span could now form a true arch. A concrete wall was also added {{to the end of}} each span, which supported not only the roadway superstructure but also the walls of each spandrel. Each <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> was now 94 ft wide. This significantly increased the dead load as well as strengthened the bridge, and allowed the bridge to be 2 ft higher than planned. These changes also meant that each of the outer lanes of the bridge could now carry 40 ST.|$|E

25|$|In August, however, {{there were}} {{problems}} with the Derwent Aqueduct which required considerable modification.

40|$|Masonry arch bridges {{still play}} an {{important}} role in the transportation infrastructure today in the United Kingdom. Previous research has mainly focused on the load carrying capacity in the span direction. The three dimensional behaviour is often investigated by simplifying into two dimensions with modified arch parameters but these simplified analyses cannot represent all aspects of behaviour. <b>Spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> failure in some railway masonry arch bridges has raised concerns recently, and this is one aspect which cannot be modelled in two dimensions. This thesis presents a research which attempts to model the interaction behaviour between arch, backfill and <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> with the aim of representing the three dimensional nature of real bridges. It mainly focuses on the <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> defects under increasing load, including crack development across the wall and longitudinal cracks in the arch barrel underneath <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall.</b> Experimental results from the laboratory tests on engineering blue brick and a hydraulic premixed mortar as well as brickwork masonry specimens are presented. Numerical analysis was initially performed on these brickwork masonry specimens for validation. Three dimensional FE models were proposed for both small and large scale bridges. The general behaviour of the small scale bridge under rolling load and large scale bridge under increasing load were studied. Reasonable agreement between the FE analyses and experimental results from previous literature was obtained, indicating the model validated for small masonry specimens could be scaled up to full-scale bridges. A series of computer models were constructed to investigate the relationship between a range of geometric and material parameters and the lateral behaviour of arch bridges. The backfill depth and <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> thickness have greatest impact on both bridge strength and lateral behaviour. The fill properties also have an importance influence on the load carrying capacity. This provides an indication of which bridge should be more closely monitored for <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> defects. Separate FE models was constructed to simulate existing longitudinal cracks found in the arch barrel for old bridges and the influence of strengthening of <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> with tie bars. The general behaviour under a concentrated load is studied and discussed. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to effectively model the three dimension behaviour of masonry arch bridges and in particular, <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> failures...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{tremendous}} {{advantages of the}} laser scanning technology for the geometric characterization of built constructions, there are important limitations preventing more widespread implementation in the structural engineering domain. Even though the technology provides extensive and accurate information to perform structural assessment and health monitoring, many people are resistant to the technology due to the processing times involved. Thus, new methods that can automatically process LiDAR data and subsequently provide an automatic and organized interpretation are required. This paper presents a new method for fully automated point cloud segmentation of masonry arch bridges. The method efficiently creates segmented, spatially related and organized point clouds, which each contain the relevant geometric data for a particular component (pier, arch, <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall,</b> etc.) of the structure. The segmentation procedure comprises a heuristic approach for the separation of different vertical walls, and later image processing tools adapted to voxel structures allows the efficient segmentation of the main structural elements of the bridge. The proposed methodology provides the essential processed data required for structural assessment of masonry arch bridges based on geometric anomalies. The method is validated using {{a representative sample of}} masonry arch bridges in Spain...|$|E

40|$|Investigation on Double Tube Hybrid System (DTHS) {{through an}} {{analytical}} study is conducted {{as a part}} of the proposal on the seismic design method for Double Tubes Hybrid System (DTHS) for buildings. This structural system comprises Energy Dissipation Structural Walls (EDSWs) as the interior tube and <b>Spandrel</b> <b>Wall</b> Frame (SWF) as the exterior tube. The hysteretic behavior of EDSWs and SWF have been experimentally investigated and reported elsewhere. They indicated a stable elasto-plastic manner under cyclic lateral loading, and had an ample energy dissipation capacity. In order to establish a reliable performance-based seismic design method for DTHS, a further investigation of overall building through an analytical study is needed. Three building models, 3 -story, 6 -story, and 12 -story are simulated by a frame analysis method. The structural behaviors of DTHS are investigated by performing static and dynamic response analyses. It is proved that high-rise building model utilizing proposed structural system is an effective structural system for DTHS, in which overturning moment dominates rather than shear, which is desirable in the view point of structural design. Application in low-rise building is proved also as an effective method to increase the structural performance of DTHS even though the design strength is set slightly larger than the value for controlling the deformation in high-rise building...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} {{study is a}} part of the investigation on the seismic design method for Double Tubes Hybrid System (DTHS) for buildings. This structural system consists of RC core walls as the interior tube, and the exterior frames composed of RC short columns and RC spandrel walls as the exterior tube. The RC core walls are designed as the Energy Dissipation Structural Walls (EDSW), which are composed of RC coupled shear walls linked by short steel H-shaped beams as the energy dissipation devices. The hysteretic behavior of EDSW as the core tube has been experimentally investigated and reported elsewhere. It is clarified that EDSW behave in a very ductile manner under cyclic lateral loading, and have an ample energy dissipation capacity. The exterior frame is made of RC spandrel walls and RC short columns. We call such a new constructional system frame as the <b>Spandrel</b> <b>Wall</b> Frame (SWF). We focus on the behavior of SWF in this paper, so that an {{experimental study}} is carried out on the SWF specimens. With respect to the RC short columns, we introduce steel Tube jacketing Reinforced Concrete (TRC) columns instead of the ordinary RC columns.

40|$|Small scale {{centrifuge}} {{models were}} used to study the behaviour of arches repaired using different techniques. The models under test were 1 / 12 th scale replicas of a 6 metre single span three ring arch. Two types of arch geometry, with span/rise of 4 and 2, were studied as a shallow and deep arch geometry. The models were tested in a centrifuge under a steady equivalent gravity of 12 g. Two types of 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were studied which had the same geometry but different in the addition of spandrel walls. The 3 -D models were built with spandrel walls but without any wing walls or parapet. Both 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were tested under rolling and failure loads. The models were usually tested with fourteen passes of a rolling load and then up to the observation of first signs of failure {{to enable them to}} be suitable for applying a repair method. The repaired models were tested using the same procedure but up to the full failure load. To understand the behaviour of the arch models under unsymmetrical loads different roller weights were applied at different positions. The arch deflection and the soil/masonry interaction in arch extrados were measured in all the tests and compared with each other. Plastic mesh reinforcement, stitching, and concrete slab on top of the soil backfill were applied as repair methods to the 2 -D arch models. A review of the results has shown an increase in arch stiffness, decrease in deflections and a significant improvement in the ultimate load carrying capacity. A significant effect on the pressure distribution on the arch barrel was observed due to the application of the concrete slab on top of the backfill. Stitching of arch barrel and the barrel to the spandrels, applying partial saddle concrete and strengthening of <b>spandrel</b> <b>wall</b> using reinforced concrete were tested in the 3 -D arch models. The results showed improvements in the stiffness and ultimate arch load carrying capacity due to these repair techniques. The results provide a valuable data base for validation of numerical models and an initial attempt to use them with a commercial finite element program is included.
