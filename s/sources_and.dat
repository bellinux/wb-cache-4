30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} generally correlated two-hop MIMO relay systems with mutually correlated source symbols, spatially correlated channels and colored noises. For the system capacity maximization, we propose joint designs of <b>source</b> <b>and</b> relay precoders in two {{cases of the}} full CSIT (like [28 – 31]) and the partial CSIT. The partial CSIT denotes full CSI of the source-relay link and covariance information of the relay-destination link <b>and</b> the <b>source</b> signal <b>and</b> noise covariance matrices known to the transmitters. First, with the full CSIT, the optimal structure of the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> relay precoders is derived by maximizing the instantaneous MI between the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> the destination. By the obtained <b>source</b> <b>and</b> relay precoders and the destination equalizer, the compound relaying channel is shown to be decomposed into parallel sub-channels. We design an iterative algorithm to perform power allocation iteratively and alternatively between the <b>source</b> antennas <b>and</b> the relay antennas. To reduce the computational complexity of the iterative algorithm, we develop its simplified version in which power allocation is carried out separately between the <b>source</b> antennas <b>and</b> the relay antennas. Next, with the partial CSIT, the optimal structure of the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> relay precoders is also derived by maximizing an upper bound of the average MI between the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> the destination. Again, an iterative algorithm and a simplified algorithm for <b>source</b> <b>and</b> relay power allocation are developed as well.|$|R

50|$|A {{relay network}} {{is a broad}} class of network {{topology}} commonly used in wireless networks, where the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> destination are interconnected by means of some nodes.

30|$|As is {{the case}} with {{homogeneous}} transfer learning solutions, whether the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> target domains contain labeled data drives the solution formulation for heterogeneous approaches. Data label availability {{is a function of the}} underlying application. The solutions surveyed in this paper have different labeled data requirements. For transfer learning to be feasible, the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> the target domains must be related in some way. Some heterogeneous solutions require an explicit mapping of the relationship or correspondence between the <b>source</b> <b>and</b> target domains. For example, the solutions defined for Prettenhofer [91] and Wei [125] require manual definitions of <b>source</b> <b>and</b> target correspondence.|$|R
