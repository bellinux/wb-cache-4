40|$|Thermodynamical stabilities of four {{conventional}} <b>second</b> <b>phases</b> {{as well as}} magnesium matrix in bioabsorbable magnesium alloys {{were investigated}} theoretically via computer calculation method. Model of individual phase and systems including phase and four water molecular (phase- 4 H 2 O) were established to simulate the in vitro and in vivo environment. Local orbital density functional theory approach was applied to calculate the total energy for the individual phase and phase- 4 H 2 O system. The results demonstrated that all the <b>second</b> <b>phases</b> possessed higher phase stability compared with magnesium matrix, but the phase stability was quite different for different types of <b>second</b> <b>phases</b> or <b>second</b> phase- 4 H 2 O systems. Furthermore, a schematic process of inflammation reaction caused by magnesium alloy implants was proposed for the further evaluation on biocompatibility of different <b>second</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, {{each of which}} were over {{twice the size of}} the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders in the <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E
