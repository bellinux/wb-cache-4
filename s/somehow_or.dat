500|$|Alongside ghostwriter Don Moore, a pulp-fiction veteran, Raymond {{created the}} {{visually}} sumptuous science-fiction epic comic strip Flash Gordon. The duo also created the [...] "complementary strip, Jungle Jim, an adventurous saga set in South-East Asia", a topper which ran above Flash in some papers Raymond was concurrently illustrating Secret Agent X-9, which premiered January 22, 1934, {{two weeks after}} the two other strips. It was Flash Gordon that would outlast the others, quickly [...] "develop an audience far surpassing" [...] that of Buck Rogers. Flash Gordon, wrote Stephen Becker, [...] "was wittier and moved faster," [...] so [...] "Buck's position as America's favorite sci-fi hero", wrote historian Bill Crouch, Jr., [...] "went down in flames to the artistic lash and spectacle of Alex Raymond's virtuoso artwork." [...] Alex Raymond has stated, [...] "I decided honestly that comic art is an art form in itself. It reflects the life and times more accurately and actually is more artistic than magazine illustration—since it is entirely creative. An illustrator works with camera and models; a comic artist begins with a white sheet of paper and dreams up his own business—he is playwright, director, editor and artist at once." [...] A. E. Mendez has also stated that [...] "Raymond’s achievements are chopped into bite-sized pieces by the comic art cognoscenti. Lost in the worthwhile effort to distinguish comics as an art form, the romance, sweep and beauty of Raymond's draftsmanship, his incomparable line work, is dismissed. To many, it's just pretty pictures. <b>Somehow</b> <b>or</b> another, it's OK for people like Caniff and Eisner to borrow from film. That’s real storytelling. But for Raymond to study illustrators, well, that's just not comics." ...|$|E

2500|$|For example, if {{a peanut}} butter {{producer}} purchases a jar manufacturer, {{is that an}} expense (since they have to purchase jars <b>somehow)</b> <b>or</b> a sheltering of their income through investment? Flat tax systems can differ greatly in how they accommodate such gray areas. For example, the [...] "9-9-9" [...] flat tax proposal would allow businesses to deduct purchases but not labor costs. (This effectively taxes labor-intensive industrial revenue at a higher rate.) How deductions are implemented will dramatically change the effective total tax, and thus the flatness of the tax. Thus, a flat tax proposal is not fully defined unless the proposal includes a differentiation between deductible and non-deductible expenses.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the failure}} of his plans he retired {{to the country and}} awaited events. [...] Whitelocke's career, however, had been marked by {{moderation}} and good sense throughout. [...] The necessity of carrying on the government of the country <b>somehow</b> <b>or</b> other had been the chief motive of his adherence to Cromwell rather than any sympathy for a republic or a military dictatorship, and his advice to Cromwell to accept the title of king was doubtless tendered with the object of giving the administration greater stability and of protecting its adherents under the Statute of Henry VII. [...] Nor had he shown himself unduly ambitious or self-seeking in the pursuit of office, and he had proved himself ready to sacrifice high place to the claims of professional honour and duty. [...] These considerations were not without weight with his contemporaries at the Restoration. [...] Accordingly, Whitelocke was not excepted from the Act of Indemnity, and after the payment of various sums to the king and others he was allowed to retain the bulk of his property. [...] He lived henceforth in seclusion near Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire, dying on 28 July 1675.|$|E

2500|$|While at Rochester, Ashkin was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to formally {{recognize the importance of}} the Feynman diagram. Feynman devised the diagram in 1948 to provide a simple visualization of the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles. Although the diagram and its offshoots were later seen as extremely important tools, Feynman did not give them a theoretical framework nor did he explain how he proposed they be used. Physicists had difficulty in understanding their function, distrusted their simplicity, and were reluctant to give them formal recognition. Feynman later said physicists did not realize the diagram's power and would employ a more complex method created by Julian Schwinger. Ashkin, he said, {{was the first}} to break with this pattern: [...] "They <b>somehow</b> <b>or</b> other couldn’t do it. They had to go through this [...] to believe it. But that's all right. The only person who didn't, the first paper where it was used directly — which I kept looking for, I kept flipping through the Physical Review as it came out — was Ashkin. He'd done some calculation for some experiment, and he said, 'We’ve calculated this using Feynman's rules.' Bloop! There it was in writing! Then gradually more and more people did it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the {{agitating}} questions {{relating to}} our peculiar institutions—African slavery {{as it exists}} among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the [...] "rock upon which the old Union would split." [...] He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him {{and most of the}} leading statesmen {{at the time of the}} formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, <b>somehow</b> <b>or</b> other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the [...] "storm came and the wind blew, it fell."Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.|$|E
2500|$|For Badiou {{the problem}} which the Greek {{tradition}} of philosophy has faced and never satisfactorily dealt with {{is that while}} beings themselves are plural, and thought in terms of multiplicity, being itself {{is thought to be}} singular; that is, it is thought in terms of the one. He proposes as the solution to this impasse the following declaration: that the one is not. This is why Badiou accords set theory (the axioms of which he refers to as the Ideas of the multiple) such stature, and refers to mathematics as the very place of ontology: Only set theory allows one to conceive a 'pure doctrine of the multiple'. Set theory does not operate in terms of definite individual elements in groupings but only functions insofar as what belongs to a set is of the same relation as that set (that is, another set too). What individuates a set, therefore, is not an existential positive proposition, but other multiples whose properties (i.e., structural relations) validate its presentation. The structure of being thus secures the regime of the count-as-one. So if one is to think of a set – for instance, the set of people, or humanity – as counting as one, the multiple elements which belong to that set are secured as one consistent concept (humanity), but only in terms of what does not belong to that set. What is crucial for Badiou is that the structural form of the count-as-one, which makes multiplicities thinkable, implies (<b>somehow</b> <b>or</b> other) that the proper name of being does not belong to an element as such (an original 'one'), but rather the void set (written Ø), the set to which nothing (not even the void set itself) belongs. It may help to understand the concept 'count-as-one' if it is associated with the concept of 'terming': a multiple is not one, but it is referred to with 'multiple': one word. To count a set as one is to mention that set. How the being of terms such as 'multiple' does not contradict the non-being of the one can be understood by considering the multiple nature of terminology: for there to be a term without there also being a system of terminology, within which the difference between terms gives context and meaning to any one term, is impossible. 'Terminology' implies precisely difference between terms (thus multiplicity) as the condition for meaning. The idea of a term without meaning is incoherent, the count-as-one is a structural effect or a situational operation; it is not an event of 'truth'. Multiples which are 'composed' or 'consistent' are count-effects. 'Inconsistent multiplicity' [...] is [...] 'the presentation of presentation.' ...|$|E
