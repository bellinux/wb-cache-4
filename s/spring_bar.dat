5000|$|Though the British Ministry of Defence's {{name for}} the strap was nondescript, its {{specifications}} were precise. MoD-issued G10 straps were nylon, only made in [...] "Admiralty Grey" [...] with a width of 20mm, and had chrome-plated brass buckle and keepers. Another key trait was a second, shorter piece of nylon strap attached to the buckle. Since the strap was {{to be used by}} the military, it needed to be functional and fail-safe. The extra nylon had a keeper at its end through which {{the main part of the}} strap passed through after it had been looped behind the watch. This created a pocket, limiting the distance the watch could move. As long as the strap was passed through properly and snugly on the wrist, the watch would stay exactly where it was needed. The bonus feature of a strap that passes behind the watch is that in the event a <b>spring</b> <b>bar</b> breaks or pops out, the watch will still be secured by the other <b>spring</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Watchstraps or bracelets for diving watches are {{generally}} made of {{materials that are}} adequately water (pressure) resistant and able to endure the galvanic corrosiveness of seawater. In practical terms most diving watches feature a rubber, silicone rubber, polyurethane or fabric watchstrap or a stainless steel or titanium metal link or mesh bracelet of adequate length to facilitate wearing the watch over a diving suit sleeve.For a wrist with a 200 mm circumference wearing a 4 mm thick diving suit sleeve increases the strap or bracelet length required the fit the watch over the sleeved wrist to 225 mm. For this bracelets often have a (concealed) divers extension [...] clasp by which the bracelet can be appropriately extended by approximately 20 mm to 30 mm.Some watchstraps allow an increase in length by adding a diving suit extension strap piece to the standard watchstrap. If required more than one diving suit extension strap piece {{can be added to}} the standard watchstrap.With increasing depth and rising water pressure the (sleeved) wrist of a diver is exposed to compression effects that have a shrinking effect on the wrist circumference. Many watchstraps intended for diving watches have rippled or vented sections near the attachment points on the watch case to facilitate the required flexibility to strap the watch tightly for normal wear at the surface whilst keeping the watch sufficiently tightly in place on the divers wrist at depth.Metal link bracelets theoretically have more failure points compared to metal mesh bracelets and watchstraps due to the use of link connection parts like split pins or screw pins. One piece (NATO style) nylon fabric straps that slide under the watch case through both spring bars (or attaching points between the watch case and strap) are used to minimize the chance of losing the watch due to a <b>spring</b> <b>bar</b> or attachment point failure.|$|E

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} balance system was {{designed}} to determine the wind-induced vibrations of a space shuttle model. The balance utilizes a flexible sting mounting {{in conjunction with a}} geometrically scaled rigid model. Bending and torsional displacements are determined through strain-gauge-instrumented <b>spring</b> <b>bar</b> mechanisms. The natural frequency of the string-model system can be varied continuously throughout the expected scaled frequency range of the shuttle vehicle while a test is in progress by the use of moveable riders on the <b>spring</b> <b>bar</b> mechanism. Through the use of a frequency analyzer, the output can be used to determine troublesome vibrational frequencies. A dimensional analysis of the wind-induced vibration problem is also presented which suggests a test procedure. In addition a computer program for analytical studies of the forced vibration problem is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} torsion deflections and energy storage of the composite bar in torsion bar suspension system.

The experiment was carried out on a torsion test machine, which was built specifically to investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of torsion <b>spring</b> <b>bar</b> used in vehicle suspension system. This paper provides fundamental knowledge of torsion test and significant parameters such as torque, modulus of resilience in torsion and angle of twist has been highlighted. The torsion deflections were obtained experimentally. The results of experimental study are compared with the conventional torsion suspension system...|$|E
30|$|A common {{practice}} {{to correct a}} class II malocclusion with a retrognathic mandible {{is to use a}} functional appliance [[1]-[4]]. The early functional appliances are removable in nature and dependent on patient compliance for effectiveness. Removable appliances, such as the Frankel regulator, Bionator (Wehrheim, Germany), Activator (LM-Instruments Oy, Parainen, Finland), Twin Block, and even class II elastics, often have inconsistent results {{due to the fact that}} these appliances require high levels of patient cooperation [[5]]. A major advantage of fixed functional devices such as the Herbst, Jasper Jumper (3 M), MARA, and Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device (FRD; 3 M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) is that they are fixed and effective 24 Â h a day with minimal patient compliance. The treatment effects of the various types of Herbst appliances have been well documented in the literature. There is a significant amount of evidence that class II malocclusion with mandibular retrusion can be corrected with a combination of maxillary restraint, mandibular lengthening, dental changes, and glenoid fossa remodeling [[3],[6]-[8]]. However, most of the earlier design of the Herbst appliance cannot be used in combination with multibracket therapy to reduce treatment time. The FRD was introduced in 1999 and claimed to have similar results as the Herbst appliance and Class II elastic treatment [[9]]. It was also recommended as an acceptable substitute for Class II elastics for non-compliant patients [[10]]. The original appliance consisted of a NiTi <b>spring</b> <b>bar</b> with a transparent plastic coating. The spring can be attached, via its bent ends, to bands and archwires of the fixed orthodontic appliance [[11]]. The FRD is a more refined appliance to eliminate the limited movement of the other class II correctors and also the fatigue factor. The compression spring has a three-part telescoping assembly to allow enough freedom of jaw opening. The issue of fatigue fracture was addressed in the spring design based on engineering principles. Several studies have evaluated the dental and skeletal short-term effects of comprehensive fixed appliance treatment combined with the FRD in class II patients. Few studies have compared with a control sample to evaluate the exact mechanism of the appliance [[10]-[16]]. The objective of this study was to investigate the cephalometric changes of 24 patients treated with FRD in conjunction with comprehensive orthodontic treatment and compared to untreated subjects who were matched in age, sex, and craniofacial morphology.|$|E

5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses <b>spring</b> <b>bars</b> and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle. Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. Tow vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R

The circular cylinder of 100 mm in diameter and 1. 5 m in length was towed vertically at constant speeds through the towing tank to simulate uniform current condition. Some key VIV parameters such as amplitude over diameter, lift and drag coefficients are presented against a non dimensional parameter known as reduced velocity to understand the effects of VIV on two degree of freedom system. The relative magnitude of the super-upper response branch vibration amplitudes are emphasised in this particular study. Results of this paper can be used as validation materials for CFD analysis that is very important to design riser system for oil and gas industry, also mentioned experiment procedure can be treated as a guide for future endeavour to perform similar kind of tests...|$|R
