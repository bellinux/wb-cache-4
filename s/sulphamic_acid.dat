30|$|<b>Sulphamic</b> <b>acid</b> (H 2 NSO 3 H), {{is used as}} a {{cleaning}} agent in industrial equipment and for the removal of process scales in sugar industry. Sulphamic acid can be used on mild steel and stainless steel without causing pitting or chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC) [1, 2, 3].

The most frequently used and most important method of producing single crystals of a given material is by solidification of its own melt called ‘crystal growth from the melt ’ or just ‘melt growth’. Its technical and economic importance {{is due to the fact}} that large single crystals can be grown very effectively and with a high yield at a relatively high growth rate. This growth rate is not limited by the transport of crystal species but only by the removal of the heat of crystallization.

Due to the large length-to-diameter ratio composed with perfect single crystal structure and chemical homogeneity, the mechanical properties approach theoretical value.

40|$|SUMMARY It is {{now well}} {{established}} that although acetylsalicylate does {{not interfere with}} the commonly used nitration method for measuring paracetamol, salicylate does interfere. Several methods have been used to remove this interference, by solvent extraction, or to make allowance for the interference, for example, by arithmetical correction. We describe a new approach to the problem by modifying the reaction conditions in an attempt to find the optimum conditions for the nitration of paracetamol {{while at the same time}} minimising salicylate interference. A method is proposed in which the concentration of nitrite is reduced and a time delay is introduced after the addition of <b>sulphamic</b> <b>acid.</b> This method is shown to be accurate, precise, and linear and exhibits minimal interference from salicylate.
