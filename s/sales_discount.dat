These patterns in the trade direction allow us to separate the issuer pricing behavior from (i) the life cycle and (ii) the order flow.

Data for the analytical part were acquired from the questionnaire survey, which was held within several days in September and November 2015. Through the questionnaire, it was possible to examine to which degree are costumers inspired by advertising leaflets, what forms of discounts are the most sought after, whether customers are using frequent discounts and are subject to buy things impulsively, if they are shopping in sales and discount portals. Obtained data are processed by using statistical methods to test relations between qualitative characteristics and as a result is identified how the discounts can influence the costumers behaviour...|$|E

This paper presents a model in which sellers want to reduce prices periodically in order to improve their ability to collude over time. In particular, the study shows that if buyers have heterogeneous storage technologies, periodic sales may facilitate collusion by magnifying intertemporal linking in consumers' decisions. The stability and the profitability of different sale strategies is then explored. The optimal <b>sales</b> <b>discount</b> and timing of sales are characterized.

The customer profit management model shows the level of profitability of each customer for the company.

In order to simulate the phenomenon in the online environment, a 2 x 3 experimental design (low or high level of information sensitivity; 5 %, 30 %, 60 % sale discount) and a 2 x 2 experimental design (low or high level of information sensitivity; low or high level of job-hunting compensation) were implemented and assessed. The results show that privacy concern has a negative effect on information disclosure, but a positive effect on protection intention. The interactions of information sensitivity and compensation have significant effects on information disclosure and transaction intention. Additionally, information sensitivity has a negative effect on information disclosure and transaction intention. In the online purchasing environment, a 30 % <b>sales</b> <b>discount</b> performs better than either a 5 % or a 60 % discount. However, across contexts, services provided in the job hunting environment are more prized by customers than the 30 % sale discount.

Goyal ([1985]) was the first proponent for developing an economic order quantity (EOQ) model under the conditions of permissible delay in payments. Shah ([1993]) considered a stochastic inventory model when items in the inventory deteriorate and delays in payments are permissible. Aggarwal and Jaggi ([1995]) extended Goyal's model (1985) to allow the inventory to have deteriorating items. Jamal et al. ([1997]) further generalized Aggarwal and Jaggi's model (1995) to allow for shortages. Hwang and Shinn ([1997]) developed a model considering exponentially deteriorating items and found decision policy for selling price and lot size. Teng ([2002]) amended Goyal's model (1985) by considering the difference between unit price and unit cost and established an easy analytical closed-form solution to the problem. Chang et al. ([2003]) constructed a mathematical model for an EOQ inventory with deteriorating items and supplier credits are linked to ordering quantity. Chung and Huang ([2003]) generalized Goyal's EOQ model (1985) to an economic production quantity (EPQ) model in which the selling price {{is the same as}} the purchase cost. Huang ([2003]) extended Goyal's model (1985) to the case in which the supplier offers the retailer the permissible delay period M (i.e., the upstream trade credit), and the retailer in turn provides the trade credit period N (with N[*]<[*]M) to his customers (i.e., the downstream trade credit). Ouyang et al. ([2006]) developed an EOQ model for deteriorating items under trade credits. Teng and Goyal ([2007]) amended Huang's model (2003) by complementing his shortcomings. Liao ([2007]) established an EPQ model for deteriorating items under permissible delay in payments. Chang et al. ([2008]) reviewed the contributions on the literature in modeling of inventory lot sizing under trade credits. Ho et al. ([2008]) developed an integrated supplier–buyer inventory model with the assumption that demand is sensitive to retail price and the supplier adopts a two-part trade credit policy. Huang and Hsu ([2008]) have developed an inventory model under two-level trade credit policy by incorporating partial trade credit option at the customers of the retailer. Liao ([2008]) developed an EOQ model with non-instantaneous receipt and exponentially deteriorating items under two-level trade credit financing. Teng and Chang ([2009]) extended Huang's model ([2007]) by relaxing the assumption N[*]<[*]M. Jaggi et al. ([2008]) developed a simple EOQ model in which the retailer's demand is linked to credit period. Thangam and Uthayakumar ([2009]) developed an EPQ model for perishable items under two-level trade credit policy when demand depends on selling price and credit period. Teng ([2009]) developed an EOQ model for a retailer who receives a full trade credit from its supplier and offers a partial trade credit to its bad credit customers or a full trade credit to its good credit customers. Teng et al. ([2009]) developed a mathematical model for an EOQ inventory with two warehouses and solved the problem by an arithmetic–geometric inequality method. Tsao ([2009]) developed a model by considering advance <b>sales</b> <b>discount</b> and trade credits. In the paper of Tsao ([2009]), he considered a strategy, namely advance <b>sales</b> <b>discount</b> (ASD) program, that the customers can commit their orders at a discount price prior to the selling season. He considers the cases such as T[*]≥[*]t 1, t 2 [*]≤[*]T[*]≤[*]t 1, and T[*]≤[*]t 2. Chen and Kang ([2010 a]) considered trade credit and imperfect quality in an integrated vendor-buyer supply chain model.

Cárdenas-Barrón et al. ([2010]) developed a model which considers the advantage of a one-time discount offer with allowed backorders. Balkhi ([2011]) has developed a finite horizon inventory model with deteriorating items under inflation and time value of money when shortages are not allowed. Thangam and Uthayakumar ([2011]) have built a mathematical model for a retailer under two-level trade credit and two-payment methods. Tsao ([2011]) developed an EOQ model by considering trade credit and logistics risk. Teng et al.

([2011]) studied supply chain models for deteriorating items with ramp-type demand rate under permissible delay in payments. Jaggi et al. ([2012]) developed an EOQ model under two-levels of trade credit policy when demand is influenced by credit period. Liao et al. ([2012]) have developed a two-warehouse lot-sizing model with order-dependent trade credit period. Tsao and Sheen ([2012]) have developed a multi-item supply chain model with trade credit periods and weight freight cost. Thangam ([2012]) developed a two-level trade credit financing model for a supply chain with deteriorating items and advance payment scheme. Teng et al. ([2012 a]) developed vendor-buyer inventory models with trade credit financing under a non-cooperative and integrated environments. Concurrently, Teng et al. ([2012 b]) proposed an EOQ model with trade credit financing for increasing demand. Min et al. ([2012]) established an EPQ model with inventory level-dependent demand and permissible delay in payments. Tsao ([2012]) considered manufacturer's production and warranty decisions for an imperfect production system under system maintenance and trade credit. Teng et al.

([2013]) have developed an EPQ inventory model with supplier's cash discount and two-level trade credit financing. Ouyang et al. ([2013]) have developed a mathematical model with two-level trade credit financing in which trade credit offer depends on the amount of ordering quantity. Taleizadeh et al.

Chung and Cárdenas-Barrón ([2013]) presented a simplified solution procedure to an EOQ model for deteriorating items by Min et al. ([2010]) with stock-dependent demand and two-level trade credit.

Ouyang and Chang ([2013]) proposed an optimal production lot with imperfect production process under permissible delay in payments and complete backlogging. Chen et al.
