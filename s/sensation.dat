5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain <b>sensation,</b> and temperature <b>sensation</b> are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E

40|$|Possible {{interactions}} between flavor and oral texture <b>sensations</b> were investigated for four flavorants, diacetyl, benzaldehyde, vanillin, and caffeine, added in two concentrations to model vanilla custard desserts. The flavorants affected viscosities {{and resulted in}} corresponding changes in perceived thickness and melting <b>sensations.</b> In addition, flavorants affected prickling <b>sensations,</b> probably via activation of the trigeminal nerve system, and <b>sensations</b> of roughness, astringency, and dryness/mealiness.

5|$|The {{teeth and}} gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are {{generally}} sharp, lasting {{as long as}} the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic <b>sensation</b> to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant <b>sensation</b> caused by intense or damaging events.

40|$|Background: A small dose of {{intravenous}} bolus {{injection of}} lobeline (LB) {{gives rise to}} a range of <b>sensations</b> in the upper respiratory tract (named J <b>sensations)</b> including dryness, swelling, burning, suffocation in the upper respiratory tract, and dry cough. We were interested in investigating: a) whether people with coronary artery disease (CAD) feel the same kind of <b>sensations</b> with LB as those of healthy subjects, b) we also attempted to compare these <b>sensations</b> with those felt when they were exercising moderately, and c) finally, a similar comparison, undertaken in healthy subjects, allowed us to examine the origin of exercise-related <b>sensations</b> experienced by subjects with CAD. Methods: J <b>sensations</b> were evoked by threshold doses of LB in 10 CAD patients and 10 healthy subjects as control. These <b>sensations</b> were then experienced in treadmill exercise tolerance testing (Bruce Protocol) and compared. Results: Diversity and incidence of J <b>sensations</b> felt with the above protocol were significantly higher amongst CAD patients than the control subjects. CAD patients usually reported experiencing more than one kind of J <b>sensations,</b> when exercising. It is worth mentioning that dry cough was present in 30 % of CAD patients while exercising, but was absent in the health...|$|R

5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of <b>sensation,</b> and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore <b>sensation</b> to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
40|$|Objective. Grasping and {{manipulation}} control critically depends on tactile feedback. Without this feedback, {{the ability for}} fine control of a prosthesis is limited in upper limb amputees. Early {{studies have shown that}} non-invasive electro-cutaneous stimulation (ES) can induce referred <b>sensations</b> that are spread to a wider and/or more distant area, with respect to the electrodes. Building on this, we sought to exploit this effect to provide somatotopically matched sensory feedback to people with partial hand (digital) amputations. Approach. For the first time, this work investigated the possibility of inducing referred <b>sensations</b> in the digits by activating the palmar nerves. Specifically, we electrically stimulated 18 sites on the palm of non-amputees to evaluate the effects of sites and stimulation parameters on modality, magnitude, and location of the evoked <b>sensations.</b> We performed similar tests with partial hand amputees by testing those sites that had most consistently elicited referred <b>sensations</b> in non-amputees. Main results. We demonstrated referred <b>sensations</b> in non-amputees from all stimulation sites in one form or another. Specifically, the stimulation of 16 of the 18 sites gave rise to reliable referred <b>sensations.</b> Amputees experienced referred <b>sensations</b> to unimpaired digits, just like non-amputees, but we were unable to evoke referred <b>sensations</b> in their missing digits: none of them reported <b>sensations</b> that extended beyond the tip of the stump. Significance. The possibility of eliciting referred <b>sensations</b> on the digits may be exploited in haptic systems for providing touch <b>sensations</b> without obstructing the fingertips or their movements. The study also suggests that the phenomenon of referred <b>sensations</b> through ES may not be exploited for partial hand prostheses, and it invites researchers to explore alternative approaches. Finally, the results seem to confirm previous studies suggesting that the stumps in partial hand amputees partially acquire the role of the missing fingertips, physiologically and cognitively...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} synesthesia, as a psycho-physical phenomenon, can be {{characterized}} briefly as intersensory, intersensual association. As I have pointed out before, synesthesia is an essential sign of artistic thinking (for all kinds of art, including music) [I]. It should be particularly emphasized here that not only may exteroceptive <b>sensations</b> (externally stimulated <b>sensations</b> such as hearing, sight, etc.) act as components of synesthetic interrelationships (Fig. 1), but interoceptive and proprioceptive (internally generated) <b>sensations</b> may also contribute. In Fig. 2, points O 1, and O 2 represent interoceptive and proprioceptive <b>sensations,</b> respectively. Fig. 1. Rough diagram of direct synesthetic ties between external <b>sensations.</b> The interoceptive receptors register the state of internal organs- well-being, for instance- and proprioceptive <b>sensations</b> yield such information as {{the position of the}} body in space (including muscular and weight <b>sensations).</b> Interoceptive <b>sensations</b> act on the unconscious, and they are tied to our most basic emotions. These <b>sensations</b> are ancient and are part of the psychologies of all people-that is why interoception-based synesthetic phenomena are the most powerful of al emotional components. This is reflected in the broad usage of such synesthetic terms as "bright " and "dark, " in reference to sounds, and "warm " and "cool, " in reference to colors [2]. In the past, investigators did not pay particular attention to the importance of internal <b>sensations</b> in the original theories of synesthesia; they generally limited themselves to studying more exotic exteroceptive intersensory relationships (such as "color hearing " in music). However, the presence of less noticeable, "dim " <b>sensations</b> (to use I. Sechenov's term) determines more widespread intersensual relationships. When we discuss audio synesthesias, such synesthesias are relationships between "hearing " and proprioceptive <b>sensations</b> (point...|$|R

Switching to a second series of bites of another vanilla custard dessert showed larger sensory effects, especially on astringency <b>sensations</b> but also to a lesser extent on <b>sensations</b> of thickness and fatty afterfeel. Single and multiple bite results are discussed in terms of possible peripheral mechanisms. Switching results are discussed in terms of possible central sensory contrast mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced <b>sensation</b> and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost <b>sensation,</b> so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost <b>sensation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a {{stinging}} <b>sensation</b> {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating {{a stinging}} <b>sensation.</b> This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E

Different mechanical, chemical and electrical stimuli of quantitative sensory testing were applied. Attentional focus on bodily <b>sensations</b> was measured using validated questionnaires. The results indicated that focusing on bodily <b>sensations</b> is associated with higher levels of experienced itch and pain but not with tolerance to stimuli. This suggests that attentional focusing on bodily <b>sensations</b> is a mechanism responsible for sensitivity to different physical <b>sensations,</b> such as itch and pain...|$|R
