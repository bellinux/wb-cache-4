Since both data types are the result of human linguistic processing, we present a model of the architecture that such a system might have in order to produce such contrasting data.

2500|$|In the 1960s, Chomsky {{introduced}} two central ideas {{relevant to}} the construction and evaluation of grammatical theories. The first was the distinction between competence and performance. Chomsky noted the obvious fact that people, when speaking in the real world, often make linguistic errors (e.g., starting a sentence and then abandoning it midway through). He argued that these errors in linguistic performance were ir{{relevant to the}} study of linguistic competence (the knowledge that allows people to construct and understand grammatical sentences). Consequently, the linguist can study an idealised version of language, greatly simplifying linguistic analysis (see the [...] "Grammaticality" [...] section below). The second idea related directly to the evaluation of theories of grammar. Chomsky distinguished between grammars that achieve descriptive adequacy and those that go further and achieved explanatory adequacy. A descriptively <b>adequate</b> <b>grammar</b> for a particular language defines the (infinite) set of grammatical sentences in that language; that is, it describes the language in its entirety. A grammar that achieves explanatory adequacy has the additional property that it gives an insight into the underlying linguistic structures in the human mind; that is, it does not merely describe the grammar of a language, but makes predictions about how linguistic knowledge is mentally represented. For Chomsky, the nature of such mental representations is largely innate, so if a grammatical theory has explanatory adequacy it must be able to explain the various grammatical nuances of the languages of the world as relatively minor variations in the universal pattern of human language. Chomsky argued that, even though linguists were still a long way from constructing descriptively <b>adequate</b> <b>grammars,</b> progress in terms of descriptive adequacy will only come if linguists hold explanatory adequacy as their goal. In other words, real insight into the structure of individual languages can only be gained through comparative study {{of a wide range of}} languages, on the assumption that they are all cut from the same cloth.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{arguments}} which {{have led to the}} attempted con-struction of so-called text grammars {{is based on the assumption}} that the notion of grammaticalness is not absolute but relative. 1 That is, a sentence can be characterized to be grammatical only with respect to an ordered set (possibly empty) of other sentences, preceding it in a discourse. An <b>adequate</b> <b>grammar</b> may hence be required to explicate this type of grammatical relativity by formulating rules and constraints determining how the structure of sentences depends on the structure of the preceding (or perhaps following) sentences. 2 It has been shown that this sort of dependency is primarily semantic, whereas morphophonological and syntactical discourse constraints derive from the underlying semantic ones.

Although even descriptive adequacy {{on a large}} scale is by no means easy to approach, it is crucial for the productive development of linguistic theory that much higher goals than this be pursued. To facilitate the clear formulation of deeper questions, it is useful to consider the abstract problem of constructing an “acquisition model ” for language, that is, a theory of language learning or grammar construction.

40|$|In many-valued logic a {{question}} arises {{about the existence}} of a logical matrix M = (A,D) that is <b>strongly</b> <b>adequate</b> for the Lukasiewicz logic C L ∞. W. Dziobiak (e. g. [1]) proved the above to be true and concluded the existence of a Wajsberg algebra A such that the logical matrix M = (A, { 1 }) is <b>strongly</b> <b>adequate</b> for C L ∞. On the other hand, it is known that this is equivalent to the fact that every subdirectly irreducible Wajsberg algebra of cardinality at most ℵ 0 is embeddable into A [2]. This motivates the problem posed by Dziobiak: to construct an MV-algebra A such that every subdirectly irreducible MV-algebra of cardinality at most ℵ 0 is embeddable into A. We provide the desired construction based on the categorical equivalence between MV-algebras and unital abelian lattice-ordered groups. Given a subdirectly irreducible MV-algebra M of cardinality at most ℵ 0 we consider the lattice-ordered abelian group G with a strong order unit u, such that M is isomorphic to Γ(G, u) as guaranteed by the acclaimed Mundici’s Categorical Equivalence Theorem [3]. The unital group G is totally-ordered, so by the Hahn’s Representation Theorem, it embeds into the Hahn’s group V (Λ,R) for some countable chain Λ with a maximal element (e. g. [4]). This group, in turn, embeds into V (Q̂,R), with Q ̂ = Q ∪ {∞}, the chain of the rationals extended by the maximal element ∞. Thus the MV-algebra M embeds into Γ(V (Q̂,R), v), for some strong order unit v of V (Q̂,R). There exists an o-group automorphism of V (Q̂,R) mapping v on 1, the characteristic function of ∞. Thus the MV-algebra Γ(V (Q̂,R), v) is isomorphic to A = Γ(V (Q̂,R), 1) and, as a result, every MV-algebra M in concern embeds into A.

The idea of an adequate set of models was introduced by the author in [2]. Roughly speaking, an adequate set is a set consisting of countable models which are pairwise membership comparable below a particular ordinal called their comparison point. The relevance of the comparison point is that the two models have only a finite overlap past this ordinal. We presented a general framework in [2] for using adequate sets of models as side conditions in forcing on ω 2 with finite conditions.

To overcome the exponential {{increase in the number of}} higher order mutants a search process that seeks fit mutants (both first and higher order) from the space of all possible mutants is proposed. A fault-based higher order mutant classification scheme is introduced. Based on different types of fault interactions, this approach classifies higher order mutants into four categories: expected, worsening, fault masking and fault shifting. A search-based approach is then proposed for locating subsuming and strongly subsuming higher order mutants. These mutants are a subset of fault mask and fault shift classes of higher order mutants that are more difficult to kill than their constituent first order mutants.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to briefly examine two {{proposed}} extensions of statistical/probabilistic methodology, long familiar to the sciences, to linguistics. On the one hand it will be argued that the invocation of probabilistic measures is indispensable to any sensible criteria of grammatical adequacy, and on the other hand it will be suggested that probabilistic automata can be relevant to studies of language behavior. 1. The fully <b>adequate</b> (categorial/generative) <b>grammar</b> is one with which there corresponds an algorithm by means of which we can (recognize/ generate) all and only those syntactically correct sequences in the corresponding language. At this writing, there does not exist any such 2 ̆ 7 ideal 2 ̆ 7 grammar for any natural language; and as long as this situation remains, it will be necessary for the linguist to 2 ̆ 7 rank 2 ̆ 7 competing grammars for both reasons of suitability for corpora, and assessment in terms of potential adequacy. Because of the prima facie potential of the transformational grammars introduced since the mid- 19502 ̆ 7 s, linguists have not made any rigorous attempt at providing a measure of descriptive adequacy of grammars. Lately, such intuitive criteria as simplicity, intuitivity, economy, etc. have been levied against competing grammars, in adjudication of adequacy. But these are certainly not the kinds of objective criteria necessary to any independently valuable method of resolving disputes over relative adequacy. This is not to say that these quasi-criteria are without import to the linguist. Surely, in a ceteris paribus situation it is reasonable to prefer the simpler model to the more complex. But up to now there is no method of 2 ̆ 7 ranking 2 ̆ 7 available by which we can determine when a ceteris paribus situation obtains. In linguistics, just as in the sciences, only when the adequacies of competing models are established are issues of simplicity, economy and the like, germane. Certainly, the application of statistical/probabilistic procedures to the field of linguistics is not new. Precedents have been established in taxonomic studies, analyses of distributions of word types in corpora (viz. Zipf 2 ̆ 7 s Law), etc. But the notion of using an interjacent probabilistic grammar in determining descriptive adequacy is quite innovative. Of the recent developments in this area, perhaps the most notable is that of Suppes (1970). Suppes 2 ̆ 7 motivation for this paper was the disregard of conventional grammatical models to such fundamental and universal characteristics of natural languages as relatively short utterance length, predominance of grammatically simple utterances, etc. It seems irrational to Suppes to be tolerant of grammars which pay an inordinate amount of attention to those syntactic structures which are 2 ̆ 7 deviant, 2 ̆ 7 or at least atypical of general usage, and whose relative frequency of occurrence in the corpus is low. To put the matter differently, if any putatively <b>adequate</b> <b>grammar</b> is to be of value, it must be able to account for a sizeable portion of the corpus, thereby identifying those grammatical types which demand further scrutiny. In order to establish the relative values for alternative grammars, Suppes suggests we consult a probabilistic grammar...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides an}} explicit syntactic and semantic {{account for a}} reasonably large sample of question constructions in Swedish. Within generative grammar, the existence of non-local dependencies as in constituent questions has been taken as evidence for the need to postulate transformational rules in the grammar of natural languages. Recently a number of linguists have proposed ways of handling such dependencies without transformations. Until now, these proposals {{have been based on}} English. In this study, we investigate the possibility of extending non-transformational approaches to languages like Swedish where question formation differs from English in a significant way. In Swedish, more than one constituent can be extracted from a clause. We discuss the consequences of this fact for transformational and non-transformational approaches to Swedish. It is shown that the non-transformational approaches need to be substantially modified in order to provide a syntactically and semantically <b>adequate</b> <b>grammar</b> for Swedish. The implications of these modifications are assessed {{from the point of view}} of choosing between grammars. The main part of the dissertation consists of an analysis of the semantics of constituent questions. We propose an extension to the semantics for questions in the framework of Montague grammar given by Hamblin and Karttunen. Most current approaches to questions take the entire question phrase to be the interrogative quantifier. We point out that these approaches are not adequate for questions where the interrogative phrase contains an anaphor bound from inside the sentence. In addition, these approaches cannot account for all readings of temporally ambiguous sentences. To allow the semantic rules to handle such cases as well, a more general approach to questions is proposed. On this approach, only the 2 ̆ 7 which 2 ̆ 7 part of the question phrase constitutes the interrogative quantifier. This quantifier ranges not over individuals directly, as in the previous theories, but over functions that pick out sets of individuals. In simple questions, the result of the proposed analysis is tantamount to the results on earlier approaches. However, it is shown that only the proposed approach can generalize to more complex questions. The analysis proposed here is compared to current approaches to questions within transformational grammar. Finally, we discuss the relative merits of a structurally based and a semantically based approach to anaphoric relations...|$|R

Word order variation can essentially perform the same functions as movement transformations. The two are similar in their function and operation in that they allow rearrangement of elements or constituents, and indicate semantic and pragmatic differences. ^ So far, very little has been done in linguistics on the subject of word order in Hindi. I have shown that this is a much larger subject than might be supposed. An <b>adequate</b> <b>grammar</b> of Hindi ought to take this subject into account. In this study, I have touched upon the following areas of word order: basic word order, syntactic restrictions, and discourse functions of varying orders. ^ Chapter 1, an introduction to the present study, argues that word order variation in flexible word order languages like Hindi is similar to movement transformations in languages with less flexible word orders. In chapter 2, I deal with the issue of basic word order in general theory and in Hindi. With the help of a few tests I support the general hypothesis that the basic word order in Hindi is SOV. In chapter 3, I look at the syntactic restrictions on the movement of elements or constituents in simple and complex sentences. I show that there are very few constraints on the movement of major constituents but that there are severe constraints on the movement of elements or constituents when they move into other constituents or phrases. In chapter 4, I focus on one particular movement, Topicalization. I show that in Hindi, a formal constraint cannot explain all the data concerning topicalization but that these can be explained with the functional notion 2 ̆ 7 topicality 2 ̆ 7. In chapter 5, I demonstrate that difference in Hindi word order mainly serve to achieve different discourse functions, including suspense, emphasis, de-emphasis, and announcement of topic. The use of word order variation for expressing grammatical relations and semantic reasons is limited. The sixth and last chapter contains a summary and conclusions of the present study. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new connectionist approach to grammatical inference. Using only positive examples, the algorithm learns regular graph grammars, representing two-dimensional iterative structures drawn on a discrete Cartesian grid. This work is {{intended as a}} case study in connectionist symbol processing and geometric conceptformation. A grammar is represented by a self-configuring connectionist network that is analogous to a transition diagram except that it can deal with graph grammars as easily as string grammars. Learning starts with a trivial grammar, expressing no grammatical knowledge, which is then refined, by a process of successive node splitting and merging, into a <b>grammar</b> <b>adequate</b> to describe the population of input patterns. In conclusion, I argue that the connectionist style of computation is, in some ways, better suited than sequential computation to the task of representing and manipulating recursive structures. 1. Introduction Connectionism is conventionally seen [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding 142 hospital admissions for acute asthma in 110 children during a one year period were examined. Thirty four of 106 (32 %) children with previous wheezing {{had not been}} diagnosed as asthmatic, nor received effective antiasthmatic medication. Nineteen of 36 (53 %) known, but undertreated, asthmatics were {{under the care of}} the hospital paediatricians. Twenty-four of 58 (41 %) regular school attenders had missed more than 11 days' school in the previous year. Good parental understanding of their child's illness was <b>strongly</b> associated with <b>adequate</b> treatment. Parental understanding was, however, poor in 58 of 137 (42 %) admissions. Control of inadequately treated chronic symptoms was obtained by simple and straightforward changes in treatment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{introduction}} into {{the principles of}} interactivity in music video games. Music video games are an old but small genre of games. The earliest direct ancestors emerged in the 1970 ies. Some recent music video games were hugely successful. Until today, {{there are only a}} few different approaches to their design. The purpose of this article is to shed light on what these design principles are, and how the player is immersed. By analysing several games qualitatively, we extracted certain typical features of games of this genre: active scores, rhythm action, quantisation, synaesthesia, play as performance, free-form play, and sound agents. All these aspects of music video games are discussed in this paper with the aim of describing how they affect the interactivity of the games. The result is a grammar of the language of music video games. Linked to <b>adequate</b> metaphors, this <b>grammar</b> can build a veritable repository for rhythm based, melodically interactive games and digital electronic instruments...|$|R
40|$|Plateau State, Nigeria is reported. About 15 cattle, 20 {{goats and}} 8 sheep are {{slaughtered}} on daily basis in this government-owned and managed slaughter facility which has served the locality for upward of 30 years since inception. In this case report, the procedure of slaughter, inspection, processing {{and marketing of}} {{the products of the}} abattoir are presented. Personal observations were made and buttressed by photographs on the operations of the slaughter facility. This practice poses high risk of contamination of meat and meat products with harmful bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic or chemical agents that can cause severe or even fatal disease in humans. We, therefore, <b>strongly</b> recommend that <b>adequate</b> measures be taken by all stake holders to both fund and enforce existing legislations bordering on issues of food hygiene and community health...|$|R
