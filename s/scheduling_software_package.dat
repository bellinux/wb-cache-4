40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{of projects}} has {{gained increasing attention}} since the introduction of PERT and CPM. Both the scheduling literature and the <b>software</b> <b>scheduling</b> <b>packages</b> rely on (meta-) heuristic and exact procedures to schedule projects under various assumptions. However, there is still room for improvement by incorporating specific characteristics into the scheduling procedures. In this paper we describe the scheduling of a real-life project that aims at {{the construction of a}} tunnel at the Westerschelde in the Netherlands. In doing so, we show that so-called work continuity is the main issue during the <b>scheduling</b> phase. No <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> however, is able to incorporate this requirement in an exact way.

The second schedule is produced using BPS, which is a constraint-based scheduler following the principle of the Activity-based approach. A comparison is made between the two schedules considering three different aspects: (1) User input requirements to the problem (2) Quality of the schedule produced (3) Solution statistics. Interestingly, the two schedules produced by the two different approaches are slightly different, although both of them satisfied the product delivery requirement...|$|E

40|$|Common {{practice}} in scheduling under limited resource availability is to first schedule activities {{with the assumption}} of unlimited resources, and then assign required resources to activities until available resources are exhausted. The process of matching a feasible resource plan with a feasible schedule is called resource allocation. Then, to avoid sharp fluctuations in the resource profile, further adjustments are applied to both schedule and resource allocation plan {{within the limits of}} feasibility constraints. This process is referred to as resource leveling in the literature. Combination of these three stages constitutes the standard approach of top-down scheduling. In contrast, when scarce and/or expensive resource is to be scheduled, first a feasible and economical resource usage plan is established and then activities are scheduled accordingly. This practice is referred to as bottom-up scheduling in the literature. Several algorithms are developed and implemented in various commercial <b>scheduling</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> to <b>schedule</b> based on either of these approaches. However, in reality resource loaded scheduling problems are somewhere in between these two ends of the spectrum. Additionally, application of either of these conventional approaches results in just a feasible resource loaded schedule which is not necessarily the cost optimal solution. In order to find the cost optimal solution, activity scheduling and resource allocation problems should be considered jointly. In other words, these two individual problems should be formulated and solved as an integrated optimization problem. In this research, a novel integrated optimization model is proposed for solving the resource loaded scheduling problems with concentration on construction heavy equipment being the targeted resource type. Assumptions regarding this particular type of resource along with other practical assumptions are provided for the model through inputs and constraints. The objective function is to minimize the fraction of the execution cost of resource loaded schedule which varies based on the selected solution and thus, considered to be the model's decision making criterion. This fraction of cost which hereafter is referred to as operation cost, encompasses four components namely schedule delay cost, shipping, rental and ownership costs for equipment...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] “Just {{like other}} {{educational}} institutions, law schools must schedule courses by {{taking into consideration}} student needs, faculty resources, and logistical support such as classroom size and equipment needs. Course scheduling is an administrative function, typically handled by an Assistant Dean or an Associate Dean, who works with the faculty and the registrar to balance these considerations {{in advance of the}} registration process. Usually, the entire academic year is scheduled in advance, although the spring semester may be labeled tentative until registration begins for that semester. It’s hard to imagine, but some schools even publish a two-year schedule of upper-division courses so that students can plan their entire law school career in advance. In order to give assistance to those academics involved {{for the first time in}} the scheduling process, this article discusses the law school scheduling process and how a <b>scheduling</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> has worked to successfully automate what has been seen as one of the most abysmal administrative tasks of an Associate Dean. We first provide a background to course scheduling at a typical law school. We then present a review of the tools for, and literature on, course scheduling, followed by a discussion of how technology can be applied to course scheduling in general, and our outcomes of applying this technology in a law school environment. We close with a brief summary. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. The South African sugar {{industry}} is of significant {{local and international}} importance and covers an area in excess of 450 000 hectares. This area yields approximately 21 million tons of sugarcane per annum which is transported almost exclusively by road, from farms to the sugar mills. The industry is under increasing economic pressures to improve its productivity and competitiveness and sugarcane transport in the sugarcane supply chain {{has been identified as}} one area where large improvements and associated cost reductions can be made. This is mainly due to the excess in number of vehicles in the inbound transport system, the high relative cost of transport compared to other production costs in producing sugarcane, and the high fixed costs associated with truck fleet operations. A simulation case study of the transport system was completed in 2005 in the Sezela Mill area in which approximately 2. 2 million tons of sugarcane is transported per annum over an average distance of 29 km by approximately 120 independently managed vehicles owned by a wide range of hauliers and individual growers. This amounts to an estimated cost of R 58 million per annum. This study investigated the potential savings that could occur {{as a result of a}} central fleet control system with integrated vehicle scheduling. A <b>scheduling</b> <b>software</b> <b>package</b> named ASICAM, which resulted in significant savings in the timber industry (Weintraub et al, 1996), was applied within the Sezela region. Results suggested that the number of trucks in the fleet could theoretically be reduced by at least 50 %, providing that a central office controls vehicle movements and that all hauliers serve all growers in an equitable fashion. In addition, investigations towards decreasing loading times, decreasing offloading times, changing vehicle speeds and increasing payloads by reducing trailer tare mass showed further reductions in the number of trucks required...|$|E

This means that the crew {{will have to take}} an active role in scheduling and rescheduling their activities onboard, perhaps working from preliminary schedules generated on the ground.
