50|$|The {{record that}} Greaves {{attempted}} {{had been set}} three years earlier by the Australian professional Ossie Nicholson. John Naylor said: Nicholson completed his ride in fine Australian weather, on good roads, with the best equipment and even a <b>back-up</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Much of it was even done on a smooth track, using a special bike. He had a masseur, and a manager who did all the planning, booking and ordering. The contrast with Walter Greaves couldn't be more stark.|$|R
50|$|All three presenters {{are highly}} competitive; {{vandalism}} and sabotage are commonplace, and any presenter whose car breaks down during a challenge will typically be abandoned {{to make their}} own way to the designated destination. Certain challenges since the African Cheap Car Road Trip have had a back-up car made available for any presenter whose car breaks down and cannot be repaired. The <b>back-up</b> <b>vehicle</b> is generally a model that is loathed by all three presenters, or in some other way antagonistic to the current challenge.|$|R
50|$|The armed {{struggle}} degenerated into the so-called dirty war, which claimed {{thousands of lives}} and cast a heavy shadow over Argentine politics well into the 21st century. Genta himself would be the victim of such violence: on October 27, 1974, a People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) guerrilla shot Genta eleven times {{as he was leaving}} his home. Genta died immediately. The gunner left the scene in a getaway car followed by two <b>back-up</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Genta was survived by his wife, two children and two grandchildren.|$|R
5000|$|Salyut 7 was the <b>back-up</b> <b>vehicle</b> for Salyut 6 {{and very}} similar in {{equipment}} and capabilities. With delays to the Mir programme {{it was decided}} to launch the <b>back-up</b> <b>vehicle</b> as Salyut 7. In orbit the station suffered technical failures though it benefited from the improved payload capacity of the visiting Progress and Soyuz craft and the experience of its crews who improvised many solutions (such as a fuel line rupture in September 1983 requiring EVAs by the Soyuz T-10 to repair). It was aloft for eight years and ten months (a record not broken until Mir), during which time it was visited by 10 crews constituting six main expeditions and four secondary flights (including French and Indian cosmonauts). The station also saw two flights of Svetlana Savitskaya making her the second woman in space since 1963 and the first to perform an EVA during which she conducted metal cutting and welding alongside her colleague Vladimir Dzhanibekov. Aside from the many experiments and observations made on Salyut 7, the station also tested the docking and use of large modules with an orbiting space station. The modules were called [...] "Heavy Kosmos modules" [...] though in reality were variants of the TKS spacecraft intended for the cancelled Almaz military space station. They helped engineers develop technology necessary to build Mir.|$|R

50|$|The heroism of {{individual}} PPP supporters, {{many of whom}} sacrificed themselves to protect Ms Bhutto should have been properly canalised by the Chief of PPP’s security Rehman Malik. More serious, Ms Bhutto was left vulnerable in a severely damaged vehicle by the irresponsible and hasty departure of the bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz which, as the <b>back-up</b> <b>vehicle,</b> was {{an essential part of}} her convoy purposefully taken away by Rehman Malik, Babar Awan & Farhatullah Babar.....The collection of 23 pieces of evidence was manifestly inadequate in a case that should have resulted in thousands....Hosing down the crime scene so soon after the blast goes beyond mere incompetence and needed fixing criminal responsibility on many.The deliberate prevention by CPO Saud Aziz of a post mortem examination of Ms Bhutto hindered a definitive determination of the cause of her death. It was patently unrealistic for the CPO to expect that Mr Zardari would allow an autopsy on his arrival in Pakistan while in the meantime her remains had been placed in a coffin and brought to the airport. The autopsy should have been carried out at RGH long before Mr Zardari arrived. The Commission was persuaded that the Rawalpindi police chief, CPO Saud Aziz, did not act independently of higher authorities, either in the decision to hose down the crime scene or to impede the post-mortem examination.|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{companies}} sponsoring events has increased over the past decade. Yet, for many firms {{it is unclear how}} the effectiveness of event marketing activities can be measured. The study examines outcomes associated with an automobile manufacturer s sponsorship of a six-day charitable sporting event. Data for the study were collected from a sample of 565 spectators in five cities during the six-day event. Results provide evidence for inclusion of event marketing in the company s promotional mix and indicate that experience with the <b>sponsor</b> <b>s</b> products during the event may enhance event outcomes. The role of event marketing as a form of communication is discussed, and recommendations and directions for future research are suggested. ...|$|R
