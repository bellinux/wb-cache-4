25|$|The {{first major}} area in <b>semantic</b> <b>analysis</b> is the {{identification}} of the intended meaning at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense disambiguation (a concept that is evolving away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by {{the ways in which they}} are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.|$|E
25|$|In April 1997, Martha Palmer and Marc Light {{organized}} a workshop entitled Tagging with Lexical Semantics: Why, What, and How? {{in conjunction with}} the Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing. At the time, there was a clear recognition that manually annotated corpora had revolutionized other areas of NLP, such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, and that corpus-driven approaches had the potential to revolutionize automatic <b>semantic</b> <b>analysis</b> as well. Kilgarriff recalled that there was “a high degree of consensus that the ﬁeld needed evaluation,” and several practical proposals by Resnik and Yarowsky kicked off a discussion that {{led to the creation of}} the Senseval evaluation exercises.|$|E
25|$|Together, {{semantic}} and {{episodic memory}} make up our declarative memory. They each represent {{different parts of}} context to form a complete picture. As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect semantic memory. For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of declarative memory that affects both episodic and semantic memory operations. Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and semantic memory were separate systems that competed {{with each other in}} retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent <b>semantic</b> <b>analysis</b> (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in semantic similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so semantic cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.|$|E
40|$|Recently, gesture {{interaction}} {{has been}} rapidly adopted for consumer produdcts to implement Natural User Interaction. This {{study focused on}} analysis of users’ perception on gesture interaction, which could be categorized as follows: semaphoric gesture interaction and manipulative gesture interaction. Contents <b>analysis</b> and <b>semantic</b> network <b>analysis</b> were conducted to contrast existing UX issues in the two gesture interactions. From the contents analysis on user reviews, {{it is found that}} semaphoric gesture interation intrigued more usability issues than manipulative gesture interaction, and the issues emphasized efficiency and accuracy rather than fun and flexibility. From the <b>semantic</b> network <b>analysis,</b> it is found that fun and physical fatigue were the most distinguished among 121 keywords used in users’ descriptions of semaphoric gesture interaction while accuracy and familiarity were relatively important for manipulative gesture interaction. Also, it is observed that having hands-on experiences changed the structures of users’ semantic network for both gesture interactions. Based on the content <b>analysis</b> and <b>semantic</b> network <b>analysis,</b> the following six UX issues are identified: limited by hardware, intuitive interaction, familiarity effect, eye-motor coordination, fatigue in repetition, and integrity in interaction. ope...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the structure of the}} International Communication Association (ICA) through <b>semantic</b> network <b>analysis.</b> <b>Semantic</b> network <b>analysis</b> examines the relationships among a system's components based on the shared meanings of symbols. Galileo analysis and Quadratic Analysis Procedure revealed that the semantic network for ICA based on paper titles presented to its divisions and interest groups at its 2992 conference had a high degree of correspondence with the affiliation structure reported by Barnett and Danowski. Both net-works differentiated the humanistic divisionsfrom the scientific, the mediafedfrom the inter-personal, and the theoreticalfrom the applied. The results are taken to be an indication of the validity of the procedures employed for determining semantic networks. Finally, results are interpreted in regard to Human Communication Research's relationship to its parent organi-zation, ICA. emantic network analysis, similar to network analysis, is both a research method and a theoretical framework (Doerfel, 1998). S <b>Semantic</b> network <b>analysis</b> differs from traditional network methods because it focuses on the structure of a system based on shared meaning rather than on links among communication partners. In other words, two nodes are connected in a semantic network to the extent that their uses of concepts overlap. The meaning-centered network approach stems from Monge and Eisenberg's (1987) call to enhance traditional net-work analysis by focusing on communication content. Semantic networ...|$|R

Social networking sites also include much information about what products and services prospective clients might be interested in.

The Interest Graph is initially constructed by collecting, with permission, user data from Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Google Reader or Evernote.

25|$|Process indices {{examine how}} {{individuals}} process information in their environment, such as by analyzing communication patterns between team members or using eye tracking devices. Team communication (particularly verbal communication) supports the knowledge building and information processing {{that leads to}} SA construction (Endsley & Jones, 1997). Thus, since SA may be distributed via communication, computational linguistics and machine learning techniques can be combined with natural language analytical techniques (e.g., Latent <b>Semantic</b> <b>Analysis)</b> to create models that draw on the verbal expressions of the team to predict SA and task performance (Bolstad, Cuevas, Gonzalez, & Schneider, 2005; Bolstad, Foltz, Franzke, Cuevas, Rosenstein, & Costello, 2007). Although evidence exists to support the utility of communication analysis for predicting team SA (Foltz, Bolstad, Cuevas, Franzke, Rosenstein, & Costello, in press), time constraints and technological limitations (e.g., cost and availability of speech recording systems and speech-to-text translation software) may make this approach less practical and viable in time-pressured, fast-paced operations.|$|E
