5|$|Many organosodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} prepared. Because {{of the high}} polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa). Because of the large size and very low polarising power of the Na+ cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zinc has an {{electron}} configuration of 3d104s2 {{and is a}} member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b> The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, , by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.|$|E
5|$|From the hydride {{electron}} pair, one electron {{is transferred}} to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b> The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
50|$|To {{tell which}} is the <b>strongest</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> one can change the sign of its {{respective}} reduction potential to make it oxidation potential. The bigger the number, the <b>stronger</b> the <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b> For example, among Na, Cr, Cu and Cl−, Na is the <b>strongest</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> and Cl− is the weakest one.|$|R

5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion is a very <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E

5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have many}} applications, {{the most well-known}} being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap. Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals. Being a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> it {{is often used to}} reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron absorption.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, {{the most common}} of which being tetrahydrofuran. The most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
50|$|Forming {{aldehydes}} from {{carboxylic acid}} derivatives {{is often a}} challenge, because weaker <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> (NaBH4) are incapable of reducing esters and carboxylic acids, which are relatively stable, and <b>stronger</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> (LiAlH4) immediately <b>reduce</b> the formed aldehyde to an alcohol.|$|R
25|$|Titanium dioxide is {{incompatible}} with <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> and <b>strong</b> acids. Violent or incandescent reactions occur with molten metals that are very electropositive, e.g. aluminium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and lithium.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the action}} of oxidants ({{potassium}} permanganate, potassium dichromate) polythionic acids and their salts are oxidized to sulfate, and the interaction with <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> (amalgam of sodium) converts them into sulfites and dithionites.|$|R
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> such as ascorbic acid, to a sulfide-containing solution is sometimes used to prevent sulfide oxidation from atmospheric oxygen. Although it is certainly a sound precaution for the determination of sulfide with an ion selective electrode, it might however hamper {{the development of the}} blue color if the freshly formed methylene blue is also reduced, as described here above in the paragraph on redox indicator.|$|E
500|$|Gallium {{reacts with}} the chalcogens only at {{relatively}} high temperatures.

50|$|Lithium {{borohydride}} (LiBH4) is a tetrahydroborate {{and known}} in organic synthesis as a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> for esters.

30|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that in a {{traditional}} polyol process to obtain metal nanoparticles, EG acts not only as an organic solvent but also as a <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> [24]. The use of EG to reduce Cu(II) species at a relative high temperature would produce Cu nanoparticles > 30 nm due to its inherently mild reducing ability [7]. At room temperature, EG is unlikely involved in the reduction of Cu(II) species, and the introduction of a much <b>stronger</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> is believed to be a crucial factor for achieving much smaller particle sizes, given that the nucleation and growth processes are greatly dependent on the power of <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> [15]. Briefly, weaker <b>reducing</b> <b>agents</b> benefit further growth of the existing nuclei leading to larger particles. With <b>stronger</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> the larger nucleation probability would be expected, in favor of the formation of more ultrafine nanoparticles.|$|R
500|$|Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6, {{the last}} being most stable. In the {{hexavalent}} state, uranium {{is very similar}} to the group 6 elements. Many compounds of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are non-stoichiometric, i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO2+x, where x varies between −0.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak oxidants. Most of them contain the linear [...] "uranyl" [...] group, [...] Between 4 and 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group. The uranyl group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. [...] and [...] are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b> Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms organometallic compounds, such as UIII(C5H5)3 and UIV(C5H5)4.|$|E
500|$|Cobaltocene, Co(C5H5)2, is a metallocene, the cobalt {{analogue}} of ferrocene. It {{is a dark}} purple solid. Cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons, {{one more}} than usually found in organotransition metal complexes, such as its very stable relative, ferrocene, {{in accordance with the}} 18-electron rule. This additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the Co–C bonds. Consequently, many chemical reactions of Co(C5H5)2 are characterized by its tendency to lose this [...] "extra" [...] electron, yielding a very stable 18-electron cation known as cobaltocenium. Many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts, and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate. Like the alkali metals, cobaltocene is a <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent,</b> and decamethylcobaltocene is stronger still due to the combined inductive effect of the ten methyl groups. Cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene, an even stronger reducing agent.

500|$|Lithium {{and sodium}} react with carbon to form acetylides, Li2C2 and Na2C2, {{which can also}} be {{obtained}} by reaction of the metal with acetylene. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium react with graphite; their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers, forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae MC60 (dark grey, almost black), MC48 (dark grey, almost black), MC36 (blue), MC24 (steel blue), and MC8 (bronze) (M = K, Rb, or Cs). These compounds are over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite, suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers (e.g. [...] ). Upon heating of KC8, the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to KC24, KC36, KC48 and finally KC60. KC8 is a very <b>strong</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water. While the larger alkali metals (K, Rb, and Cs) initially form MC8, the smaller ones initially form MC6, and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around 500°C to form. Apart from this, the alkali metals are such strong reducing agents that they can even reduce buckminsterfullerene to produce solid fullerides MnC60; sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium can form fullerides where n = 2, 3, 4, or 6, and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve n = 1.|$|E
