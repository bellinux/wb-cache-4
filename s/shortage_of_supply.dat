50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Salim Huneidi, {{who worked as}} an agent for an {{international}} Steel Structure and Construction company {{felt that there was}} a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> of cutting and welding gases in Kuwait. He began researching the industrial processes to supply to the growing demand of industrial gases and built the Arabian Gulf’s first oxygen separation plant in 1953 in Kuwait City, under the name Kuwait Oxygen and Acetylene Company (KOAC).|$|E
50|$|The dwindling {{forests that}} did not {{regenerate}} themselves led to erosion of the soils, including those suitable for agricultural, {{in the wake of}} which, fields and settlements had to be abandoned. The result was a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> especially in time of war. Given the devastating effects of overexploitation arising for the reasons set out above, territorial lords imposed official regulations for the use of woodland, a case in point being the 1579 Hohenlohe Forest regulations.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{a period}} of {{economic}} collapse and the following Sierra Leone Civil War inflation became rampant, devaluing older coins. A new coin series was introduced in 1996 for 10, 50 and 100 leones. The 50 leones is octagonal while {{the other two are}} round. These coins were struck in nickel-plated steel and feature important figures in Sierra Leone's political history. Ten sided, bimetallic 500 leones coins were first introduced in 2004. Of the four coins in circulation, only the 100 leones is available in small quantity due to their low valuation and <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E

Doha's population currently stands at around one million, with {{the population of the}} city more than doubling from 2000 to 2010. Due to the high influx of expatriates, the Qatari housing market saw a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> which led to a rise in prices and increased inflation. The gap in the housing market between supply and demand has narrowed, however, and property prices have fallen in some areas following a period which saw rents triple in some areas.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} his undergraduate studies overseas, Sameer Mehra returned to India in 1998 {{with the idea}} of organic contract farming. There was a growing global demand for organic produce and India had unique advantages that made it a natural choice for cultivating these products: tropical weather and varied landscape ensure agro-climatic diversity and a broad range of crops year-round. Due to the high costs as well as local traditions, fertilizers and pesticides have low penetration throughout much of India. With a US$23 billion global market for organic foods in 2002 alone, and a huge <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> Mehra saw an opportunity to supply organic food from India.|$|E

50|$|The 63 {{series was}} {{originally}} introduced in 1944 {{as a means}} of transporting increasing number of workers commuting to factories of arms and other industries. Between 1944 and 1945, very few of these trains were in production, therefore postwar construction of these trains increased dramatically. These trains had brown, steel bodies. The cars were designed under the overall goal of mass transportation amid the serious <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> in the wartime. This resulted in long body (20 meters), many doors (four per side), less seating, lack of ceiling and new design of side windows (consisting of three frames: only upper and lower frames can be opened).|$|E
5000|$|Recent surveys on retail out-of-stocks {{suggests}} that instore operations are fundamental to reducing retail out-of-stocks. Around 70-90% of stockouts {{are caused by}} defective shelf replenishment practices, {{as opposed to the}} 10-30% resulting from the upstream supply chain, such as a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> from a supplier. [...] This broad knowledge offers retailers the opportunity to improve on-shelf availability through internal measures. However, it requires a detailed understanding of the causes for out-of-stocks.A shortage of working capital may limit the value of orders that can be placed each month. This could be caused by poor cash flow management or other inventory issues such as too much cash tied up in high levels of excess.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, nickel {{was in high}} demand due to the Vietnam War, {{but there was a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> due to {{industrial}} action against the major Canadian supplier Inco. These factors pushed the price of nickel to record levels, peaking at around £7,000/ton on the London market early in November 1969. [...] In September 1969, the mining company Poseidon NL made a major nickel discovery at Windarra in the Shire of Laverton, Western Australia. In early September their shares had been trading at $0.80, but as information about the discovery was released, the price rose until it was trading at $12.30 on October 1. After this, very little further information came to light, but the price continued to climb due to speculation; at one point, a UK broker suggested a value of up to $382 a share.|$|E

50|$|According {{to the law}} of {{marginal}} utility, {{the value}} of each good in a stock of identical goods is utility of the last and most easily dispensable unit. That is why price is said to be determined by supply and demand: the price reflects the (approximate and average) value of the good, but most closely reflects the value of the last use. If there is a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> the good will cease being applied to its least important uses. All else being equal, the price will increase and the increase in price represents, so to speak, the value we attribute to the new last use. Before, with a larger supply, the last use was of less value to us. With a smaller supply the value of the last use is necessarily more important because we always satisfy our more important wants first. Therefore, the increase in price {{can be seen as a}} reflection of the increase in value we attribute to the last use of the supply.|$|E
5000|$|He defined {{purchasing}} {{media for}} {{the academic community}} in very specific terms. [...] However, for the layperson, he recommended that people think of purchasing media as coins, paper currency, or checks that are claims on goods or services, much as is implied in the expression [...] "promissory notes." [...] He used the metaphor of a baggage claim check. [...] Banks issuing paper notes should only do so, he claimed, in direct ratio {{to the amount of}} gold in their vaults (under a gold standard) and to the things their customers were bringing to market; and any issuance above that amount would be, by definition, [...] "inflationary," [...] i.e. it will tend to cause price increases over and above those caused by direct cause-effect relationships among normal supply and demand forces. [...] Such [...] "inflationary" [...] price increases are different from those caused, for example, by a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> or by a rise in demand, because they are caused by a devaluation of the purchasing media itself through excessive issuance.|$|E
50|$|The total {{estimated}} revenue {{of the province}} in 1949-50 was Rs. 62.98 lakhs and the estimated expenditure stood at Rs. 87.69 lakhs. The main products of Coorg include coffee, tea and rubber. Coorg was one of India's largest producers of tea {{with a total of}} 415 acres under tea cultivation. During the rule of the Coorg Rajahs, rice was the most important crop cultivated. It was replaced by coffee when the state passed into British rule. The first coffee plantation was established near Mercara in 1854. From 1854 to 1870, coffee cultivation in Coorg expanded rapidly as exports increased from 579 tons in 1857 to 3,000 tons in 1867 and 4,880 tons in 1876. Coffee production slowed down due to a blight in 1870 in 1871 but recovered quickly reaching the peak of production between 1878 and 1883. Coffee prices fell by 40 percent between 1879 and 1889 due to the competition of imported Brazilian coffee on the local market but recovered in 1890 when there was a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> from Brazil. With fluctuating fortunes, coffee continues to be Coorg's most important source of revenue.|$|E

5000|$|Japan used Java as its {{operation}} {{base for the}} entire South East Asia, thus Java {{was one of the}} most oppressed places in Indonesia during the occupation. The Javanese farmers were forced to plant rice and sell it only to the Japanese organization at a very low price. In consequence, the farmers had nothing much to eat no matter how great the harvest was. They also could not buy some foods in the market because of <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> since all farmers had to sell their rice to the Japanese organization only, and lack of money, for the farmers received very small amount of money in exchange for their harvest. At the end of 1944, more than 2.4 million Javanese died because of starvation. Nobody was an exception in the Japanese cruelty. Almost every man and woman in their productive age were recruited to join rōmusha (the Japanese word for Indonesian forced labourers). Many of them died helpless due to continuous working, illness without any proper food or medication. Many Indonesian women were also deceived and sent away from their homes, eventually ended up as comfort women for the Japanese forces all over South East Asia.|$|E

5000|$|If a {{hurricane}} struck Florida {{and there was}} a shortage of water, everything else equal, the price of bottled water would increase. Water in Florida, before this shortage, was used for drinking water, cooking, watering plants, and bathing. With the tap off, the price of bottled water has increased {{to such an extent that}} bottled water will surely not be purchased for watering plants or bathing. That is, the increase in price reflects the increase in the value we attribute to the last use of the last unit in the supply of the good. To explain, before the hurricane, water was valued according to the fact that it would be used for bathing and watering plants. Now, with a shortage, it is valued according to its ability to quench thirst and cook food. The latter uses importance is [...] "approximated" [...] in the price of the good. The bottled water which now costs, say, $20 a bottle, is an approximation of the value attribute to drinking water, cooking water, and whatever else it might be used for at the higher price—given that previous uses are not considered due to the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and its corollary, the increase in price. That is why it is said that a homogeneous stock of goods is valued according to its final utility—according to its last use of a stock of a good.|$|E
