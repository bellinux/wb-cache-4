40|$|The NIOSH <b>Engineering</b> <b>Control</b> Pro- gram {{seeks to}} protect workers by en- gineering {{interventions}} {{that can be}} used to eliminate or more safely work around hazards. This snapshot shows recent accomplishments and upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) <b>Engineering</b> <b>Controls</b> Program seeks to protect workers by removing hazardous conditions or by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard. The program works with partners in industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia on these areas: 1. Reducing silica exposure at U. S. highway construction sites using <b>engineering</b> <b>controls.</b> 2. Reducing global asphalt fume exposure using <b>engineering</b> <b>controls.</b> 3. Protecting flavorings workers from exposure to Diacetyl and 2, 3 -Pentanedione. What do we do? 1. Increase awareness and use of silica dust controls and practices for work tasks linked to silica exposure. 2. Promote the use of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> for silica and asphalt fume to industry, regulatory agencies and consensus standard bodies. 3. Promote the use of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> for Diacetyl and food flavorings that contain Diacetyl to industry, regulatory agencies and consensus standard bodies. What have we accomplished? 1. NIOSH and the national Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership published an <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> best practices document to control silica dust exposure from asphalt milling machines. 2. Members of the national Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership have formally agreed to install NIOSH-recommended silica dust controls on all new half-lane and larger cold-milling machines by January 2017. Two milling machine manufacturers with 80 % of the U. S. market began putting controls on new milling machines in 2014, nearly three years ahead of the agreed-upon deadline. 3. All U. S. and foreign manufacturers of heavy construction equipment that sell pavement-milling machines to the U. S. market have the NIOSH-evaluated retrofit kits commercially available. 4. NIOSH-recommended <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are being installed on paving equipment by several major European manufacturers in anticipation of a new international standard on mobile road construction machinery. NIOSH is also participating in developing the new standard. 5. Published a best practices <b>engineering</b> <b>control</b> document for Diacetyl and 2, 3 -Pentandione. Document recommenda-tions are already being implemented in several facilities in California. What's next? 1. Evaluate prototype <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> for the remaining milling machine manufacturers as they continue to implement NIOSH recommendations and complete testing by the agreed upon 2017 deadline. 2. Work with partners to finalize changes to the international standard on mobile road construction machinery. The new version of the standard will incorporate NIOSH-recommended <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> for asphalt paving machines. 3. Publish criteria document for Diacetyl and industry to begin adopting <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> in the NIOSH best practice document. NIOSHTIC No 2004811...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are {{strategies}} {{designed to}} protect workers from hazardous conditions by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard or by removing a hazardous substance through air ventilation. [...] <b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> involve a physical change to the workplace itself, {{rather than relying on}} workers' behavior or requiring workers to wear something.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are {{physical}} {{changes to the}} workplace that isolate workers from hazards by containing them in an enclosure, or removing contaminated air from the workplace through ventilation and filtering. They are used when hazardous substances and processes cannot be eliminated or replaced with less hazardous substitutes. The types of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> optimal for each situation {{is influenced by the}} quantity and dustiness of the material as well as the duration of the task. Well-designed <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> are typically passive, in the sense of being independent of worker interactions, which reduces the potential for worker behavior to impact exposure levels. The initial cost of <b>engineering</b> <b>controls</b> can be higher than administrative controls or personal protective equipment, but the long-term operating costs are frequently lower and can sometimes provide cost savings {{in other areas of the}} process.|$|R
