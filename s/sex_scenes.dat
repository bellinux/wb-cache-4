5|$|In {{the adult}} {{versions}} of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Kanon without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene {{in each of the}} five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Yūichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> in Kanon are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> were not written with reproduction in mind.|$|E
5|$|Shuffle! Essence+ {{allows the}} player {{to follow the}} storylines of seven heroines, {{including}} four new storylines: Tsubomi's, Sakura Yae's, Nadeshiko Benibara's and Daisy's. In Daisy's path, Erica Suzuran makes her first appearance as a secondary character and Ruri Matsuri appears as the second main heroine, {{but she does not}} have any <b>sex</b> <b>scenes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 2 version {{varies from}} the PC version {{as all the}} <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> are removed and the player may follow two new storylines: Mayumi Thyme's and Kareha's. Additionally, Kareha's younger sister Tsubomi makes her first {{appearance}} in the PS2 version during Kareha's path.|$|E

5|$|The Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano {{to watch}} John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and {{to focus on}} Humphrey Bogart's {{character}} in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar. Gershon's influences for her role were James Dean, Marlon Brando and Clint Eastwood. Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> and prepared by drinking tequila.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> were choreographed by feminist {{writer and}} sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} <b>sex</b> <b>scenes,</b> she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E

5|$|The first Japanese {{mainstream}} {{film with}} nudity was Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh, (1964), and Takechi {{made the first}} big-budget, mainstream pink film, Daydream(白日夢), the same year. Like Women... Oh, Women!, Daydream was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film. This time, the studio gave Takechi's film a major publicity campaign. Based on a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the film was a black comedy involving a series of <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist's office. After being drugged, the artist watches helplessly {{from the other side}} of a window as the dentist tortures and performs a series of sexual acts on a female patient.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{began to}} develop the film after being offered a three-picture {{contract}} for Columbia Pictures. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded the film himself, shooting it independently {{over a period of}} 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several <b>sex</b> <b>scenes,</b> reportedly unsimulated. He received a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed critical reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.|$|E
5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. <b>Sex</b> <b>scenes</b> are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E

5|$|Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood, but Coyle was displeased when {{industry}} officials {{wanted him to}} change the ending and make the <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> more risque. Due to complications from the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the Hollywood discussions eventually collapsed. It did not receive a national release, but played at theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, Fargo, North Dakota, and several cities throughout Minnesota, including Minneapolis and Duluth. Coyle first publicly showed the film on December 26, 2008, at the Omaha hospice where his father Jim was staying for an audience of about 15 people. Jim Coyle, who died {{a few weeks after}} the screening, loved the film, describing it as very powerful and truthful. It officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California.|$|E
5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of <b>sex</b> <b>scenes.</b> Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a computer screen. The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought A.I. {{would be}} closer to Steven Spielberg's {{sensibilities}} as director. Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects, and convinced Kubrick to remain as director. The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to Eyes Wide Shut (1999). After the filmmaker's death in March 1999, Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg {{to take over the}} director's position. By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment, but removed various <b>sex</b> <b>scenes</b> with Gigolo Joe. Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000, because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Minority Report and Memoirs of a Geisha. The following month Spielberg announced that A.I. would be his next project, with Minority Report as a follow-up. When he decided to fast track A.I., Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist.|$|E
