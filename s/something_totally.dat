25|$|One {{argument}} against Dualism is {{with regard to}} causal interaction. If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> immaterial can affect <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> material—this is the basic problem of causal interaction.|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E

In Germany, Power Play praised its [...] "technical perfection" [...] and [...] "excellent" [...] story, while Play Time lauded its graphical and aural presentation, and awarded it Game of the Month. Finland's Pelit stated, [...] "Ultima Underworld is <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> new in the CRPG field. The Virtual Fantasy of the Abyss left reviewers speechless." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "We wanted {{our first}} album, Replenish, to {{be a really}} honest statement. Four people playing in a room and getting <b>something</b> that’s <b>totally</b> their own.

Up until recently, all I used for effects was a wah-pedal and I only used that on two songs," [...] said guitarist Kenwyn House.|$|R

Mark Caballero, one of its animators, explained [...] "our idea was like our goal is like the more disturbing, the better because I don't think there is a fortune telling machine out there that doesn't disturb when you see it. Tibbitt said [...] "it was a great idea I was just expecting maybe a 3D version of the painting but we got <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> different and it's very cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> out. Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each other. I mean, you gotta say, 'Is the man mad or is he – he's either mad or extremely subtle." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

"Its {{impossible}} {{to avoid the}} inevitable clichés, and dodge overused adjectives, such as [...] "unbelievable," [...] "excellent," [...] "breathtaking," [...] "unique," [...] "vibrant," [...] and worst of all, [...] "refreshing," [...] when describing this album because Dolly Varden is all of these and more.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. She reached out to me and said she had an idea and really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.' It sounded like <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> different than what had been on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that makes us feel no longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe, which {{at the same time we}} feel we can understand. Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E
500|$|The Vidiians' {{debut in}} [...] "Phage" [...] {{received}} primarily positive responses from Voyagers cast and crew. Kate Mulgrew praised {{the moment in}} which Janeway {{had to choose between}} [...] "sacrificing Neelix's lungs or allowing another species to continue to survive". She viewed Janeway's initial difficulty with approaching the Vidiians about the subject of ethics as showcasing a level of [...] "poignancy". While discussing the alien species introduced in the early seasons of Voyager, Westmore said that he found the Vidiians to have the most compelling design. He described them as [...] "the most interesting ones that we've run into as far as a new concept and look, and <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> different", highlighting their use of horror conventions. Taylor praised Westmore's work representing the Vidiians as [...] "truly grisly-looking people" [...] without turning them into flat or static characters. Skye Dent had a more critical opinion of the episode, saying that alterations made to her first draft of the script weakened the effectiveness of the alien species as antagonists. She felt that they [...] "just seemed very wimpy to me, even though they were saying the same dialogue I had written".|$|E

Never daring to tell anybody of this presence in his mind, for fear of being considered insane, Hitler would gradually develop the idea that only by killing all Jews would he be free of that haunting presence. In short, the very act intended to avert the Holocaust ends up being its direct cause.|$|R

500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{wrote that}} [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{sounds like a}} [...] "Tumblr-meme version" [...] of the singer's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". He added that the release [...] "may not be the nadir of Madonna's career so far, but I can think of few moments that feel as much a {{betrayal}} of her legacy than the way she deadpans 'It's so erotic' right before chirping 'This feeling can't be beat'." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt the production credits for MDNA had fueled [...] "over-inflated expectations" [...] for the single. Copsey found it was not [...] "forward-thinking" [...] like Madonna's past records and cited the lyrics [...] "Girls they just wanna have some fun/ Get fired up like a smoking gun" [...] {{as an example of}} this, although he concluded his review writing [...] "we defy anyone who isn't singing this back to themselves immediately after." [...] The New York Observer journalist Daniel D'Addario compared it to [...] "Music", but added that [...] "Madonna was twelve years younger at that time and thus perhaps a more convincing 'bad girl', so too was our culture... maybe it's time for her to try <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> different?" [...] In another article for The Guardian, Gareth Grundy proclaimed [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] to be a [...] "clumsy rave-pop", while Amanda Dobbins from New York panned it as a [...] "paint-by-numbers, 808- and Tanqueray-referencing dance track that falls even flatter when compared to its source material". Malone from NME found no innovation in the track, writing, [...] "combined with earlier single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' it points to an uneasy mix for album MDNA." [...] Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re-releasing [...] "Music" [...] again as a single, instead of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". She added that [...] "There's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise, but in Madge's too-capable hands it's also suffocatingly professional." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

[...] The 1938 production was the UK {{premiere of the}} revised version and the first to combine the death of Macbeth from the 1847 version with the triumphal ending from the 1865 version, <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> against Verdi's wishes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "Lightning never strikes twice (in {{the same}} place)" [...] {{is similar to}} [...] "Opportunity never knocks twice" [...] in the vein of a [...] "once in a lifetime" [...] opportunity, i.e., something that is generally considered improbable. Lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas. Since various factors alter the probability of strikes at any given location, repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability (but are not impossible). Similarly, [...] "A bolt from the blue" [...] refers to <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> unexpected.|$|E
2500|$|OCD {{sometimes}} manifests without overt compulsions. Nicknamed [...] "Pure-O", or {{referred to}} as Primarily Obsessional OCD, OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases. Primarily obsessional OCD has been {{called one of the}} most distressing and challenging forms of OCD. People with this form of OCD have distressing and unwanted thoughts emerging frequently, and these thoughts typically center on a fear that one may do <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> uncharacteristic of oneself, possibly something potentially fatal to oneself or others. The thoughts may likely be of an aggressive or sexual nature.|$|E
5000|$|Instead {{of using}} the [...] "traditional {{scientific}} approach", Baichwal tackled the issue lightning strikes from a [...] "philosophical point of view". She said [...] "Our main challenge was {{figuring out how to}} make a film about <b>something</b> that's <b>totally</b> ephemeral. I love unanswerable questions; questions like 'Is {{there such a thing as}} destiny', and 'what does it all mean?'" [...] While research is done into the role of electricity in our brains, Baichwal wanted to find out the effect of electricity on the mind. She said that [...] "Lightning is always cast in a scientific light film, unless it's used as a joke. We wanted stories that embodied that tension between meaning and chance." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{the project}} {{proceeded}} there was increasing tension between Richard Thompson and Rafferty. Thompson preferred a spontaneous approach to recording and found Rafferty's time-consuming and perfectionist approach hard to cope with. He also felt increasingly frozen {{out of the}} project: [...] "When {{he got to the}} mixing, I just didn’t bother to turn up [...] [...] [...] because if I said <b>something</b> it was <b>totally</b> ignored and I thought 'hey, whose record is this anyway?'" ...|$|R

Many of the scenes were improvised and the music was played on a Casio CZ synthesizer.|$|R
2500|$|The final track, [...] "Journeyman", is Iron Maiden's {{first and}} only fully {{acoustic}} song. According to Dickinson on the Death on the Road live album, it is about [...] "the whole process of writing and being a musician," [...] although Mick Wall describes it as [...] "a wistful tale of carpe diem." [...] The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, [...] "after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music it just seemed right to play out with <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> unexpected and left field." [...] The original version appears on the No More Lies EP.|$|E
2500|$|The name Maitreya {{is derived}} from the Sanskrit word maitrī [...] "loving-kindness", which is in turn derived from the noun mitra [...] "friend". The Pali form Metteyya is {{mentioned}} in the Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta (Digha Nikaya 26) of the Pāli Canon, and also in chapter 28 of the Buddhavamsa. Most of the Buddha's sermons are presented as having been presented in answer to a question, or in some other appropriate context, but this sutta has a beginning and ending in which the Buddha is talking to monks about <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> different. This leads scholar Richard Gombrich to conclude that either the whole sutta is apocryphal or that it has at least been tampered with.|$|E
2500|$|While {{studying}} {{painting at}} the Royal College of Art Emin became disenchanted {{with the art}} of painting, [...] "the idea of being a bourgeois artist, making paintings that just got hung in rich people's houses was a really redundant, old fashioned idea that made no sense for the times that we were living in." [...] She felt {{there was no point}} in making art that someone had made decades or centuries before her, [...] "I had to create <b>something</b> <b>totally</b> new or not at all". When asked by a reporter, when she decided that her life 'as Tracey Emin' was going to be her art, she replied '"I realised that I was much better than anything I'd ever made".|$|E

[...] "My My Metrocard" [...] criticizes New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and [...] "Hot Topic" [...] praises progressive activists. The band emphasized frankness and didacticism in its lyrics {{as a response to}} the ironic tone of hipster subculture. Le Tigre's vocals often carry a bored or soft-spoken tone, punctuated by more energetic bursts. Their use of girl group chants was likened to 1960s group the Shangri-Las. Hanna was influenced by the vocals on old records by Lesley Gore, the Shirelles, and Connie Francis.
