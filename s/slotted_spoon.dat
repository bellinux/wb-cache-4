2500|$|The Bohemian Method is {{a recent}} {{invention}} that involves fire, and was not performed during absinthe's peak of popularity in the Belle Époque. Like the French method, a sugar cube is placed on a <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> over a glass containing one shot of absinthe. The sugar is pre-soaked in alcohol (usually more absinthe), then set ablaze. The flaming sugar cube is then dropped into the glass, thus igniting the absinthe. Finally, a shot glass of water is added to douse the flames. This method tends to produce a stronger drink than the French method. A variant of the Bohemian Method involves allowing the fire to extinguish on its own. This variant is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Cooking the Absinthe" [...] or [...] "The Flaming Green Fairy." [...] The origin of this burning ritual may borrow from a coffee and brandy drink that was served at Café Brûlot, in which a sugar cube soaked in brandy was set aflame. Most experienced absintheurs do not recommend the Bohemian Method and consider it a modern gimmick, as it can destroy the absinthe flavour and present a fire hazard due to the unusually high alcohol content present in absinthe.|$|E

5|$|Deep frying is {{done with}} a deep fryer, a pan such as a wok or chip pan, a Dutch oven, or a {{cast-iron}} pot. Additional tools include fry baskets, which are used to contain foods in a deep fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature.

500|$|Zelda was the {{inspiration}} for [...] "Witchy Woman" [...] the song of seductive enchantresses written by Don Henley and Bernie Leadon for the Eagles, after Henley read Zelda's biography, of the muse, the partial genius behind her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, the wild, bewitching, mesmerizing, quintessential [...] "flapper" [...] of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties embodied in The Great Gatsby as the uninhibited and reckless personality of Daisy Buchanan. Zelda's behavior in the lyrics of [...] "Witchy Woman" [...] refer to her partying excesses that were detrimental to her psyche: [...] "She drove herself to madness with the silver spoon," [...] is a reference to Zelda's time in a mental institution and the absinthiana, <b>slotted</b> silver <b>spoon</b> used to dissolve sugar cubes with absinthe. She was also {{the inspiration}} for [...] "Zelda Fair" [...] in Catherynne M. Valente's Speak Easy (2015), a Jazz Age fantasia that [...] "interprets [...] "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" [...] if Zelda Fitzgerald waltzed in and stole the show" [...] (dust jacket).|$|R
50|$|A <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is an {{implement}} used in food preparation. The term {{can be used}} to describe any spoon with slots, holes or other openings in the bowl of the spoon which let liquid pass through while preserving the larger solids on top. It is similar in function to a sieve; however, a ladle-sized <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is most typically used to retrieve items from a cooking liquid while preserving the liquid in the pot, while table-sized slotted spoons are often used to serve foods prepared or packaged in juices, such as canned fruit and vegetables.|$|E
5000|$|One {{peculiar}} {{example of}} a <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> {{is used in the}} traditional absinthe ritual. In the beginning of absinthe preparation, a special absinthe spoon helps to flavor the cocktail. The spoon holds a sugar cube above a glass while the preparer pours cold water over the sugar.|$|E
5000|$|A {{perforated}} or <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is used {{to dissolve}} a sugar cube in a glass of absinthe, usually to sweeten the drink and counteract its mild bitterness. The spoon is normally flat, with a notch in the handle where it rests {{on the rim of}} the glass. Originating circa the 1870s their use increased over the 1880s and 1890s and were often stamped with brand names or logos as advertising, much like modern alcohol paraphernalia. Sometimes they were sold as tourist items; for example, some might be shaped like the Eiffel Tower, such as the spoon Eiffel Tower #7, which was made for the inauguration of the building in 1889.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for the title and lyrics about a seductive enchantress came {{from a number of}} women, although Henley had one particular woman in mind - Zelda Fitzgerald whose biography he was reading while writing the song. [...] According to Henley, he was suffering from flu with a very high fever and become semi-delirious, and every time the fever subsided, he would continue to read a book on the life of Zelda Fitzgerald, and the character in the song would be a mix of Zelda Fitzgerald [...] "along with amorphous images of girls he had met at the Whisky and the Troubadour". Zelda, the muse behind her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, was known as a wild, bewitching and mesmerizing [...] "Flapper" [...] of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties, and is sometimes thought to be the model for the character of Daisy Buchanan in his novel, The Great Gatsby. In [...] "Witchy Woman", the line [...] "She drove herself to madness with the silver spoon" [...] may be a reference to Zelda's time in a mental institution and the special <b>slotted</b> silver <b>spoon</b> used to dissolve sugar cubes with absinthe, the popular 1920s alcoholic beverage distilled from the wormwood tree and called [...] "the green fairy" [...] for sometimes inducing hallucinations.|$|R
50|$|The whey used {{is usually}} a {{by-product}} in the production process of other harder cheeses, commonly that of halloumi or kefalotyri cheese. The whey is gradually heated to 65 C in a large cooking bowl. A small amount of goat or sheep milk (5-10%) can be added at this temperature to improve the end product quality. The temperature is then increased to boiling point, whilst mixing. At 80 - 85 C small crumbly curds of anari start forming and are skimmed off the surface using a <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> or a colander. They are placed in a container that allows further drainage and then cut into cubes of roughly 10 cm sides.Excluding the drainage, the above process takes roughly 1 hour.|$|E

Usually, friends keep nickname based on their character, attitude, and personality. For example, if a person short then they usually add ‘kuttai’ (short) followed by a name.

50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E

5000|$|Bohemian-style absinth lacks {{much of the}} herbal {{profile and}} density of {{authentic}} absinthe, including the constituents that create the louche.Since this renders Czech style absinth unusable for the traditional method of preparation, a modern ritual involving fire was created. In the “fire ritual,” absinth is poured into a glass, and a sugar cube on a <b>slotted</b> <b>spoon</b> is placed over the glass. The sugar cube is then soaked with absinth and is set on fire. The cube is then dropped into the absinth, setting it ablaze. Then water is poured over the flame until it goes out. Usually, a 1:1 ratio of water to absinth is used. This procedure produces a minor simulation of the louche that is seen in traditional absinthe, and the low water-to-alcohol ratio increases {{the strength of the}} resulting drink. (A traditional absinthe drink is diluted with water to a ratio between 3:1 and 5:1.) Many Czechs do not dilute the drink at all. The fire ritual first appeared in advertisements after having been seen in a Prague bar in the late 1990s. [...] It has been mistaken at times as historical fact due to its having been misrepresented as such in several contemporary costume drama films.|$|E
