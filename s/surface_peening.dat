40|$|The {{beneficial}} effect of <b>surface</b> <b>peening</b> (including shot peening, laser shock peening, low plasticity burnishing, etc.) on fatigue resistance of structural alloys {{is well documented}} and widely used in industry to improve component life. It {{is perhaps the most}} widely used technique that relies on the introduction of residual stresses into the component by direct mechanical means. The resulting stress states are usually evaluated experimentally by X-ray diffraction or other stress measurement techniques. In order for shot peening operations to be effective and reliable, the process of introducing residual stresses and strains into peened components must not only be controlled but also be predictable and quantifiable. The present paper establishes a framework for predictive modelling of the residual stress states due to <b>surface</b> <b>peening.</b> Firstly, uniform (within planes parallel to the surface) plastic deformation of the surface layer taking place during shot peening of a thin plate is simulated using the concept of eigenstrain. As a further demonstration of the capabilities of the proposed approach, flexible plate theory is applied to the analysis of stresses and deformations arising due to local peening within a circular area. The results are of considerable use and significance for the analysis of shot peening and peen forming operations. © IMechE 2005...|$|E

In cases where a weld fatigue issue is discovered in the field the customer desires to have low-cost methods to increase service life. This research was initiated to recommend a process for treating welded joints on heavy trucks that can be accomplished in the field with limited manufacturing resources. <b>Surface</b> <b>peening</b> is a cold working process that introduces beneficial residual compressive stresses in {{the surface of a}} work piece. Two different <b>surface</b> <b>peening</b> processes were evaluated for their ability to increase fatigue life in fillet welds. These processes were hammer peening and rotary flap peening. T-shaped fillet weld test samples were fabricated and subjected to cyclic loading in three configurations; as-welded, welded and hammer peened, and welded and flap peened. Metallographic inspection was used to further evaluate the test samples following fatigue testing. Fatigue life estimation methods were considered based on both experimentally measured strain data and stress/strain results obtained through the use of finite element methods. Stress-life analyses based on weld classifications established by British Standard BS 7608 were conducted.

40|$|AbstractThe {{approach}} to engineering design {{based on the}} flaws propagation assumption applying the principles of fracture mechanics is commonly used in aluminum structures for aerospace engineering, in which surface shot peening is an attractive method of improving fatigue performance, because it promotes the retardation of the crack initiation and earlier crack growth. The main purpose of present work was to analyze {{the effect of the}} surface shot peening on the fatigue crack propagation of the 7475 aluminum alloy with a T 7351 heat treatment. Two types of fatigue tests were performed: constant amplitude and variable amplitude loading in which periodic overload blocks of 300 cycles are applied with intervals of Nint cycles. Surface micro shot peened promoted an increasing in micro-hardness only in order or 6 % and created negative surface residual stresses in order of - 174 MPa, which compare with the positive residual stresses of + 291 MPa on the machined specimens. For tests at constant amplitude loading the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>peening</b> on da/dN-ΔK curves is quite limited, particularly for R = 0. 4. However, this beneficial effect increases significantly near the threshold. Repeated overload block reduces significantly the fatigue crack propagation rate, being this effect particularly dependent of the intervals between the blocks. The maximum reduction of crack propagation rate and retardation effects were obtained for Nint = 7500 cycles...|$|E
