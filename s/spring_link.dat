50|$|A {{non-profit}} {{group known}} as the The T1 Trust plans to build an all-new, fully operational T1 using the original plans with subtle performance improvements where necessary. The T1 Trust's goal is to provide mainline excursion service and to set the world speed record for a steam locomotive currently held by the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard at 126 mph. It is worth mentioning the original T1s {{were reported to have}} broken Mallard's speed record as far back as 1948, but these claims have never been officially confirmed. The T1 Trust's cost estimate to build T1 number 5550 is $10 million with an expected completion date of 2030. The construction of 5550 is also following construction and financing methods pioneered by the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado project. The first piece of the locomotive, the keystone shaped number plate, was cast in April 2014, followed by the first minor component, a driving <b>spring</b> <b>link</b> pin, in October 2014. The headlamp was constructed and given to The T1 Trust by a donor in mid 2015. On February 26, 2016 the first driving wheel for 5550 was cast. The massive and complex Boxpok driver weighs 2,500 pounds. In October 2016, construction began on the iconic prow of the locomotive using aircraft grade aluminum framework and plating. On January 18, 2017, the first frames for the cab of 5550 were cut and prepared for assembly. Similar to the prow, the cab frames are made of aircraft grade aluminum. The second Boxpok driver, originally ordered on December 9, 2016, was delivered to the Trust on March 15, 2017.|$|E

The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of land-based exercise therapy intervention on QOL and muscle strength in patients with knee OA in previous researches. Materials & Methods: English literature associated with the effects of land-based therapeutic exercise methods were extracted from Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Medlib, IrMedex, Magiran, <b>Spring</b> <b>link,</b> Scopus, Cochrane, and Science Direct databases since 2000 to 2016. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 articles remained to be reviewed. Results: There were 1200 patients (Mean ± Standard deviation 64. 5 ± 4. 7 years of old) with knee OA in those eleven studies. Generally, two interventions were administrated for such patients including exercise therapy and Yoga. The most common treatment outcome measurements involved Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Short Form 36 (SF- 36), and strength. Conclusion: Although it was impossible to compare the results of the eleven studies due to inconsistency in outcome measurements and their units to introduce the most effective therapeutic intervention for improvement of QOL in individuals with knee OA, the positive effect of land-based exercise therapy on signs and symptoms of such disorder was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is {{a chronic}} {{epidemic}} {{which can lead}} to enhanced bone fragility and consequent an increase in fracture risk. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas {{have a long history of}} use in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Antiosteoporotic TCM formulas have conspicuous advantage over single drugs. Systematic data mining of the existing antiosteoporotic TCM formulas database can certainly help the drug discovery processes and help the identification of safe candidates with synergistic formulations. In this review, the authors summarize the clinical use and animal experiments of TCM formulas and their mechanism of action, and discuss the potential antiosteoporotic activity and the active constituents of commonly used herbs in TCM formulas for the therapy of osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature was searched from Medline, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, <b>Spring</b> <b>Link,</b> Web of Science, CNKI and VIP database from 1989 to 2015, and also collected from Chinese traditional books and Chinese Pharmacopoeia with key words such as osteoporosis, osteoblast, osteoclast, traditional Chinese medicine formulas to identify studies on the antiosteoporotic effects of TCM formulas, herbs and chemical constituents, and also their possible mechanisms. RESULTS: Thirty-three TCM formulas were commonly used to treat osteoporosis, and showed significant antiosteoporotic effects in human and animal. The herb medicines and their chemical constituents in TCM formulas were summarized, the pharmacological effects and chemical constituents of commonly used herbs in TCM formulas were described in detail. The action mechanisms of TCM formulas and their chemical constituents were described. Finally, the implication for the discovery of antiosteoporotic leads and combinatory ingredients from TCM formulas were prospectively discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice and animal experiments indicate that TCM formulas provide a definite therapeutic effect on osteoporosis. The active constituents in TCM formulas are diverse in chemical structure, and include flavonoids, lignans, saponins and iridoid glycosides. Antiosteoporotic mechanism of TCM formulas and herbs involves multi regulatory pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin, BMP/Smad, MAPK pathway and RANKL/OPG system. Phytochemicals from TCM formulas and their compositional herb medicines offer great potential for the development of novel antiosteoporotic drugs. The active ingredients in TCM formulas can be developed in combination as potent drugs, which may exhibit better antiosteoporotic effects compared to the individual compound...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade the study of {{phenology}} {{has taken on a}} new legitimacy in the area of climate change research. A growing literature reveals that a change in the timing of natural events is occurring {{in a wide range of}} locations and affecting a wide range of species. Changes in spring have been those most commonly reported, with the emphasis on an advance in <b>spring</b> <b>linked</b> to an increase in temperature. Detection of change in autumn is hampered by a smaller pool of available data, events that are harder to define (such as leaf coloration), and various influencing environmental factors triggering autumnal phases. Despite this, the general pattern may be towards a delay in autumn. Plant, animal and abiotic responses, especially in spring, are quite similar. Thus, it would appear that winter is being squeezed at both ends, and this effect, of increasing the growing season, should become more pronounced in the face of predicted global warming.

When the confining force range is increased toward the inside of the chain, a paradoxical behavior is exhibited.

A minimum of fluctuations is observed at a distance of the cell extremities that scales linearly with the confining force range. Those features are in very good agreement with the model. Moreover, the simulations exhibit an asymmetry in their fluctuations which is an anharmonic effect. It is characterized by the measurement of the skewness, which is found to be strictly positive for the outer particles when the confining force is short ranged...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented that studies {{the response of}} a two-degree-of-freedom dynamic sliding system; that is a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator being fi xed {{on top of a}} rigid block that can slide on its supporting shaking table along a horizontal axis when subjected to unidirectional dynamic or earthquake excitations along this horizontal axis. This problem appears to be of interest in predicting the dynamic and earthquake response of superstructures supported on a large foundation block capable of horizontal sliding by means of seismic sliding isolators. Special mock-ups are tested at the shaking table of Aristotle University for this purpose utilizing horizontal simulated earthquake excitations based on prototype earthquake ground motion recordings. The numerical results, which were obtained by a computer software developed for this purpose, are compared with the corresponding experimental measurements. The measured acceleration and displacement responses of the mock-ups appear to be, in all the examined cases, in reasonably good agreement with the numerical predictions. However, in certain cases, the numerically predicted sliding displacement of the rigid block appears to have an offset that differs from the sliding response that was observed during the experiments.

40|$|Hearing {{and balance}} {{rely on the}} ability of hair cells in the inner ear to sense miniscule {{mechanical}} stimuli. In each cell, sound or acceleration deflects the mechanosensitive hair bundle, a tuft of rigid stereocilia protruding from the cell's apical surface. By altering the tension in gating <b>springs</b> <b>linked</b> to mechanically sensitive transduction channels, this deflection changes the channels' open probability and elicits an electrical response. To detect weak stimuli despite energy losses caused by viscous dissipation, a hair cell can use active hair-bundle movement to amplify its mechanical inputs. This amplificatory process also yields spontaneous bundle oscillations. Using a displacement-clamp system to measure the mechanical properties of individual hair bundles from the bullfrog's ear, we found that an oscillatory bundle displays negative slope stiffness at the heart of its region of mechanosensitivity. Offsetting the hair bundle's position activates an adaptation process that shifts the region of negative stiffness along the displacement axis. Modeling indicates that the interplay between negative bundle stiffness and the motor responsible for mechanical adaptation produces bundle oscillation similar to that observed. Just as the negative resistance of electrically excitable cells and of tunnel diodes can be embedded in a biasing circuit to amplify electrical signals, negative stiffness can be harnessed to amplify mechanical stimuli in the ear...|$|R
