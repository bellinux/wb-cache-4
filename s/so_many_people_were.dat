In consequence factories across the country were forced to shut and up to four million people claimed unemployment benefits. Although <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> made redundant there was little unrest and no major public disorders. Television services were suspended completely, radio broadcasts were reduced, some magazines were ordered to stop being published, and newspapers were cut in size to four pages or one sheet. Food rations, still in use from the Second World War, were cut to levels lower than in the war years. These measures made little difference to the rate of coal consumption but served to reduce public morale.|$|E
