25|$|Bronze Age remains {{have been}} found in Ewell and the Romans are likely to have {{encountered}} an existing religious site when they first arrived leaving pottery, bones, and a few other remains, which have been taken to the British Museum. Ewell is on a long line of <b>spring</b> <b>line</b> settlements founded along the foot of hills on a geological line between the chalk of the North Downs to the south, and the clay of the London Basin to the north.|$|E
25|$|Epsom and Ewell {{lies on the}} <b>spring</b> <b>line</b> on {{the north}} face of the North Downs where {{pervious}} chalk meets impervious London clay {{and a series of}} springs form. In Ewell the springs which form the Hogsmill River are evident, those in Epsom less so. The springs attracted prehistoric people and remains have been found, mostly in Ewell and particularly near the Hogsmill. In Roman times the road now known as Stane Street, from London to Chichester, passed through Epsom and Ewell. Roman remains have been found in Ewell suggesting a sizeable settlement. Epsom and Ewell have Saxon names: Ewell takes its name from the spring in the centre of the town and Epsom, or Ebbisham, is the enclosure of Ebbi. A Saxon cemetery in The Grove in Ewell was excavated in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Percussion is {{sponsored}} by Mapex Drums and Majestic Percussion, Vic Firth Drumsticks, Remo, and Avedis Zildjian Company. In the past, outside of marching season, the drum line has branched out to other spectrums of the percussion world. They formed the ASU PASIC Drumline in 1995 with Percussive Arts Society International Convention being held locally and hosted by Dr. J.B. Smith, Professor of Music and the Coordinator of Percussion Studies in the School of Music at Arizona State University, at Phoenix Civic Plaza in Phoenix, Arizona. With the recent sensation of indoor percussion has had few lines part take in it. Initially with the 1998 ASU <b>Spring</b> <b>Line</b> and {{with the addition of}} the pit during the 2006 marching season the staff formed the 2007 ASU Winter Drumline. Competing locally in the Winter Guard Arizona circuit as well as nationally in Winter Guard International Percussion Regionals in Phoenix and Las Vegas in order to qualify in Winter Guard International Percussion World Championship in Dayton, Ohio. The winter line was on hold due to constraints since its inaugural line in 2007, but was re-established in 2013.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, Watson {{announced}} her involvement with People Tree, a Fair trade fashion brand. Watson {{worked as a}} creative advisor {{for the company to}} create a <b>spring</b> <b>line</b> of clothing, which was released in February 2010; the range featured styles inspired by southern France and London. The collection, described by The Times as [...] "very clever" [...] despite their [...] "quiet hope that [...] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle", was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration, admitted that competition for the range was minimal, but argued that [...] "Fashion {{is a great way to}} empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in"; adding, [...] "I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there." [...] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.|$|E

2500|$|Epsom {{lies within}} the Copthorne Hundred used for periodic, {{strategic}} {{meetings of the}} wealthy and powerful in Anglo-Saxon England, and later having a Hundred Court. The name of Epsom is early recorded as forms of Ebba's ham ( [...] or perhaps manor). Ebba was a Saxon landowner. [...] Many <b>Spring</b> <b>line</b> settlements by springs in Anglo-Saxon England were founded {{at the foot of}} dry valleys such as here and Effingham, Bookham, Cheam, Sutton, Carshalton, Croydon and Bromley. A relic from this period is a 7th-century brooch found in Epsom and now in the British Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Pocklington is a <b>spring</b> <b>line</b> settlement, {{located at}} the base of the Yorkshire Wolds. Geologically speaking, the rocks {{underlying}} this area were lain down under tropical oceans, and, when the land rose, the chalk wolds were formed from the skeletons and shells covering the sea floor. The landscape around Pocklington therefore varies from flat arable land primarily devoted to agriculture to the south and west, and grassy, chalk hills and dry valleys to the north and east. A lot of the more level farming country was, from the Middle Ages onwards, reclaimed from marshland.|$|E

2500|$|By March 1999, {{the channel}} {{admitted}} defeat in its ratings war with ITV, with its <b>Spring</b> <b>line</b> {{up with a}} stronger emphasis on serious factual programmes, educations and drama. This change in strategy came about after continuing complaints that the channel was appealing to {{the lowest common denominator}} to win viewers, which has left it chastened by the hoax guests on Vanessa, over reliance on docusoaps and the dropping of the vilified Noel's House Party. Alan Yentob said [...] "The spring package is to remind people of what the BBC is here for, Range and ambition you won't find anywhere else at peak time". The changes help the channel distinguish itself from (as one BBC executive said) its downmarket rival and would not compete for viewers on ITV's terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{settlement}} {{pattern of the}} Vale of Pickering is striking. There {{are two types of}} settlement, both relating to the topography. The first group is the villages and towns on the northern and southern fringes of the area. These settlements were established in close proximity to each other on the approximate shoreline of the glacial lake. They were built along the <b>spring</b> <b>line,</b> where the underlying aquifers met less porous rocks. Many of the parishes associated with the settlements are linear running from the vale bottom upwards to the higher ground, [...] meaning that the long narrow parishes each had an amount of different types of soil and elevation. The second type of settlement is on the valley floor. These are small more widely spaced villages in areas of rising ground. These villages result from the relatively late enclosure of the carr lands following their drainage [...] {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. Long narrow lanes and tracks with wide grass verges link these settlements and solid well managed hedges.|$|E
2500|$|Fragments {{of stone}} {{used in the}} {{construction}} of the monument underwent a petrological examination at the British Museum in London, where it was established that they were a form of oolithic limestone that was local to the area around the Rollrights. Archaeologist George Lambrick argued that the stones had been discovered by prehistoric peoples as naturally occurring surface boulders, rather than having been quarried, because of certain weathering patterns that could be found on them and which were consistent with those found on surface boulders. He went on to argue that the most likely place that such surface boulders would have been found in the late prehistoric was [...] "on the sides of the ridge at or near the level of the strong <b>spring</b> <b>line</b> between the Inferior Oolithic and the Lias clay." [...] If this had indeed been the place where the megalith builders had found the boulders, then they would have had to be transported up hill, at a gradient averaging about 1 in 15 on the shortest routes, for either 250 metres (for the Whispering Knights), or 450 metres (for the King Stone and King's Men).|$|E

25|$|The {{base of the}} Tunbridge Wells Sand {{is marked}} by a {{distinct}} change from the predominantly argillaceous sediments of the Wadhurst Clay to siltstones and silty sands.
