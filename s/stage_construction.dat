5|$|The group's Red Rocks {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and video equipment through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered <b>stage</b> <b>construction</b> and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and sound equipment. Crew members used squeegees to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an electrical shock while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had to hike through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows early in the morning, and lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E
500|$|During {{his five}} years as an {{assistant}} director, Kurosawa worked under numerous directors, but {{by far the most}} important figure in his development was Yamamoto. Of his 24 films as A.D., he worked on 17 under Yamamoto, many of them comedies featuring the popular actor Ken'ichi Enomoto, known as [...] "Enoken". Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawa's talent, promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year. Kurosawa's responsibilities increased, and he worked at tasks ranging from <b>stage</b> <b>construction</b> and film development to location scouting, script polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing and second-unit directing. In the last of Kurosawa's films as an assistant director for Yamamoto, Horse (Uma, 1941), Kurosawa took over most of the production, as his mentor was occupied with the shooting of another film.|$|E
500|$|Wishing {{to shoot}} the film in France, Besson could not find {{suitable}} facilities and [...] "with a heavy heart" [...] filmed in London. It was primarily filmed at Pinewood Studios on seven soundstages including the 007 <b>Stage.</b> <b>Construction</b> of sets began in October 1995. The opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House. Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in Mauritania; the first shoot for the film, a background shot of the desert, occurred there on 5 January 1996. Filming with actors began in late January, and was completed 21 weeks later. Willis finished filming on 16 May, while Oldman only commenced filming the following week; the film's protagonist (Korben) and antagonist (Zorg) never actually share any screen time. Despite being filmed in London, The Fifth Element was a French production, {{and went on to}} become the costliest European film ever made at the time. The buildings in New York were derived from both metabolist-inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s, and the futuristic designs of architect Antonio Sant'Elia in the 1910s. Besson demanded that most of the action shots in the film take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science fiction films, and wanted a brighter [...] "cheerfully crazy" [...] look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one. Gaultier designed every one of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the film's Fhloston Paradise scenes, and checked each costume every morning. His designs, described as [...] "intellectually transgressive", were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms. A single jacket he designed for the film cost $5,000.|$|E

2500|$|This is when Tropicana's glory years really began. Ardura hired {{maverick}} choreographer Roderico [...] "Rodney" [...] Neyra {{away from}} his chief rival on the cabaret scene, the Club San Souci, and Fox contracted up-and-coming architect Max Borges-Recio, who created Tropicana's Arcos de Cristal, a building composed of parabolic concrete arches and glass walls over an indoor <b>stage.</b> <b>Construction</b> continued through 1951. Giant fruit trees were left in situ during construction to punctuate the interior. When the indoor cabaret at the air-conditioned Arcos de Cristal opened on March 15, 1952, it had a combined total seating capacity of 1,700 for the interior and outside areas with furniture designed by Charles Eames. The Arcos de Cristal won numerous international prizes when it was built {{and was one of}} only six Cuban buildings included in the landmark 1954 Museum of Modern Art exhibit entitled [...] "Latin American Architecture since 1945." ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Halen had {{a notable}} {{effect on the}} modern rock music tour with {{their use of the}} concert {{technical}} contract rider. They were one of the first bands to use contract riders to specify a [...] "wish list," [...] a practice now used throughout the music industry. They pioneered extensive requirements including power availability and <b>stage</b> <b>construction</b> details. The band's demands were not limited to technical issues; their now-infamous rider specified that a bowl of M's, with all of the brown M's removed, was to be placed in their dressing room. According to David Lee Roth, this was listed in the technical portion of the contract not because the band wanted to make capricious demands of the venue, but rather as a test {{of whether or not the}} contract had actually been thoroughly read and honored, as it contained other requirements involving legitimate safety concerns. If the bowl was present, then the band members could safely assume the other, legitimate, items in the technical rider were being fulfilled to their satisfaction. Conversely, if the bowl was missing, or brown M's were present, then the band members would be within their rights to have the venue inspect the work, ask it be redone, etc. Their concern for safety was real: during their earlier tours, not only had equipment been damaged, but several members of their road crew were nearly electrocuted, both due to inadequate safety measures and preparation on the part of the local venue.|$|E

40|$|A {{case study}} is {{presented}} in this paper which describes finite element analysis of <b>staged</b> <b>construction</b> of the upstream tailings dam Aitik, located in north of Sweden. The purpose of the study is to evaluate stability of the dam for current and future raisings and to strengthen the dam with optimum volume of rockfill banks on the downstream side when stability of the dam is not satisfactory during a <b>construction</b> <b>stage.</b> The finite element method was utilized to model the consolidation process and stability of the dam during the <b>staged</b> <b>construction.</b> The study has shown that stability of the dam during raisings was reduced due to build-up of excess pore pressures. Therefore, the dam was strengthened with rockfill banks on the downstream side to carry out the construction of the dam at a planned rate of raising. An optimization analysis was performed {{in order to reduce the}} volume of the rockfill necessary for stabilizing the dam. With the use of the finite element based optimization approach discussed in this paper, stability of the dams during <b>staged</b> <b>construction</b> can be enhanced by utilizing a minimum volume of rockfill banks.
