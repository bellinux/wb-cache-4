25|$|It is {{suggested}} that this newfound power resulting from women's taking revolutionary action, led {{to the death of}} <b>some</b> <b>powerful</b> women of this era, including Marie Antoinette, Olympe de Gouges, and Madame Roland. Corday's killing of such an influential leader during the revolution angered many people. Her actions were described by many as disquieting as well as transgressive. This behavior left a lasting impression on male revolutionaries because even though women were not at the forefront, they nonetheless had a place in the revolution, but not a prominent enough one to counteract a woman committing such an act.|$|E

The major opposition came from the water-powered mill owners along the Derwent, of which there were many, downstream of the proposed canal, fearful of loss of flow in dry weather. Since, between Cromford and Pinxton, the canal would be level, Jessop was able to give reassurance, carefully downplaying the problem of the descent, with its locks, to Langley Mill.|$|E

25|$|The IBF {{installed}} George Groves as Froch's mandatory challenger, their bout {{taking place}} on Saturday 23 November at the Phones4u Arena in Manchester with Froch's IBF and WBA super-middleweight titles on the line. Despite being floored {{for only the second}} time in his career by a left hook right hand from Groves in the first round, Froch defended his titles with a TKO victory in Round 9. There was significant controversy as many observers felt that referee Howard Foster stepped in to end the contest prematurely. The three scoring judges had scored Groves ahead of Froch before Groves was shaken by <b>some</b> <b>powerful</b> Froch blows in the 9th. The controversial ending prompted a widespread demand for a rematch to be fought between the two.|$|E

These, along with Montaigu graduates, he sent to monasteries and bishops who asked for help in reforming their priests. They would work by setting an example of a strict ascetic life of prayer and devotion. Many monks began to suspect some order of take-over. Still others began resenting the suggestion they {{did not know how to}} live a holy life, while still others felt that Standonck's approach was too extreme.

There was a distinct revival {{during the middle of the}} 1984 season. The club had lost 6 of its first 7 games but won its next 6, two by large margins. After a powerful win against reigning premiers Hawthorn in round 13, elevating the club to 4th place on the ladder, Barassi's five-year plan seemed close to fruition. However, a loss the following week to eventual premiers Essendon seemed to demoralize the club and they only won two more games.|$|E

25|$|The {{different}} types of radio-loud active galaxies are linked by unified models. The key observation {{that led to the}} adoption of unified models for powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars was that all quasars appear to be beamed towards us, showing superluminal motion in the cores and bright jets {{on the side of the}} source nearest to us (the Laing-Garrington effect:). If this is the case, there must be a population of objects not beamed towards us, and, since we know the lobes are not affected by beaming, they would appear as radio galaxies, provided that the quasar nucleus is obscured when the source is seen side-on. It is now accepted that at least <b>some</b> <b>powerful</b> radio galaxies have 'hidden' quasars, though it is not clear whether all such radio galaxies would be quasars if viewed from the right angle. In a similar way, low-power radio galaxies are a plausible parent population for BL Lac objects.|$|E
25|$|The Khabur River valley {{became the}} heart of the Hurrian lands for a {{millennium}}. The first known Hurrian kingdom emerged around the city of Urkesh (modern Tell Mozan) during the third millennium BCE. There is evidence that they were initially allied with the east Semitic Akkadian Empire of Mesopotamia, indicating they had a firm hold on the area by the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254–2218 BCE). This region hosted other rich cultures (see Tell Halaf and Tell Brak). The city-state of Urkesh had <b>some</b> <b>powerful</b> neighbors. At some point in the early second millennium BCE, the Northwest Semitic speaking Amorite kingdom of Mari to the south subdued Urkesh and made it a vassal state. In the continuous power struggles over Mesopotamia, another Amorite dynasty had usurped the throne of the Old Assyrian Empire, which had controlled colonies in Hurrian, Hattian and Hittite regions of eastern Anatolia since the 21st century BCE. The Assyrians then made themselves masters over Mari and much of north east Amurru (Syria) in the late 19th and early 18th centuries BCE. Shubat-Enlil (modern Tell Leilan), was made the capital of this Old Assyrian empire by Shamshi Adad I {{at the expense of the}} earlier capital of Assur.|$|E

[...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, although complimentary towards the focus on Samantha Mulder, was critical of the slowness of the episode, writing, [...] "While the series' reversion to its central theme is much appreciated, this episode unfolds with an unfortunate slowness that does little to satisfy the seven-year itch many X-Files viewers have come to feel in response to monster-of-the-week episodes and phony-baloney mythology cliffhangers." ...|$|E

[...] "There are <b>some</b> <b>powerful</b> moments... and it's pleasant for once to see Lwaxana adding, rather than subtracting, from a storyline." [...] Handlen, however, criticizes the setup of Timicin's situation, as it reduced the characterization available to some of the Enterprise crew.

500|$|Most of the {{criticism}} of Harry Potter is from Fundamental Evangelical Christian groups, who believe the series' depiction of witchcraft is dangerous to children.

500|$|In Africa, {{cultural}} {{views of}} the lion have varied by region. In some cultures, the lion symbolises power and royalty and <b>some</b> <b>powerful</b> rulers had the word [...] "lion" [...] in their nickname. For example, Marijata of the Mali Empire (c. 1235–c. 1600) was given the name [...] "Lion of Mali". Njaay, the legendary founder of the Waalo kingdom (1287–1855), {{is said to have}} been raised by lions and returned to his people part-lion to unite them using the knowledge he learned from the beasts. In parts of West Africa, to be compared to a lion was considered to be one of the greatest compliments. The social hierarchies of their societies where connected to the animal kingdom and the lion represented the top class. However, in more forested areas where lions were rare, the more numerous leopard represented the top of the hierarchy. In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and is seen as the link between the seers and the supernatural. In other East African traditions, the lion is the symbol of laziness. In many folktales, lions are portrayed as having low intelligence and are easily tricked by other animals. Although lions were commonly used in stories, proverbs and dances, they rarely featured in visual arts.|$|E
500|$|In 1273 Przemysł II {{became an}} {{independent}} Duke of Poznań. The circumstances around this event {{are not entirely}} clear. On the basis of only one known source, a document dated 1 October 1273, it appears that Przemysł II began to use the title of [...] "dux Poloniae" [...] (Duke of [...] Poland). A document issued on 25 August 1289, notes that the Greater Poland ruler gave the villages of Węgielnice and Łagiewnice to the major of Gniezno, Piotr Winiarczyk, in gratitude for helping him {{to escape from the}} Gniezno fortress (however, when the incident took place wasn't mentioned in the document). In light from modern historiography, the events preceding the issue of this document could be as follows: Przemysł II, unhappy with the prolonged guardianship of his uncle, and with the support of <b>some</b> <b>powerful</b> Greater Poland magnates decided, regardless of the consequences, to assert his rights over Poznań. It's unclear at this stage whether there has been any armed incidents; in any case the demands of Przemysł II became so insistent that they ended in his imprisonment in the Gniezno castle. It can be assumed that there wasn't a prison in the proper sense of the word, but under house arrest, during which Przemysł II wasn't too rigorously guarded, since the prince was able to escape from the castle without any outside help. In a document issued to Piotr Winiarczyk, the writer used the phrase [...] "qui de nocte consurgens", which supports the assumption that the clerk was asleep and was completely surprised by the arrival of the prince. In any case, the real cause of this grant of lands given to Winiarczyk by Przemysł II apparently wasn't sure, and probably only equipping him with sufficient means to escape.|$|E
