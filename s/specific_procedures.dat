5|$|The three {{episodes of}} Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons make up one side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{most of the}} game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. Keen can move left and right and can jump; after finding a pogo stick in the first episode, he can also bounce continuously and jump higher than he can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The second episode introduces moving platforms as well as switches that extend bridges over gaps in the floor. Once entered, {{the only way to}} exit a level is to reach the end, and the player cannot save and return to the middle of a level. In between levels, Keen travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by moving Keen to the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional and can be bypassed, while others are secret and can only be reached by following <b>specific</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{laws in the}} UK {{cover the}} remains of all {{aircraft}} which have crashed during military service (land or sea) are protected by the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. This Act defines an offence of tampering with, damage to, moving, or unearthing the aircraft remains. Exceptions apply to those holding licences, which can be issued by the Secretary of State, authorising <b>specific</b> <b>procedures</b> to be performed.|$|E
25|$|Statutory {{basis for}} the Trial of the Pyx is given by the Coinage Act 1971, {{the latest in a}} long series of {{similarly}} named Acts of Parliament. <b>Specific</b> <b>procedures</b> are established by Order in Council, the most recent being the Trial of the Pyx Order 1998, which was amended in 2005, 2012 and 2016. It is not required for a new Order to be issued for each Trial: this is mandated (to occur) only with regulatory revision.|$|E

25|$|Treatment is by {{endoscopic}} valve ablation. Fetal {{surgery is}} a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe oligohydramnios, to try to limit the associated lung underdevelopment, or pulmonary hypoplasia, that is seen at birth in these patients. The risks of fetal surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and fetal or maternal death. <b>Specific</b> <b>procedures</b> for in utero intervention include infusions of amniotic fluid, serial bladder aspiration, and creating {{a connection between the}} amniotic sac and the fetal bladder, or vesicoamniotic shunt.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 205 million pregnancies occur {{each year}} worldwide. Over a third are {{unintended}} {{and about a}} fifth end in induced abortion. Most abortions result from unintended pregnancies. In the United Kingdom, 1 to 2% of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus. A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. The manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses. <b>Specific</b> <b>procedures</b> may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor or a woman's personal preference.|$|E
25|$|A magical {{record is}} a journal or other source of {{documentation}} containing magical events, experiences, ideas, {{and any other}} information that the magician may see fit to add. There can be many purposes for such a record, such as recording evidence to verify the effectiveness of <b>specific</b> <b>procedures</b> (per the scientific method that Aleister Crowley claimed should {{be applied to the}} practice of Magick) or to ensure that data may propagate beyond the lifetime of the magician. Benefits of this process vary, but usually include future analysis and further education by the individual and/or associates with whom the magician feels comfortable in revealing such intrinsically private information.|$|E

25|$|The {{underwater}} {{environment is}} unfamiliar and hazardous, {{and to ensure}} diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must be followed. A certain minimum level of attention to detail and acceptance of responsibility for one's own safety and survival are required. Most of the procedures are simple and straightforward, and become second nature to the experienced diver, but must be learned, and take some practice to become automatic and faultless, just like the ability to walk or talk. Most of the safety procedures are intended {{to reduce the risk}} of drowning, and many of the rest are {{to reduce the risk of}} barotrauma and decompression sickness. In some applications getting lost is a serious hazard, and <b>specific</b> <b>procedures</b> to minimise the risk are followed.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the games}} in the Commander Keen series are side-scrolling {{platform}} video games: {{the majority of the}} game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump; in every episode besides Keen Dreams they can also use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. Beginning with episode two, [...] "The Earth Explodes", there are also moving platforms as well as switches which extend bridges over gaps in the floor. Keen Dreams and later games add fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down, and {{with the exception of the}} 2001 Commander Keen also show the platforms viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect. Throughout the series, once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though for Keen Dreams and episodes four through six the player can save and return to the middle of a level, rather than only between levels like the other games. In between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Some levels are optional and can be bypassed, while others are secret and can only be reached by following <b>specific</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In Great Britain, {{the term}} mother lodge {{is used to}} {{identify}} the particular Lodge where the individual was first [...] "made a Mason" [...] (i.e. received his Entered Apprentice degree).

Lodge Mother Kilwinning No 0 in the Grand Lodge of Scotland is known as the Mother Lodge of Scotland, having been referred to in the Schaw Statutes of 1598 and 1599, and having itself warranted other lodges at a time when it did not subscribe to a grand lodge.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, PayPal is {{licensed}} as a money transmitter, on a state-by-state basis. But {{state laws}} vary, as do their definitions of banks, narrow banks, money services businesses and money transmitters. [...] Although PayPal is not {{classified as a}} bank, the company is subject {{to some of the}} rules and regulations governing the financial industry including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act. The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from P2P payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires <b>specific</b> <b>procedures</b> for billing errors, dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.|$|E
