5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they just got audible in a stationary background noise. These distances were then compared to the <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E

In this study ship’s inertial <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> is calculated using the ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) algorithm implemented in the FLUENT code. Firstly, a method for predicting the inertial <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a floating body based on the FLUENT code is established. Then, the results calculated by the method are compared with those obtained from the empirical formulae and the physical model tests.

40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> and crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> {{and it is}} very complicated to calculate them accurately. At present there are several calculation methods about them, but all these methods have large error. Based on the research of the existing calculation methods, this paper simplifies vessel resistance and calculates vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> and crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> accurately by means of physical and mathematical methods. 1 forward Vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VSD) and Vessel’s crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VCSD) are two important indexes measuring the braking performance of the vessel. They have very important influence on the vessel navigation safety. Calculation of them {{is one of the major}} problems in Marine research. As early as the 1970 s, Chinese scholars Wang FengChen and Liu ZhengJiang et al. began to make research on large vessel’s stopping performance. [1, 2, 3] These research mainly used regression method on the measured data of VCSD to get the VCSD calculation formula. Foreign scholars have carried out extensive research, such as Tani, Okamoto, Havald, respectively put forward their own views and methods about the calculation of the VCSD for different type of vessel...|$|R
25|$|Very short headways are controversial. The UK Railway Inspectorate has {{evaluated}} the ULTra design {{and is willing}} to accept one-second headways, pending successful completion of initial operational tests at more than 2 seconds. In other jurisdictions, existing rail regulations apply to PRT systems (see CVS, above); these typically calculate headways in terms of absolute <b>stopping</b> <b>distances,</b> which would restrict capacity and make PRT systems unfeasible. No regulatory agency has yet endorsed headways below one second, although proponents believe that regulators may be willing to reduce headways as operational experience increases.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, a Royal Enfield Super Meteor {{motorcycle}} {{was used}} by the Road Research Laboratory to test the Maxaret anti-lock brake. The experiments demonstrated that anti-lock brakes can be of great value to motorcycles, for which skidding is involved in a high proportion of accidents. <b>Stopping</b> <b>distances</b> were reduced in most of the tests compared with locked wheel braking, particularly on slippery surfaces, in which the improvement could be as much as 30percent. Enfield's technical director at the time, Tony Wilson-Jones, saw little future in the system, however, and it was not put into production by the company.|$|E
25|$|Stopping sight {{distance}} is the distance traveled during perception-reaction time (while the vehicle driver perceives a situation requiring a stop, realizes that stopping is necessary, and applies the brake), and maneuver time (while the driver decelerates {{and comes to}} a stop). Actual <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> are also affected by road conditions, {{the mass of the}} car, the incline of the road, and numerous other factors. For design, a conservative distance is needed to allow a vehicle traveling at design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. Typically the design {{sight distance}} allows a below-average driver to stop in time to avoid a collision.|$|E
40|$|When {{the city}} centre {{is the major}} {{destination}} of the passengers, public transport vehicles will get fuller as they approach it. The disadvantage of time loss due to stops {{on the way to}} the centre is thus experienced by an increasing number of travellers. We demonstrate that optimal <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> increase as vehicles get closer to the centre. This is at variance with the usual assumption of constant <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> employed in this type of models. A Countervailing force is that urban densities increase as one approaches the centre. We demonstrate that there exist combinations of the various cost and density gradient parameters that result in constant <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> as an optimal outcome. However, this is found for rather steep density gradients, so that the overall conclusion is that there are good reasons to let <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> increase as one approaches the city centre.

Thus low-intensity oil lamps continued to be used, positioned on the front of locomotives to indicate the class of each train. Four [...] "lamp irons" [...] (brackets on which to place the lamps) were provided: one below the chimney and three evenly spaced {{across the top of the}} buffer beam.

40|$|Abstract—The Automobile Braking System has {{a crucial}} role for safety of the {{passenger}} and riding quality of the vehicle. The braking force mainly depends on normal reaction on the wheel and the co-efficient of friction between the tire and the road surface. Whenever a vehicle is loaded, the normal reaction on the rear wheel is increased. Thus the amount of braking force required to halt the vehicle with minimum <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> {{is based on the}} pillion load on the vehicle. In this work, in order to vary the braking force in two wheelers, the mechanical leverage which operates the master cylinder is varied based on the pillion load. Thus the amount of braking force developed between ground and tire is varied. This optimum braking force on the disc brake helps in attaining the minimum vehicle <b>stopping</b> <b>distance.</b> In addition to that, it also helps in preventing sliding. Thus the system results in reducing the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of the two wheelers and providing a better braking efficiency than the conventional braking system.
