5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> {{as a serious}} blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or {{that it is a}} statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} criticized {{element of the}} film is its ending.

500|$|Music critic Chet Flippo {{wrote in}} a Texas Monthly article {{entitled}} [...] "Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson's latest album {{is more than a}} good country music; it's almost Gospel": [...] "The difference between Nelson's Red Headed Stranger and any current C album, and especially what passes for a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I have heard that <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing".|$|E
500|$|The 1933 film My Weakness had {{previously}} {{used the word}} [...] "gay" [...] as an overt descriptor of homosexuality; one of two men pining away for the same woman suddenly suggests a solution to their mutual problem: [...] "Let's be gay!" [...] However, the Studio Relations Committee censors decreed that the line was too risqué {{and had to be}} muffled.

[...] Phil Rosenthal of the Chicago Sun-Times described the arc as a [...] "lingering exit". Associated Press Television critic Frazier Moore found the entire story arc to be [...] "a dramatic and fitting farewell for the character - and a proud performance by Smits". The Buffalo News describes the arc as [...] "a brilliant five-episode story line".|$|E

500|$|In 1989 President George H.W. Bush awarded Kennan the Medal of Freedom, the nation's {{greatest}} civilian honor. Yet {{he remained}} a realist critic of recent U.S. presidents, urging the U.S. government to [...] "withdraw from its public advocacy {{of democracy and}} human rights", saying that the [...] "tendency to see ourselves {{as the center of}} political enlightenment and as teachers to a great part {{of the rest of the}} world <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as unthought-through, vainglorious and undesirable". These ideas were particularly applicable to U.S. relations with China and Russia. Kennan opposed the Clinton administration's war in Kosovo and its expansion of NATO (the establishment of which he had also opposed half a century earlier), expressing fears that both policies would worsen relations with Russia. He described NATO enlargement as a [...] "strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions".|$|E

He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, {{and turned it into}} his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of Sophocles's Women of Trachis and Electra, and continued work on The Cantos. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: [...] "E.P. has—as he had before—bats in the belfry but it <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> that he has fewer not more than before his incarceration." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan, at {{his website}} Jammer's Reviews, gave [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] {{two out of}} four. Prior to airing, he {{considered}} {{the possibility that the}} crew might actually return home and thus the series would go in a different direction. This was based on the involvement of Berman in the writing, the length of time for the crew returning home matching the summer hiatus and the possibility that the fifth series would cover the crew's reintegration into Federation society. After watching [...] "Hope and Fear", he said [...] "At its fundamental core, a story like [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as almost completely pointless." [...] He said that once again, the status quo of the series was maintained and nothing of note changes. He called the score [...] "wonderous", the sets [...] "impressive" [...] and the direction of the episode [...] "stellar", but said that the plot was [...] "cobbled together out of unlikely coincidences and prior story events that have been twisted to fit the end result." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Stewart's {{involvement}} in transferring resource rights to Alberta, {{his relationship with}} the UFA government that had defeated him in 1921 was frosty: Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster, in his biography of UFA Premier John Edward Brownlee, alleges that this antipathy influenced Stewart's preference for private corporations over the Alberta government in granting hydroelectric power permits. [...] He also feuded with then-Premier Brownlee over development in Alberta's national parks (Stewart favouring large-scale private development and Brownlee opposing it), causing King to record in his diary [...] "Brownlee <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as...being superior to Mr. Stewart, who is handicapped in his dislike of [...]" [...] When King sought to absorb Progressives into his Liberal Party to form a stronger coalition against the Conservatives, Stewart opposed cooperation with the UFA leaders who made up {{a large part of the}} Progressives' Albertan base. [...] While King was inclined to view UFA politicians, like Progressives elsewhere, as [...] "Liberals in a hurry" [...] who were fundamentally comfortable with his government and preferred it to the Conservatives, Stewart understood that the UFA was a distinct group whose members were in many respect more conservative than liberal. [...] King dismissed his minister's views as being the result of Stewart's acrimonious history with the UFA.|$|E

500|$|Silent Alarm {{does not}} contain a solitary lyrical centre and simply observes people's lives. Okereke wanted to leave {{individual}} listeners space {{to make their own}} conclusions, but has admitted that the record [...] "operates in the realm of cultural politics". Much of the songwriting is inspired by the style of confessional poetry authors like Anne Sexton and musicians Thom Yorke and Björk. In general, Silent Alarm tries to make clear an existential pointlessness in life. With hindsight, Okereke noted themes of [...] "helplessness and weariness" [...] because of the album's focus on how he was feeling between the agesof18and20. Professor John Sutherland has pointed out literary elements, often similar to Sylvia Plath's work, in the lyricist's writing. Discussing the opening track [...] "Like Eating Glass", he explained, [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> that whoever did the lyrics must have read some of her work. It has the same rather jagged, surprising imagery. It could sit fairly comfortably in a poetry anthology." [...] The recurring line [...] "We've got crosses on our eyes" [...] is inspired by cartoon characters who have crosses on their eyes when they die. Okereke tried to convey the feelings in a failing relationship, [...] "of being completely disorientated", using childhood metaphors.|$|E
500|$|The WiiWare {{version has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{with the central}} criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag (US$12, £10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which [...] "sacrifices none of [...] classic-influenced charm". He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that [...] "the prospect of Amaya finally earning {{a little something for}} the hard work he invested in this masterpiece <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as satisfyingly poetic" [...] and [...] "absolutely worth your money". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. Edge compared the remake to , satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that Cave Story [...] "belongs on a Nintendo system" [...] and noted gameplay similarities to Blaster Master, in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. Cave Story was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 Nintendo Power Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Drowned in Sound, Alexander Tudor {{observed}} the album's [...] "abrasiveness, brute force, and determination {{to push the}} instrument to its limits," [...] describing a [...] "relentless pummelling of metal in motion; often aggressive or chaotic, but using scales to evoke a sense of discipline" [...] while noting that Stetson was [...] "equally at home with classical minimalism." [...] Exclaim! reviewer Vincent Pollard noted how Vol. 3 [...] "organically and coherently blends Stetson's avant-garde playing and dark, complex themes with accessible and compelling compositions," [...] while MusicOMH commented that Stetson was [...] "finding guttural, fuzzy, violent sounds from his saxophone... but also finding a disarming warmth where necessary." [...] In his review for No Ripcord, Stephen Wragg stated that [...] "there’s such a polyphonic richness to these recordings that it sounds, at times, like five people are present" [...] and noted that the techniques employed in the recording of the album [...] "creates this heady, vertiginous rush– adrenaline-inducing in its deftness; and that’s an effect that <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> as incredibly difficult to recreate in music." [...] Spins Richard Gehr suggested that the music was [...] "densely multiphonic, often claustrophobic, and reeks of fear and flight" [...] but that it [...] "offers at least a slight sense of salvation," [...] {{and concluded that the}} final album in the trilogy was [...] "music of the moment, a work of granular epiphanies that accrete, finally, into a magnificent whole." ...|$|E
