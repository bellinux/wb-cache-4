25|$|There is no legally adopted term in Russia for artisanal fisheries. Artisanal or <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> usually {{refers to}} fishing mainly with {{traditional}} gear, with production {{delivered to the}} market but also used for subsistence. In Russia, the term covers also several kinds of fisheries classified as industrial, such as salmon, chars, whitefish, navaga, flounders and greenling fisheries in the Baltic, the Arctic and the Far Eastern Seas. <b>Subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> by indigenous groups is also an issue. Indigenous fishers mainly work estuaries, lagoons and rivers (for anadromous fish). Legally, they are bound to use their catch for local consumption only. They {{are not allowed to}} sell their catch, but in reality, this is not always the case.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the river}} was navigated and <b>subsistence</b> <b>fished</b> by local Alaska Natives. The name of the river means from- or up to- great water, a {{reference}} to Iliamna Lake, Alaska's largest freshwater lake.|$|R
50|$|Lethrinus atkinsoni {{is caught}} as a <b>subsistence</b> <b>fish,</b> commercially, {{as well as}} by {{recreation}} fishers. Although considered desirable as food, other species in the genus are preferred due to its smaller size. It is caught mainly using handlines, by trawling, and is caputured in such nets as the shore seine and gillnet. It is marketed mostly fresh, not frozen.|$|R

Box 26, Mekoryuk, Alaska 99630 Nunivak Islanders (Nuniwarmiut) report Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus; atgiiyar) was {{a significant}} and consistent subsistence resource {{during the first half}} of the 20 th century. Following an absence of at least 30 years, Pacific cod returned to Nunivak waters in the mid- 1980 s and were once again incorporated into the Nuniwarmiut subsistence round. This report presents an overview of traditional and contemporary Pacific cod fishing primarily collected as “traditional knowledge” from Nunivak elders, as well as from literature and archival sources. The report also summarizes the current state of the Nunivak Pacific cod fishery with results of <b>subsistence</b> <b>fish</b> surveys and documentation of fishing grounds. Secondarily, historical and contemporary use and availability of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka; cayag), Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus; culugpaugar) and other <b>subsistence</b> <b>fish</b> resources are presented. Ten Nuniwarmiut elders were interviewed and each provided detailed information on previously undocumented aspects of Pacific cod fishing at Nunivak Island, including locations, availability, methods, gear, processing and storage techniques...|$|R
25|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} taken {{as part of}} a number of fisheries, although catch data is not available. It is taken by methods including hook and line, gill nets as well as other <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> gear. Razorbelly scad is marketed fresh and dried salted.|$|E
25|$|More recently, South American rivers {{including}} the Amazon {{have become a}} popular destination for recreational anglers, who go to fly fish for pacu. The International Game Fish Association has sponsored fly-fishing courses for native Brazilian fishermen, typically accustomed to <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing,</b> so they can work as guides to fishing tourists.|$|E
25|$|For most {{of their}} history, the Sama-Bajau have been a nomadic, {{seafaring}} people, living off the sea by trading and <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing.</b> The boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau see themselves as non-aggressive people. They kept close to the shore by erecting houses on stilts, and travelled using lepa, handmade boats which many lived in.|$|E

25|$|Finally, 109 {{species of}} fish species have been {{identified}} by the IMNA alone, with a clear dependence on altitude. The largest specimens, which are the principal targets of commercial and <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> - such as sábalo, barred surubim, and pacú - are restricted to the alluvial plains, below 700 m. Above just 1000 m, the fish diversity diminishes dramatically.|$|E
25|$|The parish's {{principal}} activities are farming and animal husbandry (dairy and cattle ranching primarily), focusing on dairy production, {{as well as}} <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> and a small commercial nucleus. The port has had remodeling and modernization to permit both an increase in commercial traffic between Ponta Delgada, Vila do Corvo (Corvo Island) {{and the rest of}} the archipelago, as well as to capture lucrative trans-Atlantic maritime tourism.|$|E
25|$|Artisan {{fishing is}} {{small-scale}} commercial or <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing,</b> particularly practices involving coastal or island ethnic groups using traditional fishing techniques and traditional boats. This may also include heritage groups involved in customary fishing practices. Artisan fishers usually use small traditional fishing boats that are open (undecked) and have sails; these boats use {{little to no}} mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan fishing boats are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines.|$|E
50|$|A federally {{recognized}} Alaska Native tribal entity {{is located}} in the community—the Akiak Native Community. Akiak is a Yup'ik Eskimo village with a reliance on <b>subsistence</b> and <b>fishing</b> activities. The sale or importation of alcohol is banned in the village.|$|R

25|$|The 2010 census {{states that}} there were 170 people living on the island. However, witness {{accounts}} estimate that the population actually ranges between 35-50 people. Some support themselves largely by <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> and farming, while others depend on welfare. All residents live rent-free, and meat is free. Niihau has no telephone services and no paved roads. Horses are the main form of transportation; bicycles are also used. There are no power lines; solar power provides all electricity. There is no plumbing or running water on the island. Water comes from rainwater catchment. The Robinson family established most of these conditions. There is no hotel, and barges deliver groceries from Kauai, often purchased by relatives, with free shipping.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 2009, the International Court of Justice in the Hague upheld Costa Rica's {{navigation}} {{rights for}} commercial purposes to <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> on {{their side of the}} river. An 1858 treaty extended navigation rights to Costa Rica, but Nicaragua denied passenger travel and fishing were part of the deal; the court ruled Costa Ricans on the river were not required to have Nicaraguan tourist cards or visas as Nicaragua argued, but, in a nod to the Nicaraguans, ruled that Costa Rican boats and passengers must stop at the first and last Nicaraguan port along their route. They must also have an identity document or passport. Nicaragua can also impose timetables on Costa Rican traffic. Nicaragua may require Costa Rican boats to display the flag of Nicaragua, but may not charge them for departure clearance from its ports. These were all specific items of contention brought to the court in the 2005 filing.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the ancient}} {{manuscript}} Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island. In the following centuries, Norwegians, {{and to a lesser}} extent other Scandinavians, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin. The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing, one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a period of civil strife, Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration to that Union and came under Danish rule after Sweden's secession from that union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced Lutheranism forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence. In the wake of the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars, Iceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944. Until the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> and agriculture, and was among the poorest in Europe. Industrialisation of the fisheries and Marshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity, and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the European Economic Area, which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.|$|E

50|$|Pond {{culture is}} the most common system in the country. Other forms of fish culture such as cage culture are only {{starting}} to be discussed especially by the emerging commercial fish farmers. Previously farmers, 99 percent of whom were <b>subsistence</b> <b>fish</b> farmers, had ponds ranging anywhere from 50 m² to 200 m². The majority (an estimated 60 percent) remain at subsistence level of production with little or no technical inputs or management. With the drive to commercialise aquaculture, production efforts to increase the pond surface have resulted in a current average of 500 m² per pond. Farmers at this level have adopted the use of inputs such as quality fish seed and feed. The feed, however, is still usually made on-farm using formulae provided by the Aquaculture Research and Development Centre, Kajjansi.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aquaculture}} of salmonids is {{the farming}} and harvesting of salmonids under controlled conditions for both commercial and recreational purposes. Salmonids (particularly salmon and rainbow trout), along with carp, {{are the two}} most important fish groups in aquaculture. The most commonly commercially farmed salmonid is the Atlantic salmon. In the U.S. Chinook salmon and rainbow trout are the most commonly farmed salmonids for recreational and <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> through the National Fish Hatchery System. [...] In Europe, brown trout are the most commonly reared fish for recreational restocking. Commonly farmed non-salmonid fish groups include tilapia, catfish, sea bass and bream.|$|E
2500|$|Costa Rica {{filed suit}} before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in The Hague, which ruled in 2009 that con objetos de comercio {{had to be}} read as [...] "with {{purposes}} of trade," [...] and that Nicaragua had therefore breached its treaty obligations by preventing free navigation with purposes of commercial tourism. [...] The ICJ also ruled that Costa Rican police forces {{did not have the}} right to navigate the San Juan River with arms and ammunition, or to use the river to resupply their posts along the right bank. [...] The ICJ also ruled that Nicaragua was obliged to recognize a customary right by Costa Rican inhabitants of the right bank of the river to practice <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of the 20th century, very few people lived in this area as it was {{isolated}} and inaccessible. Only about two or three homes belonging to families who made a living by <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing</b> and agriculture were here. The population began to rise with the establishment of sea turtle hunting, which began in nearby San Agustinillo. In the 1970s a turtle slaughterhouse was built in Mazunte, making the area the center of sea turtle exploitation, and the town became almost wholly dependent on the trade of turtle meat and eggs, the latter considered to be an aphrodisiac. [...] Legally about 30,000 animals a year were butchered, but some environmentalists believe the illegal take may have been more than twice that.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the economy}} around Kaltag is based on <b>subsistence</b> hunting and <b>fishing.</b> Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, {{waterfowl}} and berries are elements of the subsistence economy.|$|R
25|$|The {{economy of}} the island was always based almost {{exclusively}} on commerce and services. Due to lack of rain, agriculture is at a <b>subsistence</b> level. <b>Fishing</b> has some relevance, but conditions prevent it from being more important, {{not only for the}} catch—lobster—but also for the associated industries: conserves, drying and salting of fish, and naval construction.|$|R
2500|$|Cities, {{characterized}} by population density, symbolic function, and urban planning, have existed {{for thousands of}} years. In the conventional view, civilization and the city both followed from the development of agriculture, which enabled production of surplus food, and thus a social division of labour (with concomitant social stratification) and trade. Early cities often featured granaries, sometimes within a temple. A minority viewpoint considers that cities may have arisen without agriculture, due to alternate means of <b>subsistence</b> (<b>fishing),</b> to use as communal seasonal shelters, to their value as bases for defensive and offensive military organization, [...] or to their inherent economic function. Cities {{played a crucial role}} in the establishment of political power over an area, and ancient leaders such as Alexander the Great founded and created them with zeal.|$|E
2500|$|The Tuvaluan economy {{therefore}} {{relies heavily}} on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal <b>subsistence</b> <b>fishing,</b> locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years [...] all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008 comprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse seiners, far outweigh domestic activity, with a production volume of 35,541 tonnes worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. The fishing in the 900,000km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna.|$|E

40|$|Background Mercury is a metal with {{widespread}} {{distribution in}} aquatic ecosystems and significant neurodevelopmental toxicity in humans. Fish biomonitoring for total mercury {{has been conducted}} in South Carolina (SC) since 1976, and consumption advisories have been posted for many SC waterways. However, there is limited information on the potential reproductive impacts of mercury due to recreational or <b>subsistence</b> <b>fish</b> consumption. Methods To address this issue, geocoded residential locations for live births from the Vital Statistics Registry (1995 – 2005, N = 362, 625) were linked with spatially interpolated total mercury concentrations in fish to estimate potential mercury exposure from consumption of locally caught fish. Generalized estimating equations were {{used to test the}} hypothesis that risk of low birth weight (LBW, < 2, 500 grams) or preterm birth (PTB, < 37 weeks clinical gestation) was greater among women living in areas with elevated total mercury in fish, after adjustment fo...|$|R
