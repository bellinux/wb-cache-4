5|$|Rousseau hiked to {{the radio}} tower and changed the message from the numbers to a repeating {{distress}} call. Three days later, Rousseau {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Alexandra. One week after Alex's birth, Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) came and took Alex from Rousseau. Ben told Rousseau that the child would be safe with them, and that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> for being left alive. Before leaving, Ben tells her that if she hears whispers, she should run the other way. After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.|$|E
2500|$|Antonio {{was raised}} in Port Melbourne, Victoria, a working class suburb of Melbourne. [...] Her father was a Chilean docker of French and Spanish descent who {{died when she was}} 15 months. [...] With the {{encouragement}} of her uncle she learnt her cricket from the boys in her neighbourhood streets. [...] As a young girl during the Great Depression, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to find work at a shoe factory in the industrial suburb of Collingwood. [...] The factory was home to a women's cricket team where Antonio {{came to the attention of}} Eddie Conlon, a club cricketer with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game. [...] With the assistance of Conlon, Antonio developed a rare mix of leg spin and off spin, including a top spinner and a wrong'un.|$|E
2500|$|The British satirical {{programme}} Spitting Image made a send-up of [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] entitled [...] "Kylie Minogue", {{in which}} Minogue {{is depicted as}} being brought to life in a way similar to Frankenstein's monster in an old 1930s movie. The action shifts between the laboratory to an apartment {{similar to that of}} the original video. The song also pokes fun at her performance in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, in which as Charlene Mitchell, later Robinson she was best known at the time, and implies that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> to have been chosen over other soap stars, namely Paul Henry who was Benny Hawkins in the British drama Crossroads. Stock, Aitken and Waterman are combined together as a large tape player providing creature-Minogue's voice which at one point is distorted to sound like Rick Astley.|$|E

60|$|Allie had steeled {{herself to}} anything, and those shots warned her that {{now she had}} two less enemies to contend with, and that she must be quick to seize the first {{opportunity}} to act. She could leap upon the mustang, and if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> she could get away. She could jump for the Winchester and surely shoot one of these villains, perhaps both of them. But the spirit that gave her the nerve to attempt either plan bade her wait, not too long, but longer, {{in the hope of}} a more favorable moment.|$|E
60|$|She {{was half}} afraid {{she had been}} too prudent and let a good offer go by; but {{although}} it might bring her trouble and disappointment, she would sooner look for the ore herself. She had sometimes shrunk from the task, but after all it was her duty. Then she could not ask George for advice. He had never believed in the lode and would, no doubt, tell her <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> to get an offer, and had better make the best bargain she could. Farnam knew nothing about mining; he was absorbed in his orchard, and Mabel now and then declared that his judgment was only worth trusting about fruit trees.|$|E

6000|$|She {{stood the}} journey {{perfectly}} well, {{and in the}} passage to Dover she suffered so little from the rough weather {{that she was an}} example to many robust matrons who filled the ladies' cabin with the noise of their anguish during the night. She would have insisted upon taking the first train up to London, if March had not represented that this would not expedite the sailing of the Cupania, and that she might as well stay the forenoon at the convenient railway hotel, and rest. It was not quite his ideal of repose that the first people they saw in the coffee-room when they went to breakfast should be Kenby and Rose Adding, who were having their tea and toast and eggs together in the greatest apparent good-fellowship. He saw his wife shrink back involuntarily from the encounter, but this was only to gather force for it; and the next moment she was upon them in all the joy of the surprise. Then March allowed himself to be as glad as the others both seemed, and he shook hands with Kenby while his wife kissed Rose; and they all talked at once. In the confusion of tongues it was presently intelligible that Mrs. Kenby was going to be down in a few minutes; and Kenby took March into his confidence with a smile which was, almost a wink in explaining that he knew how it was with the ladies. He said that Rose and he usually got down to breakfast first, and when he had listened inattentively to Mrs. March's apology for being on her way home, he told her that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> not to have gone to Schevleningen, where she and March would have frozen to death. He said {{that they were going to}} spend September at a little place on the English coast, near by, where he had been the day before with Rose to look at lodgings, and where you could bathe all through the month. He was not surprised that the Marches were going home, and said, Well, that was their original plan, wasn't it? ...|$|E
6000|$|But as {{respects the}} frivolity of the proof adduced, {{there was nothing}} to choose between Catholic and Protestant. Out of civil and canon law a net was woven through whose meshes there was no escape, and into it the victims were driven by popular clamor. Suspicion of {{witchcraft}} was justified by general report, by the ill-looks of the suspected, by being silent when accused, by her mother's having been a witch, by flight, by exclaiming when arrested, I am lost! by a habit of using imprecations, by the evidence of two witnesses, by the accusation of a man on his death-bed, by a habit of being away from home at night, by fifty other things equally grave. Anybody might be an accuser,--a personal enemy, an infamous person, a child, parent, brother, or sister. Once accused, the culprit was not to be allowed to touch the ground on the way to prison, was not to be left alone there lest she have interviews with the Devil and get from him the means of being insensible under torture, was to be stripped and shaved in order to prevent her concealing some charm, or to facilitate the finding of witch-marks. Her right thumb tied to her left great-toe, and vice versa, she was thrown into the water. If she floated, she was a witch; if she sank and was drowned, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky.</b> This trial, as old as the days of Pliny the Elder, was gone out of fashion, the author of De Lamiis assures us, in his day, everywhere but in Westphalia. [...] "On halfproof or strong presumption," [...] says Bodin, the judge may proceed to torture. If the witch did not shed tears under the rack, it was almost conclusive of guilt. On this topic of torture he grows eloquent. The rack does very well, but to thrust splinters between the nails and flesh of hands and feet [...] "is the most excellent gehenna of all, and practised in Turkey." [...] That of Florence, where they seat the criminal in a hanging chair so contrived that if he drop asleep it overturns and leaves him hanging by a rope which wrenches his arms backwards, is perhaps even better, [...] "for the limbs are not broken, and without trouble or labor one gets out the truth." [...] It is well in carrying the accused to the chamber of torture to cause some in the next room to shriek fearfully as if on the rack, that they may be terrified into confession. It is proper to tell them that their accomplices have confessed and accused them ("though they have done no such thing") that they may do the same out of revenge. The judge may also with a good conscience lie to the prisoner and tell her that if she admit her guilt, she may be pardoned. This is Bodin's opinion, but Walburger, writing a century later, concludes that the judge may go to any extent citra mendacium, this side of lying. He may tell the witch that he will be favorable, meaning to the Commonwealth; that he will see that she has a new house built for her, that is, a wooden one to burn her in; that her confession will be most useful in saving her life, to wit, her life eternal. There seems little difference between the German's white lies and the Frenchman's black ones. As to punishment, Bodin is fierce for burning. Though a Protestant, he quotes with evident satisfaction a decision of the magistrates that one [...] "who had eaten flesh on a Friday should be burned alive unless he repented, and if he repented, yet he was hanged out of compassion." [...] A child under twelve who will not confess meeting with the Devil should be put to death if convicted of the fact, though Bodin allows that Satan made no express compact with those who had not arrived at puberty. This he learned from the examination of Jeanne Harvillier, who deposed, [...] "that, though her mother dedicated her to Satan so soon as she was born, yet she was not married to him, nor did he demand that, or her renunciation of God, till she had attained the age of twelve." ...|$|E

60|$|Her eyes sparkled. The {{thought of}} the money was {{wonderful}} to her. A thousand pounds in mille notes that very night! She thought it all over rapidly. She would never run such risks again. She would play for small amounts each day--just enough to amuse herself. Then, if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky,</b> <b>she</b> would plunge, only she would choose the right moment. Very likely <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> able to pay the whole amount back {{in a day or}} two. If Henry minded, well, it was his own fault. He should have been different.|$|R
