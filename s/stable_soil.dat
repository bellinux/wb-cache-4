In addition, as ants and termites build mounds, they transport soil materials from one horizon to another. Other important functions are fulfilled by earthworms in the soil ecosystem, in particular their intense mucus production, both within the intestine and as a lining in their galleries, exert a priming effect on soil microflora, giving them the status of ecosystem engineers, which they share with ants and termites.|$|E

The text includes a similar coverage on legends of god Shiva and god Vishnu, and dedicates a section on goddess Shakti as well. Chapters 54-102 of the text discuss the significance and celebration of Hindu festivals and family celebrations such as those related to the Sanskara (rite of passage).

40|$|Testing the {{relative}} {{performances of the}} single ring pressure infiltrometer (PI) and simplified falling head (SFH) techniques to determine the field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K fs, at the near point scale may help to better establish the usability of these techniques for interpreting and simulating hydrological processes. A sampling of 10 Sicilian sites showed that the measured K fs was generally higher with the SFH technique than the PI one, with statistically significant differences by a factor varying from 3 to 192, depending on the site. A short experiment with the SFH technique yielded higher K fs values because a longer experiment with the PI probably promoted short-term swelling phenomena reducing macroporosity. Moreover, the PI device likely altered the infiltration surface {{at the beginning of}} the run, particularly in the less <b>stable</b> <b>soils,</b> where soil particle arrangement may be expected to vary upon wetting. This interpretation was supported by a soil structure stability index, SSI, and also by the hydraulic conductivity data obtained with the tension infiltrometer, i. e. with a practically negligible disturbance of the sampled soil surface. In particular, a statistically significant, increasing relationship with SSI and an unsaturated conductivity greater than the saturated one were only detected for the K fs data obtained with the PI. The SFH and PI techniques should be expected to yield more similar results in relatively rigid porous media (low percentages of fine particles and structurally <b>stable</b> <b>soils)</b> than in soils that modify appreciably their particle arrangement upon wetting. The simultaneous use of the two techniques may allow to improve K fs determination in soils that change their hydrodynamic behaviour during a runoff producing rainfall event...|$|R
50|$|James Nations recognizes four zones {{which the}} Lacandón utilize to {{maintain}} a diverse food supply and healthy diet. The primary or old growth forest consists of small portions of tropical rain forest and lower mountainous rain forest, which constitutes {{the majority of the}} forest ecosystem. While the growth in this type of rainforest is not quite as tall as that seen in a tropical rainforest, the two largely share the same characteristics (see interactive map at and map at). The primary growth forest provides hunting for the Lacandón, as deer, peccary, agouti, and monkeys inhabit the area. The Lacandón also utilize the many different plant species in the rainforest for various purposes, including dietary and medicinal; the medicinal use of plants is well-developed amongst the Lacandón and is important in their culture. This zone is also very important for the maintenance of rich and <b>stable</b> <b>soil,</b> of which the Lacandón take advantage in their milpa systems, the second zone.|$|E

The place where it met the River Brue, then flowing about 80 m north of its present course, was already significant: it had been an important crossing point, with a timber causeway over the river and the associated marshy floodplain, since at least the 8th century. For most of the canal's length it was dug through firm clay, following a level course along the 10-metre contour on the north-west side of Wearyall Hill, but at its end point, close to the Saxon-era market place (still extant at [...] ) it encountered less <b>stable</b> <b>soil.</b> Here the banks were revetted with timber and a wharf was possibly constructed.

50|$|The composition, moisture, and {{compaction}} of soil are {{all major}} factors {{in determining the}} erosivity of rainfall. Sediments containing more clay {{tend to be more}} resistant to erosion than those with sand or silt, because the clay helps bind soil particles together. Soil containing high levels of organic materials are often more resistant to erosion, because the organic materials coagulate soil colloids and create a stronger, more <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> structure. The amount of water present in the soil before the precipitation also plays an important role, because it sets limits on the amount of water that can be absorbed by the soil (and hence prevented from flowing on the surface as erosive runoff). Wet, saturated soils {{will not be able to}} absorb as much rain water, leading to higher levels of surface runoff and thus higher erosivity for a given volume of rainfall. Soil compaction also affects the permeability of the soil to water, and hence the amount of water that flows away as runoff. More compacted soils will have a larger amount of surface runoff than less compacted soils.|$|E

5000|$|Composting {{allows the}} plants to {{transform}} and enrich {{the soil with}} organic matter, and also to return nutrients to the soil. Biointensive composting is fairly straightforward, emphasizing the health and diversity of the microbes that break down and {{become a part of}} the compost. Thus, relatively cooler composting is practiced, and plant materials are preferred over animal materials. Soil is often combined with the compost to inoculate the pile with microbes. Without human waste recycling, however, nutrients and organic matter are constantly removed from the soil (as food that is consumed by the farmer) and flushed away. Therefore, when safe and legal human waste recycling is possible—as in many places it already is—that fertility can, and should, be returned to the soil. Another great unappreciated source of compost and soil improvement is the roots of crops themselves, which, in the biointensive system are left to decompose in the soil, where they help to both fertilize and “sew it together”, creating <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> structure. Thus, crops such as alfalfa, which has exceptionally deep roots, and cereal rye, which has a particularly high volume of roots, are valued.|$|E

30|$|The {{enhanced}} SMZ mineralization, measured {{after the}} first 14 C-SMZ application, as well as after the second application is exclusively due to the inoculated microbial community, since the “adaptation” experiments have clearly excluded adaptation processes {{as a reason for}} accelerated SMZ degradation. In a third phase, the carrier particles were separated from the bulk soil, before SMZ was applied for a third time (Additional file 7 : Fig S 6; Additional file 8 : Fig S 7). In the bulk soil without carrier particles, 56  % of the applied SMZ was degraded after 62  days. These results reveal that microbes were able to proliferate in the soil matrix and continue the SMZ degradation there, which is a very important factor to ensure the success of this application approach. There is no need to apply the carrier particles again, after the microbes have established in the bulk soil. Therefore, we strongly recommend this very effective, sustainable, and <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> inoculation approach, using a microbial community which supports the degrading strain, and carrier particles for a <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> inoculation, for remediating soils.|$|E

During that 1000 years, three quarters of the forest cover was progressively cleared by burning, but there was no apparent correlation with increased instability in sand dune areas.

Their principal cause appears to be climatic, with unstable phases being windy and dry and stable phases less windy and moist...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) is {{a major source of}} uncertainty in predicting atmospheric CO 2 concentration during the 21 st century. Isolating the <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> carbon (C) from other, more labile, C fractions in soil is of prime importance for calibrating soil C simulation models, and gaining insights into the mechanisms that lead to soil C stability. Long-term experiments with continuous bare fallow (vegetation-free) treatments in which the decay of soil C is monitored for decades after all inputs of C have stopped, provide a unique opportunity to assess the quantity of <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> C. We analyzed data from six bare fallow experiments of long-duration (> 30 yrs), covering a range of soil types and climate conditions, and sited at Askov (Denmark), Grignon and Versailles (France), Kursk (Russia), Rothamsted (UK), and Ultuna (Sweden). A conceptual three pool model dividing soil C into a labile pool (turnover time of a several years), an intermediate pool (turnover time of a several decades) and a stable pool (turnover time of a several centuries or more) fits well with the long term C decline observed in the bare fallow soils. The estimate of stable C ranged from 2. 7 g C kg− 1 at Rothamsted to 6. 8 g C kg− 1 at Grignon. The uncertainty associated with estimates of the stable pool was large due to the short duration of the fallow treatments relative to the turnover time of <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> C. At Versailles, where there is least uncertainty associated with the determination of a stable pool, the soil contains predominantly stable C after 80 years of continuous bare fallow.
