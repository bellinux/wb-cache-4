In general, for light-duty engines (passenger cars, race cars, and light commercial vehicles), the vanes rotate in unison to vary the gas <b>swirl</b> <b>angle</b> and the cross sectional area. In general, for heavy-duty engines, the vanes do not rotate, but instead the axial width of the inlet is selectively blocked by an axially sliding wall (either the vanes are selectively covered by a moving slotted shroud or the vanes selectively move vs a stationary slotted shroud). Either way, the area between {{the tips of the}} vanes changes, leading to a variable aspect ratio.|$|E

The development of upstream and downstream propagating disturbance waves was observed and the propagation velocities measured. A downstream traveling wave was observed to produce a structure similar in appearance to a vortex breakdown. An upstream traveling wave produced a moving turbulent region.

The results showed that the swirl flow burner yields higher thermal efficiency and emits lower CO concentration than those of the conventional radial flow burner. A greater <b>swirl</b> <b>angle</b> results in higher thermal efficiency and CO emission. With increasing loading height, the thermal efficiency increases but the CO emission decreases. For a lower loading height (2 or 3 [*]cm), the highest efficiency occurs at the inclination angle 15 °.

The study is confined to the static components of the centrifugal compressor stage like crossover bend (180 0 U-bend), a radial cascade of return channel vanes and exit ducting (90 0 L-turn).

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the effects of using a jet of air to control the vortex breakdown position on a 70 degree delta wing is presented. The specific objectives focused on optimizing the blowing positions in terms of maximum lift increments obtained for minimum blowing rates.

Measurements were made downstream of the mixer in a coaxial wind tunnel. The core-to-bypass velocity ratio was set to 2 : 1, temperature ratio to 1. 0, and pressure ratio to 1. 03, giving a Reynolds number of 5. 2710 5, based on the core flow velocity and equivalent diameter. In the core flow, the background turbulence intensity was raised to 5 and the <b>swirl</b> <b>angle</b> was varied from 0 deg to 30 deg with five vane geometries. At low swirl angles, additional streamwise vortices were generated by the deformation of normal vortices due to the scalloped lobes. With increased core swirl, greater than 10 deg, the additional streamwise vortices were generated mainly due to radial velocity deflection, rather than stretching and deformation of normal vortices. At high swirl angles, stronger streamwise vortices and rapid interaction between various vortices promoted downstream mixing.

40|$|Unsteady vortex {{structure}} over a delta-wing {{in response to}} the transient along-core blowing is investigated by velocity measurements and the phase-trigger technique. The wing geometry has a 75 -deg sweep angle and is at a 40 -deg angle of attack. The changes of the along-core and the swirling velocity components are related to illustrate the evolution of the {{vortex structure}} when the transient blowing is applied along the axis of the vortex core. It is found that the highly sensitive character of the central region of the vortex core occurs not only in the along-core direction but also in the circumferential direction. Within the stable vortex core, the along-core velocity {{in response to the}} transient along-core blowing must change in accordance with the swirling velocity. The magnitudes of the along-core and the swirling velocity components within the stable vortex core must satisfy the stability parameter and the limitation of the maximum <b>swirl</b> <b>angle.</b> The maximum <b>swirl</b> <b>angle</b> within the stable vortex core is nearly the same both in the case of transient along core blowing and in the unperturbed case.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the aerodynamic performance of an annular S-shaped duct representative of that used to connect the compressor spools of aircraft gas turbine engines. Measurements of both the mean flow and turbulent structure have been obtained using both 5 hole pressure probes and a 3 component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. The measurements indicate that development of the flow within the duct is complex and significantly influenced by the combined effects of streamwise pressure gradients and flow curvature. For inlet conditions in which boundary layers are developed along an upstream entry length the static pressure, shear stress and velocity distributions are presented. The data shows {{that as a result of}} flow curvature significant streamwise pressure gradients exist within the duct, with this curvature also affecting the generation and suppression of turbulence. The stagnation pressure loss within the duct is also assessed and is consistent with the measured distributions of shear stress. More engine representative conditions are provided by locating a single stage compressor at inlet to the duct. Relative to the naturally developed inlet conditions the flow within the duct is less likely to separate, but mixing out of the compressor blade wakes increases the measured duct loss. With both types of inlet conditions the effect of a radial strut, such as that used for carrying loads and engine services, is also described both in terms of the static pressure distribution along the strut and its contribution to overall loss. The effects of inlet swirl on the flow field that develops within an annular S-shaped duct have also been investigated. By removing the outlet guide vanes from an upstream single stage compressor <b>swirl</b> <b>angles</b> in excess of 30 ° were generated. Results show that within the S-shaped duct tangential momentum is conserved, leading to increasing swirl velocities through the duct as its radius decreases. Furthermore, this component influences the streamwise velocity as pressure gradients are established to ensure the mean flow follows the duct curvature. Consequently in the critical region adjacent to the inner casing, where separation is most likely to occur, higher streamwise velocities are observed. Within the duct substantial changes also occur to the turbulence field which results in an increased stagnation pressure loss between duct inlet and exit. Data is also presented showing the increasing <b>swirl</b> <b>angles</b> through the duct which has consequences both for the design of the downstream compressor spool and of any radial struts which may be located within the duct...|$|R

40|$|Master of EngineeringSpray dryers are {{the core}} {{components}} of a milk powder production plant, where the basic configuration usually features co-current flow of milk powder and air. Spray dryers have to be cleaned frequently due to powder deposit build-up on the walls. Powder deposit build-up gives rise to lower product yields and poses a potential fire risk. If the powder deposits are scorched (from being overheated) they will contaminate, and thus compromise, the quality and consumer safety of the final product, if the powder deposits fall in and mix with it. With milk powder production rates of most industrial spray dryers ranging from 4 - 28 tonnes of dry powder an hour, these wall deposition problems are significant. This problem is worth investigating because the outcome of reducing or eliminating wall deposition is that a spray dryer could operate {{for a longer period}} of time without having to be cleaned. Reduction in downtime due to cleaning would give rise to increased production time and possibly a reduction in the cost of manufacturing the product. The spray dryer used in this work was a modified short-form co-current Niro unit, fabricated from stainless steel. The spray dryer had an internal diameter of 0. 80 m, narrowing down to 0. 06 m at the base, and a height of 2 m. A two-fluid nozzle was used to spray the process fluids (water, skim milk and grape skin extract) into the drying chamber. To measure the wall deposition fluxes on the internal walls of the spray dryer, four stainless steel plates (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) were inserted in place of the windows that were previously used as sight glasses. A fifth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) and a sixth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 110 mm) were also placed on the conical section of the spray dryer at different circumferential locations. Before this work, no quantitative data on the effects of spray dryer operating conditions on the wall deposition fluxes of food material were available. This work investigated the effect on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls of the spray dryer of (i) flow patterns in the spray dryer, by changing the degree of swirl imparted to the incoming air by using three <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angles</b> of 0 o, 25 o and 30 o, and (ii) the stickiness of the product, through first changing the temperature of the incoming air by using three inlet air temperatures of 170 oC, 200 oC and 230 oC; and then changing the process fluid flowrate by using three flowrates of 1. 4 kg hr- 1, 1. 6 kg hr- 1 and 1. 8 kg hr- 1. Previous researchers have found that the extent to which water droplets spread out in the drying chamber is affected by the amount of swirl in the inlet air. This is likely to affect wall deposition fluxes because the particles will be closer to the walls if the droplets spread out widely. The results of this work have quantitatively confirmed that the spray deposition flux increases at higher <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angles,</b> where the spray deposition flux increased from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 (<b>swirl</b> vane <b>angle</b> 0 o) to 12. 9 g m- 2 hr- 1 (<b>swirl</b> vane <b>angle</b> 30 o). When a <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angle</b> of 0 o was used, it was observed that the cross-sectional area of the spray cloud did not change very significantly with time. However, when a <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angle</b> of 25 o was used, the spray cloud was observed to “flutter”, and when the <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angle</b> was increased to 30 o, the spray cloud was observed to recirculate rapidly back in the direction of the nozzle. Thus, the chance of the particles being thrown further towards the walls of the chamber is likely to increase at higher <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angles.</b> This result suggests that higher wall deposition arises because more swirl is imparted to the air entering the dryer, which in turn affects the stability of the spray cloud and, therefore, the stability of the flow patterns in the spray dryer. The stickiness of the skim milk powder is related to the temperature and moisture content of the particles. In the past, the sticky-point curve has been suggested as a semi-quantitative concept in selecting operating conditions for spray drying food material containing carbohydrates, where it has been implied that there is no significant wall deposition below the sticky-point curve. This work has quantified the spray deposition in spray dryers with respect to the sticky-point curve, where the highest spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls was 16 g m- 2 hr- 1, and the operating point corresponding to this spray deposition flux was located at and above the sticky-point curve. Hence, both particle stickiness and flow patterns affect the wall deposition of particles in a spray dryer. This work also investigated the effect of wall properties, namely a non-stick food grade material (nylon), adhesive tape and stainless steel, on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls. The effect of electrostatics on wall deposition was studied by grounding the spray dryer and an anti-static agent was added to the skim milk to investigate if altering the properties of the feed material could reduce wall deposition. This work has quantitatively confirmed that cohesion occurs at the same rate as adhesion for skim milk powder in this spray dryer, because firstly, decreasing the adhesion tendency of the v wall by using nylon coating had no significant effect on the spray deposition flux compared with a smooth stainless steel wall and a wall covered with a double-sided adhesive tape; and secondly the powder collected on the walls was a linear function of time with and without adhesive on the plates. Furthermore, using a nylon coated wall did not eliminate wall deposition, and the wall deposition flux was found to be the same as when a stainless steel wall was used. This result further supports the finding here that spray deposition on the walls for skim milk powder is controlled by cohesion rather than adhesion. The spray dryer operating parameters that gave rise to the least spray deposition flux on the walls were a <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angle</b> of 0 o, an inlet air temperature of 230 oC and a process fluid flowrate of 1. 4 kg hr- 1. Decreasing the feed flowrate from 1. 8 kg hr- 1 to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 (decrease by 24 %), with the inlet air temperature and <b>swirl</b> vane <b>angle</b> held constant, decreased the wall deposition flux by 43 % from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 to 4 g m- 2 hr- 1. Since the spray deposition flux on the walls decreased by 43 % when the feed flowrate was decreased by 24 %, it might be considered that the production process is in favour of a decrease in the feed flowrate to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 in this dryer, and consequently a decrease in the spray deposition flux on the walls per unit production output. Finally, this work investigated if the outlet moisture content from this small spray dryer used here was equilibrium limited or controlled by drying kinetics. The findings in this work confirmed the product moisture locus concept, which implies that the outlet moisture content of the skim milk particles approaches the equilibrium moisture content (in equilibrium with the outlet gas), and that the outlet moisture content of spray-dried food material containing carbohydrates is probably not limited by particle drying kinetics, even though the spray dryer is smaller (diameter 0. 8 m, height 2 m) than those used in the dairy industry, typically with a diameter of 30 m and a height of 10 m...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} project was undertaken {{to investigate the}} character of vortex breakdown with particular regard to the waveguide theories of vortex breakdown. A rectangular wing based on the NACA 0012 airfoil was used to produce a trailing vortex which convected downstream without undergoing breakdown. Dye marked the vortex location. A disturbance was then introduced onto the vortex using a small moving wire to 'cut' the vortex. The development of upstream and downstream propagating disturbance waves was observed and the propagation velocities measured. The downstream traveling wave produced a structure similar in appearance to a vortex breakdown. The upstream wave produced a moving, swirling, turbulent region {{that was not a}} vortex breakdown. The waves moving in either direction have the same swirl velocity profiles but quite different axial velocity profiles. The upstream disturbance (turbulence) moved into a flow with an axial velocity profile that had a wake-like defect in the core region. The downstream moving vortex breakdown moved into a flow with a jet-like overshoot in the core region. The fact that no breakdown was observed for the wake-like defect and breakdown was observed for the jet-like overshoot is not consistent with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. Although there are not a lot of examples, CFD results show breakdown for both types of profiles. The longitudinal and swirl velocity profiles were documented by Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) measurement.
