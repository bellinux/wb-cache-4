40|$|We {{show that}} the {{representation}} of an image in a deep neural network (DNN) can be manipulated to mimic those <b>of</b> other <b>natural</b> images, with only minor, imperceptible perturbations to the original image. Previous methods for generating adversarial images focused on image perturbations designed to produce erroneous class labels, while we concentrate on the internal layers of DNN representations. In this way our new class of adversarial images differs qualitatively from others. While the adversary is perceptually similar to one image, its internal representation appears remarkably similar to a different image, one from a different class, bearing little if any apparent similarity to the input; they appear generic and consistent with the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> images. This phenomenon raises questions about DNN representations, {{as well as the}} properties <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> images themselves. Comment: Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 201...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} {{inspired}} by {{an article published in}} 2011 about inherent limits in image denoising. In that article, a new method for denoising images (that has been called shotgun denoiser), based on the model <b>of</b> the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> patches derived from a large database of samples, was described. This method was only of theoretical interest, since the computational requirements to actually use it are prohibitive. In this work that method is described, analyzed and transformed to make it possible to run it on a normal computer. In order to do so, a new denoising formula has been derived, on a database of normalized patches extracted from noiseless natural images. The factorization <b>of</b> the probability <b>space</b> <b>of</b> the <b>natural</b> images allows to increment the performance of the original algorithm by severals orders of magnitude, by working with entire equivalence classes instead of single patches. Methods for further accelerating the process are described, and a survey is made on the algorithms for approximate nearest neighbour search in space with high dimensionality. An usable algorithm is then described and its performance is throughly tested over some test images. The result of this algorithm is compared to other state-of-the-art denoising methods, and although on average the method devised is a bit worse than others, in the parts of the image with more details it actually outperforms the best existing denoising algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} the modern novel’s {{attempt to create}} edenic <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> innocence. It focuses on two French novels, La Faute de l’Abbé Mouret by Emile Zola (1875) and Le Mariage de Loti by Pierre Loti (1880), which both unsuccessfully try to build an edenic chronotope : a vegetal Paradise where time stops being a source of distruction, and where life seems to recover its lost signification. The analysis of these narratives will show that the construction of this kind <b>of</b> <b>space</b> has become, in the modern novel, a difficult and contradictory operation. Moreover, this renewed natural Eden appears incapable of containing the plot : it closes up on itself, expelling the heroes who inhabited it and rejecting them into the conflictual and incoherent <b>space</b> <b>of</b> Culture to which they belong. This unsuccessful construction leads the narratives to a contradictory representation of Nature, which becomes an uncanny space where the dark figures of the unconscious reveal the unsatisfactory illusion of the edenic chronotope.
