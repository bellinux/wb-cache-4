25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences. Others dealt with the occult, with spiritualism, or with abnormal states of mind. She was much interested in psychological problems, her character-drawing is good although her women are better than her men, she had some sense of humour, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a story. She is entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} number of previously created costumes and make-up {{were included in the}} bar room scenes in [...] "Tapestry". There were notes from the producers not to include any Ferengi, as at that point the Federation had not yet made first contact with them. The scene featured both Anticans and Selay close to one another, despite being at war at the time that this flashback scene was set and only making peace earlier in The Next Generation in the episode [...] "Lonely Among Us". Several of the glasses and other props in this scene were from a collection that Paramount had stored from the 1956 Charlton Heston film, The Ten Commandments. There were problems with the audio recordings of some scenes with Stewart and Brandy, as the camera dolly was noisy which required them to re-record their lines later so that they could be dubbed over the originals. Brandy was [...] "amazed" [...] that there was no difference <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> in Stewart's performance, but felt that it took away an element from her performance.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the feud between Mercedes and Mitzeee, All About Soap {{columnist}} Laura Morgan {{commented that}} it was shocking that she felt sorry for Mercedes. She explained that even though Mercedes was [...] "a nasty cow" [...] because of the feud she was a [...] "woman teetering {{on the verge of}} a massive meltdown". Upon Mercedes telling Riley she has no need to be angry with Silas not sitting trial Morgan said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> Mercedes had been [...] "knocked her for six", adding that Mercedes could not [...] "hide anything from us". The journalist added that [...] "Mercedes did what Mercedes does best and decided a randy hook-up [...] was just what she needed to get her mind off Silas. After slapping on the war paint and selecting her sluttiest outfit, minxy Merc headed to a grotty hotel". She went on to explain that [...] "Mercedes knows she’s sinking. She pretty much admitted it when the doc asked her if she hated him and she replied, “I guess I hate myself a little more...” So why doesn’t she get some help before she totally and utterly loses the plot? [...] we’re missing our tart-with-a-heart Mercedes. We want to see her flirting her way around the village again, but without her finger firmly on the self-destruct button..." ...|$|E

60|$|Annette remembered {{having heard}} him go out. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> always <b>tell</b> his footstep.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> the rector of her {{aversion to}} Manston, {{and of her}} unquenched love for Edward.|$|R
2500|$|Around 1999 with Sugah going nowhere, no {{album to}} show, and many broken promises, Tweet {{returned}} to her parents' home in Panama City penniless and depressed. After Tweet fell into a deeper depression after a string of bad relationships {{and a number of}} jobs she had suicidal thoughts, but she {{received a phone call from}} Elliott, calling to ask if Tweet would contribute background vocals on her then-latest album Miss E... So Addictive. Tweet felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> Elliott about her situation and what she was going through. To this day she calls Elliott her [...] "Guardian Angel".|$|E
2500|$|The Clum {{manuscript}} {{was apparently}} Boyer's {{name for the}} materials given him by Laing, which include a collection of notes, newspaper accounts, memorabilia, and the written recollections of relatives, plus other materials he had acquired over many years. Boyer said that he [...] "often used my knowledge of Josie when using dialogue so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her tale, the way she wanted." [...] He insisted that his knowledge of her life was [...] "fortified by my written, taped and oral research," [...] and that it didn't matter if [...] "the details Josie gave in her memoirs are correct." [...] Using the collection and his personal knowledge, he wrote his synthesized version of Marcus' life in Tombstone as if the words were Josephine's. Boyer also made several errors in the process.|$|E
2500|$|They murdered Mrs Rival before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{the police}} who hired her. Mr Bland and his {{sister-in-law}} thought their plan would baffle the police, while Mrs Bland {{felt she was}} a pawn in their schemes. Mr Bland took care to dispose of Duguesclin's passport {{on a trip to}} Boulogne, which trip he mentioned to Colin in casual conversation. Poirot holds that people reveal much in simple conversation. Poirot had assumed this trip took place, so the man's passport would be found in a country different from where he was murdered, and long after friends and family in Canada had missed him on his holiday in Europe. The missing clock, with Rosemary written on it, was traced. Colin realised that Sheila had taken it and tossed it in the neighbour's dustbin, seeing it was her very own clock, mislaid {{on the way to a}} repair shop. But the clock was taken by Miss Martindale, not mislaid by Sheila.|$|E

60|$|Then {{it came to}} {{her with}} a shock, as an {{extraordinary}} oversight, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never <b>tell</b> Manning about Ramage--never.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chasing butterflies," [...] was all {{the answer}} Rose gave; for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> the foolish little fancy that had comforted her so much.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they brought}} her to a state in which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her lamentable history.|$|E
60|$|Then, after apologising {{for putting}} so many {{questions}} to her, I asked her if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me her name.|$|E
60|$|Lenore {{did not see}} the {{resulting}} conflict, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by something that swayed the crowd when Glidden had been freed.|$|E
60|$|And still Bellew did not speak, but stood devouring {{her with}} his little eyes; and how long this went on <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then Augusta {{returned}} to her hut with a heavy heart. She covered up the dead body as best <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>telling</b> little Dick that Mr. Meeson was gone by-by, and then sat down in that chill and awful company. It was very depressing; but she comforted herself somewhat with the reflection that, on the whole, Mr. Meeson dead was not so bad as Mr. Meeson in the animated flesh.|$|R
60|$|Before the {{entrance}} was gained {{she heard the}} crack of a pistol, but whether fired by the boomer or an Indian <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{they are}} almost worse than orphans,' said Sister Constance, when the Curate went down from reading to the invalid, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him the verdict.|$|E
6000|$|... "Course she has! Trust Carrie to {{get things}} {{straight}} and get 'em darn quick! I bet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you every date in history!" [...] boasted her husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say {{any such}} beastly thing of mother. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{whether it was}} just a simple dislocation, and she was right, having ever so much more sense than you, Janet." ...|$|E
60|$|Bingley {{replied that}} he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|She had {{a feeling}} at his {{departure}} as of an immense cavity, of something enormously gone; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether it was infinite regret or infinite relief....|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> {{the woman}} said. 'Why, you yourself--you wear the colour too?' he said. 'Windows are closed that {{never used to}} be by day. What does this mean?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "<i Tenez, voila le Capitaine Brunot>," [...] said Tiare, one {{day when}} I was fitting {{together}} what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me of Strickland. [...] "He knew Strickland well; he visited him at his house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he were to}} {{come again}} he would come in vain, John." [...] She {{did not say that}} he had come again. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her own secret, but not that of another person.|$|E
6000|$|Polly was silent; and I {{wondered}} how much longer she was going on talking about indifferent matters, and what {{it could be that}} she took so long before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me. Presently she asked-- ...|$|E
60|$|Louise {{looked on}} the ground and was silent. On being again urged to say which way she desired to be conducted, she again looked down, and said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|Moreover, {{there was}} something, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> exactly what, about Miss Panney's words and manner, which put an {{unsatisfactory}} aspect upon the obvious methods of Cicely's communications with her employer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I? I {{thought it}} was myself that I doubted." [...] She was {{stricken}} with sudden misgiving as to what had seemed so well; her words tended rapidly <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whither.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are {{you alone}} in the dark?' he said. And <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by his tone he resented it, he resented this {{isolation}} she had drawn round herself. Yet, feeling static and inevitable, she was kind towards him.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, at {{the gate}} she shared her wrath with Jenny's mother. What call had they to {{want to make the}} poor {{children}} to be like parsons at church? Jem shouldn't be there no more, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|Dolly {{was more}} sorry than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> {{that he should}} have taken so much trouble. It was such a long way, and he must have such a deal to do. And how WAS Mr Willet--that dear old gentleman-- ...|$|E
60|$|The moving shadow {{split into}} two shadows that stole closer, loomed before her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> which belonged to Jim till he touched her. His touch was potent. It seemed to {{electrify}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} heard otherwise," [...] I told him. [...] "But when I asked my mother once at which church I was christened, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> me and forbade me to ask again." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> {{how sorry}} {{she should be}} to see in her little {{daughter}} any dawnings of an affection {{which would be a}} virtual condemnation to such a life as his mother's had been.|$|R
