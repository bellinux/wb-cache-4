Design: A cross-sectional nationwide mail survey. Methods: A mail survey of 1237 elite Australian athletes was conducted. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the model. Results: Morality (personal moral stance on performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use),</b> reference group opinion (perceived moral stance of reference group on performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use)</b> <b>and</b> legitimacy (perceptions of the drug testing and appeals processes) evidenced significant relationships with attitude towards performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use,</b> which in turn was positively associated with doping behaviour. The model accounted for 81 % and 13 % {{of the variance in}} attitude towards performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> doping behaviour, respectively. Conclusions: These findings validate the usefulness of the Sport Drug Control Model for understanding influences on performance-enhancing <b>substances</b> <b>use.</b> Nevertheless, {{there is a need to}} survey athletes representing a broader range of competition levels and cross-cultural research to test the model’s applicability to other populations of athletes...|$|R

2500|$|An {{additional}} cognitively-based {{model of}} substance abuse recovery has been offered by Aaron Beck, the father of cognitive therapy and championed in his 1993 book [...] Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse. This therapy rests upon the assumption addicted individuals possess core beliefs, often not accessible to immediate consciousness (unless the patient is also depressed). These core beliefs, such as [...] "I am undesirable," [...] activate a system of addictive beliefs that result in imagined anticipatory benefits of <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> <b>and,</b> consequentially, craving. Once craving has been activated, permissive beliefs ("I can handle getting high just this one more time") are facilitated. Once a permissive set of beliefs have been activated, then the individual will activate drug-seeking and drug-ingesting behaviors. The cognitive therapist's job is to uncover this underlying system of beliefs, analyze it with the patient, and thereby demonstrate its dysfunctionality. As with any cognitive-behavioral therapy, homework assignments and behavioral exercises serve to solidify what is learned and discussed during treatment.|$|E
