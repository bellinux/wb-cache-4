5|$|In archaea such as Thermoplasma acidophilum, all the α {{and all the}} β {{subunits}} are identical, whereas eukaryotic proteasomes such {{as those}} in yeast contain seven distinct types of each subunit. In mammals, the β1, β2, and β5 subunits are catalytic; although they share a common mechanism, they have three distinct substrate specificities considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH). Alternative β forms denoted β1i, β2i, and β5i can be expressed in hematopoietic cells in response to exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as cytokines, in particular, interferon gamma. The proteasome assembled with these alternative subunits is known as the immunoproteasome, whose <b>substrate</b> <b>specificity</b> is altered relative to the normal proteasome.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers <b>substrate</b> <b>specificity</b> to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E

40|$|A third multidrug {{transporter}} gene named bmr 3 was cloned from Bacillus subtilis. Although Bmr 3 shows {{relatively low}} homology to Bmr and Blt, the <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities</b> {{of these three}} transporters overlap. Northern hybridization analysis showed that expression of the bmr 3 gene was dependent on the growth phase. Bacteria possess pumps of low specificity that can extrude structurally unrelated compounds in an energy-dependent manner (12, 16, 20). Mutations in the genes encoding these pumps increase the susceptibilities of the mutant bacteria to diverse cytotoxic compounds (11, 15, 21), and overexpression of these pumps from genes on multicopy plasmids confers multidrug resistance to bacteria (1, 13, 18, 19).

40|$|The <b>{{substrate}}</b> <b>specificities</b> of dynein, kinesin, and myosin substrate turnover {{activity and}} cytoskeletal filament-driven translocation were examined using 15 ATP analogues. The dyneins were more {{selective in their}} substrate utilization than bovine brain kinesin or muscle heavy meromyosin, and even different types of dyneins, such as 14 S and 22 S dynein from Tetrahymena cilia and the beta-heavy chain-containing particle from the outer-arm dynein of sea urchin flagella, could be distinguished by their <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities.</b> Although bovine brain kinesin and muscle heavy meromyosin both exhibited broad <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities,</b> kinesin-induced microtubule translocation varied over a 50 -fold range in speed among the various substrates, whereas heavy meromyosin-induced actin translocation varied only by fourfold. With both kinesin and heavy meromyosin, the relative velocities of filament translocation did not correlate well with the relative filament- activated substrate turnover rates. Furthermore, some ATP analogues that {{did not support the}} filament translocation exhibited filament- activated substrate turnover rates. Filament-activated substrate turnover and power production, therefore, appear to become uncoupled with certain substrates. In conclusion, the <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities</b> and coupling to motility are distinct for different types of molecular motor proteins. Such nucleotide "fingerprints" of enzymatic activities of motor proteins may prove useful as a tool for identifying what type of motor is involved in powering a motility-related event that can be reconstituted in vitro...|$|R
25|$|To date, {{there have}} been few {{examples}} of hydrogen bond catalysis in the synthesis of natural products despite the large number of reactions being discovered.

25|$|The {{catalytic}} {{mechanism of}} enzymes within a superfamily is typically conserved, although <b>substrate</b> <b>specificity</b> may be significantly different. Catalytic residues {{also tend to}} occur in the same order in the protein sequence. The families within the PA clan of proteases, although there has been divergent evolution of the catalytic triad residues used to perform catalysis, all members use a similar mechanism to perform covalent, nucleophilic catalysis on proteins, peptides or amino acids. However, mechanism alone is not sufficient to infer relatedness, since some catalytic mechanisms have been convergently evolved multiple times independently, and so form separate superfamilies.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of RNR is {{designed}} to maintain balanced quantities of dNTPs. Binding of effector molecules either increases or decreases RNR activity. When ATP binds to the allosteric activity site, it activates RNR. In contrast, when dATP binds to this site, it deactivates RNR. In addition to controlling activity, the allosteric mechanism also regulates the <b>substrate</b> <b>specificity</b> and ensures the enzyme produces {{an equal amount of}} each dNTP for DNA synthesis. In all classes, binding of ATP or dATP to the allosteric site induces reduction of cytidine 5’-diphosphate (CDP) and uridine 5’-diphosphate (UDP); 2’-deoxyguanosine 5’-triphosphate (dGTP) induces reduction of adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP); and 2’-deoxythymidine 5’-triphosphate (dTTP) induces reduction of guanosine 5’-diphosphate (GDP) (Figure 1).|$|E

Comparison of the susceptibilities of the constructed mutants to 52 antimicrobial agents belonging to various groups suggested the following <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities.</b> All of the efflux systems extrude a wide variety of antimicrobial agent groups, i. e., quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, most penicillins (all but carbenicillin and sulbenicillin), most cephems (all but cefsulodin and ceftazidime), meropenem, and S- 4661, but none of them extrude polymyxin B or imipenem. Extrusion of aminoglycosides is specific to MexXY-OprM, and extrusion of a group of the β-lactams, i. e., carbenicillin, sulbenicillin, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, is specific to MexAB-OprM. Moreover, MexAB-OprM and MexCD-OprJ extrude novobiocin, cefsulodin, and flomoxef, while MexXY-OprM does not.

25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the <b>substrate</b> <b>specificity</b> of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E

Peptide antigens are displayed by the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC) proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. These peptides are products of proteasomal degradation of proteins originated by the invading pathogen. Although constitutively expressed proteasomes can participate in this process, a specialized complex composed of proteins, whose expression is induced by interferon gamma, are the primary producers of peptides which are optimal in size and composition for MHC binding. These proteins whose expression increases during the immune response include the 11S regulatory particle, whose main known biological role is regulating the production of MHC ligands, and specialized β subunits called β1i, β2i, and β5i with altered <b>substrate</b> <b>specificity.</b> The complex formed with the specialized β subunits is known as the immunoproteasome.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{prenylation}} is {{a common}} post-translational modification in metazoans, protozoans, fungi, and plants. This modification, which mediates protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions, {{is characterized by the}} covalent attachment of a fifteen-carbon farnesyl or twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine residue of a carboxyl terminal CaaX motif. In Arabidopsis, era 1 mutants lacking protein farnesyltransferase exhibit enlarged meristems, supernumerary floral organs, an enhanced response to abscisic acid (ABA), and drought tolerance. In contrast, ggb mutants lacking protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 exhibit subtle changes in ABA and auxin responsiveness, but develop normally. Results We have expressed recombinant Arabidopsis protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 (PGGT 1) in E. coli and characterized purified enzymes with respect to kinetic constants and <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities.</b> Our results indicate that, whereas PFT exhibits little specificity for the terminal amino acid of the CaaX motif, PGGT 1 exclusively prenylates CaaX proteins with a leucine in the terminal position. Moreover, we found that different substrates exhibit similar K m but different k cat values in the presence of PFT and PGGT 1, indicating that <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities</b> are determined primarily by reactivity rather than binding affinity. Conclusions The data presented here potentially explain the relatively strong phenotype of era 1 mutants and weak phenotype of ggb mutants. Specifically, the <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities</b> of PFT and PGGT 1 suggest that PFT can compensate for loss of PGGT 1 in ggb mutants more effectively than PGGT 1 can compensate for loss of PFT in era 1 mutants. Moreover, our results indicate that PFT and PGGT 1 <b>substrate</b> <b>specificities</b> are primarily due to differences in catalysis, rather than differences in substrate binding. </p...|$|R
