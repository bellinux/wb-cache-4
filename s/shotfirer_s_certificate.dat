40|$|A Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law {{exists in}} Japan. This law was {{effective}} since 1949 and minor revision {{has been made}} a number of time. However, a major revision of this law was made in 1988 and was effective for school year 1990. The purposes of this study are following: 1) To clarify the status of curricula for the pre-service training of lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education before and after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law; 2) To Compere and to clarify the differences of new curricula from old ones; and 3) To find out the trends and probrems of curricula for the pre-service training of science teachers. The main results were as follows; 1) There is a variety of professional education curricula for lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education. 2) In 1990, the average number of credits for Science Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoka-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) was not different as compared with the case of 1988. However, the legal number of credits for Laboratories as a part of Science Subjects was changed from 4 to 8 after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law. And actual number of credits for these subjects increased according to the law. The doubling of the number of credits for Laboratories meets with the approval of over 600 f the institutions. However, there is no backing of collateral increase of faculty members and budget, therefore a heavy burden must necessarily be imposed on science faculty members. 3) The number of credits for Professional Teaching Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoshoku-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) increased after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law. However, the number of credits for Methodology of Science Teaching (2 ̆ 7 Rika-Kyoikuho 2 ̆ 7), which is an integrative subject in pre-service training courses for science teachers, decreased.

5000|$|In 1995, Zhu Ling was {{the victim}} of an unsolved {{attempted}} thallium poisoning in Beijing, China. In 1994, Zhu Ling was a sophomore studying Physical Chemistry at Tsinghua University in Beijing. She began to show strange and debilitating symptoms at the end of 1994, when she reported experiencing acute stomach pain and extensive hair loss. Ultimately she was diagnosed on Usenet with poisoning by thallium. To this day, there is still speculation as to the poisoner's identity among Chinese expatriates overseas. The primary (and only) suspect of the police investigation, Sun Wei, is a member of a family with high-level political connections, which may have been used to halt and suppress the results of the investigation. Sun Wei was Zhu Ling's classmate and roommate in Tsinghua University from 1992 to 1997. Tsinghua University also said she was the only student who had access to thallium compound at the school. The investigation's results have never been released to Zhu Ling's parents or the general public.

40|$|The {{registration}} of an aircraft {{is a prerequisite}} for issuance of a U. <b>S.</b> <b>certificate</b> of airworthiness by the FAA. The procedures and requirements for aircraft registration, and the subsequent issuance of registration numbers, are contained in FAR Part 47. However, the process/method(s) for applying the requirements of Parts 45 & 47 to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has not been defined. This task resolved the application of 14 CFR Parts 45 and 47 to UAS. Key Findings: UAS are aircraft systems and as such the recommended approach to registration is to follow the same process for registration as manned aircraft. This will require manufacturers to comply with the requirements for 14 CFR 47, Aircraft Registration and 14 CFR 45, Identification and Registration Marking. In addition, only the UA should be identified with the N number registration markings. There should also be a documentation link showing the applicability of the control station and communication link to the UA.

Information is shown for checkboxes {{in the following}} categories: Risk factors in this pregnancy, Obstetric procedures, Characteristics of labor and delivery, Method of delivery, Abnormal conditions of the newborn, and Congenital anomalies of the newborn. These categories are included on both the 1989 and the 2003 U. <b>S.</b> Standard <b>Certificate</b> of Live Birth; however, many of the specific checkbox items were modified, or are new to the 2003 certificate. Data on selected new checkbox items are presented in this report. METHODS: Descriptive tabulations are presented on births occurring in 2005 to residents of the 12 states (Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York (excluding New York City), Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington), which implemented the 2003 U. <b>S.</b> Standard <b>Certificate</b> of Live Birth as of January 1, 2005. RESULTS: There were 1, 268, 502 births to residents of the 12 -state area in 2005 (31 percent of all U. S. births). Gestational and prepregnancy diabetes were reported at rates of 39. 3 and 6. 9 per 1, 000. Infants of women with diabetes, especially prepregnancy diabetes, {{were more likely to}} be high birthweight and to be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) than infants of women without diabetes. The rate of cervical cerclage was 3. 7 per 1, 000; this procedure was used more frequently in twin and higher order births than in singleton births. Almost all attempts at forceps or vacuum delivery (almost 99 percent) were successful. Almost one-third of all women who had a cesarean delivery had attempted a trial of labor. Antibiotics were given to 17 percent of women during labor. Steroids (glucocorticoids) for fetal lung maturation were received prior to delivery by 1 percent of all mothers. Surfactant replacement therapy was received by newborns at a rate of 3. 7 per 1, 000; rates were higher for infants delivered very preterm (less than 32 weeks of gestation). Large differences by race and Hispanic origin were seen for the receipt of steroids and for surfactant replacement therapy. More than 6 percent of all infants were admitted to a NICU. Nearly one-half of all singleton infants admitted to a NICU were delivered at term. Cyanotic congenital heart disease (56. 9 per 100, 000 infants) and hypospadias (126. 2 per 100, 000 male births only) were among the most frequently reported congenital anomalies. by Fay Menacker and Joyce A.

(2) Sub-sample results based on linear tests show a unidirectional causal relation from the CD rate to the EURO rate during the first sub-period for all three maturities. During the second sub-period, however, linear tests uncover a strong bi-directional relation between the CD and the Euro rates for all three maturities. The linear results for the third sub-period reveal mostly unidirectional causality from the EURO rate to the Cd for three maturities. (3) Finally, sub-sample nonlinear causality tests reveal mostly a unidirectional causality from the CD rate to the EURO rate for all three maturities during the first sub-sample, a strong significant bi-directional causality between the two rates for all three maturities during the second sub-period, and an uneven bi-directional causality between the two rates for all three maturities during the third sub-period.
