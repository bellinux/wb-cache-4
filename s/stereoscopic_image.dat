2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{software}} extensions that can be added to ArcGIS for Desktop that provide added functionality, including 3D Analyst, Spatial Analyst, Network Analyst, Survey Analyst, Tracking Analyst, and Geostatistical Analyst.

Numerous extensions have also been developed by third parties, such as the [...] spell-checker, [...] XTools and MAP2PDF for creating georeferenced pdfs (GeoPDF), ERDAS' Image Analysis and Stereo Analyst for ArcGIS, and ISM's PurVIEW, which converts Arc- desktops into precise stereo-viewing windows to work with geo-referenced <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>image</b> models for accurate geodatabase-direct editing or feature digitizing.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{resampling}} detection method for <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images.</b> Although previous resampling techniques {{can be applied}} to <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images,</b> performance improvement is hard to be expected with the two separated results. In this research, we found a strong relationship between the left and right images derived from the characteristics of the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images.</b> The proposed technique exploits that relationship of the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> as additional information for reliable detection performance. Furthermore, the proposed method includes a preprocessing step to acquire the independent performance from the image’s own characteristics. The experimental results exhibit superior performance compared with the existing works.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{developed}} a 3 D display using an LCD display panel and a grating film for stereoscopic viewing. The display screen is divided in half {{in order that}} left and right regions provide the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> for left and right eyes. Because both <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> {{are not in the}} same position, it is difficult for the observer to view the 3 D image by the stereoviewing. We solved this problem using a polarized LCD panel and a grating film. The optical grating film shifts both left and right images to the same position. As the result, the observer can watch overlapped <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> for left and right eyes.

40|$|Current head-mounted {{displays}} (HMDs) {{provide only}} a fixed lens focus. Viewers have to decouple their accommodation and vergence responses when viewing <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> presented on an HMD. This study investigates the time taken to fuse {{a pair of}} <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> displayed on an HMD when the accommodative demand is matched to the vergence demand. Four testing conditions exhausting the factorial combinations of accommodative demands (2. 5 D and 0. 5 D) and vergence demands (2. 5 MA and 0. 5 MA) were investigated. The results indicate that viewers take a significantly shorter {{amount of time to}} fuse a pair of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> (i. e., fusion time) when the accommodative demand and the stereoscopic depth cues match. Further analysis suggests that an unnatural demand for the eyes to verge toward <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>images</b> whose stereo depth is farther than the accommodative demand is associated with significantly longer fusion time. This study evaluates the potential benefits of using a dynamically adjustable lens focus in future designs of HMDs. School of Optometr...|$|R
