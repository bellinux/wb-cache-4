2500|$|On March 16, 1991, a year {{prior to}} the Los Angeles riots, {{storekeeper}} Soon Ja Du physically confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins by grabbing her sweater and backpack over whether the 15-year-old {{had been trying to}} steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha {{in the back of the}} head, killing her. (<b>Security</b> <b>tape</b> showed the girl, already dead, was still clutching $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time. As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and looked down on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already fragile environment. [...] The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney King's trial resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, and much of that anger was directed at Koreans.|$|E
