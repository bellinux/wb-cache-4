During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport.

Bored with practice, she gave up playing piano at that time. Hoping for more freedom, she urged her parents to send her to Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding school attended by her siblings. At Geelong she took up the piano again, this time playing jazz including performing with her brother David's group on weekends.

There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the film.

Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E
