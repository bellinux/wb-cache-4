5|$|On the one hand, {{there is}} little {{question}} that they are most closely related to three other families of streamlined, surface water fishes: the flyingfishes, needlefishes, and <b>sauries.</b> Traditionally, these four families {{have been taken to}} together comprise the order Beloniformes. The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and <b>sauries</b> another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, <b>sauries,</b> anchovies, rays are harvested and {{a small number of}} abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented anchovy), abalone, wakame, and squid.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and <b>sauries,</b> and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|E
40|$|The {{feeding of}} Pacific <b>saury</b> (Cololabis saira) on chaetognaths was {{investigated}} off {{the east coast}} of Japan. 58. 1 % of the <b>saury</b> examined contained chaetognath remains. Most <b>saury</b> contained only a couple of chaetognaths, but about one-third of the <b>saury</b> had over 100 in their gut-suggesting encounters with chaetognath swarms. The chaetognath Sagitta elegans was commonly ingested, and the mean calculated length of S. elegans ingested by <b>saury</b> was significantly larger than the mean length of S. elegans collected by net from the water, indicating selectivity of larger prey sizes by <b>saury.</b> Sagitta elegans ingested at the Oyashio region feeding grounds in July were significantly larger than those ingested in the mixed/transition water off Sanriku in November. Correlation analysis of <b>saury</b> size versus ingested S. elegans size suggests that <b>saury</b> at the Oyashio feeding grounds in July do not eat S. elegans of lengths directly proportional to the <b>saury’s</b> length. But, <b>saury</b> do seem to select S. elegans directly proportional to their own body length in the region of the Subarctic Front. Though size of <b>saury</b> and S. elegans affects predatorprey interactions, additional unknown factors are also recognized as being influential...|$|R
50|$|The <b>saury</b> (Cololabis adocetus) (not to be {{confused}} with the Pacific <b>saury,</b> another species in the *Cololabis* genus) is a member of the family Scomberesocidae, or the <b>saury</b> family. It is widespread in the Eastern Pacific in the surface waters, typically remaining in the top 50 centimeters of the water column - although it can be found at depths of up to 1 meter. It can grow to a length of about 5 centimeters. The <b>saury</b> generally lives in waters between 5 and 12 degrees Celsius. The <b>saury</b> is a highly migratory fish.|$|R
50|$|The {{contact was}} made by radar at about 22:25. <b>Saury</b> set a course to {{intercept}} the targets, two large warships and a destroyer. At 03:03 on 31 July, <b>Saury</b> submerged. At 03:25, she turned to attack; losing, regaining, losing, and then regaining depth control. By then, the targets had passed firing bearing. A few seconds later, at 03:38, the sound operator reported a bearing of 180 degrees relative. Almost simultaneously, the periscope revealed a destroyer with a zero degree angle on the bow. The commanding officer ordered <b>Saury</b> deep. A few seconds later, two jolts shook <b>Saury.</b> She took on a five-degree list to port. She continued to go deeper, then retired to the east. No depth charges were heard. <b>Saury</b> remained at 175 to 200 ft all day. At 20:20, she surfaced. Her periscope shears were bent 30 degrees from the vertical to starboard. All equipment mounted therein was damaged. Both periscopes and both radars were out of commission. <b>Saury</b> had been blinded.|$|R
25|$|Oceanic {{epipelagic fish}} can be true residents, partial residents, or {{accidental}} residents. True residents live their entire {{life in the}} open ocean. Only a few species are true residents, such as tuna, billfish, flying fish, <b>sauries,</b> pilotfish and remoras, dolphin, ocean sharks and ocean sunfish. Most of these species migrate {{back and forth across}} open oceans, rarely venturing over continental shelves. Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds.|$|E
500|$|Rather {{than being}} {{closely related to}} the flyingfishes, the {{subfamily}} Zenarchopterinae appears to be the sister group of the needlefishes and <b>sauries.</b> This is based on the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, sperm ultrastructure, and molecular evidence. However, this hypothesis has awkward implications for how the morphological evolution of the group is understood, because the fused pharyngeal plate has been considered reliably diagnostic of the halfbeak family. Furthermore, the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw (the so-called [...] "halfbeak stage") the theory that halfbeaks are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable. In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of halfbeaks appears to be the basal condition, with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sauries</b> are marine {{epipelagic fish}} which live in {{tropical}} and temperate waters. These fish often jump while swimming near the surface, skimming the water, {{which is similar}} to flying fish, a fellow member of the beloniformes order. The jaws of <b>sauries</b> are beak-like, ranging from long, slender beaks to relatively short ones with the lower jaw only slightly elongated. The mouth openings of <b>sauries,</b> however, are small and the jaws have weak teeth. The most distinctive feature of <b>sauries,</b> however, is the presence of a row of small finlets behind the dorsal and anal fins. They also lack swim bladders. <b>Sauries</b> grow to a maximum length of about 46 cm, but the group also includes the smallest of all epipelagic fish, Cololabis adocetus, with an adult length of just 7.5 cm.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific <b>saury</b> (Cololabis saira) is {{a member}} of the family Scomberesocidae. This <b>saury,</b> which is a food source in some East Asian cuisines, is also known by the name {{mackerel}} pike.|$|R

50|$|Pacific <b>saury</b> {{are often}} {{imported}} to the United Kingdom {{where they are}} used as bait for sea fishing. In the UK they are usually called blueys, possibly due to people confusing the Pacific <b>saury</b> with blue mackerel.|$|R
50|$|At about 02:10 on 23 December, {{an enemy}} {{destroyer}} sighted <b>Saury.</b> The submarine went to 120 ft. By 02:16, three depth charges had exploded within 200 yd. Two more depth charges followed, but <b>Saury</b> escaped {{and continued to}} hunt for targets. Early afternoon brought more depth charging, but <b>Saury</b> was not damaged. On 24 December, she sighted a transport, running fast and very close in shore. The submarine was unable to close and attack.|$|R

50|$|Beloniformes: {{the order}} of ray-finned fish that {{includes}} Adrianichthyidae (ricefish and medakas); Belonidae (needlefish); Exocoetidae (flyingfishes); Hemiramphidae (halfbeaks): and the Scomberesocidae (<b>sauries).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sauries</b> are fish of {{the family}} Scomberesocidae. There are two genera, each {{containing}} two species. The name Scomberesocidae {{is derived from the}} Greek, skombros = tuna/mackerel, and esox = nursery of salmon.|$|E
5000|$|Cololabis is a genus of <b>sauries</b> {{found in}} the eastern and {{northern}} Pacific Ocean. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek word kolos, meaning [...] "short", and the Latin word labia, meaning [...] "lips".|$|E
50|$|The Pacific <b>saury</b> is {{a highly}} migratory species. Adults are {{generally}} found offshore, near {{the surface of the}} ocean, in schools. Juveniles associate with drifting seaweed. Pacific <b>saury</b> are oviparous. Eggs are attached to one another and to floating objects such as seaweed via filaments on the shell surface.|$|R

50|$|Due to its location, Owase {{is mainly}} {{supported}} by its commercial fishery and forestry industries. Yellowtail, amberjack, Japanese horse mackerel, <b>sauries,</b> sea bream and bonito {{are among the}} fish landed at Owase. Japanese cypress and cryptomeria trees are found in abundance here in the mountains.|$|E
50|$|The {{order is}} {{sometimes}} divided up into two suborders, the Adrianichthyoidei and the Belonoidei. The Adrianichthyoidei contains {{only a single}} family, the Adrianichthyidae. Originally, the Adrianichthyidae {{were included in the}} Cyprinidontiformes and assumed to be closely related to the killifish, but a closer relationship to the beloniforms is indicated by various characteristics including the absence of the interhyal, resulting in the upper jaw being fixed or nonprotrusible. The Belonoidei may also be further subdivided into two superfamilies, the Scomberesocoidea and the Exocoetoidea. The Scomberesocoidea contains the Belonidae and Scomberesocidae, while the Exocoetoidea comprises the Exocoetidae and Hemiramphidae. However, newer evidence finds that the flyingfishes are nested within the halfbeaks, and the needlefish and <b>sauries</b> are nested within the subfamily Zenarchopterinae of the family Hemiramphidae, which has been recognized as its own family. The <b>sauries</b> are also nested within the family Belonidae.|$|E
