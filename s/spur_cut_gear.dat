40|$|This paper proposes the {{computerized}} tooth profile generation of <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> <b>cut</b> with shaper cutters. A complete geometrical mathematical {{model of a}} spur shaper cutter is proposed, including the protuberance, the involute region and semi-topping. The profiles of standard or non-standard <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> <b>cut</b> with the shaper cutter are obtained based on the theory of gearing. In addition, {{the effects of the}} cutter parameters on the generated tooth profile are investigated and illustrated with computer simulation, while the appropriate shaper cutter parameters corresponding to the required gear profile, are also determined using an optimization method. # 2000 Elsevier Science S.

5000|$|Gear oil has a {{characteristic}} aroma {{due to the}} addition of sulfur-bearing anti-wear compounds. These compounds are used to reduce the high sliding friction by the helical <b>gear</b> <b>cut</b> of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of straight <b>cut</b> <b>spur</b> <b>gears).</b> On motorcycles with [...] "wet" [...] clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating {{the lower part of}} the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission. The original Mini placed the gearbox in the oil sump below the engine, thus using the same oil for both. The clutch was however a fairly conventional dry plate clutch.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the benefits of}} a drivetrain that is able to disengage its propulsion motor from the driveline in an electric vehicle. The drivetrain was developed for an ultra-efficient eco vehicle competing in the Shell 2013 Eco Marathon. Various clutch mechanisms were examined. In spite of the complexity and losses associated with additional bearings and release surfaces, an actuated dog clutch was chosen as it offers superior performance due to the dual capability of freewheeling and regenerative braking that results. Track data from the event is presented along with experimental work that indicates that the clutch mechanism reduces power consumption by more than 35 % for a ferrous permanent magnet propulsion motor. Savings were reduced to 5 % for a coreless permanent magnet motor coupled to the driveline via an 11 : 1 straight <b>cut</b> <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement. This reduced saving was due to the removal of hysteresis and eddy current losses from the stator. The paper also demonstrates during a competition in which the driver was aware of the energy consumption, the driving style changed when the technological option to free wheel was available. Finally the study was inferred onto a real world application with further experimental and simulation work on the Delta E 4 Coupe, a high performance electric sports car. The vehicle uses a ferrous permanent magnet direct drive arrangement, indicated a reduction in power consumption of 10 to 14 %. It is hoped that these insights are relevant when considering the development of electric vehicle drivetrains where machine topology and drive cycle will determine the value of a clutch mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} the {{bending fatigue strength}} of precision forged spur gears and to compare the results with those obtained from conventional <b>cut</b> <b>gears,</b> single tooth bending fatigue tests were carried out on both through-hardened and induction-hardened gear teeth. The gears were produced from rolled bar cut blanks, disc forged blanks or precision forged teeth blanks. For this purpose, a special test fixture was designed and built for an Amsler high-frequency vibrophore fatigue testing machine. The {{results show that the}} endurance limit of precision forged gears is significantly higher than those obtained from <b>cut</b> <b>gears.</b> The bending fatigue strength of forged gears was some 12. 5 per cent higher than the cut teeth in a through-hardened condition and 8. 4 per cent higher for the induction-hardened teeth. The eVect of surface roughness at the tooth root area on the bending fatigue strength of the forged gears is also shown...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper will}} {{concentrate}} on an extensive investigation of machine <b>cut</b> acetal <b>gear</b> wear and thermal mechanical contact behaviour. The results for machine <b>cut</b> acetal <b>gears</b> will be compared to previously published results obtained for polymer gears manufactured through injection moulding. The machine cutting manufacturing process can be economical for small batch runs due to {{the expense of the}} mould for injection moulding. Injection moulding becomes economical for larger batches. A new and unique polymer gear test rig has been employed to investigate the polymer gear wear behaviour. The unique test rig design allows the effect of misalignment on polymer gear engagement to be considered and the gear surface wear to be recorded continuously. Extensive experimental tests have been carried out to investigate machine <b>cut</b> acetal <b>gear</b> wear performance. Further examinations have been carried out using a scanning electron microscope to understand the gear wear mechanisms. An equation has been presented to predict polymer gear flank temperature and correlated well with the tests. ...|$|R

These procedures are based upon: (1) fundamental gear geometry and kinematics as exposited by Buckingham, et al; (2) formulas developed from differential geometry; and (3) geometrical concepts developed in recent papers and reports on spiral bevel gear surface geometry. Procedures which characterize the geometry so that the surface parametric equations, the principal radii of curvature, and the meshing kinematics are systematically determined are emphasized.

The gears are used for power transmission and also in marine and aerospace applications; where accuracy and power transmission capacity are the requirements. High speed gears (of the order of 30, 000 rpm) have to be of high quality to maintain contact and keep contact stresses within the limits.
