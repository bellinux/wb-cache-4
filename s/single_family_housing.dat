40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{estimate}} {{the market value of}} a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> in the municipality of Postojna on the basis of various types of data, namely on the basis of advertised prices of <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses,</b> selling prices of <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> and <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> with the ascribed generalized market value used with the method of comparison, on the basis of selling prices of building land which does not have a connection to public utilities, expenses for the building land development fee and expenses {{for the construction of a}} new <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> used with the method of expenses. The estimated market value of a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> refers to a hypothetical <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> with the characteristics of the average or the median of the discussed <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> in the municipality of Postojna. It has been established that by using the method of comparison the estimated market values of a hypothetical <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> are by 35 % higher for the sample of advertised <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> and for the sample of sold <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> by 21 % higher than the estimated market value by using the method of expenses. This means that it is worth investing in the construction of a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> in the municipality of Postojna which does not hold good for the town of Postojna itself.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is by using {{different}} types of data: information about the advertised <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> and sold <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses,</b> used in the method of comparison and information about the advertised and sold building land, costs for the payment of municipal contribution and replacement cost of construction from the portal PEG, used in the method of expenses, to estimate {{the market value of}} an evaluated <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> in the municipality of Medvode. In case of the evaluated <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> in the municipality of Medvode, I came to the conclusion, that when using different types of data in the method of comparing and in the method of expenses, estimated market values differ for 61 %. Nevertheless, this only applies to this case. Based on large differences between the estimated market value of <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> and market value based on the method for a global assessment of the market value in the municipality of Medvode I have concluded, that it is not profitable to buy a building land and build on it, but to buy existing <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house,</b> since the costs of building land are extremely high. The final result, the estimated market value, depends on the selection of appropriate methods as well as the selection of appropriate data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the construction of}} price indexes for condominiums and <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> in Switzerland over the period 1985 to 2004 using the indirect method. We find, that the pooling of the data, i. e. direct indexes with fixed hedonic prices, are good models for average properties but can be biased for the indexation of non-average properties. Therefore indirect index construction using predictions for specific properties based on annual equations are recommended. Based on differentiation of forty regions it is shown, that indexes vary from region to region, but show a comparable general course between 1985 and 2004. In recent years prices for <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> raised in the large urban areas and tourist resorts but, due to big land reserves, were stable ore even declined in smaller urban and semi-urban {{as well as in}} rural areas.

5000|$|Central Etobicoke (Etobicoke Centre); {{the oldest}} {{communities}} in Etobicoke developed along the first street, Dundas Street, {{in the south}} of this area, which crosses the width of Etobicoke on the escarpment formed by the ancient shoreline of Lake Iroquois. This area centres around the Islington community, the former administrative centre of Etobicoke and later Etobicoke's 'downtown' which is near the central 'Six Points' intersection at its western boundary. The rural Richview community developed directly to the north of Islington in the 19th century on Eglinton Ave. (formerly Richview Rd.), as did the gateway Humber Heights communities (connecting to Toronto): Westmount and Humbervale, to the east on Eglinton. Development of the until-then largely undeveloped eastern part of central Etobicoke (originally a forest reserved for the use of government mills as [...] "The King's Mill Reserve"; 'Kingsmill'), the 'Humber Valley', was largely the work of Robert Home Smith starting about 1900 and including the communities of the Kingsway and Edenbridge. As Etobicoke developed in the post-war years, low-density residential areas filled in most of the rural areas between the old communities including Princess-Rosethorn and Eringate - Centennial - West Deane as well as the older Eatonville community to the west of Islington. Central Etobicoke includes Etobicoke's most exclusive neighbourhoods, with fine housing stock and many large treed properties. Along the East and West Mall parallel to Highway 427 exists a mix of hi-rise rentals, townhouses and post-war bungalows. Markland Wood is the farthest western community within Etobicoke/Toronto; situated along Bloor Street West, it is predominately <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> with some mixed hi-rise rentals.|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} {{real estate}} values, developers often apply designs on the land. In {{the case of}} a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> development, the designs are applied to the unit of subdivisions. In this study, the designs are defined as ?value creation concepts,? which increase housing values at the subdivision level. The value creation concepts are classified into five categories ? the sense of arrival, product mix, walkability, circulation system, and amenity. This cross-sectional study focuses on exploring the effects of value creation concepts in the subdivision. Two methodologies ? the Hedonic Price Model (HPM) and the Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) ? are used to test whether or not the value creation concepts would increase or decrease <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> values. The study sample is composed of 6, 562 single family houses nested in 85 subdivisions in College Station, Texas. Data are composed of two levels: the housing level and the subdivision level. The scores of the sense of arrival were provided by sixtyone graduate students at Texas A&M University using photograph evaluations. Most structural variables were obtained from the Brazos County Appraisal District, and physical environmental variables were objectively measured using the Geographical Information System. In the both models, sense of arrival, greenway connectivity, sidewalk connectivity, and median length of cul-de-sac variables have positive effects on <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> values while phased project, the number of accessible entrances, street density, single family density, and median length of block variables have negative effects on <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> values. At the housing level, several structural variables (e. g. bathrooms, attached garage, porches, etc), attached to a golf course, sports facilities, network distance from the nearest elementary school, population density, and personal variables (i. e., tenure, workable age, employment) were significant (p<. 05) predictors of <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> value. Findings support that the value creation concepts have effects on increasing housing values at the subdivision level, which would provide thoughtful insights for developers in residential areas. In addition, the HLM can be used as the complement of the HPM by controlling interaction terms between housing variables and subdivision variables, or among the subdivision variables themselves...|$|E

A {{naturally}} beautiful setting {{combined with}} four distinct weather seasons dictates a lifestyle for this small South Berkshire town's residents and visitors alike. This thesis proposes {{that it is}} desirable and possible for a dwelling to be unique to an area, and as such, to reflect and embody specific aspects of that area. A dwelling of this type could easily become the cornerstone of a recognizable new neighborhood, one which Great Barrington is in dire need of. In this thesis I have isolated the topography, climate, and mode of life which are specific to the Berkshire area and especially to Great Barrington. These extracted qualities specific to Great Barrington are used to generate a design for a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> in this South Berkshire town. Through this residential model of the <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>house</b> {{it is suggested that}} one's physical habitation is able to both directly and indirectly reflect and relate to the ever changing seasons and weather.
