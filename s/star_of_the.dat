He opened the campaign being named the NHL's First <b>Star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Week on 13 October 2008, with a five-point effort over two games.

Bernier was later removed; on 12 February 2009, Head Coach Alain Vigneault moved Alexandre Burrows up from the third line during a game against the Phoenix Coyotes. Late in the campaign, Daniel was named the NHL's Second <b>Star</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Week on 30 March 2009, after recording four goals and four assists in four games, including a game-winning goal. He added ten points over ten games in the 2009 playoffs, helping the Canucks advance to the second round, where they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks.|$|E
