2500|$|McLuhan {{frequently}} quoted Walter Ong's Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan {{to write}} The Gutenberg Galaxy. Ong wrote a highly favorable review {{of this new}} book in America. However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy as [...] "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond." [...] McLuhan himself said of the book, [...] "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [...] It {{seems to me a}} book that <b>somebody</b> <b>should</b> have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of Understanding Media [...] that I'm doing now." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1894, Morse {{was moved}} to quarterback to replace King. [...] Newspaper {{accounts}} indicate that Morse's move to the quarterback position was less than successful. [...] One paper noted pointed to the quarterback position as Princeton's downfall and noted, [...] "Morse, who by the way is a splendid half, was anything but a success in the position." [...] Morse was sidelined due to illness {{in the middle of}} the season with what was described as [...] "a threatened attack of pneumonia." [...] Morse returned to the lineup for the Penn game and put on a display that drew praise for his [...] "pluck" [...] but also dismay at the physical beating he took. [...] The New York World reported as follows:"Morse and Ward were both cripples. [...] I don't believe in talking about the roughness of the game. [...] Any man who goes into it must expect anything and take it, but Morse was tackled altogether beyond the pale of pardon, more than once. [...] When a man gets as far gone as he was and nothing but his indomitable pluck allowed him to stand, <b>somebody</b> <b>should</b> have had the power and the will to force him to leave the game. [...] But he died fighting ..."Despite the beating, Morse was Princeton's leading rusher in the 1894 Penn game, and his 25-yard run was the longest of the game. [...] However, the beating took a permanent toll on Morse. [...] After the game, The New York Times reported on Morse's retirement from football:"Franklin B. Morse, '95, Princeton's greatest half back, has gone out of training and quit the game. [...] This move was not taken by Morse until it was forced upon him. [...] He has been ill for some time and was really unable to go in the game with Pennsylvania, although he played in that game as long as he could stand on his feet. [...] Since then he has been on the field only a few times, and had to leave the game each time. [...] The whole student body deeply regrets Morse's inability to continue playing." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Somebody</b> Becky <b>should</b> have. But in the {{meantime}} {{it was clear that}} honest Briggs must not lose her chance of settlement for life, and so she and her bags were packed, and she set off on her journey.

6000|$|... 'There is <b>somebody</b> {{else who}} <b>should</b> not be forgotten, by the bye,' said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. 'Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care what}} she'd say. I dare say she walked with <b>somebody</b> once;--only I <b>should</b> think the <b>somebody</b> must {{have found it}} very dull." ...|$|R

60|$|Whether {{he would}} have {{proceeded}} farther was left to Anne's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager {{to make use of}} the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest <b>somebody</b> else <b>should</b> come in.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not, {{with all}} my heart; and I hope that {{somebody}} else may,--unless <b>somebody</b> else <b>should</b> change his mind. Thank you; I am so much obliged to you. Mind you come and call on me,--193, Park Lane. I dare say you know the little cottage." [...] Then he put Madame Max Goesler into her carriage, and walked away to his club.|$|R
60|$|The {{days and}} weeks went by like a long {{nightmare}} and in due course the event happened. Bickley was not attending the case; {{it was not in}} his line, he said, and he preferred that where a friend's wife was concerned, <b>somebody</b> else <b>should</b> be called in. So it was put in charge of a very good local man with a large experience in such domestic matters.|$|R

60|$|As for {{plans of}} the heart and {{domestic}} life, Moses was one of that very common class who had more desire to be loved than power of loving. His cravings and dreams were not for somebody to be devoted to, but for <b>somebody</b> who <b>should</b> be devoted to him. And, like most people who possess this characteristic, he mistook it for an affectionate disposition.|$|R
5000|$|The punk band Helen Love name-checked Jenkins {{on their}} single 'Where Dylan Thomas Talks To Me', {{released}} in November 2014. The song revealed the band's {{desire to see}} the cycle path from Mumbles to Swansea being renamed 'The Nigel Jenkins Way', with lead singer Love seeing it as a fitting tribute to [...] "a fantastic writer and poet, a maverick, a punk rocker, <b>somebody</b> Swansea <b>should</b> be really proud of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{who is your}} <b>somebody,</b> I <b>should</b> like to know? I dare say, one {{no better}} than a formalist, who thinks that reading prayers out of a book, kneeling, bowing, and {{changing}} gowns, is religion! Thank Heaven, I'm pretty indifferent to the opinions of such people. Harkee, Jenny; if I thought I was no better than some persons I could name, I'd give the point of salvation up, in despair!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} to Anne {{at this point}} of the tirade that the best policy would be to temporize till <b>somebody</b> <b>should</b> return, and she put out her head and face, now grown somewhat pale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he explained, [...] "I wasn't {{the only}} person, present, and I hadn't {{arrived at the}} beginning. <b>Somebody</b> <b>should</b> have stopped the fellow; the shares he tried to work off on Crestwick were no good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I quite {{agree with}} you, sir, that <b>somebody</b> <b>should</b> {{be here to}} help me look after the boy, but not Mr Burns. I am sorry {{to have to say}} it, but I do not trust Mr Burns.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that again. Well," [...] {{answered}} Isaline boldly, [...] "because I do {{not love}} him, and I love <b>somebody</b> else. You <b>should</b> not ask {{a young lady}} about these matters. In Switzerland, we {{do not think it}} comme il faut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Flambeau, as {{the priest}} put his cigar {{in his mouth}} again and leaned back, staring at the roof, [...] "suppose {{somebody}} else did use the scissors. Why <b>should</b> <b>somebody</b> else, cutting pieces off his sermon paper, make Quinton commit suicide?" ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{he called}} a page, who had thoughtfully {{presented}} himself, and gave directions to have the Remorse Apartments of the palace put in order, and for the court tailor to prepare an evening suit of sackcloth-and-ashes. Then summoning the hawk, he seized and dashed him to the ground, killing him very dead. Rejoining his retinue, he dispatched an officer to remove {{the body of the}} serpent from the fountain, lest <b>somebody</b> else <b>should</b> get poisoned. There wasn't any serpent--the water was remarkable for its wholesome purity! ...|$|R
6000|$|There is much {{need that}} <b>somebody</b> <b>should</b> do {{for what is}} vaguely called [...] "Ethics" [...] just what the Political Economists have done.

60|$|Suppose {{it should}} not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose <b>somebody</b> <b>should</b> have got over the wall of the back-yard and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a {{supposition}} at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.|$|E
6000|$|She {{went on to}} give {{a few of the}} particulars, {{but none}} of the invented horrors that had been communicated by the boy. [...] "I thought it better to tell you at once," [...] she added, [...] "in case he should not be very well able to walk home, and <b>somebody</b> <b>should</b> bring him." ...|$|E
6000|$|George said: [...] "I {{should not}} show temper over the matter, if I were you. There {{will come a}} day, perhaps not far distant, when that bicycle, {{with a couple of}} {{mountains}} between it and the nearest repairing shop, will, in spite of your chronic desire for rest, have to be overhauled. Then you will clamour for people to tell you where you put the oil-can, and what you have done with the screw-hammer. Then, while you exert yourself holding the thing steady against a tree, you will suggest that <b>somebody</b> else <b>should</b> clean the chain and pump the back wheel." ...|$|R
6000|$|This morning, I am strong again, calm, wickedly {{capable of}} deceiving Mr. Philip Dunboyne, {{as he has}} deceived me. He has not the faintest {{suspicion}} that I have discovered him.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} don't believe in spirits?" [...] {{said the man}} from India. After a pause he added: [...] "There's <b>somebody</b> else I <b>should</b> like to find, before we go after a fellow with an alibi in the Inner Temple. What's become of that fellow in green--the {{architect}} dressed up as a forester? I haven't seem him about." ...|$|R
