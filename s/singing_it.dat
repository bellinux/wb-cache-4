5000|$|... "Sumer Is Icumen In" [...] is {{featured}} throughout the series. At times it is heard as background music at parties.

5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple <b>singing</b> <b>it</b> quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

5000|$|On Duran Duran's {{episode of}} Behind the Music, Reed {{admitted}} that their version {{might be better}} than his original version, saying, [...] "I think Duran Duran's version of 'Perfect Day' is possibly the best rerecording of a song of mine. I'm not sure that I <b>sang</b> <b>it</b> as well as Simon Bon <b>sang</b> <b>it.</b> I think he <b>sings</b> <b>it</b> better than I did. If I could've <b>sung</b> <b>it</b> the way he did, I would've. It wasn't from lack of trying. They recorded it the way I meant record it, which is a real big thrill for me, so thank you, Duran Duran." ...|$|R

25|$|When Sacred Harp singers begin a song, they {{normally}} start by <b>singing</b> <b>it</b> {{with the appropriate}} syllable for each pitch, using the shapes to guide them. For those in the group not yet familiar with the song, the shapes help {{with the task of}} sight reading. The process of reading through the song with the shapes also helps fix the notes in memory. Once the shapes have been sung, the group then sings the verses of the song with their printed words.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Lynagh {{and with}} David Campese in vintage form, Australia beat New Zealand 13-12 {{in the final}} of the 1988 Hong Kong Sevens. When Lynagh received the silver symbol of sevens supremacy from Hong Long bank taipan Williams Purves, the Royal Hong Kong Police bank struck up ‘Waltzing Matilda’, but they might have stopped the drums and trumpets after a few bars. No one heard them anyway as all but the most rabid anti-Australians in the twenty-thousand-strong throng took up the <b>singing.</b> <b>It</b> was stirring stuff. In the Australian on 28 March Dwyer used the occasion to proclaim {{the start of a new}} era in Australian rugby.|$|E
25|$|William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang {{during the}} {{extraordinary}} {{events of the}} Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, great pain, nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when they suddenly felt accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and <b>singing.</b> <b>It</b> was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch was a strange person {{to be at the}} centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to have experienced the strong feelings of sin or conversion that so many others had reported.|$|E
25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into <b>singing</b> <b>it.</b> The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E
5000|$|Iggy Pop praised {{their version}} and stated: [...] "That's good. She <b>sings</b> <b>it</b> well and she threw a little note in when she <b>sings</b> <b>it,</b> that I wish I had thought of, it's kind of {{improved}} it .... The horn thing is good." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Musica proibita" [...] (Forbidden Music) {{is a song}} {{within a}} song. A young woman tells of a {{handsome}} young man ("un bel garzone") who sings a love song beneath her balcony every night.

25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful <b>singing.</b> <b>It</b> is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
