25|$|Gross {{examination}} - {{the examination}} of diseased tissues with the naked eye. This is important especially for large tissue fragments, because the disease can often be visually identified. It is also at this step that the pathologist selects areas that will be processed for histopathology. The eye can sometimes be aided with a magnifying glass or a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope,</b> especially when examining parasitic organisms.|$|E

25|$|After {{thoroughly}} {{cleaning the}} diamond, the diamond {{is picked up}} using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond {{for the first time}} through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set down and picked up with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope,</b> she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.|$|E
500|$|Further {{conservation}} {{was undertaken}} between 1983 and 1989 using a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope.</b> Restorers removed varnish that had turned brown {{as well as}} layers of old fillers– one of which contained the pigment viridian, not available until 1859. They stripped paint additions from the mountain peaks, Leo's robe and {{in the area around}} Francis's tonsure. The removal of overpainting revealed an X that had been scratched into the original paint on the upper right stones at some unknown time. According to Butler, the removal of pigment exposed underlying paint in [...] "amazingly good condition".|$|E
50|$|Since {{the digital}} {{microscope}} has the image projected directly {{on to the}} CCD camera, {{it is possible to}} have higher quality recorded images than with a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope.</b> With the <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope,</b> the lenses are made for the optics of the eye. Attaching a CCD camera to a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope</b> will result in an image that has compromises made for the eyepiece. Although the monitor image and recorded image may be of higher quality with the digital microscope, the application of the microscope may dictate which microscope is preferred.|$|E

50|$|Digital microscopes are {{commonly}} low priced commercial microscopes {{designed for use}} with a computer, although advanced systems {{that do not require}} a separate computer can cost tens of thousands of dollars. The low price commercial microscopes normally omit the optics for illumination (for example Köhler illumination and phase contrast illumination) and are more akin to webcams with a macro lens. For information about <b>stereo</b> <b>microscopes</b> with a digital camera in research and development, see optical microscope.|$|R
50|$|Recently, video dual CCD camera pickups {{have been}} fitted to <b>stereo</b> <b>microscopes,</b> {{allowing}} the images to be displayed on a high resolution LCD monitor. Software converts the two images to an integrated anaglyph 3D image, for viewing with plastic red/cyan glasses, or to the cross converged process for clear glasses and somewhat better color accuracy. The results are viewable by a group wearing the glasses. More typically, a camera attached {{to one of the}} eyepieces will record conventional 2D images.|$|R

5000|$|A primary {{difference}} between a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope</b> and a digital microscope is the magnification. With a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope</b> the magnification is found by multiplying the lens magnification by the eyepiece magnification. Since the digital microscope {{does not have an}} eyepiece, the magnification cannot be found using this method. Instead the magnification for a digital microscope is found by how many times larger the sample is reproduced on the monitor. Therefore, the magnification will depend {{on the size of the}} monitor. The average digital microscope system, which has a 15" [...] monitor, would result in an average difference in magnification between an optical microscope and a digital microscope of about 40%. Thus the magnification number of a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope</b> is usually 40% less than the magnification number of a digital microscope.|$|E

50|$|Great working {{distance}} {{and depth of}} field are important qualities {{for this type of}} microscope. Both qualities are inversely correlated with resolution: the higher the resolution (i.e. the greater the distance at which two adjacent points can be distinguished as separate), the smaller the depth of field and {{working distance}}. Some <b>stereo</b> <b>microscopes</b> can deliver a useful magnification up to 100×, comparable to a 10× objective and 10× eyepiece in a normal compound microscope, although the magnification is often much lower. This is around one tenth the useful resolution of a normal compound optical microscope.|$|R
40|$|AP Environmental {{students}} visited Norroway Stream in Randolph, MA. This stream {{comes from}} nearby Norroway Pond. Students took macro invertebrate samples {{from a point}} in the stream near West St. A kick sample was taken using a net to catch organisms. After collecting the specimens they were stored and brought back to the school to work with. Students sorted the sample and picked out the macro invertebrates and then identified them to the order level using a key and <b>stereo</b> <b>microscopes.</b> This is a new program for this class...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{magnification}} systems in <b>stereo</b> <b>microscopes.</b> One type is fixed magnification in which primary magnification is achieved by a paired set of objective lenses with a set degree of magnification. The other is zoom or pancreatic magnification, which are capable of a continuously variable degree of magnification across a set range. Zoom systems can achieve further magnification {{through the use of}} auxiliary objectives that increase total magnification by a set factor. Also, total magnification in both fixed and zoom systems can be varied by changing eyepieces.|$|R

50|$|USB microscopes {{are most}} useful when {{examining}} flat {{objects such as}} coins, printed circuit boards, or documents such as banknotes, but {{can be used on}} surfaces of irregular shape such as fibres owing to the high depth of field. Their use is generally similar to that of a reflection optical microscope or a <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope.</b> USB microscopes offer the advantage of being much less bulky than a conventional <b>stereo</b> <b>microscope,</b> so they can be used in the field attached to a laptop computer. They are also useful in examining large items in situ where use of a conventional microscope would be difficult, if not impossible.|$|E

50|$|Non-destructive {{examination}} (NDE) or {{nondestructive testing}} (NDT) {{is a family}} of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, industrial computed tomography scanning, microscopy, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic-particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, eddy-current testing, acoustic emission testing, and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a checkweigher. <b>Stereo</b> <b>microscopes</b> are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects.|$|R
50|$|Devices such as <b>stereo</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{have small}} exit pupils, and {{adjustment}} for user IPD is necessary. These devices {{can be designed}} to fit a large range of IPDs as factors such as size and weight of the adjusting mechanism are not overly critical. In contrast to microscopes, the weight and bulk of NVGs and HMDs are large factors for wearing comfort and usability. The ANVIS NVG has an adjustment range of 52 to 72 mm. The Rockwell-Collins Optronics XL35 and XL50 binocular HMDs {{have a range of}} 55 to 75 mm. The 1988 Army Survey can be used to evaluate the percentage of the Army population captured by these ranges.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stereo</b> <b>microscopes</b> used in micron-level vision {{research}} do {{not directly}} provide the reflectivity field {{that we would}} like to measure for a number of reasons: 1) The measurement system causes blurring in reflectivities, 2) The measured image is a composition of reflectivity and illumination, 3) The measured data contain some random noise. In this work, we propose a method for finding the reflectivity image from the measured stereo microscopic data. First, we find the two intrinsic images, reflectivity and illumination, that make up the measured image. However the reflectivity component here still contains blurring and measurement noise. We use Tikhonov and edge-preserving regularization to deal with these problems, and estimate the underlying reflectivity image. We demonstrate the performance of our technique through experimental results on real data...|$|R
