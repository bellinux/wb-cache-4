We investigated the addition of intravenous (iv) piperacillin/tazobactam immediately prior to <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy with standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis to determine if it would decrease the incidence of serious infectious complications after <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. Group 1 patients were a historic control of 197 patients who underwent <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy with standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Group 2 patients, 104 patients, received standard fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and the addition of a single dose of iv piperacillin/tazobactam 30 minutes prior to <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. There were ten serious bacterial infectious complications in group 1 patients. No patients in group 2 developed serious bacterial infections after <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. There was approximately a 5 % incidence of serious bacterial infection in group 1 patients. Subgroup analysis revealed an almost 2. 5 times increased risk of infection in diabetes patients undergoing <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and biopsy. There was a 10 % risk of serious bacterial infection in diabetics compared with a 3. 8 % risk group 1 nondiabetes patients.

40|$|Boundary incompleteness raises great {{challenges}} to automatic <b>prostate</b> segmentation in <b>ultrasound</b> images. Shape prior can provide strong guidance in estimating the missing boundary, but traditional shape models often suffer from hand-crafted descriptors and local information {{loss in the}} fitting procedure. In this paper, we attempt to address those issues with a novel framework. The proposed framework can seamlessly integrate feature extraction and shape prior exploring, and estimate the complete boundary with a sequential manner. Our framework is composed of three key modules. Firstly, we serialize the static 2 D <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> images into dynamic sequences and then predict prostate shapes by sequentially exploring shape priors. Intuitively, we propose to learn the shape prior with the biologically plausible Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This module is corroborated {{to be effective in}} dealing with the boundary incompleteness. Secondly, to alleviate the bias caused by different serialization manners, we propose a multi-view fusion strategy to merge shape predictions obtained from different perspectives. Thirdly, we further implant the RNN core into a multiscale Auto-Context scheme to successively refine the details of the shape prediction map. With extensive validation on challenging <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> images, our framework bridges severe boundary incompleteness and achieves the best performance in prostate boundary delineation when compared with several advanced methods. Additionally, our approach is general and can be extended to other medical image segmentation tasks, where boundary incompleteness {{is one of the main}} challenges.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a novel {{training}} method is proposed {{to increase the}} classification efficiency of support vector machine (SVM). The efficiency of the SVM {{is determined by the}} number of support vectors, which is usually large for representing a highly convoluted separation hypersurface. We noted that the separation hypersurface is made unnecessarily over-convoluted around extreme outliers, which dominate the objective function of SVM. To suppress the domination from extreme outliers and thus relatively simplify the shape of separation hypersurface, we propose a method of adaptively penalizing the outliers in the objective function. Since our reformulated objective function has the similar format of the standard SVM, the idea of the existing SVM training algorithms is borrowed for training the proposed SVM. Our proposed method has been tested on the UCI machine learning repository, as well as a real clinical problem, i. e., tissue classification in <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> images. Experimental results show that our method is able to dramatically increase the classification efficiency of the SVM, without losing its generalization ability. ...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Prospective study developed over a one-year period. All the patients with indication for prostate biopsy were evaluated. Regardless of PSA values, the patients underwent ultrasound {{in order to identify}} suspicious nodules (confirmed by two observers). Sextant biopsy was subsequently performed. In cases of finding suspicious nodules, an additional puncture directed to such nodules was done. Results: In a total of 155 cases the prevalence of malignancy was of 53 %. Suspicious nodules were detected in 34 patients, and 25 where malignant (positive predictive value of 74 %). The specificity and sensitivity for suspicious nodules were 88 % and 31 % respectively. Comparatively with the randomly obtained sextant specimens, the rate of findings of neoplasia was higher in the specimens obtained with puncture directed to the nodule (p = 0. 032). No statistically significant difference was observed in the Gleason score for both types of specimens (p = 0. 172). Conclusion: The high positive predictive value and the high rate of findings of neoplasia in specimens of suspicious nodules should be taken into consideration in the future.

40|$|Quantifying the {{accuracy}} of segmentation and manual delineation of organs, tissue types and tumors in medical images is a necessary measurement that suffers from multiple problems. One major shortcoming of all accuracy measures is that they neglect the anatomical significance or relevance of different zones within a given segment. Hence, existing accuracy metrics measure the overlap of a given segment with a ground-truth without any anatomical discrimination inside the segment. For instance, if we understand the rectal wall or urethral sphincter as anatomical zones, then current accuracy measures ignore their significance when they are applied to assess {{the quality of the}} prostate gland segments. In this paper, we propose an anatomy-aware measurement scheme for segmentation accuracy of medical images. The idea is to create a ``master gold'' based on a consensus shape containing not just the outline of the segment but also the outlines of the internal zones if existent or relevant. To apply this new approach to accuracy measurement, we introduce the anatomy-aware extensions of both Dice coefficient and Jaccard index and investigate their effect using 500 synthetic <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> images with 20 different segments for each image. We show that through anatomy-sensitive calculation of segmentation accuracy, namely by considering relevant anatomical zones, not only the measurement of individual users can change but also the ranking of users' segmentation skills may require reordering.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a two-step, semi-automated method for reconstructing a three-dimensional (3 D) {{shape of the}} prostate from a 3 D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image. While the method has been developed for <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> imaging, it can potentially be applicable to any other organ {{of the body and}} other imaging modalities. The proposed method takes as input a 3 D TRUS image and generates a watertight 3 D surface model of the prostate. In the first step, the system lets the user visualize and navigate through the input volumetric image by displaying cross sectional views oriented in arbitrary directions. The user then draws partial/full contours on selected cross sectional views. In the second step, the method automatically generates a watertight 3 D surface of the prostate by fitting a deformable spherical template to the set of user-specified contours. Since the method allows the user to select the best cross-sectional directions and draw only clearly recognizable partial or full contours, the user can avoid time-consuming and inaccurate guesswork on where prostate contours are located. By avoiding the usage of noisy, incomprehensible portions of the TRUS image, the proposed method yields more accurate prostate shapes than conventional methods that demand complete cross-sectional contours selected manually, or automatically using an image processing tool. Our experiments confirmed that a 3 D watertight surface of the prostate can be generated within five minutes even from a volumetric image {{with a high level of}} speckles and shadow noises...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{modelling}} {{and statistical}} learning theory are two powerful analytical frameworks for analyzing signals and developing efficient processing and classification algorithms. In this thesis, these frameworks are applied for modelling and processing biomedical signals {{in two different}} contexts: ultrasound medical imaging systems and primate neural activity analysis and modelling. In the context of ultrasound medical imaging, two main applications are explored: deconvolution of signals measured from a ultrasonic transducer and automatic image segmentation and classification of <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound</b> scans. In the former application a stochastic model of the radio frequency signal measured from a ultrasonic transducer is derived. This model is then employed for developing in a statistical framework a regularized deconvolution procedure, for enhancing signal resolution.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel deformable model for automatic segmentation of <b>prostates</b> from three-dimensional <b>ultrasound</b> images, by statistical matching of both shape and texture. A set of Gabor-support vector machines (G-SVMs) are positioned on different patches {{of the model}} surface, and trained to adaptively capture texture priors of ultrasound images for differentiation of prostate and nonprostate tissues in different zones around prostate boundary. Each G-SVM consists of a Gabor filter bank for extraction of rotation-invariant texture features and a kernel support vector machine for robust differentiation of textures. In the deformable segmentation procedure, these pretrained G-SVMs are used to tentatively label voxels around the surface of deformable model as prostate or nonprostate tissues by a statistical texture matching. Subsequently, the surface of deformable model is driven to {{the boundary between the}} tentatively labeled prostate and nonprostate tissues. Since the step of tissue labeling and the step of label-based surface deformation are dependent on each other, these two steps are repeated until they converge. Experimental results by using both synthesized and real data show the good performance of the proposed model in segmenting <b>prostates</b> from <b>ultrasound</b> images.

ResultsTwo hundred and twenty-eight men with bothersome LUTS (IPSS >  7) were enrolled as study participants at a mean age of 56. 4 years. Patients with PV > 25  mL were significantly older and had higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and scores for total IPSS, storage, urgency items, and nocturia items.

The purpose of this video is to describe the procedure step by step. Materials and methods: We present {{the case of a}} 68 year-old man with localized PCa in the anterior aspect of the prostate. Results: The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with the patient in lithotomy position. Briefly, the equipment utilized includes the cryotherapy console coupled with an ultrasound system, argon and helium gas bottles, cryoprobes, temperature probes and an urethral warming catheter. The procedure starts with a real-time trans-rectal <b>prostate</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> which is used to outline the prostate, the urethra and the rectal wall. The cryoprobes are pretested and placed in to the prostate through the perineum, following a grid template, along with the temperature sensors under ultrasound guidance. A cystoscopy confirms the right positioning of the needles and the urethral warming catheter is installed. Thereafter, the freeze sequence with argon gas is started, achieving extremely low temperatures (- 40 °C) to induce tumor cell lysis. Sequentially, the thawing cycle is performed using helium gas. This process is repeated one time. Results among several series showed a biochemical disease-free survival between 71 - 93 % at 9 - 70 month- follow-up, incontinence rates between 0 - 3. 6 % and erectile dysfunction between 0 - 42 % (1 – 5).

Until recently, no morphological change of the lower urinary tract could safely diagnose BOO. Therefore, the value of ultrasound measurement of detrusor wall thickness (DWT) {{for the detection of}} BOO was investigated. The results of the studies demonstrate that suprapubic measurement of DWT should be performed at the anterior bladder wall with a bladder filling of ≥ 250 ml or a bladder capacity of ≥ 50 %. Measurements in healthy men are significantly thicker than in healthy women. Ultrasound measurement DWT values ≥ 2 mm indicate BOO. The more severely BOO is the thicker DWT becomes. Compared to pressure-flow studies, ultrasound DWT measurement for the evaluation of BOO has a positive predictive value of 94 - 95 %, negative predictive value of 75 - 86 %, sensitivity of 64 - 83 %, specificity of 95 - 97 %, and a likelihood ratio of a positive test result of 17. 6 - 21. 3.

We compared the results of free uroflowmetry and transrectal <b>ultrasound</b> <b>prostate</b> size determination with those of pressure-flow analysis of bladder outlet obstruction in 871 consecutive elderly men. Maximal flow, prostate size, and post-void residual and voided volumes were correlated with bladder outlet obstruction to derive a clinical prostate score. Clinical prostate score shows a superior correlation with bladder outlet obstruction than isolated objective parameters or symptom score...|$|R
25|$|Urinalysis is {{typically}} performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate {{for signs of}} a urinary tract infection, glucose in the urine (suggestive of diabetes), or protein in the urine (suggestive of kidney disease). Bloodwork including kidney function tests and prostate specific antigen (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively. However, checking blood PSA levels for prostate cancer screening is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well. If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasonography may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or <b>prostate</b> cancer. <b>Ultrasound</b> examination of the testes, prostate, and kidneys is often performed, again to rule out cancer and hydronephrosis.|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} and chronic kidney disease in community-dwelling men. BackgroundBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and chronic kidney disease are important public health problems in older men. Previous referral-based studies disagree on whether BPH is associated with chronic kidney disease. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the community-based {{association between}} clinical measures of BPH and chronic kidney disease. MethodsA community-based sample of 2115 white men (ages 40 – 79 years) was randomly selected from the Olmsted County, Minnesota population (55 % participation rate) in 1990. A random subsample (N = 476) had a detailed clinical evaluation. This evaluation included a questionnaire with similar queries to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), peak urinary flow rates (uroflowmeter), postvoid residual urine volume (<b>ultrasound),</b> <b>prostate</b> volume (<b>ultrasound),</b> serum <b>prostate</b> specific antigen (PSA), and serum creatinine. ResultsAfter adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes, leukocyte esterase positive (possible urinary tract infection), and smoking, chronic kidney disease [serum creatinine ≥ 133 μmol/L (1. 5 mg/dL) ] was associated with diminished peak urinary flow rate (7) by an OR = 2. 91 (95 % CI 1. 32 – 6. 62), and chronic urinary retention (postvoid residual > 100 mL) by an OR = 2. 28 (95 % CI 0. 66 – 6. 68). There was no association with a prostate volume > 30 mL by an OR = 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 22 – 1. 37) or PSA > 1. 4 ng/mL by an OR = 1. 17 (95 % CI 0. 47 – 2. 81). ConclusionThere was a cross-sectional association between signs and symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction and chronic kidney disease in community-dwelling men. Prostatic enlargement was not associated with chronic kidney disease...|$|R
40|$|Multi-parametric {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (mp-MRI) has become an increasingly important method for detecting and treating <b>prostate</b> cancer. Transrectal <b>ultrasound</b> (TRUS) is {{the most commonly used}} method for guiding prostate needle biopsy and remains the gold standard for diagnosis of prostate cancer. MRI-to-TRUS image reg- istration is an important technology for enabling computer-assisted targeting of the majority of prostate lesions that are visible in MRI but not independently distinguishable in TRUS images. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the needle placement accuracy of an image guidance system (SmartTargetÒ), developed by our research group, using a surgical training phantom...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an automated multi-step algorithm for segmenting the <b>prostate</b> boundary from <b>ultrasound</b> images. As the acquired ultrasound images are usually affected {{due to the}} presence of Speckle and other noise artifacts, {{the first step is to}} pre-process these images using Sticks Filtering. Further, in stage two an initial contour is determined from these pre-processed images. Finally, Ant Colony Optimization is used to segment the prostate boundary to determine the volume of the prostate. In the last section the performance of both pre-processing stage as well as segmentation stage is presented and is compared with existing algorithms. Index Terms—Prostate, TRUS, ACO I...|$|R
