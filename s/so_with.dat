5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, <b>so</b> <b>with</b> their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, <b>so</b> <b>with</b> Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication.

5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do <b>so</b> <b>with</b> great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less <b>so</b> <b>with</b> the German cockroach.|$|E
5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did <b>so</b> <b>with</b> generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E

50|$|It {{was said}} {{of a famous}} English Headmaster that he was <b>so</b> good <b>with</b> the boys, and <b>so</b> good <b>with</b> the parents, that {{naturally}} he {{had no time for}} the Staff. It was because Miss Bassett was <b>so</b> good <b>with</b> the girls and the parents and the Staff that many people considered her a great Headmistress. A member of the Staff at Streatham, who later had the opportunity to know the English educational world very well once said that, as a Headmistress Miss Bassett was in a class by herself.|$|R

5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their option, and traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did <b>so</b> <b>with</b> a two-year, $8.5million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.|$|E
5|$|He {{added that}} while he regretted that his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on this occasion and doing <b>so</b> <b>with</b> his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.|$|E
5|$|Iginla scored his 500th goal on January 7, 2012, against Niklas Bäckström of the Minnesota Wild in a 3–1 victory.

5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing <b>so</b> <b>with</b> the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Miller had the {{upcoming}} Test series against England in 1946–47 {{to look forward}} to.

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to discuss the MSA of Africa without first considering the immense size of the continent.

Liverpool were expected to win the first leg, played at Anfield, their home ground, and they did <b>so</b> <b>with</b> a score of 5–1.
