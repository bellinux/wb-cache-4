5|$|At State {{funerals}} the heralds {{once again}} {{take their place}} {{at the front of}} the royal procession as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the procession of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and crest, spurs, gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This procession of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> titles of the deceased. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother at the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.|$|E

Methods: Electronic and hand searches were conducted to identify all published literature relating to the aim of the review. Data were narratively synthesised.

No studies assessed the impact of both attachment <b>style</b> <b>and</b> EI on PPC. Conclusion: Whilst tentative links were found between both PPC <b>and</b> both attachment <b>style</b> <b>and</b> EI, heterogeneity in study design, predictor variables and outcome measures made drawing conclusions difficult. Practice implications: More research is needed to assess the influence of both attachment <b>style</b> <b>and</b> EI on PPC...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to provide empirical evidence that subunit managerial performance is an interactive function of evaluation <b>style</b> <b>and</b> organization characteristics of autonomy and interdependence. Both autonomy and interdependence are believed crucial to the design of evaluation systems because the accounting literature has suggested that accounting performance measurement is more suitable for independent and autonomous organizational subunits. Subjects were division managers of profit centers and investment centers from large manufacturing companies within the Metropolitan Sydney and Wollongong areas. Collection of data was based on interviews and pretested questionnaire. The statistical analysis involved formulation of two regression equations in which the focus of research interest was to find the significance of the regression coefficients in the cross-product terms representing, respectively, the interactive effects of evaluation <b>style</b> <b>and</b> autonomy, <b>and</b> evaluation <b>style</b> <b>and</b> interdependence. The results showed a significant interaction between evaluation <b>style</b> <b>and</b> autonomy, indicating the importance of matching accounting-based evaluation <b>style</b> <b>and</b> high autonomy to induce higher subunit managerial performance. The lack of significant interaction between evaluation <b>style</b> <b>and</b> interdependence was consistent with prior studies which asserted that profit centers and investment centers are characterized by a low level of interdependence between subunits...|$|R
