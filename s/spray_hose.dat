50|$|More {{than seven}} billion rolls {{of toilet paper}} are sold yearly in the United States alone. Americans use an average of 23.6 rolls per capita a year. The average American uses 50 lb of tissue paper per year which is 50% {{more than the average}} of other Western {{countries}} or Japan. The higher use in the United States may be {{explained by the fact that}} other countries people use bidets or <b>spray</b> <b>hoses</b> to clean themselves. Millions of trees are harvested in North and South America leaving ecological footprint concerns. Citizens of many Western countries sometimes use toilet paper for industrial purposes such as oil filters, which may distort the use statistics.|$|R

50|$|Arriving in Los Angeles, Friendless frees Brown Eyes {{and leads}} her away, using his red {{bandanna}} {{once more to}} guide the other thousand steers to the stockyard. The townspeople are terrified of the cattle {{as some of the}} cows break away and begin entering the stores, but Friendless manages to corral them together. Friendless ties Brown Eyes up before going back to retrieve the other cattle, leaving his red bandanna with her in order to keep her cool. Realizing his mistake, he enters a masquerade store to find something red to attract the cows. Deciding on a red devil's outfit, he exits the store and the cattle begin to chase him. The police attempt to arrest him, but are mistakenly <b>sprayed</b> with <b>hoses</b> from the fire department, who flee once they see the cattle coming.|$|R
50|$|During the Phantom FG1 trials (involving three newly {{delivered}} aircraft {{operated by}} 700P NAS) the longer waist catapult was used, {{and a thick}} steel plate was chained to the deck behind the catapult to absorb {{the heat of the}} Phantom's afterburners. The JBD was not used as it would have been damaged, and after each launch fire <b>hoses</b> <b>sprayed</b> water on the deck plate to cool it down before the next aircraft could be loaded onto the catapult.|$|R
5000|$|By November 1, the {{painting}} {{had begun to}} attract local news coverage. It was dubbed the [...] "Pink Lady" [...] by the media, due to the pink paint used for the skin. Los Angeles County road officials, concerned about traffic problems {{the painting}} might cause, attempted to remove it with high-pressure <b>spray</b> from fire <b>hoses,</b> and then with paint stripper. However, Seemayer had used heavy-duty house paint for her creation, and both methods failed to remove it.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{includes two}} primary elements: {{a pair of}} neon-topped tapering concrete walls flanking the entry sidewalk, and a wall-mounted neon sign displaying the number 25 in a stylized font. During the day, the neon is not lit. At night, the entry numbers glow red, and {{the tops of the}} tapering wall glow blue. According to the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey, the red neon symbolizes fire and the blue neon symbolizes water <b>spray</b> from fire <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{fog nozzle}} is a {{firefighting}} <b>hose</b> <b>spray</b> nozzle that breaks its stream into small droplets. By doing so, its stream achieves a greater surface area, {{and thus a}} greater rate of heat absorption, which, when {{compared to that of}} a smoothbore nozzle, speeds its transformation into the steam that smothers the fire by displacing its oxygen. Specially designed fog nozzles (with no stream adjustment) have been certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) for use on Class B & C hazards.|$|R

5000|$|Pantyhose {{have been}} criticized for being flimsy because the thin knit fabric is prone to tearing or laddering (or [...] "running"). The wearer can cause a run in the hose by {{catching}} a toenail in the fabric when the hose is put on, by catching it on a rough surface like a corner of a desk, or a car, and by numerous other risks. Some women apply clear nail polish or hair <b>spray</b> to their <b>hose</b> to prevent runs from growing.|$|R
30|$|The {{protective}} {{performance of}} the FFPPC is greatly affected {{by the presence of}} moisture. The amount of moisture and its distribution; the material used for the clothing system and the clothing design; and the thermal intensity affects the level of thermal protection of the FFPPC (Mell and Lawson [2000]; Lawson et al. [2004]; Barker et al. [2006]). Accumulated moisture on the skin and in the fabric ensembles can alter the level of protection. In a clothing system, the moisture is created from the internal (by perspiration) as well as the external (environmental factors such as water <b>spray</b> from <b>hoses,</b> rain, dew and moisture in the air) sources. The degree of moisture absorption, location and amount of moisture in the body, source of moisture and duration of exposure to thermal radiation affects the moisture transfer through a clothing system to the environment.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the last}} people to be rescued was a six-year-old boy pulled alive from the rubble of his {{collapsed}} home in Taichung County {{by a team of}} South Korean and Japanese search and rescue workers, some 88 hours after the quake. Even later, nearly 130 hours after the earthquake, two brothers emerged alive from the ruins of the Tunghsing Building in Taipei to the astonishment of rescuers. The brothers survived on the water <b>sprayed</b> from fire <b>hoses,</b> rotten fruit, and their own urine.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{attempted}} occupation drew over 3,500 activists who felt energized after growing disillusionment with nuclear {{power with the}} near meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania a few months earlier. The activists made several attempts to get through fencing {{and at one point}} entered the site but were met by state police equipped with pepper spray, tear gas, and in one case, a fire <b>hose</b> <b>spraying</b> water on them. Dozens of arrests were made. The occupation was not successful in taking over the site but drew much national media attention.|$|R
5000|$|Dunn {{wrote in}} his August 2000 newsletter, [...] "The best-kept secret in America's fire service is that firefighters cannot {{extinguish}} a fire in a 20- or 30-thousand-square-foot open floor area in a high-rise building. A fire company advancing a 2½-inch hoseline with a 1¼-inch nozzle discharges only 300 gallons per minute and can extinguish only about 2,500 square feet of fire. The reach of the streams is only 50 feet. A modern open-floor office design, with cubicle work stations and dwarf partitions that do not extend to the ceiling, allows fire to spread throughout an entire 100- × 200-foot floor area. A fully involved, free burning 20,000-square-foot floor area cannot be extinguished {{by a couple of}} firefighters <b>spraying</b> a <b>hose</b> stream from a stairway. City managers and department chiefs will not admit this to the public if they want to keep their jobs. But every fireground commander knows this is a fact." ...|$|R
40|$|Dick Peixoto (pronounced Peh-SHOTE) exemplifies {{a recent}} type of organic farmer who, {{after a long}} career in {{conventional}} farming, transitions to organics for a mixture of reasons. Peixoto was born in 1956 in Watsonville, California, the grandson of immigrants from the Azores Islands who have been farming in the Pajaro Valley for the past 100 years. He {{grew up on the}} family ranch on Green Valley Road. His father worked off-farm for a fertilizer and pest control company in Watsonville, in addition to working on the family ranch. Peixoto spent his childhood riding around with his dad, dragging <b>spray</b> <b>hoses</b> around apple orchards in the Pajaro Valley. He dates his farming career to eighth grade, when he hired neighborhood kids to pick tomatoes on his family farm so he could market them. In 1976, when Peixoto was a senior in high school, he and his brother, Jim, began growing string beans commercially. Soon after, Peixoto began farming on his own, learning lettuce growing, as well as irrigation and laser leveling. Attracted by the organic price premium, Peixoto decided to transition to organic farming, and began Lakeside Gardens on a 55 -acre farm in Watsonville in 1996. His conventional farming friends thought he had “lost his marbles,” but Lakeside Gardens has been very successful and Dick has become a spokesperson for integrated pest management, hedgerows and other organic farming methods. The company has expanded their operation to a total of 1200 acres, including fifty different parcels in the Pajaro Valley, many of which border on hospitals and schools trying to reduce pesticide exposure. Lakeside also farms on 500 acres in El Centro, making them one of the larger organic growers on the Central Coast and in California. They grow 75 different crops. All of their produce is California grown, and shipped by Albert’s Organics and other organic food distribution companies across the country to grocery stores such as Safeway and Kroger’s, as well as Whole Foods. Peixoto is outspoken on food safety, water supply, open space preservation, and other issues affecting agriculture, and is often quoted in the media on these topics. Ellen Farmer conducted this oral history on April 18, 2007, at Lakeside Organic Gardens in Watsonville...|$|R

5000|$|Suitsupply {{is known}} for its sexually-charged {{photography}} and ad campaigns. Carli Hermes has been shooting all the Suitsupply campaigns since 2004. Some photos from the Shameless campaign had to be removed from a London Suitsupply shop, and images from the same campaign at Westfield Shopping Centre were criticised because they were displayed where they can be easily seen by children. [...] Several photos from the Shameless campaign had to be removed from Suitsupply's website and Facebook page for portraying the woman as a sex object and/or as submissive to the man according to a ruling by the Belgian advertising standards authority. The Ambition and Not Dressing Women campaigns also courted controversy. For the 2012 Fall/Winter lookbook campaign the Lunch atop a Skyscraper photograph shot by Charles Ebbets was a source of inspiration, and the images were shot against the skyline of New York City.The spring/summer 2016 campaign, titled Toy Boys, depicted doll-size men in suits playing on giant female bodies; scenes included: men sliding down a model’s bare chest, straddling a woman's neck, standing on a woman and <b>spraying</b> a <b>hose</b> into her mouth, etc. The images provoked controversy on social media.|$|R
50|$|The Commissioner of Police, Dick Lee {{provided}} reassurances that weapons such {{as water}} cannons and plastic bullets would not be used. Given the police's experience in dealing with previous riots, such as those involving Vietnamese refugees in the 1990s, Mr Lee said the Hong Kong Police Force {{should be able to}} handle any protests. In the unlikely event of an emergency which the police cannot handle, the Chief Executive had the power to seek help from the Hong Kong detachment of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Provisions for this were in the Hong Kong Basic Law. On 17 December, the Hong Kong Police Force used tear gas, pepper <b>spray</b> and fire <b>hoses</b> in order to suppress the demonstrators. Almost 1000 demonstrators have been detained.|$|R
