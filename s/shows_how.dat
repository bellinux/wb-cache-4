5|$|In {{order to}} produce a Horn instance, no two {{variables}} that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint {{on a pair of}} variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint.

By breaking up long clauses into multiple smaller clauses, and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, it is possible to reduce this to linear time.|$|E

Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed {{a higher percentage of}} highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present {{methods for}} {{evaluating}} human and automatic taggers that extend current practice in three ways.

Second, we <b>show</b> <b>how</b> to accommodate a common property of manually constructed “gold standards ” that are typically used for objective evaluation, namely that there is often more than one correct answer. Third, we <b>show</b> <b>how</b> to measure performance when the set of possible tags is tree-structured in an is-a hierarchy. To illustrate how our methods can be used to measure inter-annotator agreement, we <b>show</b> <b>how</b> to compute the kappa coefficient over hierarchical tag sets. 1...|$|R
