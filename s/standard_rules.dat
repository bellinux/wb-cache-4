Two bouts were featured on the undercard. In respective singles matches, World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels to retain his title and Gene Snitsky defeated Kane in a Weapon of Choice match, a match in which the use of foreign objects, which is usually illegal under the <b>standard</b> <b>rules</b> of professional wrestling, is allowed.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the <b>standard</b> <b>rules</b> are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E

He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the <b>standard</b> <b>rules</b> of modelling and perspective.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} online multiplayer. Having five maps as standard, matches can {{be carried}} out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer. Random battles are played either with <b>standard</b> <b>rules,</b> or with special limitations. The Fog of War environmental effect is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes. In addition, Fates features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of Fire Emblem Awakenings Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The <b>standard</b> <b>rules</b> are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} three different rounding rules for multiplication and division is presented, including statistical analyses via Monte-Carlo simulations {{as well as a}} math-ematical derivation. This work expands upon a previous study by Mulliss and Lee (1998), by making the more realistic assumption that the contributing uncertainties are statistically independent. With this assumption, it is shown that the so-called <b>standard</b> rounding <b>rule</b> fails over 60 % of the time, leading to a loss in precision. Two alternative rules are studied, and both are found to be significantly more accurate than the <b>standard</b> <b>rule.</b> One alterna-tive rule requires one extra significant digit beyond that predicted by the <b>standard</b> <b>rule.</b> The other requires one to count numbers whose leading digit is 5 or greater as having an extra significant digit, and then to apply the <b>standard</b> <b>rule.</b> Although the second alternative rule is slightly more accurate, the first is shown to be completely safe for data — never leading to a truncation of digits that contain significant information. Accordingly, we recommend the first alternative rule as the new standard. PACS numbers: 01. 30. Pp, 01. 55. +b, 02. 70. Uu I...|$|R
