It {{is important for}} teachers to make the mathematical meaning of manipulatives clear and help the students to build connections between the concrete materials and abstract symbols. Virtual manipulatives usually have this built-in structure. Many virtual manipulative activities give students hints and feedback with pop-ups and help features. More traditional concrete manipulatives are not conducive to comprehension without direct instructor assistance. For example, in using tangrams, students can practically copy a design made from pattern blocks.

Model 1907s made from 1913 until 1917 had a collared barrel and a loaded chamber indicator, allowing the shooter to tell by touching the shell ejection port whether a cartridge was chambered. The Model 1907 uses no screws (even the grips <b>snap</b> <b>into</b> <b>place)</b> and is simple to strip. The grips were made from gutta-percha, though some early production examples had metal grips. In 1912 the Model 1907 underwent a major design revision modifying almost every major component.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} game set {{includes four}} plastic display racks and four decks of 96 cards. Each card has either one letter or a blank on it. Each deck has 5 each of A, S, blank; 3 each of B, H, P, W, Y; 2 each of J, Q, V, X, Z; and 4 each {{of all the}} other letters. Each display rack can hold up to twelve cards, with a point value assigned to each card position: 5-10-15-15-10-5-5-10-15-15-10-5. The cards are used to spell out each player's secret word face-down on one of the racks. For words less than 12 letters, blank cards may be used at one or both ends of the word to disguise its true length. Game version #202, introduced in 1976, replaces the letter cards with strips of paper on which the letters are written, and doors <b>snap</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> to cover them.|$|E
50|$|The Folgore's {{launcher}} is a {{recoilless rifle}} that fires a boost-after-launch rocket projectile. It {{consists of a}} long, reusable launch tube constructed of high strength nickel-cobalt-steel. The use of nickel-cobalt-steel not only keeps the weight at a reasonable level, but also enables the firing of projectiles {{at a much higher}} velocity, than other weapons previously in its class. To load the Folgore, the nozzle clamp has to be released and tilted to the side to insert the ammunition. The cartridge case is perforated with holes along its sides to allow gases to escape to the back and out of the nozzle on firing to achieve a recoilless effect. One kilogram of propellant in the cartridge case is used to fire the projectile. After the projectile exits the muzzle, six fins <b>snap</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> The fins are canted slightly to impart spin. After the projectile has coasted a safe distance a rocket motor ignites, boosting the projectile from 385 m/s to 500 m/s, giving the projectile an almost flat trajectory to 500 m.|$|E

40|$|Successful {{treatment}} of {{many types of}} cancer is improved when early detection is possible. One method of early detection is microscopic inspection of the tissue at risk. Microscopic inspection can be performed by extracting a biopsy and using traditional microscopes, but biopsy is painful and inconvenient which limits its use. An alternative is in vivo microscopy using an endoscope or microendoscopy. This dissertation describes the design, construction, and evaluation of a miniature microscope or microendoscope based on new microfabrication technologies. All components typically found in a traditional bench-top microscope were designed and built on a miniature scale. The objective was comprised of one planoconvex spherical glass lens and three printed microlenses. The printed lenses were patterned using grayscale lithography in a custom engineered photosensitive hybrid sol-gel glass material. Illumination was delivered by high-brightness Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) via multimode fiber. The design incorporated a custom imaging detector and a Micro-Electrical-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) actuator for optical sectioning using structured illumination. The opto-mechanical system is designed using a new concept called "zero alignment assembly" in which the lens elements <b>snap</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> and are constrained to a precise position with tolerances tighter than the optical tolerances. This scheme requires no post-assembly alignment or adjustment and simplifies system assembly. The miniature microscope was designed to image in several modes including reflectance, fluorescence, and using structured illumination for optical sectioning. A unique optical design incorporated tilted elements to remove ghost images and internal reflections from the image plane. This design enabled microscopic imaging of extremely low reflectance samples like tissue where the "in-focus" component of the object reflects only 0. 04 % of the illumination. The miniature microscope was built and tested by imaging a variety of test objects including cancer tissue phantoms and pig tissue. The results demonstrated the successful implementation of many new microfabrication technologies and design concepts to build a working prototype miniature microscope measuring only 3 x 4 x 15 mm capable of imaging cellular structure of tissue in reflectance or flourescence...|$|E

50|$|Molded plastic light {{tubes are}} {{commonly}} used in the electronics industry to direct illumination from LEDs on a circuit board to indicator symbols or buttons. These light tubes typically take on a highly complex shape that uses either gentle curving bends as in an optic fiber or have sharp prismatic folds which reflect off the angled corners.

50|$|PALS {{consists}} of webbing sewn onto the load-bearing equipment and corresponding webbing and straps on the attachment.

New types are laser cut out of single piece fabric rather than webbing straps sewn onto fabric. This is common on many new tactical items from backpacks to chest rigs.

This made it less expensive to build, easier to repair, and earned it heavy praise and a warm reception amongst the Mac community.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{industrial}} robots are fast and {{have very good}} repetitional accuracy, which have made them indispensable in many manufacturing applications. However, they are usually programmed to follow desired trajectories and only get feedback from position sensors. This works fine {{as long as the}} environment is very well structured, but does not give good robustness to objects not being positioned or gripped accurately. A solution is to use additional sensing, such as force sensors and vision. How to combine the data from the different sensors and use it in a good way to control the robot is still an area of research. This paper describes an assembly scenario where a switch should be <b>snapped</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> in a box. Force sensing is used to resolve the uncertain position of the parts and detect the snap {{at the end of the}} operation. During the assembly an uncertain distance is estimated to improve the performance.

50|$|A snapper is a hoax {{mechanical}} puzzle {{consisting of}} a pointed piece attached to a notched dowel and a hollow block with a secondary hole along its length through which a rubber-band is stretched (across the shaft) and tied off. A demonstrator inserts the dowel into the hollow block, hooks the rubber-band on the notch, pulls on the pointed end, and allows the dowel to <b>snap</b> back <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> The demonstrator hands the puzzle to an observer who cannot hook the rubber-band onto the dowel's notch.

The second method is to <b>snap</b> the rod <b>into</b> one of the connector slots perpendicular to first method. The rods cannot rotate and will not move without deliberate force. The third way is to slip the rod through a round hole in the connector. The rod can slide and rotate freely while in the hole.|$|R
40|$|What {{is a good}} {{metaphor for}} the word “synthesis? ” In {{classroom}} lectures, E. O. Wilson would invoke {{the image of a}} theoretical skeleton upon which one can hang the facts. For Wilson, the bones were the five agents of microevolution and the flesh, disparate empirical findings. Although vivid, the metaphor fails to capture the sociology of scientific discovery: calculated risk-taking with its own Darwinian process of winnowing hypotheses that fail to meet the accepted threshold of evidence. Wilson’s metaphor would not do justice to the feat achieved in The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption. The author, Gad Saad, has done more than just hang the facts of consumer behavior onto the skeleton of evolutionary psychology. He has given us a map of the literature where the curious reader is encouraged to probe the hinterlands. So, in answer to my own question, I would invoke the cover design of ECONOMICS 17 th edition (Samuelson and Nordhaus, 2002) : a jigsaw puzzle of the world globe fragmented into amoeba shaped pieces.
