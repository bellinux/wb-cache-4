In the 500 metres, Shim won gold in dominating style, recording a time of 44.113. That time was 0.652 seconds faster than runner-up Agnė Sereikaitė of Lithuania. In the 1000 metres, Shim broke the 9-year-old world junior 1000-metre record of 1:30.483 established by Byun Chun-sa of South Korea in 2003, finishing 1000 m in 1:30.266 in the semifinal race. <b>Shim</b> <b>set</b> a world junior record again in the 1000 m final race {{with a time of}} 1:30.208, beating South Korean fellow Hwang Hyun-sun, a member of the senior national team, by 0.106 seconds. Shim also won the 1500 metres with a time of 2:21.987, beating Hwang again by 0.082 seconds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new passive shim design method and a novel shimming procedure {{to correct the}} magnetic field inhomogeneities generated by C-shape permanent biplanar magnetic resonance imaging magnets. The method expresses the shim distribution as a sum of orthogonal functions multiplied by unknown amplitudes. The oscillating modes of the shim magnetization-thickness function are normalized within a finite disk. By minimizing the <b>shim</b> <b>set</b> weight and constraining the magnetization-thickness function, the method produces a continuous map of the required shim contribution. The map defines the shim shape and a discrete process then determines the regions where no shim contributions are needed. With this methodology, passive shims capable of generating magnetic field harmonics with minimal impurities and ferro-shim pieces can be generated. The paper reports a study of magnetic coupling among the iron pieces and its influence over the magnetic field harmonics of linear and nonlinear iron, and demonstrates that {{the exclusion of the}} magnetic coupling in the shimming process produces an unacceptable error in the final shimmed field homogeneity. The proper selection and arrangement of individual shim sizes produces a better conditioned field source matrix and hence improves the design. A number of examples show that the new method can effectively cancel target impurity harmonics while controlling high-order harmonics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method of 3 D {{automated}} shimming in high-resolution applications. This does not heavily rely on Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) modules {{and can be used}} with any spectrometer equipped with shims and homospoil facilities at least. The method exploits Fourier imaging technique for mapping of static magnetic field inhomogeneity and field shapes generated by shim coils, which are used as input for calculations of shim corrections by least squares fitting. The results of testing with protonated and deuterated solvents with 13 <b>shims</b> <b>set</b> on a Unity INOVA 300 spectrometer are also presented.

50|$|Early Matsumoku made Epiphone archtops and hollow-body basses had four-point bolt on necks. As {{production}} costs of bolt on neck guitars were less, some guitarists regarded them as inferior instruments. However, {{it was not}} the neck construction, that was inferior (as described below, many Matsumoku-built necks were of premium quality). Rather, it was the lack of reinforcement in the neck pocket area, which could enable, that area to act like a hinge, causing future problems with high action due to tension on the body's neck pocket from the strings. Collectors of Matsumoku guitars from this period have often solved this problem by fabricating and installing permanent custom neck <b>shims.</b> <b>Set</b> neck archtop guitars followed in late 1975. Specifications on Epiphone archtops changed throughout the Matsumoku era.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A novel {{approach}} to optimal, extended volume (e. g whole head) shimming is presented. The method relies on dynamically updating an optimal <b>shim</b> <b>setting</b> {{for each individual}} slice in a multi-slice dataset. The optimal shims are obtained with a rapid, automated and user-independent phase mapping technique. T 2 * and frequency distribution maps and spectroscopic images obtained from rat brain in vivo are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of DSU over global shimming for multi-slice signal acquisition. Introduction The optimization of the main magnetic field homogeneity (i. e. shimming) is important for all NMR applications, but represents a crucial step for NMR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging and T 2 *-based imaging. In the last decade several important advances in shimming methods and technology have been described [I- 31. Th...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis: This paper {{presents}} a new alternative shimming procedure {{to correct the}} magnetic field inhomogeneities generated by horizontal and C-shape biplanar MRI magnets. A magnetization map obtained {{through the application of}} the Equivalent Magnetizing Current (EMC) method is used to define the domain where the discrete iron <b>shim</b> <b>set</b> is placed to generate a given field harmonic [1]. Optionally, instead of iron a current pattern is used, then the magnetization is related to the stream function (SF) and the current pattern is placed at equally spaced contours of the SF [1]. If a set of discrete iron pieces with no reversible magnetization direction is employed to mimic the continuous magnetization function (MF) map, then iron shims of unit strength are placed only in the positive domain (valid domain) of the MF map. The field source matrix is calculated only for the discrete elements located in the valid domain, which leads to a better conditioned matrix and superior solutions. An LP algorithm is used to calculate the optimal thickness and location of the discrete ferroshims to produce the target harmonics. Examples of simulated shimming of horizontal/C-shape magnets are presented. In the case of permanent open magnets, the magnetic coupling among the iron pieces and its influence over the magnetic field harmonics is studied for linear and nonlinear iron cases. The influence of the selection and arrangement of individual shim sizes over the field source matrix conditioning is also analysed...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) scanners {{are important}} tools in medical diagnostics {{and in many}} areas of neuroscience. MR technology is moving towards ultra-high field (UHF) 7 T and 9. 4 Tscanners which provide more signal intensity. However, they also suffer from inhomogeneity of the static magnetic field (B 0 field) which can lead to artifacts and uninterpretable data. B 0 shimming is a technique used to reduce inhomogeneities but MR scanners use a constant <b>shim</b> <b>setting</b> for a duration of the experiment. Dynamic shim updating (DSU) updates the shim in real-time while the scan is in process and can hence reduce any fluctuations in B 0 field which may arise due to patient breathing, mechanical vibrations and soforth. However, DSU is currently very slow and if we want to increase the update rate, control theory needs to be applied. This paper presents an application of basic system identification and signal processing in the context of MR systems for DSU. Although system identification of these systems has been done before, they are non-parametric frequency domain approaches. These systems can be modelled as linear multivariable systems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{several aspects}} of gradient and shim coil design and fabrication. New design techniques are coupled with experimental construction methods to expand small animal insert gradient and shim technology. The design techniques are also applied {{to other areas of}} magnetic resonance hardware. A custom 2 -axis gradient insert coil is designed and fabricated for the purpose of eddy current characterization. The construction tolerances were examined via bench top inductance measurements and eddy currents measurement inside a 7. 0 T head-only MR system. A great deal of freedom is available when positioning shielding coils with respect to their corresponding primary coils in small animal inserts before eddy currents become prohibitive for imaging. A new method for actively shielding electromagnets is presented. The minimum energy method for designing shielding coils of any geometry is developed and validated against historical methods. Several shielded gradient insert coils are designed, including a cylindrical gradient set with rectangular shields, which demonstrates the versatility of this new method. The performance of the shielded insert coils is reported. A high power custom shim insert coil is designed and optimized for dynamic shimming applications. This 10 -axis shim insert coil is designed to operate at currents higher than any previously existing <b>shim</b> <b>sets.</b> Several experimental fabrication methods are tested during the construction of the insert coil. Inductance, resistance and cooling measurements are conducted and compared to design specifications. Field measurements are taken using a 3 -axis field transducer and the shim efficiencies are calculated. Finally mutual inductance measurements are taken between strongly coupled axes to verify active shielding performance. Lastly, the minimum energy method for active shielding is applied to several MR fringe field type problems. Shields are designed to conform to rooms within an imaging facility for the purpose of controlling the magnetic footprint of an MR system. The MR room itself it designed to house an active shield, along with rooms adjacent to the MR room and a small equipment cabinet located inside the MR room is also fitted with a shield. The performance of the shields is calculated, and the feasibility of such shields is discussed...|$|R

50|$|The Stoner 63 has {{a unique}} {{buffering}} system contained within the bolt carrier. In front of the carrier cap are a steel <b>shim</b> and a <b>set</b> of 27 saucer-shaped Belleville washers oriented in opposing sets of three, which absorb energy from the piston stroke by deforming into a flat plate when the bolt carrier strikes the receiver’s end cap. When the plates return to their original shape they release a pulse of strain energy which propels the reciprocating parts forward in counter-recoil with a speed only slightly below that of the original recoil velocity. The plates will function without failure for between 40,000 and 50,000 rounds (depending upon the type of ammunition used and cyclic rates employed). This feature was designed to extend the weapon’s service life.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Applications {{of dynamic}} {{shimming}} require high field fidelity, and characterizing the shim field dynamics is therefore necessary. Modeling {{the system as}} linear and time-invariant, {{the purpose of this}} work was to measure the impulse response function with optimal sensitivity. Theory and Methods Frequency-swept pulses as inputs are analyzed theoretically, showing that the sweep speed is a key factor for the measurement sensitivity. By adjusting the sweep speed it is possible to achieve any prescribed noise profile in the measured system response. Impulse response functions were obtained for the third-order shim system of a 7 Tesla whole-body MR scanner. Measurements of the shim fields were done with a dynamic field camera, yielding also cross-term responses. Results The measured shim impulse response functions revealed system characteristics such as response bandwidth, eddy currents and specific resonances, possibly of mechanical origin. Field predictions based on the shim characterization were shown to agree well with directly measured fields, also in the cross-terms. Conclusion Frequency sweeps provide a flexible tool for shim or gradient system characterization. This may prove useful for applications involving dynamic shimming by yielding accurate estimates of the shim fields and a basis for <b>setting</b> <b>shim</b> pre-emphasis...|$|R
40|$|Adiabatic RF pulses {{are useful}} pulses for inhomogeneous B 1 fields caused by surface RF coils, however the {{increase}} in SAR will lengthen the TR, and possibly also the TE if the adiabatic pulses become too long. Using the superadiabaticity theorem {{the increase in}} SAR can already be reduced, {{making it possible to}} use an adiabatic TSE in humans at 7 T (chapter 2). However the length of the TR might still be too long to make the full adiabatic TSE clinically acceptable. On the other side, it is possible to design a 1 D or 2 D RF pulse which compensates the inhomogeneous B 1 field and create a uniform flip angle distribution. Using a TOFU pulse in combination with a breast surface coil (chapter 3), the simplicity lies in the already present gradient and due to the more efficient spin energy distribution, the RF pulse will become less SAR intensive and making it compete with the conventional sinc pulses. The TOFU pulse does require a slab selective 3 D sequence. Also, the direction of placing the slab selection has to align with the dominant inhomogeneous B 1 field. If the B 1 field of a coil is not dominantly inhomogeneous in one dimension, but in two dimensions, the TOFU pulse does not work anymore and other options should be considered. For compensating the radial inhomogeneous B 1 field of a monopole antenna, a 2 D RACE pulse is designed (chapter 4). The RF pulse works in the low flip angle regime and contains less SAR than adiabatic RF pulses. Therefore the 2 D RACE pulse might be the best choice for the extreme inhomogeneous B 1 field of the antenna. A comparison with conventional pulses have been shown in vivo in the human rectum. The duration of the 2 D RACE pulse is determined by the hardware limitations of the gradients. The slew-rate and the maximal strength are limited {{in the sense that the}} RF pulse itself had to be stretched in order to suffice the hardware limitations, which makes the 2 D RACE pulse relatively long. The endorectally inserted monopole antenna can boost the SNR substantially, not only for imaging the rectum, but also for MRI of the cervix (chapter 6). In this method the monopole is used as a receive-only coil. Combining the endorectal receiver with seven external dipole antennas on a multi-transmit platform, makes the setup capable of providing uniform excitations with high SNR. The local B 1 <b>shimming</b> by <b>setting</b> the amplitude and phase of the external elements independently, is a mechanism to obtain a homogeneous B 1 field in the cervix and its close surroundings. Using the monopole antenna to boost the SNR locally will give even more detailed information about the cervical structures. This setup makes it possible to image cervical cancer patients, which may, or may not, have parametrial invasion (cervical tumor growth in its surrounding connective tissue) in earlier stages. Detection of parametrial invasion may be used for further treatment planning (chapter 5) ...|$|R
