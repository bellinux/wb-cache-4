25|$|The {{line finder}} was also {{improved}} during the system's lifetime. Originally, the line finder frame had {{a capacity of}} 300 lines each, and used 15 brushes (vertical hunting segments) on each rod. This was intended to reduce hunting time as there were more brushes hunting over a shorter distance. As these line finders went into service, however, it became evident that 15 brushes on each vertical <b>selector</b> <b>rod</b> were quite heavy, and needed springs and pulleys {{at the top of}} the frame to compensate for their mass. Later line finders used 10 brushes and rearranged the layout to accommodate 400 lines per line finder frame. This increased capacity while eliminating the need for compensating equipment.|$|E
50|$|Mk.IV had {{the tail}} casing made by Hewland, with the <b>selector</b> <b>rod</b> {{located in the}} right side lower position, facing forward. This made the shifter linkage design easier {{on the part of}} chassis manufacturers. Together with its high torque version Mk.V, Mk.IV became a big seller, putting Hewland on a growing track.|$|E
5000|$|The 23B in 1963 had the {{original}} center gear shifter relocated {{to the right}} side of the driver, and the radiator and oil cooler were combined into a single unit, with the lower 1/5 or so acting as the oil cooler. The frame received additional structural tubes to take the torque of Lotus TwinCam-based 1.6 litre Cosworth Mk.XII and Mk.XIII, mated to [...] "high torque spec" [...] 5 speed Hewland Mk.V transaxle. Smaller displacement engines were mated to 5 speed Hewland Mk.IV. Both the Mk.IV and Mk.V transaxles had GKN (Ford Zephyr) differential gears and a forward-facing <b>selector</b> <b>rod</b> on the right side in a bespoke (Hewland made) tail casing.|$|E
50|$|Ball detents are {{commonly}} found in the selector mechanism of a gearbox, holding the <b>selector</b> <b>rods</b> in the correct position to engage the desired gear. Other applications include clutches that slip at a preset torque, and calibrated ball detent mechanisms are typically found in a torque wrench.|$|R
25|$|In November 2016, {{immediately}} after his maiden first-class double century against New South Wales and amidst {{the backdrop of}} Australia's disastrous home series loss against South Africa and the retirement of chairman of <b>selectors</b> <b>Rod</b> Marsh, Handscomb {{was one of several}} players brought into Australia's Test team ahead of the dead rubber third Test against South Africa. He made his Test debut on 24 November 2016, and was presented his baggy green cap by Chris Rogers.|$|R
50|$|Later, the {{manufacturer}} introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate {{models in the}} 1970s; the Citroën GS and CX models {{had the option of}} three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear <b>selector</b> <b>rods</b> and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a torque converter. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citroën semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire gear selecting operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.|$|R

5000|$|... 1990 was {{initially}} more promising as {{he switched to}} the Coloni team. The small Italian outfit had signed an exclusive deal with Subaru to use their new Carlo Chiti-designed and Motori Moderni-built 1235 flat-12 engine and Gachot was selected to drive the sole entry. However, the engine was overweight and underpowered, resulting in an ill-handling car that rarely ran {{for more than a}} few laps and Gachot didn't look like getting out of prequalifying. At the season opener in Phoenix, Gachot's gear <b>selector</b> <b>rod</b> broke on his first flying lap and he was unable to set a representative time. Subaru withdrew entirely after the British Grand Prix. After that the car ran with a Cosworth DFR engine and performances improved; the withdrawal of Onyx ironically promoted Gachot to the main qualifying sessions but the car still wasn't quick enough and he failed to make the grid all season.|$|E
50|$|Sequential manual {{transmissions}} work {{by providing}} the driver {{with the ability to}} select the gear directly before or after the gear currently engaged. Usually the shift lever is pulled back to select the adjacent higher gear and pushed forwards to select the adjacent lower gear. On a true sequential gearbox, the shift lever operates a ratchet mechanism that converts the fore & aft motion of the shift lever into a rotary motion. This rotary action turns a selector drum (sometimes called a barrel) which has three or four tracks machined around its circumference. Running in the tracks are the selector forks, either directly, or via <b>selector</b> <b>rods.</b> These tracks deviate around the circumference and as the drum rotates, the selector forks running in the tracks are moved to select the required gear. Only a true sequential transmission has a shift mechanism that operates in this way.|$|R
2500|$|Revertive pulsing is {{a method}} of {{signaling}} in which the terminating equipment sends pulses backwards to the originating equipment as it hunts for the appropriate terminal. This {{is in contrast to}} more modern forms of forward pulsing where the originating equipment will directly outpulse to the terminating side the information it needs to connect the call. In Panel offices, as the selectors were driven upwards by the motors, brushes attached to the vertical <b>selector</b> <b>rods</b> [...] wiped over commutators {{at the top of the}} frame. These commutators contained alternating segments which serve either as insulators or conductors. When the brush passed over a conductive segment, it was grounded, thereby generating a pulse which was sent back to the sender in the originating office for counting. When the sender counted the appropriate number of pulses, it cut the power to the solenoid in the terminating office, and caused the brush to stop at its current position.|$|R
2500|$|Following the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Campese {{was dropped}} from the Australian team for their first Bledisloe Cup Test match against New Zealand in Auckland. Following an injury to Australian fullback Matthew Burke in the first Bledisloe Cup Test of 1995 in Auckland, the Australian <b>selectors</b> picked <b>Rod</b> Kafer to take Burke's place in the Australian team. Kafer then {{suffered}} a broken leg during a training session. Campese was then recalled to a training session with the Wallabies, with the information that if Matthew Burke proved his fitness, he would not play in the second Bledisloe Cup Test. Burke recovered from his injury {{to play in the}} second Bledisloe Cup Test. However, another injury to Australian centre Daniel Herbert led to Campese's selection on the bench in the second Bledisloe Cup Test of 1995. In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese wrote that [...] "for some reason, I was meant to play that weekend against the All Blacks." ...|$|R
2500|$|While the Australian {{team for}} England was being selected, the South African Cricket Union (SACU) was {{arranging}} a [...] "rebel" [...] Australian team to tour South Africa. As {{a result of}} the apartheid policy of the white minority government, South Africa was cast out of the International Cricket Council and subjected to a boycott. With his old adversaries Greg Chappell as a national <b>selector</b> and <b>Rod</b> Marsh playing an analogous role for the Western Australian team, Hughes felt that his options in Australian cricket were limited and he chose to join the rebel team as the captain. Hughes {{was one of the last}} players to join the rebel team; indeed he found out that many of the rebel squad had signed up with the South Africans during the 1983 World Cup, when he was confirmed as captain. At a press conference after the announcement of the team, Hughes announced: [...] Hughes was heavily criticised for his decision. Desmond Tutu called him a hypocrite and Prime Minister Bob Hawke called him a comforter of racists. The criticism was hurtful to Hughes who, seemingly puzzled, remarked to friends [...] "People think I'm a racist." [...] In South Africa, even before his team arrived Hughes was [...] "a hero, larger than a Reagan... most exotic export since Breaker Morant." ...|$|R
