40|$|In {{this thesis}} report, both {{quantitative}} and qualitative approaches are used to provide a comprehensive analysis of lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries for {{plug-in hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) from technological and economical perspectives. Five key factors including power density, energy density, safety, durability, and cost are employed to compare four types of Li-ion batteries. Utility analysis indicates that all the Li-ion batteries are able to satisfy both power density and energy density targets, but only two of them are able to meet safety and durability requirements. Currently, the main challenge for their automotive application is cost reduction, since the cheapest LiFePO₄ battery costs $ 247. 8 /kWh which is 1. 65 times the cost target established by USABC. Economical values of PHEV and BEV are presented from an end user's point of view. Various sensitivity analysis have been used to identify the impact of key factors such as battery pack cost reduction, driving distance, gasoline price, and government <b>subsidizations</b> on cost effectiveness of PHEV and BEV. Results show that $ 4, 270 and $ 7, 726 of U. S. government <b>subsidizations</b> to an individual user are needed for PHEV and BEV to breakeven. Lastly, the lithium ion battery based electric vehicle systems have also been evaluated in the implementation models in Singapore.

40|$|Abstract：For a tolled highway where {{consecutive}} sections allow vehicles {{enter and}} exit unrestrictedly, we propose a simple toll pricing method. We {{show that the}} method is the unique method that satisfies the properties of Transit-proofness (No Merging or Splitting) and Cost Recovery. The Transit-proofness property rules out strategic response of road users against a toll pricing scheme while the Cost Recovery rules out cross <b>subsidizations</b> between road sections {{with regard to their}} costs. Furthermore, it is shown that the toll pricing method is the discrete version of Aumann-Shapley pricing rule. When there is unit traffic (vehicle) for each (feasible) pair of entrance and exit, we show that our toll pricing method is the Shapley value of an associated game to the problem. Moreover, if there is unit trac entering at each entrance but they all exit at the last exit, the toll pricing method coincides with the well-known airport landing fee solution-the Sequential Equal Contribution rule by Littlechild and Owen (1973) ...|$|R

Optimization of cervical cancer prevention programs requires anticipation {{of the degree to which}} the public will adhere to vaccination recommendations. To compare vaccination levels driven by public perceptions with levels that are optimal for maximizing the community's overall utility, we develop an epidemiological game-theoretic model of HPV vaccination. The model is parameterized with survey data on actual perceptions regarding cervical cancer, genital warts, and HPV vaccination collected from parents of vaccine-eligible children in the United States. The results suggest that perceptions of survey respondents generate vaccination levels far lower than those that maximize overall health-related utility for the population. Vaccination goals may be achieved by addressing concerns about vaccine risk, particularly those related to sexual activity among adolescent vaccine recipients.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} local {{policy implementation}} of Cleaner Production (CP) in China. As the major policy implementer, China’s local government plays {{a crucial role}} in promoting CP. A better understanding of the factors affecting local government’s incentives regarding CP and different strategies available to the local government can help policy makers and implementers improve CP practices and other environmental policy outcomes. This paper uses the cases of Hangzhou and Guiyang to demonstrate that local conditions of policy implementation have a direct impact on the success of CP promotion. Based on 35 in-depth interviews, statistical data and internal government reports, we find that the location-based incentives of local government strongly influence their implementation strategies; and that the choices of different strategies can bring out various policy results. From this study, the identified location-based incentives are affected by energy resource endowment, economic development stage and technological competence. The successful implementation strategies involve using different policy instruments synthetically, regulating CP service organizations by controlling their qualifications, differentiating CP <b>subsidizations,</b> and improving transparency of project progress and outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Non-sustainable {{transportation}} {{is a great}} part of the stress that human activities put on the environment. Road transportation constituted 74 % of the total inland tonne-kilometres in the EU during 2009, to be compared to rail transportation at 15 %. In Sweden the numbers are slightly more in favour of rail transportation, but still a small share {{despite the fact that the}} European Committee promotes sustainable modes of transport. To reduce the environmental impact from the transport sector, and be able to promote the use of sustainable transport modes, it is important to gain an understanding of why the modal balance is disposed this way. By case studies and a survey, four factors, viz costs, environmental impact, attitudes and risks, and their impact on the choice of mode of transportation for companies located in the vicinity of a rail terminal are studied. The results clearly show that the environmental impact of rail {{transportation is}} only a fraction of that of the road transportation and could possibly influence the choice of rail transportation in a positive way. However, rail transportation is less cost efficient, flexible and reliable and these aspects – despite the advantageous conditions in terms of infrastructure and geographical vicinity to a rail terminal – contribute to a negative bias towards rail transportation among companies in the study. Thus, the cost and attitudes factors counteract the choice of rail transportation. In addition, risks, as the final factor, also counteracts the choice, since it is found that respondents consider the risks of disturbances such as delays, theft and accidents to be important when considering mode of transportation and that rail transportation is viewed as lacking compared to road transportation. This thesis contributes to the existing theory about the costs-related issues and the environmental impact of rail transportation, as well as how companies with beneficial conditions to employ rail transportation consider the mode with regards to e. g. reliability and safety, and how these factors influence the modal choice among buyers of transportation services that are located close to a rail terminal. With this knowledge, policymakers are informed of which areas to concentrate taxes, <b>subsidizations</b> and information to. These things are in all probability necessary if a large scale modal shift is desired. The contribution of the effect a modal shift could have on the environmental impact of the transportation might make certain practitioners that compete on a market where a low environmental footprint is a strong competitive weapon to rethink their modal choice.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P COMP 2016 Zhangxvi, 115 pages :color illustrationsAs the {{popularity}} of smart mobile devices, together with bandwidth-intensive applications, the data traffic for wireless data networks has grown tremendously {{in the past few}} years. This poses challenges for the network operators to improve or even maintain network quality of the system. People are concerned whether such demand increase can be fulfilled by simple infrastructure expansion. On the other hand, it also brings huge financial burden to the Internet service providers (ISPs) since supporting such demand-supply gap requires large investments. The pricing of data traffic and other services is central to the core challenges of network management, growth sustainability and monetization supports. The smart data pricing has great potential to tackle the issue of surging demand for network operators and may also bring great benefit to consumers, Internet service providers, and content providers. In this thesis, we analyze the two main pricing proposals in smart data pricing, i. e., time dependent pricing (short for TDP) and sponsored data plan (short for SDP). We try to understand the rationale behind the two pricing models, as well as their impacts to the wireless data market, in particular, who will benefit and who will be hurt from these schemes. We also propose and analyze a new pricing proposal, time dependent sponsoring (short for TDS), that combines the advantages of TDP and SDP. First, we focus on the time dependent pricing, which is a promising pricing method to relieve the congestion caused by the surging traffic demand. TDP captures the time-variation characteristic of demand by charging users dynamically over time and has the potential to even out time-of-the-day fluctuations in bandwidth consumption. We explore the design space of TDP. In particular, we focus on a number of schemes, e. g., the usage-based scheme, the flat-rate scheme, and a mixture of them which called a cap scheme. Our main findings include: 1) the ISP obtains a higher profit with usage-based (or flat-rate) scheme if the capacity is insufficient (or sufficient); 2) the usage-based scheme usually achieves a higher consumer surplus and more efficient traffic utilization than the flat-rate scheme; and 3) the cap scheme is strongly preferred by the ISP to further increase its revenue. Second, we analyze the sponsored data plan, a recent pricing proposal, i. e., when accessing contents from a particular content provider (short for CP), end users do not need to pay for that volume of traffic consumed, but the CP will sponsor for this data consumption. We build a two-class service model to analyze the consumers' traffic demand under the sponsored data plan with consideration of QoS. We use a two-stage Stackelberg game to characterize the interaction between CPs and the ISP and reveal a number of important findings. Our conclusions are: 1) When the ISP's capacity is sufficient, the sponsored data plan benefits consumers and CPs in the short run, but the ISP does not have incentives to further improve its service in the long run. 2) When ISP's capacity is insufficient,the ISP and end users may achieve a win-win trade, while the ISP and CPs always compete for the revenue. 3) The sponsored data plan may enlarge the unbalance in revenue distribution between different CPs; CPs with higher unit income and poorer technology support are more likely to prefer the sponsored data plan. Third, we propose and study one new smart data pricing scheme, time dependent sponsoring, i. e.,content providers can decide when and how much to sponsor their traffic. The main novelty of TDS is its potential to improve Internet resource utilization by migrating data traffic from peak times to valley times. We formulate a Stackelberg game model to study the interactions between the ISP, CPs and users, and derive the optimal sponsoring fractions over different times under TDS. In particular, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm to solve a non-convex optimization in sponsoring decisions. We find that: 1) TDS improves the CPs' bandwidth utilization,CPs' profit and consumers' welfare for slightly patient strategic users; but may result in controversial effects for highly patient strategic users, and 2) when CPs provide different <b>subsidizations</b> to different groups, the bandwidth usage can be improved significantly and so are CPs' profit and consumers' welfare, and 3) well designed TDS reduces the waste of capacity and thus improves social welfare and ISP's profit, compared with TDP.

[...] "Do your damnedest," [...] he told them. [...] "Burning Daylight's bucked bigger things than your dirty, lying sheets. And I don't blame you, boys... that is, not much. You can't help it. You've got to live. There's a mighty lot of women in this world that make their living in similar fashion to yours, because they're not able to do anything better. Somebody's got to do the dirty work, and {{it might as well be}} you. You're paid for it, and you ain't got the backbone to rustle cleaner jobs." ...|$|E
