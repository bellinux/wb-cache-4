40|$|International audienceSplash is an {{important}} process in interrill erosion because it produces movement of soil fragments. However, this process is technically difficult to measure and {{little is known about}} its size selectivity. In this study, a <b>splash</b> <b>ring</b> device was used to characterise the spatial variation of the quantity and the aggregate size distribution of splashed soil fragments. Soil aggregates were placed at the centre of an experimental device subjected to a 29 mm h− 1 simulated rainfall with a kinetic energy of 17 J mm− 1. Splashed soil fragments were collected in concentric rings and analysed for masses and fragment size distributions. Four different soils, with various textures, were tested. Soils fragments were splashed across the whole splash device up to 45 cm from the source, and the quantity of splashed fragments decreased exponentially with the distance. For the four tested soils, the splash parameters were significantly correlated to the results of aggregate stability measurements with r=− 0. 96 and r= 0. 95, respectively, for the total splashed mass and the mean weight diameter (MWD) of the whole splashed fragments. The measurement of the splashed fragment size distributions showed that fragments up to 2000 μm were transported by raindrop impacts. The mass percentage of the coarsest fractions of splashed soil fragments exponentially decreased with the distance from the source. The extent of this decrease depends on the soil type. The size distributions of splashed soil fragments were compared with those of soil fragments produced by breakdown. Comparison of splash data to aggregate breakdown data showed an enrichment of the 200 – 1000 μm size fraction in the splashed fragments.

40|$|Abstract: A cave ring is a faint speleothem {{consisting}} {{in a thin}} {{circle on}} the floor symmetrically surrounding a water drop impact point. Two different mechanisms seem {{to be responsible for}} cave ring formation: the drop splash at the floor, for the <b>splash</b> <b>rings,</b> and the ejection of a secondary droplet during the fall, for the fall down rings. A systematic investigation of 67 speleothem rings discovered in five different caves in central Italy was conducted. The data show compatibility with a common nature for all the observed rings. For the observed rings, the hypothesis of a falling secondary droplet origin is confirmed and the hypothesis of a primary drop splash is rejected. The trajectory of a secondary droplet has been measured, and the collected data suggest that the secondary droplets originate from a primary drop breakup at a distance y 0 5 142. 7 6 7. 2 cm from the stalactite tip. Assuming this spontaneous breakup hypothesis, the velocities ratio b 5 uy/ux 5 25. 5 6 1. 6 at the breakup time was measured. Finally, the collected ring data (5 -cm- to 50 -cm-diameter range) exhibit a negative curva-ture trajectory. The large departure from a gravity dominant parabolic trajectory suggests other forces, such as air friction or lift force, are at work on the small secondary droplets...|$|R
60|$|On {{a sudden}} he heard above the soft roar of the {{waterfall}} an unusual sound {{that he could not}} define. He dropped flat behind a stone and listened. From the direction he had come swelled something that resembled a strange muffled pounding and <b>splashing</b> and <b>ringing.</b> Despite his nerve the chill sweat began to dampen his forehead. What might not be possible in this stonewalled maze of mystery? The unnatural sound passed beyond him as he lay gripping his rifle and fighting for coolness. Then from the open came the sound, now distinct and different. Venters recognized a hobble-bell of a horse, and the cracking of iron on submerged stones, and the hollow splash of hoofs in water.|$|R
5000|$|A suikinkutsu (literally [...] "water koto cave") {{is a type}} of Japanese garden {{ornament}} {{and music}} device. It consists of an upside down buried pot with a hole at the top. Water drips through the hole at the top onto a small pool of water inside of the pot, creating a pleasant <b>splashing</b> sound that <b>rings</b> inside of the pot similar to a bell or a Japanese zither called koto. It is usually built next to a traditional Japanese stone basin called chōzubachi, part of a tsukubai for washing hands before the Japanese tea ceremony.|$|R
5000|$|The mysterious dark [...] "orthicon halo" [...] around bright {{objects in}} an IO-captured image {{is based on}} the fact that the IO relies on the {{emission}} of photoelectrons, but very bright illumination can produce more of them locally than the device can successfully deal with. At a very bright point on a captured image, a great preponderance of electrons is ejected from the photosensitive plate. So many may be ejected that the corresponding point on the collection mesh can no longer soak them up, and thus they fall back to nearby spots on the target instead, much as water <b>splashes</b> in a <b>ring</b> when a rock is thrown into it. Since the resultant splashed electrons do not contain sufficient energy to eject further electrons where they land, they will instead neutralize any positive charge that has been built-up in that region. Since darker images produce less positive charge on the target, the excess electrons deposited by the splash will be read as a dark region by the scanning electron beam.|$|R
50|$|In {{the main}} event, Kevin Owens defended the WWE Universal Championship against United States Champion Roman Reigns. During the match, Owens {{performed}} two Frog Splashes off the barricade on Reigns, {{with the second}} one through the German broadcast table. Owens performed another Frog <b>Splash</b> in the <b>ring</b> for a near-fall. Reigns attempted a Spear but Owens countered and rolled-up Reigns for a near-fall. Owens performed a Pop Up Powerbomb on Reigns but Reigns placed {{his foot on the}} bottom rope, voiding the pinfall. In the end, Owens attempted to attack Reigns with the title belt but Reigns executed a Spear on Owens. Chris Jericho then came out and attacked Owens with a Codebreaker, meaning Owens won by disqualification and retained the title. Jericho handed a shocked Owens the title belt and congratulated him, revealing that it was his plan to ensure that Owens won. As Owens and Jericho attempted to leave, Seth Rollins appeared and blocked their way. Reigns then attacked Owens with a Spear and Rollins executed a Pedigree on Jericho. Reigns and Rollins then performed Double Powerbombs on both Jericho and Owens through announce tables to end the show.|$|R
5|$|The tournament final between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe {{took place}} on August14 at Sacrifice. As Styles laid against the ring ropes at the {{beginning}} of the match, Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face, causing him to fly out of the ring and crash down on the floor. Joe followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in the face with his forearm as Styles reached his feet. Joe later held Styles in an STF submission hold, which he was forced to release when Styles touched the bottom rope. Styles then gained the advantage with a dropkick and front-flip <b>splash</b> from the <b>ring</b> ropes. He held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb, or what he calls a Rack Bomb. During the move, referee Andrew Thomas was kicked in the face and knocked unconscious, allowing Daniels to interfere in the contest. Daniels attacked Styles and attempted to hit Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring. Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his Muscle Buster maneuver, then placing Styles in his Coquina Clutch submission hold. Styles submitted to the move as the referee came to, giving the victory to Joe. The final bout lasted 15 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|R
