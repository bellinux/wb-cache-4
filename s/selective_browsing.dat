50|$|Diplodocoidea is a {{superfamily}} of sauropod dinosaurs, {{which included}} {{some of the}} longest animals of all time, including slender giants like Supersaurus, Diplodocus, Apatosaurus, and Amphicoelias. Most had very long necks and long, whip-like tails; however, one family (the dicraeosaurids) are the only known sauropods to have re-evolved a short neck, presumably an adaptation for feeding low to the ground. This adaptation {{was taken to the}} extreme in the highly specialized sauropod Brachytrachelopan. A study of snout shape and dental microwear in diplodocoids showed that the square snouts, large proportion of pits, and fine subparallel scratches in Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Nigersaurus, and Rebbachisaurus suggest ground-height nonselective browsing; the narrow snouts of Dicraeosaurus, Suuwassea, and Tornieria and the coarse scratches and gouges on the teeth of Dicraeosaurus suggest mid-height <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> in those taxa. This taxon is also noteworthy because diplodocoid sauropods had the highest tooth replacement rates of any vertebrates, as exemplified by Nigersaurus, which had new teeth erupting every 30 days.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{gigantic}} herbivores, sauropod dinosaurs {{were among}} the most important members of Mesozoic communities. Understanding their ecology is fundamental to developing a complete picture of Jurassic and Cretaceous food webs. One group of sauropods in particular, Diplodocoidea, has long been a source of debate with regard to what and how they ate. Because of their long lineage duration (Late Jurassic-Late Cretaceous) and cosmopolitan distribution, diplodocoids formed important parts of multiple ecosystems. Additionally, fortuitous preservation of a large proportion of cranial elements makes them an ideal clade in which to examine feeding behavior. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Hypotheses of various browsing behaviors (selective and nonselective browsing at ground-height, mid-height, or in the upper canopy) were examined using snout shape (square vs. round) and dental microwear. The square snouts, large proportion of pits, and fine subparallel scratches in Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Nigersaurus, and Rebbachisaurus suggest ground-height nonselective browsing; the narrow snouts of Dicraeosaurus, Suuwassea, and Tornieria and the coarse scratches and gouges on the teeth of Dicraeosaurus suggest mid-height <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> in those taxa. Comparison with outgroups (Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus) reinforces the inferences of ground- and mid-height browsing and the existence of both non-selective and <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> behaviors in diplodocoids. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results reaffirm previous work suggesting the presence of diverse feeding strategies in sauropods and provide solid evidence for two different feeding behaviors in Diplodocoidea. These feeding behaviors can subsequently be tied to paleoecology, such that non-selective, ground-height behaviors are restricted to open, savanna-type environments. <b>Selective</b> <b>browsing</b> behaviors are known from multiple sauropod clades and were practiced in multiple environments...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{densities of}} white-tailed deer (WTD) populations lead to {{alterations}} in forest structure, forest regeneration dynamics, and plant morphology from <b>selective</b> <b>browse.</b> Forests in urbanized landscapes, {{otherwise known as}} urban-wildland interfaces (UWI), are not only affected by WTD browse, but are connected with the human health risks that WTD present such as being a vector for disease or deer-car collisions. Limited resources of forest managers in UWIs cause the primary methods of WTD management to be increasing alternative forage and implementing deer culling programs. The Duke Forest currently implements a WTD culling program, but {{research has shown that}} this method, alone, will only suppress the population for a limited time.

We assumed that the shift in plant species composition was modified by <b>selective</b> ungulate <b>browsing.</b> Thus, we investigated which woody species are selected by browsing game. We have collected data on the species composition of the understory and the browsing impact on it in five different Hungarian even-aged forests between 2003 and 2005. Based on these investigations the non-native Robinia pseudoacacialiving under more favourable climatic conditions was generally preferred (Jacobs’ selectivity index: D= 0. 04 ± 0. 77), while the nativeFagus sylvatica and Quercus spp. (Q. petraea, Q. robur), both more vulnerable to increasing aridity, were avoided (D=- 0. 37 ± 0. 11;- 0. 79 ± 0. 56;- 0. 9 ± 0. 16; respectively) among target tree species. However, economically less or not relevant species, e. g. elderberry (Sambucus spp.), blackberry (Rubus spp.) or common dogwood (Cornus sanguinea) were the most preferred species (D= 0. 01 ± 0. 71; - 0. 12 ± 0. 58; - 0. 2 ± 0. 78, respectively). Our results imply that biodiversity conservation, i. e. maintaining or establishing a multi-species understory layer, can be a good solution to reduce the additional negative game impact on native target tree species suffering from drought. Due to preference for Robinia pseudoacaciaselective browsing can decelerate the penetration of this species into native forest habitats.

40|$|Abstract: We are {{developing}} a new mashup framework for creating flexible applications in which users can selectively browse through mashup items. The framework provides GUI components called widgets through which users can browse mashed-up data selectively, and the system processes demand-driven creation of mashed-up data upon receiving access requests through widgets. The application developer has to only prepare a configuration file that specifies how to combine web services and how to display mashed-up data. This paper proposes a revised widget model for effective data display, and introduces practical applications that allow <b>selective</b> <b>browsing.</b> The revision of the widget model is to accept various GUI components, process user interactions, and provide cooperative widgets. To avoid conflict with lazy data creation, we introduce properties into widgets that are automatically maintained by the system and can be monitored by other widgets. The case study through the applications shows the situations where the initially browsed data helps users to terminate redundant searches, set effective filter settings, or change {{the importance of the}} criteria.

40|$|Introduced herbivores {{frequently}} inflict significant, yet patchy {{damage on}} native ecosystems through <b>selective</b> <b>browsing.</b> However, {{there are few}} instances where the underlying cause of this patchy damage has been revealed. We aimed {{to determine if the}} nutritional quality of foliage could predict the browsing preferences of an invasive mammalian herbivore, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), in a temperate forest in New Zealand. We quantified the spatial and temporal variation in four key aspects of the foliar chemistry (total nitrogen, available nitrogen, in vitro dry matter digestibility and tannin effect) of 275 trees representing five native tree species. Simultaneously, we assessed the severity of browsing damage caused by possums on those trees in order to relate <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> to foliar nutritional quality. We found significant spatial and temporal variation in nutritional quality among individuals of each tree species examined, as well as among tree species. There was a positive relationship between the available nitrogen concentration of foliage (a measure of in vitro digestible protein) and the severity of damage caused by browsing by possums. This study highlights the importance of nutritional quality, specifically, the foliar available nitrogen concentration of individual trees, in predicting the impact of an invasive mammal. Revealing the underlying cause of patchy browsing by an invasive mammal provides new insights for conservation of native forests and targeted control of invasive herbivores in forest ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Traditional clearcutting system {{homogenise}} forest habitats (one tree species, one age class, understory destroyed), {{which will}} {{be more sensitive to}} other human and natural impacts, such as the effect of large herbivores. Since forest game damage is a very important problem in Hungary, we hypothesised that the main target tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp. and Robinia pseudoacacia) are strongly preferred as browsed forage. Therefore, our study question was which woody species are selected by game browsing: 1. native (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp.) or non-native target tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia) 2. other economically non or less relevant woody species. We have collected data on the species composition of the understory and the browsing impact on it in five different Hungarian even-aged forests between 2003 and 2005. Based on these investigations the non-native Robinia pseudoacacia was generally preferred (Jacobs’ selectivity index: D= 0, 04 ± 0, 77), meanwhile the native Fagus sylvatica and Quercus spp. (Q. cerris, Q. petraea, Q. robur) were avoided (D= - 0, 37 ± 0, 11; - 0, 33 ± 0, 85; - 0, 79 ± 0, 56; - 0, 9 ± 0, 16; respectively) among target tree species. However, economically less or not relevant species, e. g. elderberry (Sambucus spp.), blackberry (Rubus spp.) or common dogwood (Cornus sanguinea) were the most preferred ones (D= 0, 01 ± 0, 71; - 0, 12 ± 0, 58; - 0, 2 ± 0, 78, respectively). Our results clearly show that biodiversity conservation i. e. maintaining or establishing a multi-species understory layer can be a good solution to diminish the negative game impact on native target tree species.

40|$|Diplodocoid sauropods {{were among}} the most {{successful}} and largest herbivores of the Mesozoic. Here, the systematics and paleoecology of these animals are examined in five parts: a reassessment of the relationships of Australodocus, a phylogenetic analysis of the clade Diplodocoidea, an investigation of feeding behavior in diplodocoid sauropods, an examination of ontogenetic variation in the skull of Diplodocus, and a study of the evolution of tooth shape and replacement rate in Sauropodomorpha. 	Australodocus, previously considered to be a diplodocid, is re-evaluated. Characters previously considered synapomorphies with Diplodocidae are revealed to be either misinterpreted or more widely distributed within Neosauropoda. Six unambiguous synapomorphies, including pneumatization of the centrum and neural arch, suggest titanosauriform affinities for the taxon instead. 	A phylogenetic analysis confirms the assessment from the previous chapter, and also identifies several key relationships for the understanding of diplodocoid evolution. The first of these is the resolution of the plesiomorphic taxon Suuwassea as a basal dicraeosaurid. Also presented is a fully-resolved Rebbachisauridae, with two sub-clades recovered (Limaysaurinae, Nigersaurinae). 	This hypothesis of relatedness was used as a backbone to examine the evolution of feeding strategies in the clade. Some taxa (Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Nigersaurus) were discovered to have squarer snouts and microwear features more consistent with ground-height nonselective browsing (e. g. subparallel fine scratches and small, round pits) than others (Dicraeosaurus, Suuwassea, Tornieria). The microwear features present on the round-snouted taxa—coarser scratches with no preferred directional orientation and large gouges— suggest <b>selective</b> mid-height <b>browsing</b> behavior instead. 	Ontogenetic shape variation in {{at least one of the}} ground-height nonselective browsers (Diplodocus) suggests the possibility of ontogenetic variation in feeding strategy as well, where subadults may have fed selectively. 	 	Although Diplodocoidea is diagnosed in part by narrow-crowned teeth, the inference of at least two distinct feeding strategies for this clade suggests that it is unlikely that the development of narrow crowns in this clade was an adaptation for a particular feeding mode. Histological and proportional data suggest instead that the development of narrow crowns in this clade (and elsewhere) was an adaptation for rapid tooth replacement...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} supply {{eucalypt}} pulpwood to an expanding woodchip industry the silvicultural management practice of clearfelling followed by slash-burning was {{adopted in the}} dry eucalypt forests on dolerite in southeastern Tasmania. To provide data on the vegetation and fuel dynamics following dry forest utilisation, a study area with comparable sites that were (a) unlogged, (b) clearfelled, (c) clearfelled and slash-burned, was monitored over a 24 month period. Detailed records were made of plant species composition and cover on floristically similar permanent plots {{on each of these}} sites. Fuel levels, fuel structure and fuel composition were measured at the study area, and at other East Coast sites of varying ages since slash-burning. A monthly bird census was conducted in the main experimental area to establish the inter-relationships of the avifauna with particular plant species and habitats. Following clearfelling there was found to be marked variation in the growth response of plant species, due to environmental situation, degree of disturbance, and intensity of slash-burn. Moreover, the effect of these factors on individual species was greatly influenced by <b>selective</b> grazing and <b>browsing,</b> predominantly by native fauna. The combination of burning and predation tended to favour unpalatable species which recovered rapidly by vegetative means. The succession of plant species following fire in dry forest communities most closely approximated the initial floristic composition model. Most of the plant species recovered rapidly with a progressive increase in species richness {{for at least two years}} after disturbance. Slash-burning was found to reduce the levels of fine fuel (2. 0 cm in diameter or thickness) left as a result of clearfelling, but the practice was ineffective in reducing the volume of coarse fuel (2. 0 cm in diameter or thickness). However, over time, this relative reduction of fine fuel was only persistent in the compacted ground fuel layer, as the regenerating stand rapidly recovered the above-ground, vertical fine fuel structure. Experiments were conducted on various dry forest and wet forest plant species and fuel components, in order to establish their energy content and relative flammability. It was found that eucalypt dry forest species and fuel components had the highest energy content and the greatest tendency to propagate fire, whereas species from wet forest and Casuarina dry forest communities propagated fire less readily. Species from dry habitats had, in general, low ash contents, high energy levels, high volatile oil contents and low moisture contents. Wet habitat species had high percentages of moisture and ash. As a result, general support could be given to the hypothesis that natural selection has favoured flammable characteristics in fire-dependent plant communities. The gains from the retention of natural eucalypt regeneration after clearfelling (i. e. forest management in the absence of hot, slash-burns) may generally offset the short-term advantage of reduced fire hazard which results from slash-burning...|$|R

Leaf specific gravity, nitrogen, and phosphorous levels in field-collected foliage varied between palatable and apparently unpalatable provenances of fuchsia. However, these variables, and palatability to captive possums, {{were similar in}} propagated material from all provenances. To test the hypothesis that <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> had eliminated the more palatable or susceptible genotypes at sites where possums have been present for long periods, we tested the relationship between variation within provenances of measured variables and length of possum occupation at each site, but no significant relationships were found.

40|$|Using a new browse-monitoring technique, {{short-term}} {{changes in}} the winter foraging behaviour of yarded northern white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were followed over 3 winters. Hypotheses about <b>selective</b> <b>browsing,</b> shifts in foraging strategy, food patch selection, diet quality, and foraging effort were derived from optimal foraging theory. Testing of associated predictions disclosed that deer expanded their diets {{over the course of}} the yarding season, showed shifts in proportional representation of browse species in their diet, and exhibited distinct but changing preferences for certain browse types. Partial preferences in diet choices occurred, but important diet items were used in nonrandom runs once adopted into the diet. Cornus stolonifera was the dominant browse species in the diet based on construction of a functional response curve, with the use of other species influenced by C. stolonifera depletion. Deer took a greater number of twigs from denser browse plots, and made more browsing visits to dense plots over the yarding season. Browsed plots tended to be higher in total twig availability and C. stolonifera availability than unbrowsed plots for the first half of the yarding season only. Diameter at point of browsing (DPB) values increased over the season for C. stolonifera and Salix. Results indicate that winter deer foraging is a dynamic process, with high diet selectivity at the beginning of the yarding season, and gradual diet generalization in the face of overall browse depletion...|$|E

Beginning in 1981, introduced ungulates were reduced in number to allow regeneration of Sophora chrysophylla (mamane) in habitat supporting the endangered Hawaiian finch, Loxioides bailleui (palila). We found Sophora regeneration at all four study sites, but regeneration was higher in mixed species woodland with codominant Myoporum sandwicense (naio) than in areas where Sophora dominated. Regeneration of Myoporum was uniformly very low in comparison. Invasive grass cover, which suppresses Sophora germination, was highest in mid-elevation woodland where Sophora dominated. The distribution of mature and sapling Sophora were both related to study site, reflecting previous ungulate browsing and uneven recovery due to grasses. Densities of Sophora snags were not different among any of the sites, suggesting a more even distribution in the past. <b>Selective</b> <b>browsing</b> before ungulate reduction may have favored Myoporum over Sophora, leading to high densities of mature Myoporum in codominant woodland.

On the island of Newfoundland, moose (Alces alces) have become overabundant since their introduction in early 1900 ’s. Intensive <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> by moose on foundation species such as balsam fir (Abies balsamea) interacts with natural insect disturbance and limits advanced regeneration, creating moose meadows. In this thesis, I focused on where and how active restoration should be implemented in Terra Nova National Park (Newfoundland, Canada) balsam fir forests {{within the context of}} the natural disturbance regime under conditions of overbrowsing. Environmental surveys and experimental seedling planting were carried out along a disturbance gradient from closed canopy forest to large insect-disturbed stands. To develop cost-effective and science-based planting protocols, several ground treatments were tested to enhance seedlings success: (1) control, field planting, (2) removal of the aboveground vegetation and (3) ground scarification. Results indicate that (1) priority for restoration should be given to insectdisturbed areas > 5 ha rather than smaller gaps, and (2) that active restoration should be implemented following scientifically determined field planting protocols, as no substantial benefit was detected following ground treatment. The recommendations arising for this thesis allow for the development of efficient and effective protocols towards the reestablishment of multi-aged balsam fir forests in Newfoundland...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand has a {{multiplicity}} of challenging animal-control problems, {{and all of them}} concern animals which man has intentionally introduced either for sport, food or fur. Since the beginning of European settlement in the 19 th Century, approximately 53 species of mammals and 125 species of birds have been deliberately or accidentally introduced into New Zealand, and 34 birds and 31 mammals have become established (Wodzicki, 1950). The principal reasons the exotic big game animals (Riney, 1955), fur bearers and feral domestic livestock have been so destructive to certain habitats in New Zealand are because 1) some of the soils are highly susceptible to erosion, 2) the mountainous country often gets high intensity torrential rainfall, and 3) many of the endemic plants have little innate resistance to the heavy selective grazing or browsing pressure. The bulk of New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s vegetation is composed of indigenous species. This unique flora must have evolved without the presence of browsing or grazing mammals, for New Zealand has no fossil or native land mammals, except two species of bats and a rat that was liberated a few centuries ago by the Polynesians. Consequently, natural selection did not have an opportunity to eliminate the highly palatable and non-browse-resistant plants in favor of those which were either browse-resistant or unpalatable to browsing mammals. As a result, some of the highly palatable indigenous vegetation in New Zealand is unable to withstand the heavy <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> and grazing pressure inflicted by the introduced mammals (Holloway, 1950, Howard MSa and MSb, Kean and Pracy, 1949, McKelvey, 1959, Riney et al., 1959, Wardle, 1961) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTree growth {{models are}} {{supposed}} to contain stand growth laws as so called “emergent properties” which derive from interactions of individual-tree growth and mortality functions. This study investigates whether the evolving tree species composition {{in a long term}} simulation by the distance-independent tree growth model PrognAus matches the species composition of the potential natural vegetation type which is expected to occur if one refrains from further management interventions and major disturbances, climate change, and changes in site conditions can be excluded. For this purpose the development of 6933 sample plots of the Austrian National Forest Inventory was predicted for 2500 years. The resulting species proportions, derived from volume per hectare of 15 tree species or species groups, were used to classify every sample plot according to potential natural forest types, following a classification scheme based on expert knowledge. These simulated potential natural vegetation types were compared with expert reconstructions of the sample plots of the Austrian National Forest Inventory. A total of 5789 plots were actually classified with the scheme; in 33 % of the cases the classification {{on the basis of the}} PrognAus-simulations was identical with the classification by the Austrian National Forest Inventory. A predominantly correct classification was achieved for the subalpine Picea abies-type and the Fagus sylvatica-type although PrognAus showed a tendency to overestimate the proportion of F. sylvatica and P. abies. Weaknesses in the ability to simulate forest types dominated by Quercus spp., Acer spp., and Pinus sylvestris were identified. This shortcoming might be caused by the mortality model which allows a larger diameter at breast height for F. sylvatica or by the ingrowth model whose terms for the consideration of inter-specific competition may lead to a disadvantage of Quercus spp., P. sylvestris, and Abies alba.

40|$|I {{investigated}} landscape scale {{processes and}} {{factors that influence}} moose (Alces americanus syn. Alces alces) browsing and density in Newfoundland, Canada. I tested whether moose density and management designation were related to browsing patterns on the landscape, and if browsing {{has the potential to}} change forest regeneration. I quantified landscape composition and configuration in areas of different moose density (low vs. high). [...] Moose browsing was quantified using vegetation indices in areas of different moose density (low vs. high) and management designation (crown land vs. National parks). Landscape scale processes and factors (management designation, moose density, forage species, and sapling height) were incorporated into linear regression models to explain browsing patterns, and compared using the information theoretic approach. At a broader scale, landscape scale processes and factors (hunter access, success, forest cuts, and natural disturbances) as well as landscape composition and configuration were mapped and categorized using a GIS. Landscape processes and factors were included into regression models to explain moose density and compared using the information theoretic approach. Results indicate that forest regeneration was altered through <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> but did not differ according to moose density or management designation. Further, moose density did differ with landscape composition and configuration. There was high variance observed in moose browsing in relation to forest regeneration not explained by either moose density or management designation. Because of a sustained high moose density across Newfoundland, the current vegetation may be reflecting the legacy of previously high impact periods of moose browsing. My research supports previous findings that moose browsing and density are regulated by a complex interaction of landscape scale processes and factors. An understanding of the role of these landscape scale processes and factors can help guide the management of non-native overabundant moose populations in a nearly predation free ecosystem. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAs {{a result}} of diverse {{management}} policies, densities of red and roe deer have varied considerably {{for the last few}} decades in Europe. Their <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> on woody species can modify the interactions between competing species and thus change overall patterns of plant diversity in forests. However, no classification of woody species according to browsing by deer yet exists in Europe. The selectivity index, which measures the balance between availability and consumption of plant species by herbivores, could be used for such a classification. The aim of this study was, first, to rank woody species according to this selectivity index, then to test whether their rank changed when browsing pressure varied in space or time. We also explored morphological and ecological life traits (Ellenberg indicator values) that might explain differences in selectivity. In 2006, we re-sampled a network of 217 coupled floristic and browsing survey plots, which had been previously described twice (1976, 1981). The plots were located in the forest of Arc-en-Barrois (France), a large woodland area divided into a North and a South Forest which have had different histories of browsing pressure. For the three samples and the two forests, we calculated a selectivity index for 19 woody species. Dogwood (Cornus sp.) and field rose (Rosa arvensis) appeared to be the most selected species whereas beech (Fagus sylvatica), common mezereon (Daphne mezereum) and wild-service tree (Sorbus torminalis) were always avoided. The rank order of species according to their selectivity index remained stable over the three sample years and between the two forests (Spearman's rank correlations: r 0. 8 spatially, and range from 0. 3 to 0. 8 temporally). This indicates that variations in browsing pressure did not strongly modify deer selectivity patterns. Selectivity was positively correlated with wood density and negatively correlated with maximum height of the species, but unrelated to other plant traits. Finally, selectivity can be seen as an intrinsic characteristic of those woody species, and could be used as an additional life trait when analyzing vegetation communities...|$|E
40|$|Ungulate {{browsing}} and its ecological effects at plant, population, community, {{and ecosystem}} levels were {{addressed in a}} eutrophic southern African savanna. This was to test predictions of prevailing hypotheses, {{which are based on}} research in boreal and temperate forests. Changes in plant morpho-functional traits and population structure of a staple palatable species, Acacia nigrescens Miller were addressed over a two-year survey among vegetation stands with very different histories of attack from herbivores. Moreover browser-induced effects on functional composition of a woody plant community were addressed along a strong browsing gradient. Nutrient cycling was investigated through measurements of leaf litter decomposition rates, as well as soil and leaf chemistry analyses. Finally, a modelling approach was used to make predictions on plant productivity and changes in soil nutrient availability under ungulate browsing according to opposite plant defensive traits (i. e. tolerance vs resistance). I found evidence that long-term <b>selective</b> <b>browsing</b> may negatively affect soil nutrient pool, at least in the vicinity of palatable woody plants. I proposed this might be due to the drastic reduction of leaf-twig litter mass returned to the soil, which likely decreased decomposer activity and negatively affected N mineralization rates. Hence, the processes responsible for a loss of nutrients in the soil were different from those proposed for northern hemisphere scenarios, which were instead due to decreased litter quality. However, I found evidence of high plant resilience in heavily browsed sites where Acacia stands shown (1) higher leaf N during the main growing season, (2) higher N release from leaf litter, (3) high concentrations of nitrate (NO 3) and ammonium (NH 4), and (4) similar, or even faster, litter decomposition rates than in lightly browsed sites. Firstly, this suggests that tree pruning triggers and maintains a fast nutrient cycling within the plant-browser system. The accelerating effect is supported by high mass compensatory growth abilities from highly palatable, fast-growing Acacia trees that produce highly decomposable litter. Secondly, browsing may have a long-term decelerating effect on N cycling through quantitative changes in litter production rather than through qualitative changes in litter chemistry. Further studies should better address processes related to soil nutrient cycling to confirm such hypothesis. I discuss how the interactive effects of browsing-grazing-soil fertility may influence nutrient cycling trough different ecological processes. Thesis (DPhil) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
