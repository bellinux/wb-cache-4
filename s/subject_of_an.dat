5|$|A small {{model of}} this toy is {{exhibited}} in Tipu Sultan's wooden palace in Bangalore. Although other items associated with Tipu, including his sword, {{have recently been}} purchased and brought back to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya, Tipu's Tiger has not itself been the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official repatriation request, presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu's image {{in the eyes of}} Indians; his being an object of loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others.|$|E

The Kettle Creek Watershed Association (also known as the KWCA) was founded in the late 1990s. The creek became the third Home Rivers initiative of Trout Unlimited in 1998. The main industries in the Kettle Creek watershed in the 21st century are tourism, agriculture, and lumbering.|$|E
5|$|In 1652, the English {{parliament}} {{declared that}} Scotland {{was part of}} the Commonwealth. Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> act until 1657. The military administration in Scotland, led by General George Monck, was relatively successful. It managed to enforce law and order, suppressing the banditry of the Moss-troopers and enforcing a form of limited religious toleration, but by introducing English judges largely suspending the Scots law. In 1653–55 there was a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn and John Middleton, which was defeated at the Battle of Dalnaspidal on 19 July 1654.|$|E

The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
