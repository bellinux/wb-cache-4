Stock market trading operations have a considerably high level of risk, uncertainty and complexity, especially for unwise and inexperienced stock traders/investors seeking {{an easy way to}} make money quickly. In addition, trading activities are not free. Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, taxes and fees to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling orders placed at the stock exchange.

However, these <b>fiscal</b> <b>obligations</b> will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to examine problems with the Navy's two price aviation depot level repairable (AVDLR) billing and tracking system. These problems include fluctuations in post <b>fiscal</b> year <b>obligation</b> levels and the distortion of flying hour cost reporting due to AVDLR carcass charges and credits received during the expenditure availability periods of the Operations and Maintenance, Navy appropriations used to fund AVDLR purchases. Fluctuations in post <b>fiscal</b> year <b>obligation</b> levels can potentially result in the unintentional over obligation of funds. Distortions in flying hour costs result in inaccurate flying hour program budget requests. This thesis also explored the feasibility of a two price/one bill system of charging for AVDLRs which has often been proposed {{as a solution to}} the problem mentioned above. The conclusion reached is that the problems with the two price system have diminished significantly over time.

500|$|Sinologist historians {{debate the}} {{population}} figures for each {{era in the}} Ming dynasty. The historian Timothy Brook notes that the Ming government census figures are dubious since <b>fiscal</b> <b>obligations</b> prompted many families to underreport {{the number of people}} in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction. Children were often underreported, especially female children, as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the Ming. Even adult women were underreported; for example, the Daming Prefecture in North Zhili reported a population of 378,167 males and 226,982 females in 1502. The government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household, but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration. Some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide. The practice is well documented in China, going back over two thousand years, and it was described as [...] "rampant" [...] and [...] "practiced by almost every family" [...] by contemporary authors. However, the dramatically skewed sex ratios, which many counties reported exceeding 2:1 by 1586, cannot likely be explained by infanticide alone.|$|R
