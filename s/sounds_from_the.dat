5|$|In 1938 for a dance {{composition}} titled Bacchanale, John Cage {{invented the}} prepared piano, producing both transformed pitches and colorful unpitched <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> piano. Many variations, such as prepared guitar, have followed. In 1952, Cage wrote 4′33″, {{in which there}} is no deliberate sound at all, but only whatever background noise occurs during the performance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Les Chants Magnétiques was {{released}} on 20 May 1981, Oxygène and Équinoxe had achieved global sales of about 6million units. In its first two months the new album sold a reported 200,000units in France alone. The album uses <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fairlight CMI, a new instrument of which Jarre was an early pioneer. Its digital technology allowed him to continue his earlier sonic experimentation in new ways.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> video games.|$|E

5|$|For {{the album}} session, Steve Albini was engineer, Josephine Wiggs {{replaced}} Halliday on bass, Britt Walford played drums, and both Deal and Donelly played guitar. Following {{two weeks of}} practicing in England, the Breeders recorded Pod at the Palladium studio in Scotland. Albini recorded the group quickly, and focused more on getting good <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> musical equipment than on trying to improve the musicians' performances. Critics have discussed similarities between Pod and the Pixies' music, and commented favorably or unfavorably on Pods relative quality to that band's work. The album has been noted for its minimal instrumentation, and for its sexual, dark, girl-like lyrics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Kerry Packer {{established}} the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced {{many of the}} now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England {{and other parts of}} the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{were one}} game shy {{of winning the}} first-half pennant in 1984. Winning the first-half title is {{something}} that eluded the team during its entire seven-year span in the Southern League. One important highlight {{of the first half}} of 1984 took place on May 4, when Jim Deshaies pitched the club's first no-hitter against the Columbus Astros in the second game of a seven-inning doubleheader. The 5–1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three walks and a batter being hit by a pitch, advancing the runner home for the only Astros run of the game. Nashville went on to capture the second-half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating the Knoxville Blue Jays in a playoff game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but the Blue Jays emerged the victor, eliminating the <b>Sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> playoffs. Skipper Jim Marshall led his Sounds to a 74–73 record.|$|E

The sound of the keyboard riff used in the recording was achieved by using a Yamaha TX-816 rack unit and a Roland JX-8P synthesizer, as described by Michaeli: [...] "I made a brassy <b>sound</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> JX-8P and used a factory <b>sound</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Yamaha, and just layered them together." ...|$|R

In 2008, another CD of Apple-related songs, Treacle Toffee World: Further Adventures into the Pop Psych <b>Sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Apple Era 1967–1969, included two more Iveys demos.|$|E

25|$|Amusia is {{also known}} as tone deafness. Amusics {{primarily}} have deficits in processing pitch. They also have problems with musical memory, singing and timing. Amusics also cannot tell melodies apart from their rhythm or beat. However, amusics can recognize other sounds at a normal level (i.e. lyrics, voices, and <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> environment), therefore demonstrating that amusia is not due to deficits in exposure, hearing or cognition.|$|E
25|$|Oldfield used a {{modified}} Roland GP8 effects processor {{in conjunction with}} his PRS Artist to get many of his heavily overdriven guitar <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Earth Moving album onwards. Oldfield has also been using guitar synthesizers since the mid-1980s, using a 1980s Roland GR-300/G-808 type system, then a 1990s Roland GK2 equipped red PRS Custom 24 (sold in 2006) with a Roland VG8, and most recently a Line 6 Variax.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{access the}} virtual world through Internet-connected visors, which they refer to as megane, the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The visors allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their visors from their eyes. The visors also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> virtual environment.|$|E

50|$|Coaxial {{speakers}} in automobiles are 2- or 3-way loud{{speakers in}} which the tweeter, or the tweeter and a mid-range driver, are mounted {{in front of the}} woofer, partially obscuring it. The advantage of this design is the ability to use a smaller area, hence their popularity in car audio. The low frequency <b>sound</b> waves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> woofer are not reduced too much by the drivers in their path. Without time-alignment correction, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tweeter may arrive slightly before <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> woofer; this misalignment is not generally addressed in automobile sound systems.|$|R
25|$|The {{phonology}} {{of modern}} Cornish {{is based on}} a number of sources. The work of the linguist Edward Lhuyd who visited Cornwall in 1700 to record the language, as well as the modern Cornish dialect and accent of English, which got much of its intonation and <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cornish language, have provided a major source of input. Analysis of the traditional literature has also been used, as the Middle Cornish plays were often written in rhyming verse, and Late Cornish texts were written phonetically following English spelling conventions.|$|E
25|$|Henry Saint Clair Fredericks (born May 17, 1942), {{who uses}} the stage name Taj Mahal, is an American blues musician. He often {{incorporates}} elements of world music into his works. A self-taught singer-songwriter and film composer who plays the guitar, piano, banjo and harmonica (among many other instruments), Mahal has done much to reshape the definition and scope of blues music {{over the course of}} his almost 50-year career by fusing it with nontraditional forms, including <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, Africa and the South Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Poorly {{compressed}} VCD video {{can sometimes}} be of lower quality than VHS video, for example exhibiting VCD block artifacts (rather than the analog noise seen in VHS sources), but does not deteriorate further with each use. Producing video CDs involves stripping out high- and low-frequency <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> video, resulting in lower audio quality than VHS. While both formats need fast-forwarding to find certain scenes, rewinding to the beginning upon reaching the end is not required in VCD. The resolution is just half below that of common VHS resolution.|$|E
