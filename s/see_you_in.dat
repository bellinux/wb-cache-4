5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E

500|$|The censors {{ended up}} pulling [...] "I'll <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> Court", {{preventing}} it from airing in the United States during the series' original run. Terry Rakolta, a political activist from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, had launched a letter-writing {{campaign against the}} program after viewing the Season 3 episode [...] "Her Cups Runneth Over" [...] in January 1989. Offended by the episode's content, she urged advertisers to boycott the show, several of whom did or pledged to more carefully screen the episodes for which they provided advertising. The campaign garnered more media attention than she had expected and the advertisers' more careful scrutiny of the individual episodes that they supported was a significant factor {{that led to the}} pulling of [...] "I'll <b>See</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> Court". [...] Contributing to this was that the overall topic, sex, was not seen as a topic to be vocally and openly discussed on television.|$|E

Almost like a foreshadowing, there are several peculiar and eerie references in the film that are coincidental to Mr. Carradine's untimely passing which include cross dressing and auto erotic asphyxiation. His last scene on screen ended in the following dialog: [...] "Well, old friend, <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the next lifetime" [...] / [...] "Yeah, Old Friends, Old Soul Mates" [...] / [...] "Yes, we are." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Moye claimed that the producers dubbed the episode [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] both because it never aired and because they felt that they {{lost control of the}} project.

After arguing with the censors and conceding all but four of the notes, Fox still refused to air the episode. Moye claims that the final total of 13 changes was unacceptable because [...] "he integrity of the show was shot to hell." ...|$|E

After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive [...] "annoying calls" [...] from local Scientologists. [...] "The first few I was stupid enough to answer, but now they just call and call and call. When I did speak to 'a church member here in Auckland' he kept insisting over and over that we meet to talk about my 'vendetta' with the church." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring to support their second studio album, Dude Ranch. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion. The group were gone from their hometown of San Diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997.

500|$|When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to {{wear and}} in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more {{heightened}} in the film as [...] "more dominant and voyeuristic", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, [...] "I tried to do this the nice way, but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because I want to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> it. Now move!" [...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the sexual difference between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E
500|$|The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell's jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, {{prior to}} the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates.

[...] I begged the Red Sox not to trade you when you were in the minors with us. [...] Boston's loss was Houston's gain. [...] <b>See</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> Cooperstown."
