On March 9, 2008, Kathy Griffin became an ordained minister with the Universal One Church of Carrabelle, Florida.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{what for}} its members {{was an unusual}} yearlong break between touring and {{recording}} the band's followup to Unseen Power, Petra emerged to a changing musical landscape requiring adjustment from the 20-year-old band. [...] "I think we're {{on the verge of}} a new era for Petra," [...] Hartman said shortly after the release of 1993's Wake-Up Call. [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> will be – but it won't be disco." ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek Chavis of the Baltimore Sun {{gave the}} episode a more {{negative}} review, saying [...] "While {{it seems the}} productions of each number are getting bigger, the show’s spirit gets smaller. Does Ryan Murphy think that because American Horror Story is amazing he can slack off on Glee? I hope not. It was officially announced recently that Glee will end after next season (Season 6) so let’s end this show as great as we started it, shall we?" [...] Lauren Hoffman of Vulture gave the episode a 2 out of 5, signaling mixed to negative reviews, saying [...] "The main problem with last night’s episode is that “Are you a Katy or a Gaga?” isn’t a particularly interesting question. I’m not even <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> question is asking. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry certainly aren’t the same , but they’re not exactly polar opposites." [...] Despite negative reviews of the episode's theme, she did comment positively on Adam Lambert's role, calling his audition [...] "undeniably great." ...|$|E

2500|$|Years later Morrall said, [...] "I {{thought we}} would win handily. We'd only lost twice in our last 30 games. I'm still not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} <b>that</b> day at the Orange Bowl, however; it's still hard to account for." [...] Wrote Matt Snell, [...] "The most distinct image I have from that whole game is of Ordell Braase and some other guys—not so much Mike Curtis--having a bewildered look." ...|$|R

2500|$|Like {{the other}} players in the Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso {{approach}} to playing, preferring to have his work {{serve the needs of}} each song. Guitar World magazine noted [...] "there are only a handful of guitarists who can claim to have never wasted a note. Mike Campbell is certainly one of them". He is a highly melodic player, often using two or three-strings-at-a-time leads instead of the more conventional one-at-a-time approach. [...] "People have told me that my playing sounds like bagpipes," [...] he muses. [...] "I'm not exactly <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means." [...] His estimation of his own style is typically modest: [...] "I don't think people can really top Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as far as lead guitar goes. I like my playing to bring out the songs." [...] Like Tench, he is heavily involved in constructing the arrangements for the Heartbreakers' tunes. And also like Tench, he prefers rawness to polish in the studio and onstage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose you're not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> Headman really meant," [...] he said.

I wish I knew exactly why he chuckled." ...|$|E
6000|$|Up {{here among}} the heather (or nearly so) we are, {{in the opinion}} of tourists, a mere hamlet, though to {{ourselves}} we are at least a village. Englishmen call us a [...] "clachan"--though, truth to tell, we are not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is. Just as Gulliver could not see the Liliputians without stooping, these tourists may be looking for the clachan when they {{are in the middle of}} it, and knocking at one of its doors to ask how far they have yet to go till they reach it. To be honest, we are only five houses in a row (including the smiddy), with a Free Church Manse and a few farms here and there on the hillsides.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>sure!</b> <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> we'll go after," [...] {{declared}} the detective. [...] "Even if we locate our man, we won't arrest him {{until we can}} get him with the goods." ...|$|R

60|$|Another {{nephew of}} mine, James Ebenezer Lawson--he calls himself James E. {{back there in}} town, and I don't blame him, for I never could stand Ebenezer for a name myself; but that's neither here nor there. Well, he said their love was idyllic, I ain't very <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means. I looked {{it up in the}} {{dictionary}} after James Ebenezer left--I wouldn't display my ignorance afore him--but I can't say that I was much the wiser for it. Anyway, it meant something real nice; I was sure of that by the way James Ebenezer spoke and the wistful look in his eyes. James Ebenezer isn't married; he was to have been, and she died a month afore the wedding day. He was never the same man again.|$|E
6000|$|After much perplexity {{and running}} {{to and fro}} in London, it was {{arranged}} between {{the secretary of state}} and Mr. Gladstone's friends, including Phillimore principally, and then Northcote and M. Bernard, that a course of proceeding should be followed, which Mr. Gladstone when he knew it thought unfortunate. A new commission naming a successor was issued, and Mr. Gladstone then became ipso facto liberated. Sir Henry Storks was the officer chosen, and as soon as his commission was formally received by him, he was to execute a warrant under which he deputed all powers to Mr. Gladstone until his arrival. Whether Mr. Gladstone was lord high commissioner when he came to propose his reform is a moot point. So intricate was the puzzle that the under-secretary addressed a letter to Mr. Gladstone by his name and not by the style of his official dignity, because he could not be at all <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> official dignity really was. What is certain is that Mr. Gladstone, though it was never his way to quarrel with other people's action taken in good faith on his behalf, did not perceive the necessity for proceeding so rapidly to the appointment of his successor, and thought it decidedly injurious to such chances as his reforms might have possessed.[381] ...|$|E

50|$|Mick {{returns to}} his stilt house, where Christina visits him. She says that she interviewed Mick's old partner, Timmy Gavigan, at the hospital. Before Timmy died, {{he told her that}} he'd remembered a detail from the Barletta case: Graveline's brother, George, is a tree trimmer by profession. She isn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means, but Stranahan is: most {{trimmers}} use a wood chipper, an ideal device for disposing of a body in a hurry.|$|E

5000|$|Techdirt article {{contributor}} Mike Masnick responded {{recently to}} an article in Time Magazine, expressing his disagreement with why a man was arrested for piggybacking a cafe's wireless medium.

[...] The [...] "Time's" [...] writer himself is not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> title really means or how it applies to contemporary society, being that the code was established regarding computers and their networks during the Cold War era.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} notable moments in the program's history {{occurred}} on December 9, 2012, against the Appalachian State Mountaineers in Cullowhee. In {{the second half of}} that game, with 11:07 to go, the Mountaineers were leading 49-40. Appalachian State player Brian Okam was shooting the second of two free throws, when as soon as he shot the ball it sailed high in the air and fell in the arms of a teammate about 10 feet short of the rim. A Western Carolina TV analyst commentating on the game soon reacted, in a surprised manner, [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> was. Good lord." [...] Eventually, the Catamounts would go on to win 70-64. The incident has gone viral on YouTube, reaching over 18 million views.|$|E

It was tough for me for a few months in 2015, but look I'm just delighted to be back playing and delighted to be on the pitch and doing what I can for Tipperary and I'm just absolutely thrilled to be part of an All-Ireland-winning team.

5000|$|Parsons' {{move to the}} Mavericks {{caused a}} stir amongst his former Rockets' teammates. James Harden stated, [...] "Dwight Howard and I are the {{cornerstones}} of the Rockets. The rest of the guys are role players or pieces that complete our team. We’ve lost some pieces and added some pieces. I think we’ll be fine next season." [...] Parsons responded with, [...] "That's a pretty ridiculous statement if he meant that. That's {{part of the reason}} I wanted to go to Dallas, because I'm ready for that next step. I'm ready for a bigger role, and I'm ready for more leadership. If anybody should understand that, it's James, because he was in the same situation in Oklahoma City and then he got his chance to come to Houston and shine. I'm not real <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> means." ...|$|E
