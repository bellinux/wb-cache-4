5|$|Although the Palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals, {{some were}} {{associated}} with other gods. Bel had Astarte-Belti as his consort, and formed a triple deity with Aglibol and Yarhibol (who became a sun god in his association with Bel). Malakbel was part of many associations, pairing with Gad Taimi and Aglibol, and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol. Palmyra hosted an Akitu (spring festival) each Nisan. Each of the city's four-quarters had a sanctuary for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's sanctuary was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu <b>sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis <b>sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> the fourth tribe's quarter.|$|E
5|$|During routine {{maintenance}} work at Karori <b>Sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> late 2008, a tuatara nest was uncovered, with a hatchling found the following autumn. This {{is thought to}} be the first case of tuatara successfully breeding in the wild on the New Zealand mainland in over 200 years.|$|E

5|$|D. s. harrissoni, {{known as}} the Bornean Rhinoceros or Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, which was once common {{throughout}} Borneo; now, only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean subspecies is markedly smaller than the other two. The captive population consists of one male and two females at the Borneo Rhinoceros <b>Sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> Sabah.|$|E
5|$|Discovered {{during the}} mapping of California's coast in 1933, Davidson Seamount {{is named after}} {{geographer}} George Davidson of the U.S. National Geodetic Survey. Studied only sparsely for decades, NOAA expeditions to the seamount in 2002 and 2006 cast light upon its unique deep-sea coral ecosystem. Davidson Seamount is populated by a dense population of large, ancient corals, {{some of which are}} over 100 years of age. The data gathered during the studies fueled the making of Davidson Seamount into a part of the Monterey Bay National Marine <b>Sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> 2009.|$|E

5|$|In August 2016, {{there were}} only three Sumatran rhinos left in Malaysia, a male named Tam and two females, all in captivity. As of June 2017 there are only two rhinos {{remaining}} after one of the females, Puntung, was put down due to skin cancer. If the pair do not breed, and there are no further wild sightings, the species can be considered functionally extinct in Malaysia. In Indonesia, meanwhile, a seventh rhino increased the group at the Sumatran Rhino <b>Sanctuary,</b> <b>in</b> Way Kambas NP. A female was born on 12 May 2016.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, hidden-camera {{video was}} {{published}} showing adults and juveniles, indicating recent matings and breeding.

50|$|The synagogue, {{or if it}} is a {{multi-purpose}} building, prayer sanctuaries {{within the}} synagogue, should face towards Jerusalem.

5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between {{the two sides of the}} Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels <b>sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{received}} several warnings about the invasion from individuals within his government; though he initially disbelieved them, they grew more frequent as the invasion drew near, eventually convincing Noriega {{to go on}} the run. Noriega used a number of subterfuges, including lookalikes and playbacks of his recorded voice, to confuse U.S. surveillance as to his whereabouts. During his flight Noriega reportedly took shelter with several supportive politicians, including Balbita Periñan, the mayor of San Miguelito. The last two days of his flight were spent partly with Noriega's ally Jorge Krupnick. Kempe reported that Noriega considered seeking <b>sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> the Cuban or Nicaraguan embassies, but both buildings were surrounded by U.S. troops. On the fifth day of the invasion, Noriega and four others took <b>sanctuary</b> <b>in</b> the Apostolic Nunciature, the Holy See's embassy in Panama. Having threatened to flee to the countryside and lead guerrilla warfare if not given refuge, he instead turned over the majority of his weapons, and requested sanctuary from José Sebastián Laboa, the papal representative.|$|E
