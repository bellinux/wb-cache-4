5|$|She {{found so}} much {{information}} about female patriots that {{the first edition of}} The Women of the American Revolution (1848) had to be published in two volumes. These volumes were well received, and a third volume of additional material was published in 1850. Later historians consider these volumes to represent her most important work. Ellet also authored Domestic History of the American Revolution <b>summarizing</b> <b>the</b> same material in narrative form and also published in 1850.|$|E

The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years.

5|$|The episode when {{broadcast}} in the United States was viewed by 16.54 {{million people and}} received mixed reviews from critics. It is the first episode to feature a 'Previously on Lost' segment, a clip shown {{at the beginning of}} each episode <b>summarizing</b> <b>the</b> recent events of the show. The episode receives its name from the philosophical idea of tabula rasa, meaning blank slate, a concept which is brought in one of the episode's final lines, when Jack tells Kate that all of the Flight 815 survivors should be allowed to restart with a new life.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the last}} Diet {{was held in}} the early 1350s, the queens convoked a Diet to deal with the grievances of the noblemen. Mary {{confirmed}} her father's decrees of 1351 <b>summarizing</b> <b>the</b> noblemen's privileges on 22June 1384. The negotiations of Mary's marriage in France caused a new rift within the Hungarian nobility, because the Lackfis, Nicholas Zámbó and Nicholas Szécsi and other high officers, who had been appointed during Louis the Great's reign, continued to support Mary's fiancé, Sigismund, in accordance with Louis the Great's will. The queen mother replaced them with Nicholas Garai's supporters in August 1384. The prelates were also opposed to the French marriage, because the French supported Clement VII whom the Hungarian clergy considered an antipope. Mary's sister, Jadwiga, went to Poland where she was crowned on 16October 1384. Cardinal Demetrius, who had accompanied Jadwiga to Poland, remained absent from the queens' court after his return to Hungary. The royal government could not properly function during his absence because he was the keeper of the royal seal.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document <b>summarizing</b> <b>the</b> contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Harold is escorted {{back to the}} {{psychiatric}} center where he is tormented by Nurse Innes (Nancy Fish). Later, Mulder finds Innes lying on the floor, half-conscious. Innes claims Harold went berserk and attacked her. One of the other patients, Chuck Forsch, tells Scully that Nurse Innes was trying to poison Harold. Scully slowly realizes that Innes, not Harold, {{was responsible for the}} murders. When Innes attacks Scully with a scalpel, Scully draws her weapon and fires, striking her in the shoulder. While <b>summarizing</b> <b>the</b> case with Mulder, Scully explains that Innes had been taking Harold's unused medication, triggering violent and unpredictable behavior. Scully hypothesizes that Innes committed the murders in order to destroy the love Harold felt towards the young women. Later, Harold's body is discovered in a nearby alley, the apparent victim of respiratory failure. Scully, however, suspects that Harold died from what Innes took away from him. Scully admits to Mulder that she saw the ghost of the fourth victim shortly after she was murdered. Later, Scully sees Harold's spirit sitting {{in the back seat of}} her car.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, amateur historians {{first began}} writing {{accounts}} {{of the events of}} the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In January 1950, William M. Scnure mentioned the event {{at a meeting of the}} Northumberland County Historical Society, and the fort on North Mountain was said to exist in an article written by Myrtle Magargel in 1955. In 1958 the Fishing Creek Confederacy was mentioned in the History of Columbia County, Pennsylvania, which was intended to be used in schools in Columbia County. In the 1960s and 1970s local newspapers occasionally ran articles <b>summarizing</b> <b>the</b> Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 1998, the Bloomsburg Theater Ensemble compiled a book of Columbia County history based on letters to the editor, and several of these letters mentioned the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 2012 Byron Heller wrote a piece of historical fiction called The Fishing Creek Confederacy, inspired by the events of the Fishing Creek Confederacy. The confederacy has been the subject of satirical works.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before <b>summarizing</b> <b>the</b> nutrient components of pork in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E
