5|$|The club's strong {{record and}} {{regional}} visibility spurred {{the growth of}} amateur and minor league baseball in the Youngstown area, and the community's minor league teams produced notable players throughout {{the first half of}} the 20th century.

5|$|The {{story of}} the Ohio Works team {{proved to be an}} early chapter in Youngstown's long history of amateur and minor league baseball. In the 1930s and 1940s, the city was a {{frequent}} host of the National Amateur Baseball Federation (NABF) championship. NABF officials praised the community for the condition of its sandlot baseball diamonds, which they rated as {{among the best in the}} country. During the first half of the 20th century, Youngstown-based teams provided experience and exposure to future major league players such as Everett Scott, Floyd Baker, and Johnny Kucab.

40|$|<b>SCRAPPER,</b> an F-box protein coded by FBXL 20, is a subunit of SCF type E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase. <b>SCRAPPER</b> localizes synapses {{and directly}} binds to Rab 3 -interacting molecule 1 (RIM 1), an essential factor for synaptic vesicle release, thus it regulates neural transmission via RIM 1 degradation. A defect in <b>SCRAPPER</b> leads to neurotransmission abnormalities, which could subsequently result in neurodegenerative phenotypes. Because {{it is likely}} that the alteration of neural transmission in <b>Scrapper</b> mutant mice affect their systemic condition, we have analyzed the behavioral phenotypes of mice with decreased or increased the amount of <b>SCRAPPER.</b> We carried out a series of behavioral test batteries for <b>Scrapper</b> mutant mice. <b>Scrapper</b> transgenic mice overexpressing <b>SCRAPPER</b> in the hippocampus did not show any significant difference in every test argued in this manuscript by comparison with wild-type mice. On the other hand, heterozygotes of <b>Scrapper</b> knockout [SCR (+/ 2) ] mice showed significant difference in the contextual but not cued fear conditioning test. In addition, SCR (+/ 2) mice altered in some tests reflecting anxiety, which implies the loss of functions of <b>SCRAPPER</b> in the hippocampus.

5|$|The {{terms of}} the February 1922 Washington Naval Treaty forced the class' cancellation, but the two closest to {{completion}} (Amagi and Akagi) were saved from the <b>scrappers</b> by a provision that allowed two capital ships to be converted to aircraft carriers. However, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused significant stress damage to the hull of Amagi. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. Amagi was struck from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924. The other two ships, Atago and Takao, were officially cancelled two years later (31 July 1924) and were broken up for scrap in their slipways.

40|$|SummaryLittle {{is known}} about how {{synaptic}} activity is modulated in the central nervous system. We have identified <b>SCRAPPER,</b> a synapse-localized E 3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates neural transmission. <b>SCRAPPER</b> directly binds and ubiquitinates RIM 1, a modulator of presynaptic plasticity. In neurons from Scrapper-knockout (SCR-KO) mice, RIM 1 had a longer half-life with significant reduction in ubiquitination, indicating that <b>SCRAPPER</b> is the predominant ubiquitin ligase that mediates RIM 1 degradation. As anticipated in a RIM 1 degradation defect mutant, SCR-KO mice displayed altered electrophysiological synaptic activity, i. e., increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. This phenotype of SCR-KO mice was phenocopied by RIM 1 overexpression and could be rescued by re-expression of <b>SCRAPPER</b> or knockdown of RIM 1. The acute effects of proteasome inhibitors, such as upregulation of RIM 1 and the release probability, were blocked by the impairment of <b>SCRAPPER.</b> Thus, <b>SCRAPPER</b> has an essential function in regulating proteasome-mediated degradation of RIM 1 required for synaptic tuning...|$|R

5000|$|In summer 2007, Li Ming Wong {{organised}} {{a tournament}} in Los Angeles. A few {{days into the}} trip, Jarvis arranged for him, Eric, <b>Scrapper,</b> Gerald, Fabian, Phil and Callum to have a plane tour of the Grand Canyon. However, plane trouble soon forced the pilots to crash-land in the water. <b>Scrapper</b> took the others on a raft to go for help. However, the strong current blew the raft off course, leaving the five in the raft in danger and Jarvis and the two pilots stranded. With a flare gun and a rope from the cockpit, Nick and the pilots were able to pull themselves to safety. The players' raft went down a waterfall, leaving the five stranded in a clearing. <b>Scrapper</b> and Callum went to find food, as Gerald told Eric, Fabian and Phil the legend of Bigfoot. The anxious players hear a gunshot from the woods. Three hillbillies emerge and engage in conversation with the players before <b>Scrapper</b> returns with Callum, attacks the hillbillies and escapes {{with the rest of}} the team. They find refuge in a cave, and <b>Scrapper</b> volunteers to search for the nearest town. When the others awaken, they find a large, gorilla-like monster standing at the cave's entrance. Gerald screams, only for the [...] "monster" [...] to pull off its fake head and reveal itself as <b>Scrapper.</b> The hillbillies, he explained, wanted him to wear this costume to bring back tourists and make people think a Bigfoot-type creature lived there.

However, before an order could be placed for the new ship, the Hanseatic caught fire on 6 September 1966 while in New York harbour.
