40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that rational, periodically collapsing speculative bubbles may be pervasive in stock markets globally, {{but there is}} no research that considers them at the individual stock level. In this study we develop and test an empirical asset pricing model that allows for speculative bubbles to affect stock returns. We show that stocks incorporating larger bubbles yield higher returns. The bubble deviation, at the stock level as opposed to the industry or market level, is a priced source of risk that is separate from the <b>standard</b> <b>market</b> risk, <b>size</b> and value factors. We demonstrate that much of the common variation in stock returns that can be attributable to market risk is due to the co-movement of bubbles rather than being driven by fundamentals...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} relative {{concerns in}} the form of conspicuous consumption in a standard economic geography model a la Krugman. The primary intuition is that conspicuous consumption imposes a negative externality on some agents and generates a centrifugal force. We show that this is not always the case as the relative concern also rises the demand for the sophisticated good, strengthening the <b>standard</b> centripetal <b>market</b> <b>size</b> effect. We show that the resulting force is very sensitive to the topology of the network of "conspicuous" links in each region and on the level of economic integration. For instance, with relatively large shares of income devoted to the consumption of the standard good, we show that when trade is moderately costly and classes of workers are segregated, relative concerns tends to stabilize the symmetric equilibrium; on the other hand, if workers of different classes interact via their relative concerns, conspicuous consumption is a centripetal force generating stable fully or partially agglomerated equilibria. Finally, when the level of integration is high, the intuition holds and even small relative concerns destabilize the full agglomeration equilibrium, which is stable in the Krugman model...|$|R

Based on a novel two-stage estimation procedure, we find clear evidence for heterogeneity across teams. In the first stage, a random-utility model for a representative consumer is modelled and fitted to more than 1700 matches over the seasons 1996 – 2001. In the second step, attendance probabilities are predicted for the seasons 2002 – 2003 to estimate group sizes. A team's group size is positively correlated with its memberships (inline image. 61; p< 0. 01), fan clubs (inline image. 59; p< 0. 01) and merchandizing revenues (inline image. 49; p< 0. 05).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of a minimum quality standard, a {{compulsory}} labeling scheme, and the combination of both instruments in a vertical differentiation model when not all quality dimensions of products can be observed byconsumers. Both a minimum quality standard on the non-observable quality dimension and a labeling scheme that informs consumers about the non-observable quality dimension have no impact on the observable quality dimension, increase prices, and have no impact on demand. The combination of a minimum standard and a labeling scheme increases prices, reduces or enhances investment in the observable quality dimension, and alters market shares depending on the minimum quality level. Compared to the case of no regulation, social welfare may decrease or increase under the minimum quality standard, the compulsory labeling scheme or the combined scheme, depending on the level of the minimum quality <b>standard</b> and the <b>market</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper reports {{experimental}} {{data on the}} behavior in the first-price sealed-bid auction for a varying number of market participants when values and bids are private information.

Indeed the increase of bids in <b>market</b> <b>size</b> is not as steep as predicted by the risk neutral Nash equilibrium. Consequently, bids {{are more likely to be}} above [below] the equilibrium for small [big] <b>market</b> <b>size</b> and at equilibrium for some <b>market</b> <b>size.</b> The relationship between <b>market</b> <b>size</b> and average bids or prices is captured by an increasing bidding function which allows an estimate for greater <b>market</b> <b>sizes.</b> The behavioral pattern of prices is slightly different; the observed price increase due to an increase in <b>market</b> <b>size</b> does quite closely match the predicted one.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} conditions that give rise to a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between two countries (called North and South) that are potentially asymmetric with respect to their <b>market</b> <b>sizes</b> and the quality of their products. When <b>market</b> <b>sizes</b> are symmet-ric, a bilateral FTA does not arise because South (which is assumed to produce the low quality) loses from it and, therefore, rejects it. As the relative <b>market</b> <b>size</b> of North expands, South becomes more willing to sign an FTA, whereas North becomes less so. There exists a range of <b>market</b> <b>sizes,</b> for which an FTA is acceptable to both countries. How-ever, if the asymmetry in <b>market</b> <b>size</b> is too large, an FTA once again fails to arise. As the North-South quality gap increases, the set of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> parameters for which an FTA can be sustained expands. An interesting result is that the globally optimal North-South trade agreement does not call for bilateral free trade. Instead, it calls for free trade in South and a positive tariff in North. Pareto improving unilateral transfers exist, and these expand the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> range sup-porting an FTA. The direction of the transfer depends on the relative <b>market</b> <b>size.</b> The main results of the paper continue to hold in a re-peated game setting when the FTA is self-enforcing, as well as when it is weakly renegotiation-proof...|$|R
40|$|I present {{evidence}} that a moving average (MA) trading strategy has a greater average return and skewness {{as well as a}} lower variance compared to buying and holding the underlying asset using monthly returns of value-weighted US decile portfolios sorted by <b>market</b> <b>size,</b> book-to-market, and momentum, and seven international markets as well as 18, 000 individual US stocks. The MA strategy generates risk-adjusted returns of 3 – 7 % per year after transaction costs. The performance of the MA strategy is driven largely by the volatility of stock returns and resembles the payoffs of an at-the-money protective put on the underlying buy-and-hold return. Conditional factor models with macroeconomic variables, especially the default premium, can explain some of the abnormal returns. <b>Standard</b> <b>market</b> timing tests reveal ample evidence regarding the timing ability of the MA strategy.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to offer {{explanations}} of the wide variation in the impact of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> on new <b>market</b> entry decisions – i. e. its positive impact lessens because of unreliable predictability of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> on post-entry profit and entry motivations other than post-entry profit. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of the two explanations, this paper builds a contingency frame that the impact of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> on new <b>market</b> entry depends on entry-context-specific variables. It validates the contingency frame, empirically analyzing 219 parameter estimates of the impact of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> on <b>market</b> entry obtained from 41 existing empirical studies. Findings: The meta-analysis results reveal that the entry-context-specific variables used in this study – niche market entry, high-tech market entry, entry by industry incumbent firms and the year of market entry – notably moderate the impact of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> on new <b>market</b> entry decisions, as the research frame suggests. Research limitations/implications: This study examines the various literature and study outcomes in the areas of marketing, economics and strategy to elucidate whether and when <b>market</b> <b>size</b> is a critical driver of new market entry. In most cases, the greater the new <b>market</b> <b>size,</b> the greater is the propensity to enter the market. However, the contingency arguments stated in this paper suggest that firms may and do enter a new market even if the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> is not large at the time of entry.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a New Trade Theory model modified with entry barriers, thereby creating {{a link between}} the traditional interests of development and industrial organization economists and research on international trade. I show that entry barriers cause the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> to become endogenous by creating rents. Furthermore, I prove that the endogeneity of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> has four implications. First, governments can use trade policy to shift foreign rents to their countries and enlarge their home markets. Second, endogenous <b>market</b> <b>size</b> magnifies the <b>standard</b> home-market effect. Third, the endogeneity of <b>market</b> <b>size</b> interferes with the unambiguous Pareto optimality of trade agreements. In particular, if rents are suffciently large and the country size is suffciently small, a trade agreement will negatively affect the country in question. Therefore, I consider a new research question: what are consequences of trade agreements in terms of welfare redistribution? Finally, I show that an increase in entry barriers increases the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> of large countries. If the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> increase is suffciently large, the country benefits.
