5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The <b>Shop</b> <b>Around</b> the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to <b>shop</b> <b>around.</b> UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie wrote nine {{drafts of}} his {{screenplay}} over five months, until Singer {{felt that it}} was ready to <b>shop</b> <b>around</b> to the studios. None were interested except for a European financing company. McQuarrie and Singer had a difficult time getting the film made because of the non-linear story, the large amount of dialogue and the lack of cast attached to the project. Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the small role of Redfoot (the L.A. fence who hooks up the five protagonists with Kobayashi) went out to Christopher Walken, Tommy Lee Jones, Jeff Bridges, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Al Pacino and Johnny Cash. However, the European money allowed the film's producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were only able to offer the actors salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie's script and the chance to work with each other. That money fell through, however, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.|$|E

25|$|Doctor Who had {{suspended}} {{production in}} 1989, and aside from charity specials had only resurfaced as an American-funded television movie in 1996, {{which did not}} garner enough ratings {{to go to a}} regular series. When Shalka was announced in July 2003 for planned broadcast in November, the possibility of Doctor Who returning to television screens still seemed remote and BBC Worldwide were continuing to <b>shop</b> <b>around</b> for another possible movie deal. As a result, BBCi officially announced, with BBC approval, that the Doctor appearing in Shalka would be the Ninth Doctor. However, events rapidly overtook this.|$|E

25|$|In 1940 Stewart and Sullavan reunited for two films. The first, the Ernst Lubitsch romantic comedy, The <b>Shop</b> <b>Around</b> the Corner, starred them as {{co-workers}} unknowingly {{involved in}} a pen-pal romance but who cannot stand each other in real life. It was Stewart's fifth film {{of the year and}} one of the rare ones shot in sequence; it was completed in only 27 days. The Mortal Storm, directed by Frank Borzage, {{was one of the first}} blatantly anti-Nazi films to be produced in Hollywood and featured Sullavan and Stewart as friends and then lovers caught in turmoil upon Hitler's rise to power, literally hunted down by their own friends.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his seven}} decades in Hollywood, Stewart {{cultivated}} a versatile career and recognized screen image in such classics as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Mortal Storm, The Philadelphia Story, Harvey, It's a Wonderful Life, Shenandoah, The Glenn Miller Story, Rear Window, Rope, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The <b>Shop</b> <b>Around</b> the Corner, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Vertigo. He {{is the most}} represented leading actor on the AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and AFI's 10 Top 10 lists. He is the most represented leading actor on the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list presented by Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, ten of his films have been inducted into the United States National Film Registry. As part of their 100 Years Series, Stewart was named the third-greatest screen legend actor in American film history by the AFI in 1999.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Hanks' {{next project}} {{was no less}} expensive. For Saving Private Ryan, he teamed up with Steven Spielberg {{to make a film}} about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring back a soldier. It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general public. It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination. Later that year, Hanks re-teamed with his Sleepless in Seattle co-star Meg Ryan for You've Got Mail, a remake of 1940's The <b>Shop</b> <b>Around</b> the Corner. In 1999, Hanks starred in an {{adaptation}} of the Stephen King novel The Green Mile. He also returned as the voice of Woody in Toy Story 2, the sequel to Toy Story. The following year, he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor and an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of a marooned FedEx systems analyst in Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away.|$|E

25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is <b>shop</b> <b>around,</b> get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or <b>shop</b> <b>around</b> town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E
500|$|The band {{booked a}} two-week tour with Spitalfield, but Pareskuwicz {{was unable to}} get time off from work and Kunasch {{was kicked out of}} the band as the group [...] "had all gotten sick of him." [...] Kunasch was {{temporarily}} replaced by friend Brandon Hamm on guitar, alongside drummer Chris Envy from the recently disbanded Showoff, but both quit prior to the kickoff of the tour. The band invited Hurley instead to fill-in once more, while Stump borrowed one of Trohman's guitars for the trek. While most shows were cancelled, the band played any show possible: [...] "Let's just get on whatever show we can. You can pay us in pizza," [...] remembered Wentz. As the tour concluded, the general consensus was that Hurley would be the band's new drummer, and the band began to <b>shop</b> <b>around</b> the three songs from the group's unreleased split as a demo to record labels. The band members set their sights on pop punk labels, and attempted with considerable effort to join Drive-Thru Records. A showcase for label co-founders went largely mediocre, and the band were offered to sign to side label Rushmore, an offer that the members of the band declined. They got particularly far in discussions with The Militia Group and Victory Records, and Bob McLynn of Crush Management became the band's first manager. The band re-entered the studio with O'Keefe to record several more tracks to create label interest. Wentz felt [...] "in the backseat" [...] in writing the songs and temporarily questioned his place in the group, but Stump argued in his favor: [...] "No! That's not fair! Don't leave me with this band! Don't make me kind of like this band and then leave it! That's bullshit!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bailey was {{the master}} printer of a shop that {{at its peak}} {{was one of the}} largest in the city, {{employing}} more than forty workers. Many of her employees went on to respectable careers as bookmen in their own right, among them Alexander Baird, Robert P. King, and John Fagan. Her only son, William Robert, entered the <b>shop</b> <b>around</b> the time of his father's death and eventually became a foreman, but never took over his mother's reins. When he died in 1861, she retired, at the age of eighty-two. By this time printing plants of steam-powered presses were churning out more business at lower costs than even the most established, productive hand-press shops; one obituary romantically reported that [...] "steam presses were fatal to her courage and she surrendered to an instrumentality she could neither comprehend nor compete with." [...] For whatever reasons, Lydia Bailey never embraced the new technology and simply closed her business on her retirement. She died in Philadelphia soon after her ninetieth birthday.|$|E
