One important factor to understand was that, at that time, {{the relationship between the}} IMF and Tanzania was still not in good shape; with that being said, the amount of aid provided by the <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreement</b> was not a lot as it accounted only 60% of Tanzania’s quota at that time.The main purpose behind this agreement was mainly to reconstruct investors’ confidence in Tanzania by providing the country with an IMF’s approval. Successfully, this agreement achieved its goal as many developed countries were willing to provide aids to Tanzania if the country followed the proposed reforms listed under the agreement. From the US$78.5 million (64.2 million SDR) approved by the agreement, only 55.6 million (45.47 million SDR) was withdrawn. The first round of reform came to an end in 1996, and Tanzania achieved most of the reforms during this duration of time.|$|E

This led to the collapse of a third of the nation's industry and the destruction of nearly one million jobs.|$|E
40|$|Conditionality is {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspect of the IMF`s policies. It has been said to be intrusive and coercive and considered to disregard effects on growth, employment and income distribution. In the 1990 s, following {{a sharp increase in}} the number of conditions required by programs, Fund conditionality became increasingly ineffective. The paper reviews the nature and purpose of conditionality; its origin and evolution over time. It considers whether conditionality is required to safeguard the resources of the Fund. It looks into the reasons for the increase in structural conditionality, relates the increase in conditionality with the marked fall in the rate of compliance with Fund programs and with the relative decline in Fund resources. The paper notes the revision of conditionality recently undertaken at the instance of the Managing Director and considers progress on that front. Finally, certain difficult political questions arising from conditionality are posed and some suggestions presented for increasing country ownership of programs, the key to making conditionality more acceptable and effective.

40|$|Abstract: IMF {{has been}} created to make {{international}} cooperation on financial matters stronger and for solving the problems of balance of payment. However, the IMF formed policies in order to solve problems of balance of payment till the 1980 s, expanded its effectiveness much more by controlling the structural adjustment programs after the 1980 s, and undertook the role as an international lender of last resort on crises caused by globalization trends. In developing nations, foreign and domestic deficit occurred due to infrastructural causes that have created economic instabilities portrayed through inflation and unemployment. Especially foreign debt problems sourced by the foreign trade deficit transformed into an economic crisis for these countries. Many countries affected by such economic crisis applied to IMF and its Stabilization Program {{with the aim of}} providing economic stability in the hopes of recovering. The important thing here to point out is that the economic programs used by countries during their economic crisis are supported by the IMF in reality. In this situation Mexico and Argentina can be given as a good example. IMF has undertaken the same mission in Turkey with seven stabilization programs put in practice and nineteen Stand-By Arrangements between them. But IMF has failed many times in Turkey just like in many developing countries. This is because IMF did not take into consideration economic and social structure of countries in stabilization programs put in practice. Today, Turkey has reached to an important point from the way of its relationship with IMF; more clearly, Turkey is determined to achieve its future without IMF. Turkey-IMF relationship in the framework of <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreements</b> in the past half century of our economic and political history has come to an ending point. After a period of 51 years of intense relations, Turkey decided to determine its calculations of credit limit by the way of advantages and disadvantages and continue its relations in this way. In this context, this study will try to prove therotically that Turkey will put in place to foreign credit support with the purposes of carrying out stabilized policies and protecting itself from financial shocks. Finally, Turkey will contact IMF with requirements of the rules and regulations that are in its advantage...|$|R
50|$|Members of the {{government}} promised {{to move forward on}} cash and mass privatization upon taking office in January 1995 but were slow to act. United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia and Iraq (1990-2003), two of the country's most significant trading partners, took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged in 1994 when the GDP grew and inflation fell. The first round of mass privatisation finally began in January 1996, and auctions began toward the end of that year. The second and third rounds were conducted in Spring 1997 under a new government. In July 1998, the UDF-led government and the IMF reached an agreement on a 3-year loan worth about $800 million, which replaced the 14-month <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreement</b> that expired in June 1998. The loan was used to develop financial markets, improve social safety net programmes, strengthen the tax system, reform agricultural and energy sectors, and further liberalise trade. The European Commission, in its 2002 country report, recognised Bulgaria as a functioning market economy, acknowledging the progress made by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov's government toward market-oriented reforms.|$|E

These agreements are made up of a group of conditions, where the generic term "conditionality" originates.

The author of this article looks into each one of the 12 paragraphs and underlying principles that constitute the decision. Afterwards, the author examines paragraph 3 in detail, which enacts that these stand-by agreements are not international agreements, and analyses the reasons motivating such a decision on behalf of the Fund. The author also deals with the underlying issue of the legal type of international convention that a <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreement</b> may constitute: the "gentleman's agreement" or the unilateral mandatory declaration or the unenforceable agreement.

Firstly, we have presented a brief introduction that reviews the literature on the role of using public expenditures in times of economic downturn and theirs effects. Secondly, the paper presents, in a critical manner, according to the economic and functional classification, which categories of expenditures were financed by the government in 2009, compared with the previous two years, as a result of the <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreement</b> contracted by Romanian government with the international financial institutions.

40|$|The {{economic}} crises {{that is currently}} wreaking in the world hit Cameroon {{towards the end of}} 1985 – 1986. The Cameroon government, after implementing without success, an internal austerity programme negotiated and signed a <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Bretton-Woods Institutions, whose principal objectives were to redress the major economic disequilibra and formulate the bases for a steady and sustained economic growth. This then led to a change in the policy strategy obliging the state to limit its role in the economic by adopting economic liberalisation measures such as the rehabilitation programme of public enterprises which took the form of liquidations, restructuring and most importantly privatisation. Based on the effective privatisation model, this article analyses the relations between the different privatisations realised and the changes observed in ownership and in the gains to the economy. Three questions are fundamental in this analysis. What were the major reasons for the sale of public enterprises? What preliminary assessment can be made of the privatisation operations so far effected? What are the necessary alternative reforms for a more cost-effective process...|$|E
40|$|The whole {{international}} society {{believes that if}} Korea and Thailand generally carry out the IMF programs, {{the fruit of the}} structure reform will be soon put across. In Indonesia, the way of IMF capital support has been changed from the existing 8. 25 <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreement</b> to extended credit agreement, so Indonesia gets more support from the international world. But there is an analysis that there is still a lot of uncertainty in Indonesia. Observing the "economic fruit" which {{was the result of the}} IMF programs in the countries mentioned above, the cognition of the international world is more evident. In spite of this, because of the rise of the exchange rate of the three countries above, going by US dollar, the rate of foreign exchange risk which is predicted by the index of foreign exchange rate crisis increased on the contrary with the sharp decrease of state financial resource. This is because the amount of foreign debts the country should reimburse increased accordingly due to the rise of exchange rate of Korea and Thailand in which the stability of the foreign exchange rate market recovered in a short period. This considered, in order to overcome the future foreign exchange crisis and decrease foreign debts, the most important thing is to emphasize the basic economic condition presents in the prediction index of foreign exchange crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the main}} features of Paraguay’s current tax system and its evolution since the early 1990 s. Paraguay is a poor and unequal country, even compared to Latin American standards. Its current tax system {{is the result of}} the radical fiscal reform of 1991, which replaced the previous obsolete and inconsistent system. In the decade after the reform, a growing number of tax amendments, exemptions and special regimes have been introduced, producing significant changes to the original structure and a considerable reduction of tax revenues. Furthermore, this tax system, dominated by indirect taxes and characterised by high levels of tax evasion, is rather ineffective in addressing inequality. Finally, tax revenues are significantly below their potential, due to the extent of the informal economy, the widespread tax evasion and the diffuse corruption of tax officers. A new fiscal reform, recommended by the IMF under the <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Agreement</b> of December 2003, was approved in June 2004. The reform aims to address the critical issues described, to rationalise the existing tax system and to better tackle tax evasion and inequality. However, a major obstacle to this reform is the ability of the Paraguay government to fully implement it. Its application has been initially delayed to the year 2006 and its contents partially weakened. Finally, despite recent changes, the tax system remains fundamentally biased towards indirect taxation, which yields approximately 80...|$|E

During the period from 1967 to the late 1970 s, the primary health care infrastructure was expanded quite significantly. Access to primary health facilities and medical personnel improved rapidly - dispensaries and health centers increased from 1, 210 in 1961 to 2, 839 in 1980. Population coverage by medical personnel rose sharply from one physician for every 21, 000 people in 1960 to one physician for every 15, 000 people in 1997. The number of nurses increased from one for every 10, 000 people in 1960 to one for every 5, 000 in 1997. In the late 1970 s, both Tanzania’s internal and external accounts were in imbalance. The economy suffered shocks because of oil price hikes (1979), fluctuations in international prices for gricultural exports and end of coffee boom (1978), war with Uganda (1978 - 79), detrimental weather conditions, and the break-up of the East- African community (1977). These shocks led to decline in expenditures on social sectors including health. In 1986, Tanzania signed a <b>stand-by</b> <b>agreement</b> with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a structural adjustment program with the World Bank.

Research results suggest that the ISE-listed firms follow the same firm-specific determinants of dividend policy as proposed by dividend theories, and as suggested by empirical studies conducted in developed markets following Turkey’s adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and inflation accounting, starting with the fiscal year 2003. Specifically, the primary firm-specific determinants of dividend policy are profitability, debt level, firm size, investment opportunities and firm age {{in the context of an}} emerging Turkish market. The findings of this thesis indicate that implementing major economic and structural reforms, adopting more flexible mandatory dividend policy regulations and attempting to prevent insider lending (non-arm’s length transactions) have led the ISE firms to adjust their cash dividends toward their target payout ratio by smoothing their dividends as suggested by Lintner (1956) and as exemplified by companies in developed markets. Hence, Turkish corporations have also been adopting stable dividend policies and using cash dividends as a signalling mechanism since 2003, with the implementation of severe economic and structural reforms.

Hence, Turkish corporations have also been adopting stable dividend policies and using cash dividends as a signalling mechanism since 2003, with the implementation of severe economic and structural reforms. Research evidence reveals that the ISE-listed firms have highly concentrated ownership structures; mostly owned by families followed by foreign investors, whereas other blockholders such as domestic financial institutions and the state, show relatively lower shareholdings. Moreover, evidence implies that the implementation of various major economic and structural reforms in cooperation with the IMF and the EU directives and best-practice international standards, which include the publication of the Capital Market Board (CMB) of Turkey’s Corporate Governance Principles in line with the World Bank and the OECD, starting with the fiscal year 2003, have resulted in significant improvements for the ISE-listed firms corporate governance, transparency and disclosure practices and better shareholder protection. Investors, in general, therefore, have preference for the potential long-run growth opportunity for the stocks they hold in the ISE, since Turkey is a fast-growing market, rather than requiring cash dividends as a monitoring mechanism or to control agency problems. This thesis extends empirical research on dividend policy into an emerging market, which not only passed laws for financial liberalisation, but implemented serious reforms to integrate with world markets by using a large panel dataset from Turkey. Although the implementation of major reforms and regulatory changes may produce different results in different emerging markets, it is believed that this thesis can be a valuable benchmark for further longitudinal and cross-country research on this respect of the dividend puzzle...|$|E
40|$|Egypt {{has shown}} good {{progress}} {{on a number}} of indicators for economic development in recent years. This progress, however, seems to only benefit the higher strata of society and not {{the vast majority of the}} population. In this thesis I take a look at how the transition to a liberal market economy has affected the peripheral governorate of Matruh on Egypt s northwest coast and how easy it is for small and medium enterprises to develop their businesses. I then try to reflect on how this data sheds light on the advantages and disadvantages of the current Egyptian economic model. Egypt officially shifted from a state-controlled to a liberal market economy in the 1990 s with their signing of a Structural Adjustment Loan with the World Bank and a <b>Stand-By</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the IMF. These institutions advocate integration of developing countries into the free market world economy, abolishment of all kinds of inward-looking protectionist strategies and reduction of the role of the state and public sector as much as possible. The critics of this neo-liberal strategy for development say that all of today s rich and developed countries have used protectionist strategies to nurture infant industries until they were able to compete on the international market. In light of the recent transition to a liberal market economy, proclaimed objectives for the Egyptian government are to promote investment and the size of the private sector, encourage the growth of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and have all areas of the country take part in development on an equal footing through a comprehensive decentralisation process. In my data it first of all becomes clear that Egypt remains an only partially liberalised country as the traditionally strong central state with its vast bureaucracy remains strong. On the other side, the economy has been liberalised in that it fully allows the forces of the free market to rule in the private sector. Also, the state has pulled out its support, and private businesses are no longer encouraged by state subsidy, directed credit or help with marketing. Judging by the impediments faced by my interviewees, the Egyptian economic model is currently one that has kept the disadvantages of socialism and added the problems of capitalism. First, representatives from the different trades and industries say that they lack opportunity to develop their businesses due to the cost and complications in relation to state bureaucracy. Second, they lack either sources for funding, or sufficient marketing, or both. What is more, the state remaining so centralised, peripheral regions like Matruh do not at all seem to get the same attention in terms of what state services there still are. Due to Matruh s still being characterised by its history as a remote and cut off area dominated by the rule of Bedouin tribes and its limited number of inhabitants, business is also to a great extent limited to the local market...|$|E
