5|$|The Welsh Assembly has the {{authority}} to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation known as Acts of the Assembly in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific <b>secondary</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Initially, the Assembly did {{not have}} primary {{legislative}} or fiscal powers, as these powers were reserved by Westminster. The Assembly did have powers to pass <b>secondary</b> <b>legislation</b> in devolved areas. Sometimes <b>secondary</b> <b>legislation</b> {{could be used to}} amend primary legislation, but the scope of this was very limited. For example, the first Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly power to amend primary legislation relating to the merger of certain public bodies. However, most secondary powers were conferred on the executive by primary legislation to give the executive (i.e. Ministers) more powers, and the Assembly has had wider legislative powers than appearances might suggest. For example, the Assembly delayed local elections due to be held in 2003 for a year by use of secondary powers, so that they would not clash with Assembly elections. In 2001 the UK parliament used primary legislation to delay for one month local elections in England during the Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic.|$|E
25|$|The European Union issues <b>secondary</b> <b>legislation</b> on {{environmental}} issues that are valid throughout the EU (so called regulations) and many directives that must be implemented into national legislation from the 28 member states (national states).

25|$|Contemporary Welsh Law {{is a term}} {{applied to}} the body of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>legislation</b> {{generated}} by the National Assembly for Wales, according to devolved authority granted in the Government of Wales Act 2006. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales. The first Assembly legislation to be officially proposed was called the NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008. These powers have been effective since May, 2007. It {{is the first time in}} almost 500 years that Wales has had its own laws, since Cyfraith Hywel was abolished and replaced by English law through the Laws in Wales Acts, passed between 1535 and 1542 by King Henry VIII of England.|$|E

When searching for these citations however the user is confronted with low recall and precision, due to inconsistent citation practices and poorly configured search engines.

40|$|The EU Nitrates Directive is of a prime {{importance}} {{in respect of}} sustaining the natural resources for the reduction and prevention of nitrate pollution resulting from agricultural activities, and it constitutes {{an integral part of}} the EU Water Framework Directive. Accepted by the European Council in 1991, the directive entered into force being published in Official Gazette in 2004 in Turkey as “Regulation on the Protection of Waters against Pollution Caused by Nitrates from Agricultural Sources. ” As of this date, works on harmonization have been intensely continued. The works brought together multiple organizations that are notable in terms of waterworks and ensured informatory exchange through the contributions of the EU member states. Approaching to the finalization of its harmonization process, Turkey will proclaim its country either a “border to border nitrate-sensitive zone” or “nitrate vulnerable zone” in order to issue the <b>secondary</b> <b>legislations</b> required by the Nitrates Directive in accordance with these approaches. This paper covers the current works conducted with regard to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive and it has been prepared aiming at inviting attentions to the current and possible complications in the implementation process. ...|$|R
500|$|Three {{types of}} {{judicial}} interpretation are commonly {{identified in the}} context of section 3: [...] "reading in", [...] "reading out" [...] and [...] "reading down". [...] "Reading in" [...] refers to adding in words that are not present in the statute so as to ensure compliance with Convention rights, and [...] "reading out" [...] removing words in a statute to do so. These processes had already been implemented with reference to the implementation of European legislation, so as to ensure compliance of domestic law with European law. Although accepted with <b>secondary</b> <b>legislation,</b> they remain controversial with primary legislation, since parliament would have included or omitted such words if it had had such an intent; reading in or out words would therefore conflict with parliamentary intention. Courts have, however, accepted these powers, and during the passing of the Human Rights Act, it was agreed that the courts would have such a power.|$|E
500|$|Section 3(2)(a) {{extends the}} scope of section 3 to past and future Acts of Parliament in {{addition}} to present legislation. It therefore contradicts the usual policy of implied repeal [...] whereby any inconsistency between statutes are resolved in favour of the later statute. The Human Rights Act must therefore be explicitly (or [...] "expressly") repealed by an Act of Parliament deliberately doing so, not merely be introducing contradictory legislation. The act therefore carries an additional normative force and has been considered constitutional in character as a result. It is widely recognised that parliament may never directly contradict convention rights, or at least do so very rarely. Sections 3(2)(b) and 3(2)(c) confirm the validity of all legislation, {{whether or not it}} has been interpreted under Section 3. Section 3 can therefore be said to protect primary legislation which is incompatible, and any <b>secondary</b> <b>legislation</b> made under such primary legislation.|$|E
