The present article reports on the construction of a `virtual herbarium' for the state-wide collection of flowering plants in the Herbarium JCB housed at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, that is expected to be launched soon. The taxonomic data on each species include all information presented on the herbarium specimen label, namely species name, author citation, <b>sub-species</b> <b>if</b> any, variety if any, family, subfamily, collection number, locations, date of collection, habitat and the collector's name. The data further comprise `flora' in which the species are described.
