5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small <b>star</b> <b>at</b> {{the very top of}} the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin <b>star</b> <b>at</b> the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. He had intended to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found the premises too expensive and purchased a 25-year lease on the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, {{and at the same}} time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E

He was a <b>star</b> <b>at</b> Crystal City High School, where he scored 3,068 points in his scholastic career, was twice named All-American, and was elected to the Missouri Association of Student Councils. He received 75 college scholarship offers, although he applied to only five schools and only scored a 485 out of 800 on the Verbal portion of the SAT, which—despite being likely in the top third of all test takers that year—normally would have caused selective schools like Princeton University to reject him.|$|E

5|$|Corvus {{contains}} no Messier objects. It has several galaxies and a planetary nebula observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a planetary nebula, NGC 4361.

5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} that has 0.764 Jupiter masses and 1.827 Jupiter radii. In other words, {{it is about}} three-fourths as massive as Jupiter, but is {{slightly}} less than twice Jupiter's size. HAT-P-33b orbits its <b>star</b> <b>at</b> an average distance of 0.0503 AU, which is about 5% of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This orbit is completed every 3.474474 days (83.39 hours). HAT-P-33b has an equilibrium temperature of 1838 K, which is almost fifteen times hotter than the measured equilibrium temperature of Jupiter (124 K).|$|E

5|$|Her role as {{a troubled}} nun in the Powell and Pressburger {{production}} of Black Narcissus in 1947 did indeed bring her {{to the attention of}} Hollywood producers. The film was a hit in the US, as well as the UK, and Kerr won the New York Film Critics' Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth-most popular local <b>star</b> <b>at</b> the box office. Soon she received the first of her Academy Award nominations for Edward, My Son, a 1949 drama set in England that co-starred Spencer Tracy.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion <b>star</b> <b>at</b> {{a distance of}} roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests {{it could not have}} formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is the <b>star</b> <b>at</b> {{the center}} of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with {{internal}} convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It {{is by far the most}} important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, The Restaurant {{was awarded}} three Michelin stars. White {{claimed to have}} become the youngest chef ever to have won a third star, but this was later disputed by Heinz Winkler. The same year, Ladenis also won his third <b>star</b> <b>at</b> fellow Rocco Forte hotel based restaurant Chez Nico. The media response {{at the time was}} to criticise White over the fact that despite his restaurant serving French cuisine, White had never travelled to France. White had actually travelled through France on trains, for family holidays in Italy with his mother as a child.|$|E
5|$|There are {{relatively}} few stars within ten light-years of the Sun. The closest is the triple star system Alpha Centauri, {{which is about}} 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair {{at a distance of}} 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun. The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs Barnard's <b>Star</b> (<b>at</b> 5.9ly), Wolf 359 (7.8ly), and Lalande 21185 (8.3ly).|$|E

He attended the University of Georgia on a scholarship and played on the school's baseball and basketball teams, becoming the captain of both for his senior year. He was named to the All-Southeastern Conference first-team as a shortstop in 1951.|$|E

5|$|WASP-15 is host to {{the planet}} WASP-15b. The planet, which is a Hot Jupiter, orbits its host <b>star</b> <b>at</b> a {{distance}} of 0.0499 AU every 3.7520656 days. WASP-15b was noted by its discoverers because of its anomalously high radius, which is 1.428 times that of Jupiter, compared to its mass, which is 0.542 {{times the size of}} Jupiter. WASP-15b's large radius cannot be explained solely by its proximity to its star, suggesting that some form of tidal heating or other internal heating mechanism is also involved.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{discovered}} in 2008 by the SuperWASP collaboration, {{which seeks to}} discover exoplanets that transit their host stars. The planet orbits its host <b>star</b> <b>at</b> a distance of 0.05 AU every four days. The mass of this planet is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; {{it is thought that}} some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{astronomy}} {{has been the}} identification of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would provide useful constraints on supernova models. As of 2006, the search for such a progenitor had been ongoing for longer than a century. Observation of the supernova SN 2011fe has provided useful constraints. Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope did not show a <b>star</b> <b>at</b> {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant as the source. The expanding plasma from the explosion was found to contain carbon and oxygen, making it likely the progenitor was a white dwarf primarily composed of these elements.|$|E
