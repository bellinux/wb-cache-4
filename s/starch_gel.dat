Starch granules create very strong and rigid gel networks. The <b>starch</b> <b>gel</b> network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network.

The spin-spin relaxation time (T(2)), showed water mobility of <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> was detected with starch concentrations 10 - 30 %. Generally, the TNuS 19 and TNu 67 at >= 20 % showed two components (T(2 a) and T(2 b)) in water mobility, where T(2 a) and T(2 b) related to solid-like and liquid-like water molecules in <b>starch</b> <b>gels,</b> respectively. However, the TCW 70 over the concentrations examined had only T 2 b component, {{higher than those of}} corresponding TNuS 19 and TNu 67. The storage (G') and loss (G '') moduli of <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> were in the order of TNuS 19 > TNu 67 > TCW 70. Texture analyzer analysis indicated that TNuS 19 had higher hardness, stickiness and adhesiveness than did the TNu 67 and TCW 70, and changed significantly with the starch concentration increase. The value of T(2 b) was highly correlated with physical properties of <b>starch</b> <b>gels,</b> especially with dynamic rheological parameters. It is suggested that amylose content may play a major role to influence the water mobility of <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> which affects the specific viscoelasticity and textural properties of <b>starch</b> <b>gels.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Starch becomes soluble {{in water}} when heated. The {{granules}} swell and burst, the semi-crystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule, forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixture's viscosity. This process is called starch gelatinization. During cooking, the starch becomes a paste and increases further in viscosity. During cooling or prolonged storage of the paste, the semi-crystalline structure partially recovers and the starch paste thickens, expelling water.

In {{this case the}} reproductive isolating barrier was probably a change from outcrossing to selfing, and was maintained by this and {{a high degree of}} inter-specific sterility with ssp. coronaria as a result of chromosomal structural differences. Using what was then the most modern molecular technique, <b>starch</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis, to determine the genetics of populations Gottlieb found that S. malheurensis had a subset of the genetic variability of ssp. coronaria. This, as well as its geographical close proximity, led Gottlieb to propose that S. malhurensis was a product of [...] "quantum speciation." [...] Additionally, S. malheurensis was found to be much less adapted to the local habitat than ssp. coronaria (hence the name malhurensis, which in French, [...] "Malheur" [...] means unhappiness or misfortune), indicating that it was probably not formed by disruptive selection.|$|E

They differ from each other by chromosomal structural differences, and hybrids between them are sterile. Lewis and Roberts proposed in 1956 that C. lingulata arose from C. biloba rapidly and in close proximity; in 1962 Lewis coined the term [...] "catastrophic selection" [...] to define its mode of orign. Gottlieb using <b>starch</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis, determined that indeed C. lingulata had a high degree of genetic similarity to C. biloba, with fewer alleles and reduced heterozygosity. Subsequent studies confirmed a sister species relationship using chloroplast DNA as well as nucleotide sequences of the gene phosphoglucose isomerase.

Significant changes (P< 0. 05) in the crude digestibility level, thermal properties, and the water separation (syneresis) of <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> (7. 0 %[*]db) during cold and frozen storage were observed due to the modification. Hydroxypropylation increased the gel stability, water solubility, digestibility, and storage stability of the native starches in the cold storage to a significant level. Lowered gelatinization and retrogradation enthalpies as well as gelatinization temperature were observed for derivatized starches compared to the native starch. Low levels of pasting stability with increased levels of breakdown and reduced cold paste viscosity were observed in the hydroxypropylated starch samples except for the Malaysian cultivar (S 5). Chemically modified <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> stored under cold storage did not show a syneresis for two weeks in the cycle and the frozen storage showed much improved stability in the <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> within the four-week cycle.

5000|$|Despite {{their close}} genetic {{relationship}} {{and the ability}} to inter-breed, {{there are a number of}} diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by <b>starch</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains. The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs. Dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive [...] "stop" [...] between forehead and nose. The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them. [...] Most dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. So-called primitive dogs such as Dingoes and Basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle. Dogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a 6 in in the Chihuahua to 3.3 ft in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called [...] "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" [...] or [...] "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed their coat.|$|E

Also, both flour and <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> in the grit fraction had much higher values for hardness, guminess and chewiness than their flour counterparts. <b>Starch</b> <b>gels</b> were positively correlated with flour gel hardness in both dry-milled fractions implying that starch is a major determinant of gel texture. The influence of starch on the texture characteristics of <b>starch</b> and flour <b>gels</b> from the dry-milled grit and flour fractions appeared {{to be related to the}} fine structural differences of amylopectins. Starch from the grit fraction with higher amount of long chain amylopectin (DPn 70 - 75) was shown to significantly and positively correlate with stronger flour and <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> from this fraction. Among the ten corn cultivars, amylose content determined from size exclusion chromatography was significantly correlated with textural parameters of <b>starch</b> <b>gels</b> from both two dry-milled fractions. We found that the thermal parameters of gelatinization and retrogradation revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were also related to amylopectin structure. Both the onset temperature (To) and enthalpy (ΔH) of gelatinization were positively correlated with the amount of the long chains (DPn 70 - 75) and negatively correlated with the extent of chain branching of the amylopectin. The enthalpy (ΔH) of retrogradation was positively correlated with the proportion of the long chains and average chain length of the amylopectin among the ten corn cultivars. This study also showed that gelatinization and retrogradation properties of starch and flour correlated to some aspects of gel texture, particularly gel hardness. The findings suggest that fine structure of amylopectin, including chain length distribution, chain branching and average chain length, affects the crystalline structure of native starch and retrogradation of gelatinized starch. These genotypic and kernel spatial differences in starch structure have not been shown prior to this report and could have significant impact on those trying to tailor make corn flours and starches for precise applications in the food industry. ...|$|R
