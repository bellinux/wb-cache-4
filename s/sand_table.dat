500|$|Kippenberger became {{immersed}} in the Rangiora community, serving on the local council and becoming involved in various committees. He also retained {{an interest in the}} military and in 1924, joined the Territorial Force. [...] He firmly believed that a large scale conflict would once again occur in Europe, and he wanted to be prepared for this eventuality. Therefore, he built up an extensive military library and studied the theory of warfare and analysed past campaigns to ascertain strategy and tactics for a given situation. He noted the influence of landscape on the outcomes of battles and the qualities of a successful military commander. [...] He even set up a large <b>sand</b> <b>table</b> in his office at his law practice for war gaming. [...] What he would learn from his studies, he put into practice in his training with the Territorials. By 1936, he was a lieutenant-colonel, commanding the 1st Battalion of the Canterbury Regiment.|$|E

This has taken the form of <b>sand</b> <b>tables,</b> miniatures, board games, and computer games. The current tension between entertainment and military applications of games is just the return of similar concerns that surrounded the gaming tools and technologies of previous generations. Dynamic representations of the physical world are interesting and useful tools in a number of fields, to include the military, city planning, architecture, education, and entertainment. Computer games are tools that allow all of these audiences to accomplish similar goals...|$|R

So it is necessary to apply the use of PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipe <b>sand</b> and water <b>table.</b> This study aims to determine the effect of PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipe <b>sand</b> and water <b>table</b> game against the early science ability of children aged 4 - 5 years in TK Negeri Pembina 1 Pekanbaru City. The sample used in this study were 18 children. The data collection technique used is the observation sheet. Technique of data analysis using t-test test by using program of SPSS 18. The research hypothesis is the use of PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipe <b>sand</b> and water <b>table</b> has an influence on the early science ability of children aged 4 - 5 years in TK Negeri Pembina 1 Pekanbaru City. This can be known from the analysis of data obtained tcount = 16, 171 and Sig. (2 -tailed) = 0. 000. Because Sig. (2 -tailed) = 0. 000 < 0, 05 it can be concluded that there is a significant difference in early childhood science ability after using PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipe <b>sand</b> and water <b>table</b> in learning. So it means Ho is rejected and Ha accepted which means there is a very significant difference between before and after doing experiments by applying PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipe <b>sand</b> and water <b>table.</b> The influence of PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) pipe <b>sand</b> and water <b>table</b> on the early science of children aged 4 - 5 years in TK Negeri Pembina 1 Pekanbaru City is 54. 41 %...|$|R

50|$|Sand tables {{have been}} used for {{military}} planning and wargaming for many years as a field expedient, small-scale map, and in training for military actions. In 1890 a <b>Sand</b> <b>table</b> room was built at the Royal Military College of Canada for use in teaching cadets military tactics; this replaced the old <b>sand</b> <b>table</b> room in a pre-college building, in which the weight of the sand had damaged the floor. The use of sand tables increasingly fell out of favour with improved maps, aerial and satellite photography, and later, with digital terrain simulations. Today, virtual and conventional sand tables are used in operations training.|$|E

40|$|The {{military}} has always worked to fight their battles in a synthetic or artificial environment before fighting {{them in the}} real world. There are so many variables that getting everything right is extremely difficult. Planning and rehearsal are primary tools for accomplishing this. <b>Sand</b> <b>tables</b> with wooden and stone markers that allowed commanders to explain their plan to dozens of soldiers {{were some of the}} earliest virtual worlds. Board wargames replaced the sand with paper and added rules so a player could actually do some predictions in a crude virtual space. New technologies like movies, electronics, hydraulics, computers, and networks have all changed the face and usefulness of these military tools. In preparation for sending soldiers to Europe during World War II, the United States Army created extensive field maneuvers in the forests and hills of the state of Louisiana [1]. Tens of thousands of soldiers rehearsed their roles and used their new radios to report their actions to commanders who were miles away. This allowed these commanders to rehearse their strategies for positioning and moving large units, as well as the protocols for transmitting that information accurately to the units in the field. These Louisiana Maneuvers planted the seeds for large scale, live rehearsal which would become the primary mission for the world’s largest training range...|$|R
