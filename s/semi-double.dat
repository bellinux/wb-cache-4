25|$|The 1955 {{reform of}} Pope Pius XII {{did not have}} this {{division}} of Sundays into classes. Instead it laid down that the Sundays of Advent and Lent and those that follow up to Low Sunday, and also Pentecost Sunday, are celebrated as doubles of the first class, and outrank all feasts; but when feasts of the first class occur on the second, third or fourth Sunday of Advent, masses of the Feast are permitted. Sundays previously celebrated in the <b>semi-double</b> rite were raised to the double rite. A feast of our Lord occurring on a Sunday per annum {{was to take the}} place of the Sunday.|$|E

40|$|We study {{two-dimensional}} N=(2, 2) {{gauge theory}} and its dualized system {{in terms of}} complex (linear) superfields and their alternatives. Although this technique itself is not new, we can obtain a new model, the so-called "semi-doubled" GLSM. Similar to doubled sigma model, this involves both the original and dual degrees of freedom simultaneously, whilst the latter only contribute to the system via topological interactions. Applying this to the N=(4, 4) GLSM for H-monopoles, i. e., smeared NS 5 -branes, we obtain its T-dualized systems in quite an easy way. As a bonus, we also obtain the <b>semi-doubled</b> GLSM for an exotic 5 ^ 3 _ 2 -brane whose background is locally nongeometric. In the low energy limit, we construct the <b>semi-doubled</b> NLSM which also generates the conventional string worldsheet sigma models. In {{the case of the}} NLSM for 5 ^ 3 _ 2 -brane, however, we find that the Dirac monopole equation does not make sense any more because the physical information is absorbed into the divergent part via the smearing procedure. This is nothing but the signal which indicates that the nongeometric feature emerges in the considering model. Comment: 34 pages, version published in JHE...|$|R
50|$|Gardeners and nurserymen {{have also}} created hybrids between less closely related species. The {{earliest}} was probably H. × nigercors, {{a cross between}} H. niger and H. argutifolius (formerly H. lividus subsp. corsicus or H. corsicus, hence the name) first made in 1931. H. × sternii, a cross between H. argutifolius and H. lividus, first exhibited in 1947, is named after the celebrated British plantsman Sir Frederick Stern. H. × ballardiae (H. niger crossed with H. lividus) and H. × ericsmithii (H. niger crossed with H. × sternii) similarly commemorate the noted British nursery owners Helen Ballard and Eric Smith. In recent years, Ashwood Nurseries (of Kingswinford in the English Midlands), already well known for its Ashwood Garden Hybrids (H. × hybridus singles, <b>semi-doubles,</b> doubles and anemone-centres), has created hybrids between H. niger and H. thibetanus (called H. 'Pink Ice'), and between H. niger and H. vesicarius (called H. 'Briar Rose'). The gardenworthiness of these hybrids has still to be proven.|$|R

60|$|It may {{be worth}} while briefly to give the {{well-known}} history of one class of roses. In 1793 some wild Scotch roses (R. spinosissima) were transplanted into a garden (10/181. Mr. Sabine in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 285.); and one of these bore flowers slightly tinged with red, from which a plant was raised with semi-monstrous flowers, also tinged with red; seedlings from this flower were <b>semi-double,</b> and by continued selection, in about nine or ten years, eight sub-varieties were raised. In the course of less than twenty years these double Scotch roses had so much increased in number and kind, that twenty-six well-marked varieties, classed in eight sections, were described by Mr. Sabine. In 1841 (10/182. 'An Encyclop. of Plants' by J.C. Loudon 1841 page 443.) {{it is said that}} three hundred varieties could be procured in the nursery-gardens near Glasgow; and these are described as blush, crimson, purple, red, marbled, two-coloured, white, and yellow, and as differing much in {{the size and shape of}} the flower.|$|E
60|$|In {{the male}} Ibla, {{abortion}} {{has been carried}} to an extraordinary and, I should think, almost unparalleled extent. Of the twenty-one segments believed to be normally present in every Crustacean, or of the seventeen known {{to be present in}} Cirripedes, the three anterior segments are here well developed, forming the peduncle: the mouth consists as usual of three small segments: the succeeding eight segments are represented by the rudimentary and functionless thorax, supporting only two pair of distorted, rudimentary and functionless cirri: the seven segments of the abdomen have disappeared, {{with the exception of the}} excessively minute caudal appendages; so that, of the twenty-one normal segments, fifteen are more or less aborted. The state of the cirri is curious, and may be compared to that of the anthers in a <b>semi-double</b> flower; for they are not simply rudimentary in size and function, but they are monstrous, and generally do not even correspond on opposite sides of the same individual. As males in other classes of the animal kingdom often retain some female characters, so here (though the case is not strictly analogous[50]) the male possesses the cementing apparatus, which homologically is part of an ovarian tube modified.|$|E
2500|$|The decree [...] "Divino afflatu" [...] (November 1, 1911) {{involves}} {{important changes}} in the old Roman Rite office. There is an entire rearrangement of the psalms (see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X) with new ones appointed for {{each day of the}} week. These psalms are to be recited with their antiphons, not only at the Office de tempore (Sundays and feriæ) but also on feasts of a lesser rite than doubles of the second class, that is to say, on simples, semidoubles (double minors), and double majors. On feasts which are doubles of the second class and a fortiori of the first class, as well as on feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Angels, and Apostles, the psalms are proper to the feast as heretofore. On all feasts, of whatever rite, the second part of vespers, that is, the capitulum, hymn, antiphon of the [...] "Magnificat", is taken from the Sanctorale. On <b>semi-doubles</b> and those of a lesser rite the suffrages are now reduced to a single antiphon and orison which is common to all the saints heretofore commemorated, whilst the preces ("Miserere" [...] and versicles) formerly imposed on the greater feriæ are now suppressed.|$|R
60|$|Many other {{instances}} {{could be added}} of roses varying by buds. The white Provence rose apparently originated in this way. (11/46. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 759.) M. Carriere states (page 36) that he himself knows of five varieties thus produced by the Baronne Prevost. The double and highly-coloured Belladonna rose has produced by suckers both semi- double and almost single white roses (11/47. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 242.); whilst suckers from one of these <b>semi-double</b> white roses reverted to perfectly characterised Belladonnas. In St. Domingo, varieties of the China rose propagated by cuttings often revert {{after a year or}} two into the old China rose. (11/48. Sir R. Schomburgk 'Proc. Linn. Soc. Bot.' volume 2 page 132.) Many cases have been recorded of roses suddenly becoming striped or changing their character by segments: some plants of the Comtesse de Chabrillant, which is properly rose-coloured, were exhibited in 1862 (11/49. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 619.), with crimson flakes on a rose ground. I have seen the Beauty of Billiard with a quarter and with half the flower almost white. 'The Austrian bramble (R. lutea) not rarely (11/50. Hopkirk 'Flora Anomala' 167.) produces branches with pure yellow flowers; and Prof. Henslow has seen exactly half the flower of a pure yellow, and I have seen narrow yellow streaks on a single petal, of which the rest was of the usual copper colour.|$|E
6000|$|The Dahlia {{has been}} {{referred}} to by almost every author who has written on the variation of plants, because it is believed that all the varieties are descended from a single species, and because all have arisen since 1802 in France, and since 1804 in England. (10/188. Salisbury in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 1812 pages 84, 92. A <b>semi-double</b> variety was produced in Madrid in 1790.) Mr. Sabine remarks that [...] "it seems as if some period of cultivation had been required before the fixed qualities of the native plant gave way and began to sport into those changes which now so delight us." [...] (10/189. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 1820 page 225.) The flowers have been greatly modified in shape from a flat to a globular form. Anemone and ranunculus-like races (10/190. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 6 1830 page 77.) which differ in the form and arrangement of the florets, have arisen; also dwarfed races, one of which is only eighteen inches in height. The seeds vary much in size. The petals are uniformly coloured or tipped or striped, and present an almost infinite diversity of tints. Seedlings of fourteen different colours (10/191. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 1035.) have been raised from the same plant; yet, as Mr. Sabine has remarked, [...] "many of the seedlings follow their parents in colour." [...] The period of flowering has been considerably hastened, and this has probably been effected by continued selection. Salisbury, writing 1808, says that they then flowered from September to November; in 1828 some new dwarf varieties began flowering in June (10/192. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 1 page 91; and Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 3 1828 page 179.); and Mr. Grieve informs me that the dwarf purple Zelinda in his garden is in full bloom by the middle of June and sometimes even earlier. Slight constitutional differences have been observed between certain varieties: thus, some kinds succeed much better in one part of England than in another (10/193. Mr. Wildman in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 87. 'Cottage Gardener' April 8, 1856 page 33.) and it has been noticed that some varieties require much more moisture than others. (10/194. M. Faivre has given an interesting account of the successive variations of the Chinese primrose, since its introduction into Europe about the year 1820: 'Revue des Cours Scientifiques' June 1869 page 428.) ...|$|E

Feasts ranked as simples prior to 1955 were reduced to commemorations; however, on ferias per annum on which the commemoration of a saint, formerly of simple rank, happened to fall, the celebrant was permitted to say the Mass of the commemorated saint in full as a festal Mass, while saying the Office of the feria with commemoration of the saint.
