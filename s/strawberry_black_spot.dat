40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to develop and improve the methods for the detection and improvement of <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> and to evaluate the measures which were made for the improvement of <b>black</b> <b>spots.</b> <b>Black</b> <b>spots</b> are road sections on which relatively or absolutely many accidents occur. <b>Black</b> <b>spot</b> studies exist of statistical analyses of accident data related to road and traffic characteristics and the methods required to detect <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> and causes of the development of <b>black</b> <b>spots.</b> In general there are sufficient suggestions for more objective, statistical methods for the detection of <b>black</b> <b>spots.</b> For the detection of the causes of <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> there are not such methods. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures is necessary to test and to adapt {{the research}} results. Hereto objective methods should be used. In this report the degree to which it is possible to assess the relative lack of safety at hazardous road locations by means of relatively simple traffic data is studied...|$|R
