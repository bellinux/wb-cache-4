5|$|A {{division}} of the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), regulates <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. trucking industry. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for interstate commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways known as the National Network (NN).

5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the brief}} April War, the Germans had {{captured}} over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered {{them to be}} of little use for the Luftwaffe, so {{it was decided to}} equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft. These aircraft, scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired and stocks of fuel and spare parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> their families.|$|E
5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Viborg {{took place}} in the spring of 1710 during the Great Northern War (1700–1721), as a second attempt by the Russians to capture the {{fortress}} port of Viborg (Vyborg), near the modern border between Russia and Finland, after a failed attempt in 1706. After the outbreak of the war, Swedish forces had fortified themselves in the port of Viborg. In order to assure <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg, Peter the Great ordered the Swedish fort to be secured. A first unsuccessful attempt was made in 1706. Later plans were put on hold because of other ongoing conflicts but, after the Russian success at the Battle of Poltava in June 1709, the men and resources were available to capture the town.|$|E

5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|USS Theodore Roosevelt {{and later}} {{carriers}} have slight structural differences {{from the earlier}} Nimitz carriers such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on USS George Washington, and the high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with USS John C. Stennis. More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> both crew members and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of <b>safety</b> <b>for</b> divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E
