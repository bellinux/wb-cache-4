The next year, the Goldpanners hosted their first annual Midnight Sun Baseball Game, a tradition that had been conducted since 1905 and continues under the Goldpanners' auspices today.

5|$|White Zombie premiered on July 28, 1932, in New York City's Rivoli Theatre.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Anarchy, {{the number}} of <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> England began to {{increase}} sharply. By 1297, 120 new towns had been established, and in 1350 – by when the expansion had effectively ceased – there were around 500 towns in England. Many of these new towns were centrally planned: Richard I created Portsmouth, John founded Liverpool, and successive monarchs followed with Harwich, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, Royston, Baldock, Wokingham, Maidenhead and Reigate. The new towns were usually located with access to trade routes in mind, rather than defence, and the streets were laid out to make access to the town's market convenient. A growing percentage of England's population lived in urban areas; estimates suggest that this rose from around 5.5% in 1086 to up to 10% in 1377.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{switch from}} amateur to {{professional}} continued in 1968, when {{for the first}} time the chorus was supplemented by a smaller, professional group of singers; the mix of amateur and professional choristers continued over the next five years. At the end of the 1960s the main WNO company, now a year-round operation, consisted of 8 salaried principal singers, 57 guest soloists and a chorus of 90 amateurs and 32 professionals. As well as the Bournemouth players, the company engaged the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, City of Birmingham Symphony and Ulster orchestras for different venues. In the last season of the decade 32 performances were given in Cardiff and 61 elsewhere in the UK. In addition to the main company, WNO maintained two smaller groups: one, with orchestra, toured Welsh towns, the other, consisting of 12 singers with piano, toured 79, mostly <b>small,</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> Wales and England. WNO instituted its own training scheme for young singers during the decade.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} <b>small</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> the Driftless Area, {{especially}} in river valleys, at or upstream from the Mississippi. <b>Small</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> a deep steep valley {{going down to}} the Mississippi are at risk every 50 to 100 years or so of a major flood, as with the wreck of Gays Mills, Wisconsin, in August 2007, or the holding of the levee in Houston, Minnesota, (on the South Fork Root River) at the same time.

25|$|One {{explanation}} for the relatively low level of NRW may be that most Chinese live in dense apartment complexes, which results in compact distribution systems.

25|$|Despite {{the length}} of the season and amount of land burnt, the fires were {{contained}} to mostly unoccupied regions such as the Victorian Alps, national parks and remnant bushland.
