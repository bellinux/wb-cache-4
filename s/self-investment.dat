We show that, under this setting, simple contracts protected by specific performance remedies may generate hold-up and thus parties' incentives to under-invest.

40|$|This paper {{resolves}} three empirical puzzles in outsourcing by formalizing {{the adaptation}} cost of long-term performance contracts. Side-trading {{with a new}} partner alongside a long- term contract (to exploit an adaptation-requiring investment) is usually less effective than switching to the new partner when the contract expires. So long-term contracts that prevent holdup of specific investments may induce holdup of adaptation investments. Contract length therefore trades of specific and adaptation investments. Length should increase with the importance and specificity of <b>self-investments,</b> and decrease with the importance of adaptation investments for which side-trading is ineffective. My general model also shows how optimal length falls with cross-investments and wasteful investments. Contract length, market forces, incomplete contracts, holdup...|$|R

First, we show that absent initial contracts (i. e., preliminary agreements) between the parties, total efficiency increases when the buyers act competitively using implicit contractual coordination, i. e., contractual menus. Second, we show that introducing initial simple contracts allows parties to reach the first best only under cooperative common agency. Absent this machinery, competition among the principals emerges as a more efficient governance structure for common agency in incomplete transactions...|$|R

Prescription of lipid-lowering drugs, which increased substantially over this period, is used as the measure of State investment. Using bivariate and trivariate probit models, we allow for the endogeneity of the doctor's decision to prescribe and offer smoking cessation advice. We find that unobservable characteristics affecting the prescription of drugs are positively correlated with those affecting smoking advice and negatively correlated with those affecting the propensity to quit. Our results indicate that prescription of lipid-lowering drugs to individuals with cardiovascular disease increases the probability of smoking cessation by 20 – 28 percentage points...|$|R
40|$|Forests {{and trees}} may play {{important}} roles in human health outcomes and choices made by individuals in urban areas. Disruptions to forest amenities and tree canopy coverage caused by shocks to the natural environment may affect urban air quality, behavioral decisions, time use habits, and environmental management. This work exploits two distinct and unrelated shocks to forests in the United States to investigate the environmental and health economic links in urban areas between people and trees, and a proposed deeply ingrained role for environmental health in how people live, interact, optimize in their communities. 	The first chapter argues that environmental quality and forest amenities are important determinants of health and behavioral patterns in urban areas. The conclusion is that further investigations into the indirect market and nonmarket effects of forests and trees on the urban economy are necessary to better guide <b>self-investments</b> in health and management of natural resources. Chapter 2 examines one mechanism through which shocks to the natural environment caused by forest fires in the Mountain West affect health in high-density communities distant from the flame zone. Using a case study wildfire event in eastern Arizona that brought smoke over Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2011, this chapter advances the methodology by which wildfire smoke damages are assessed by modifying a relatively new US EPA benefit transfer computer program, coupling it with original household survey data, and demonstrating {{how it can be}} applied to wildfire smoke events. This chapter concludes that not only are wildfire smoke events costly in urban areas, but that perhaps wildfire smoke is more toxic to health than conventional urban air pollution, necessitating more deliberate and nuanced choices by analysts tasked with estimating the damages of wildfire events. 	Chapter 3 exploits a different shock to forest cover, caused by the emerald ash borer (EAB), to investigate heterogeneity in urban invasive species management when health is directly accounted for by environmental managers and policymakers. Simulation results show that accounting for health impacts associated with lost tree cover increases net benefits of management by more than 1100 % in a combined management model and leads to mortality reductions of 21 persons over 50 years and 5, 500 cases of reduced morbidity over the same time period for a representative EAB infested county in the US. Additionally, results indicate that a “one size fits all” management approach may be inappropriate for responding to large-scale invasive species infestations due to heterogeneity in county demographics, underlying health incidence, and tree coverage. 	Chapter 4 further exploits the shock to forest and tree cover caused by EAB to examine behavioral changes in infested areas. Specifically, this chapter investigates how a shock to environmental quality caused by detection of EAB influences labor-leisure tradeoffs made by residents of infested areas using data from the nationally-representative American Time Use Survey. Econometric results from a variety of models indicate a negative relationship between EAB detection and daily outdoor leisure time in addition to a contemporaneous positive relationship between EAB detection and daily time spent on labor supply activities. These findings exist primarily along the extensive margin and persist after controlling for year and area fixed effects and daily weather conditions. Changes are persistent; lasting for 2 years and longer. 	The overall conclusion presented in chapter 5 is that forests and trees have economically meaningful impacts on health outcomes and individual behavioral patterns in urban areas as a result of shocks to environmental quality. It may be useful for policymakers and environmental managers to consider forest amenities, and disruption to forest quality in particular, when setting environmental and labor market policy. Accounting for the links between nature, health, and optimal choices, may lead to better informed policy, particularly in high-density populated areas where impacts of trees are perhaps the greatest.

3000|$|<b>Self-investment</b> {{concerns}} {{the investment of}} personal aspects into an object that causes the object to flow from the self, fostering {{a sense of ownership}} for the object and self-identification of it (Brown et al. 2014; Paré et al. 2006). In this study, <b>self-investment</b> into a VLE refers to teachers’ contribution of themselves into using it such as their ideas, time, energy, efforts, and talents. Cloud-based VLEs offer virtual equivalents of conventional educational concepts, wherein teaching and learning can be conducted virtually. Teachers are very much self-directed in orchestrating activities in the VLE. Designing VLE contents is not the core of the teaching profession, and teachers need to devote more of themselves in activities to create learning sites, customise online assessment, and syntesise learning style reports. By investing their ideas, time, energy, and talents into the VLE, teachers may feel that the resultant contents reflect part of themselves, inducing ownership for the VLE. A similar mechanism is found in information system development, where users feel that the system flows from the self when they contribute their effort, skills, ideas, and attention into developing it (Barki et al. 2008; Paré et al. 2006). More recently, <b>self-investment</b> was also found to be the strongest predictor of psychological ownership in the social media context (Chen et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016).

The subjects of this research were the tenth grade students of SMA N 7 Purworejo In this research, the English teacher functions as the controller and the facilitator of English learning activity, and the researcher functions as the teacher’s collaborator and the observer of {{the implementation of the}} action. The steps were: reconnaissance, plan, action and observation, and reflection. The research was conducted in two cycles. The cycle consists of two stages. At the first stage, the students were asked to do self-discovery activity in order to improve their <b>self-investment.</b> The next stage, the students worked in groups in order to improve their language skills. Since in the Cycle 1, the research was not successful yet and the focus of the problems was still the same as the problem in Cycle 1, the researcher still used self-discovery and jigsaw activity to improve the students’ language skills. However, the topic given in Cycle 2 was different from the topic in Cycle 1.

40|$|The {{engagement}} of employees {{has been a}} 'hot topic' among business and organizational behaviour researchers, consultants and human resource practitioners in recent years. Engagement is a motivational concept. In this study employee engagement (or job engagement) {{has been defined as}} an employee's full investment of oneself in one's work activities. The study nevertheless accepts that the field of engagement has been plagued with numerous terms, definitions, measures and theories. Although engagement research originated in the early 1990 s, there is today a lack of consensus and consistency about important conceptual issues, such as definition and dimensionality. The current scholarly work sought to bring some clarity to the field by firstly recognising two broad streams for which the conceptualizing, theorising and operationalizing of engagement have differed markedly. The <b>self-investment</b> and anti-burnout engagement streams were named. Next, a domain for research focus was selected. The <b>self-investment</b> engagement stream, which offers the most unique, objective and encompassing meaning and theory of engagement, was identified. This stream recognises Kahn's 1990 work as the foundation of engagement study. The conceptualization of engagement as the full-investment of oneself, physically, cognitively and emotionally in one's work has been derived from this early contribution. The theory of engagement found within the <b>self-investment</b> stream, proposes that several antecedents influence three psychological conditions, which in turn predict engagement. in the current study, task-relevant job resources, socially relevant job resources and job demand characteristic were incorporated in the theoretical framework for evaluation. The job characteristic antecedents are task significance, skill variety, autonomy, feedback, internal interaction, work overload, friendship opportunity and managerial support. The psychological conditions of engagement are known as psychological meaningfulness, availability and safety. The study's results have supported the hypotheses that task significance and internal interaction are direct predictors of meaningfulness; autonomy, feedback, internal interaction and work overload are predictors of psychological availability; while, friendship opportunity and managerial support are significantly associated with psychological safety. The three psychological conditions were positively associated with engagement. It was found that psychological meaningfulness mediated the associations between the other two conditions and engagement. Then, skill variety showed a direct positive association with engagement, rather than an indirect association via one of the psychological conditions...|$|E

30|$|Extant {{literature}} has identified three key experiences as antecedents that bring about psychological ownership of an object: (a) experienced control, (b) coming to know intimately, and (c) <b>self-investment</b> (Pierce et al. 2001; Brown et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2016). Experienced control {{refers to a}} personal sense of control over a particular object experienced through its functional use, which {{give rise to a}} feeling of possessiveness. Control plays an important part on the semantics of ownership, and it is reasoned that objects that individuals exercise most control tend to be regarded as “theirs” (Pierce and Jussila 2011). Environments which afford individuals to experience control can foster the development of psychological ownership, as there are greater opportunities for exploration and to exercise discretion which satisfy the need to be effectance. Coming to know intimately about an object refers to the breadth and depth of knowledge an individual has about a target object. The more information acquired about an object, the more is known thoroughly about it. Hence, this experience promotes a sense of ownership as knowledge breeds familiarity, strengthen association, and increase proximity between a particular object and its owner (Brown et al. 2014; Pierce et al. 2001). <b>Self-investment</b> into an object refers to personal contribution invested into an object, such as one’s energy, time, imagination, and talents (Brown et al. 2014; Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981). By investing oneself into an object, individuals may consider the object to be part of themselves due to their personal contributions which emerged from the self.|$|E

30|$|<b>Self-investment</b> into a VLE {{appeared}} {{to be the most important}} antecedent of psychological ownership, consistent with existing research (Brown et al. 2014; Lee and Chen 2011; Zhao et al. 2016). This suggests that the most profound means for teachers to develop psychological ownership is through the investment of their time, effort, energy, ideas, intellect, and talents in the VLE. When teachers invest their mental energy into creating learning contents, this form of investment is considered a form of digital cultivation that transforms digital products into meaningful possessions (Watkins et al. 2016). As teachers create their digital products, they may be involved in the ritualised practices of storing, saving, or backing-up their products for fear of losing them. These activities reinforces teachers’ possessive behaviour towards their VLE accounts, because it contains the digital products that they had spent much effort to create.|$|E
