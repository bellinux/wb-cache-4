25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden <b>spiny</b> <b>mouse,</b> Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, streaked scrub warbler, mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and common genet, and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|E
25|$|Mammals are not {{generally}} {{thought of as}} pollinators, but some rodents, bats and marsupials are significant pollinators and some even specialise in such activities. In South Africa certain species of Protea (in particular Protea humiflora, P. amplexicaulis, P. subulifolia, P. decurrens and P. cordata) are adapted to pollination by rodents (particularly Cape <b>Spiny</b> <b>Mouse,</b> Acomys subspinosus) and elephant shrews (Elephantulus species). The flowers are borne near the ground, are yeasty smelling, not colourful, and sunbirds reject the nectar with its high xylose content. The mice apparently can digest the xylose and they eat large quantities of the pollen. In Australia pollination by flying, gliding and earthbound mammals has been demonstrated.|$|E
40|$|Adult {{and young}} gerbils and <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> were tested {{for their ability}} to {{discriminate}} between a short and a long arm in a T-maze. Animals were given 20 training trials/day for 5 days. The gerbils' performance improved from about 45 % correct responses on Day 1 to about 80 % on Day 5; the performances of the <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> stayed at about 40 - 50 % over the training period. There were no age differences. These findings complement those of an earlier study in which <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> did demonstrate depth perception on a visual cliff while the gerbils did not. Both sets of data are interpreted from an evolutionary perspective which relates depth perception ability to the organism's natural ecological niche: gerbils are burrowing animals and <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> are surface and rock dwellers...|$|R

Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts.

The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E

40|$|The {{pancreatic}} B-cell contains microtubules, {{which are}} thought {{to participate in the}} process of insulin release. In order to disclose a possible abnormaltiy of this B-cell microtubular system in animals with islet dysfunction, isolated islets from normal rats and mice, as well as from diabetic mutant mice (DBM <b>mice)</b> and from <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> (Acomys cahirinus) were incubated in the presence of vincristine, which causes the precipitation of the microtubular protein into paracrystalline deposits. Ultrastructural examination of the islets indicated that the volume-density of vincristine-induced deposits was markedly reduced in B-cells of <b>spiny</b> <b>mice,</b> when compared to that found in normal rats and mice and DBM mice. Exposure of the islets from <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> to a high glucose concentration, concomittantly to vincristine, caused a further reduction in vincristine-induced crystals content of the B-cell. It is speculated that an impairment of the B-cell microtubular system may account for the deficiency of insulin release found in <b>spiny</b> <b>mice.</b> Comparative StudyJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that the response of prey species to predatory risk comprised either freezing (when the prey remained immobile), or fleeing (when it ran frantically in order to remove itself from {{the vicinity of the}} predator). Other studies, however, have suggested that the prey will adjust its behavior to risk level. The present study was designed to follow the attacks of a barn owl (Tyto alba) on common <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> (Acomys cahirinus) and social voles (Microtus socialis guntherei), in order to reveal the correspondence between the behavior of the owl, the risk level at each phase of the owl's attack, and the defensive behavior of the rodents. Results <b>Spiny</b> <b>mice</b> dramatically increased the traveled distance upon the appearance of the owl, and kept moving during its attack while taking long trajectories of locomotion. Defensive response in voles dichotomized: in some voles traveled distance dropped when the owl appeared, reaching zero during its attack. In other voles, traveled distance dramatically increased once the owl appeared and further increased under its attack. These defensive responses developed by gradual tuning of normal locomotor behavior in accordance with the level of risk. Conclusions The phenotypic difference in defensive behavior between voles and <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> probably stems from their different habitats and motor capacities. Agility and running capacity, together with a relatively sheltered natural habitat, make fleeing the most appropriate response for <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> during owl attack. Clumsiness and relatively limited motor capacities, together with an open natural habitat, account for the dichotomy to freezing or fleeing in voles. Thus, the apparent species-specific anti-predator response in <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> and voles is based on species-specific normal locomotor behavior, which depends on the species-specific ecology and motor capacity, and behaviors like defensive attack or escape jump that are specific to life threat. The latter behaviors are brief, and irregularly inlaid in the ongoing locomotor behavior. Finally, our results show that in both voles and <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> there is a gradual transition from normal to defensive behavior in accordance with the increase in risk level. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Rodents {{typically}} avoid illuminated {{and open}} areas, favoring dark or sheltered environments for activity. While previous studies {{focused on the}} effect of these environmental attributes on the level of activity, the present study tested whether the spatio-temporal structure of activity was also modified in illuminated compared with dark and complex compared with open arenas. For this, we tested common <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> (Acomys cahirinus) in empty or stone-containing arenas with lights on or lights off. Results In an illuminated or open arena, <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> moved in less frequent but longer trips with relatively long distances between consecutive stops. In contrast, in either a dark arena or an arena with stones, the animals took shorter and more frequent trips, with more stops per trip and shorter inter-stop distances. In illuminated arenas <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> remained mainly along the walls, whereas locomotion in the center was more prevalent in dark empty arenas, and was carried out along convoluted paths. Increasing environmental complexity by adding stones to either illuminated or dark arenas increased locomotion along straight trajectories and away from walls. Conclusions Earlier findings of reduced activity in illuminated or open areas have been extended in the present study by demonstrating changes in the spatio-temporal structure of locomotor behavior. In the more complex arenas (with stones) <b>spiny</b> <b>mice</b> traveled along short straight segments whereas in the open their trips were longer and took the shape of a zigzag path which is more effective against fast or nearby predators. Alternatively, the zigzag path may reflect a difficulty in navigation. </p...|$|R
