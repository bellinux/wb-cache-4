5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a <b>solution</b> <b>containing</b> actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescence probe {{methods were}} applied to {{investigate}} micelle formation of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) with two kinds of surfactants, anionic sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or cationic n-dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC), in aqueous solutions using pyrene or 1 -pyrenecarboxaldehyde as fluorescence probes. Two PNIPA samples, one having a hydrophobic chain-end group and the other having a negatively-charged hydrophilic chain-end group, were used to investigate effects of the chain-end group on formation of the micelles. It {{was found that the}} critical aggregation concentration, at which the surfactant molecules start to bind to the PNIPA chains to form the micelles, is much lower for the PNIPA <b>solutions</b> <b>containing</b> SDS than for the <b>solutions</b> <b>containing</b> DTAC. This is consistent with the previous result that the cloud point in the PNIPA <b>solutions</b> <b>containing</b> SDS starts to increase from its value in the surfactant-free solutions at much lower concentration of added surfactant than that in the <b>solutions</b> <b>containing</b> DTAC. It was also found that there is a discrepancy in emission spectra for the <b>solutions</b> <b>containing</b> SDS between the two PNIPA samples but not for the <b>solutions</b> <b>containing</b> DTAC, indicating that the chain-end group of PNIPA may affect the microenvironmental polarity in the micelles composed of PNIPA and the surfactants...|$|R

5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It {{can be prepared}} by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature of about 500 °C. This green solid has a melting point of 603 °C and crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system isotypic with uranium(III) chloride (Pearson symbol hP8, space group P63/m, No. 176). Upon heating to just below its melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase. The hexahydrate BkCl3·6H2O (berkelium trichloride hexahydrate) has a monoclinic structure with the lattice constants a = 966 pm, b = 654 pm and c = 797 pm. Another berkelium(III) chloride, Cs2NaBkCl6 can be crystallized from a chilled aqueous <b>solution</b> <b>containing</b> berkelium(III) hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and caesium chloride.

5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a <b>solution</b> <b>containing</b> bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E

The purpose of this study was to do compatibility testing for parenteral nutrition (PN) <b>solutions</b> <b>containing</b> CaCl 2 using dynamic light scattering and micro-flow imaging techniques. <b>Solutions</b> <b>containing</b> TrophAmine (Braun Medical Inc, Irvine, CA), CaCl 2, and sodium phosphate (NaPhos) were compounded with and without cysteine.

The maximum amount of NaPhos that could be added to TrophAmine solutions of > = 2. 5 % AA containing at least 10 mmol/L of CaCl 2 was 7. 5 mmol/L.
