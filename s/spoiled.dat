50|$|Effective {{management}} of <b>spoil</b> is necessary because its volume is in general {{three times that}} which it was before excavation. Best practice involves removing the <b>spoil</b> away from the excavation site by mechanical earth moving equipment, or the creation of barrow run fed <b>spoil</b> heaps. In the barrow run method, a ramp is built using <b>spoil</b> transported in barrows along the barrow runs. The <b>spoil</b> heap is progressively enlarged by tipping off the vertical end face of the barrow-run. This method is efficient in storing {{the maximum amount of}} <b>spoil</b> in the minimum area, where there is no mechanised means of removing <b>spoil</b> a long distance from the site.|$|R

A time-varying gradient spoiler scheme compatible with RF <b>spoiling</b> is defined, in which spoiler gradients cycle through the vertices of a hexagon, which we call hexagonal <b>spoiling.</b> The method is compared with a traditional constant <b>spoiling</b> gradient both in the transition to and in the steady state. Extended phase graph (EPG) simulations, phantom acquisitions, and in vivo images {{were used to assess}} the method. Simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments showed that unwanted signal was markedly reduced by employing hexagonal <b>spoiling,</b> both in the transition to and in the steady state. For adipose tissue at 1. 5 Tesla, the unwanted signal in the steady state with a 60 [*]° flip angle was reduced from 22 % with constant <b>spoiling</b> to 2 % with hexagonal <b>spoiling.</b> A time-varying gradient spoiler scheme that works with RF <b>spoiling,</b> called "hexagonal spoiling," has been presented and found to offer improved <b>spoiling</b> over the traditional constant <b>spoiling</b> gradient...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this Thesis was to study the biogeochemistry {{of a variety of}} industrial <b>spoils,</b> ranging from a highly alkaline steel slag <b>spoil</b> to a slightly acidic colliery <b>spoil</b> and acidic metal mining wastes, with the ultimate aim of providing information which might be used in the remediation of these <b>spoils</b> by applying a plant cover. A variety of important processes, which are components of the major biogeochemical cycles (i. e. urea hydrolysis, nitrification, s-oxidation, and P-solubilization) were studied in these <b>spoils.</b> The activities of a range of soil enzymes (e. g. arylsuphatase and arylphosphatase) were studied in the <b>spoils</b> in relation to their use as possible indicators of microbial activity and thereby <b>spoil</b> fertility. In addition, phosphate solubilizing microorganisms were isolated in relation to the role they play in influencing the availability of phosphate to plants which, with nitrogen {{is likely to be a}} major limiting factor for <b>spoil</b> bioremediation. A preliminary study was also made of the potential for using Biochar in the remediation of these <b>spoils.</b> The results are discussed in relation to the bioremediation of these industrial <b>spoils.</b> The desirability of achieving such spoil-remediation relates mainly to aesthetic considerations, i. e. the presence of <b>spoil</b> tips ruins the local environment a factor which impacts on tourism and the introduction of “clean industries” to former mining areas. ...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observation}} of lignite strip mine <b>spoils</b> from the Darco mine near Marshall, Texas, revealed that gray <b>spoil</b> materials of various ages were devoid of vegetation. Within the same sites, <b>spoil</b> materials which were non-gray supported several conditions of revegetation.

Gray materials appear to have greater mineral sources of zinc, iron, and sulfate than non-gray <b>spoils,</b> and greater concentrations of zinc, calcium, magnesium, and potassium at all sites. Further, older <b>spoils</b> (17 to 31 years of age) have mean pH values below 5. 0, a more rapid decline in pH, and greater concentrations of zinc, iron, sulfate, and aluminum. A weathering process which accounts for such differentiation is discussed. Recommendations for further research are made...|$|R
40|$|Coal mining {{produces}} {{large quantities}} of waste rock (<b>spoil)</b> of generally sedimentary origin. Current practice involves stacking this <b>spoil</b> in piles up to 150 m high. Plans for future mining are considering <b>spoil</b> piles up to 400 m high. Under the corresponding burial stresses, the <b>spoil</b> materials undergo substantial compressions, leading to decreases in void ratio and increases in their degree of saturation (S r) at constant water content. In this study, a typical <b>spoil</b> derived from Permian-aged sandstones and mudrocks, is subjected to stresses up to 20 MPa, with the corresponding changes in degree of saturation and suction measured. The results show that loose <b>spoil</b> with a water content of around 12 % (S r = 25 %) will collapse to become saturated under a stress of 7 MPa. In contrast, loose <b>spoil</b> with a higher water content of around 16 % will collapse to become saturated under a stress of only 1. 5 MPa. From these results, a phenomenon is identified whereby <b>spoil</b> in the seepage and capillary zones {{at the base of}} very high <b>spoil</b> piles can collapse to a state of saturation. A discussion is provided on the consequences of this for the matric suction and unsaturated shear strength of these <b>spoil</b> materials, which constitute the foundation layer of the pile...|$|R

5|$|The {{identity}} of the anticoagulant substance in <b>spoiled</b> sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 Karl Paul Link and his lab of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the <b>spoiled</b> hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named dicoumarol. They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.|$|E

40|$|Slope {{failures}} of <b>spoil</b> piles pose a significant safety risk in open-cut strip mining due to slaking over time due to overburden pressure and water saturation.

It {{is important to understand}} how the mechanical properties of base <b>spoil</b> material are affected by slaking when designing safe <b>spoil</b> pile slope angles, heights, and dewatering rates. A new laboratory slaking chamber (360 mm ID, 400 mm high with 20 mm wall thickness) has been designed and constructed to accommodate approximately 60 kg of <b>spoil</b> (unit weight, 18 kN/m 3) and a simulated overburden pressure of 1000 kPa.
