40|$|AbstractThe <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> {{mechanism}} and {{the limitation of}} a borehole drilling are pointed out by theoretical and numerical analysis. The stress is relieved around the borehole wall, and the gas can be drained out easily, but {{the periphery of the}} <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> area generates annularity stress concentration to embay around the boreholes, and forms the “Bottle Neck Effect” (BNE) which restricts the gas drainage ability. Jetting high pressure water in the boreholes to form several slots can break the BNE, which makes the stress above and below the slots relieve sufficiently. The <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> area is nearly 200 times larger than the stress concentration area under the same condition. The slots around a borehole improve the borehole’s <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> ability, drain out more gas, and enlarge the drainage range, which can reduce the number of the boreholes to achieve the same aim...|$|R

40|$|Ferruform AB in Luleå is a {{manufacturer}} of chassi components for Scania’s truck production. At the department for Axle production sheet metal is processed to produce rear axle housings. The main processes include shearing, forming, welding and machining. High amount of residual stresses are built up in the material because of the extensive weld operations. Residual stresses are reduced with a very time and energy consuming heat treatment method called heat <b>stress</b> <b>relief.</b> The purpose with this thesis was to investigate alternative methods for heat <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> and then suggest the best solution for Ferruform. Our main tasks in this thesis has been literature studies, investigation of prior work, market analysis, contact and visits from suppliers, production tests and weekly meetings with our supervisor. Finally we have presented the thesis verbally at the company and at Luleå University of Technology. A written report has also been made. Two alternative methods for heat <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> has been found and further investigated. Tests have been made regarding these two methods for <b>stress</b> <b>relief.</b> One test with a method called vibratory <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> and one test with a simulated bend-straightening operation. Layouts have been created to easier visualize the space required for the different methods. Seen from the layouts is that both methods requires less space than the heat <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> oven. Single piece flow is achieved with bend-straightening and batched flow is achieved with vibratory <b>stress</b> <b>relief.</b> Bend-straightening provides single batch flow, low cycle times and is utilized by a competitor, therefore it is recommended as a primary option to heat <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> at Ferruform. However, verification tests {{have to be made}} in order to evaluate the effects of the two different alternative methods.

Also a third method is taken into account in this thesis, hot formed banjo halves. This is not an option for Ferruform but may be an alternative to Scania Sao Paolo in Brazil.

40|$|Abstract – The {{practice}} of tempering for <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> before cryogenic thermal treatment in an AISI D 2 tool steel {{has been shown}} to stabilize the retained austenite, nullifying the effect of cryogenic treatment The practice simultaneously enhances the wear resistance of the steel after complete thermal cycling (quench + <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> + cryogenic treatment + double temper). Cryogenic treatment {{has been shown to}} have a large effect on the properties of heat treated steels, especially tool steels. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of some parts it is necessary to do a prior <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> heat treatment to avoid cracks and catastrophic failures. In previous work [1] it was verified that the <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> treatment stabilizes the austenite even when the sample is submerged in liquid nitrogen. The literature [2] suggests that there is a C-curve kinetic behavior for the austenite to martensite transformation at temperatures lower than Ms. In order to confirm those previous work results[1] and test the hypothesis of a C-curve behavior, samples from an AISI D 2 tool steel bar were austenitized at 1040 °C for 40 minutes and then quenched in oil. Half of the samples were submitted to a <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> treatment at 130 °C for 90 minutes in order to enable comparison between samples with and without <b>stress</b> <b>relief.</b> Afterwards, some samples were submitted to a deep cryogenic treatment (DCT- immersion in liquid nitrogen) and others to a shallow cryogenic treatment (SCT-immersion in dry ice), for 2 and 24 hours...|$|R
