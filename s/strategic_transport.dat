5|$|Its {{location}} on a <b>strategic</b> <b>transport</b> crossroad in Podolia made the castle a prime target for foreign invaders, who rebuilt the castle {{to suit their}} own needs, adding to its multicultural architectural diversity.

However, {{in spite of the}} many architectural and engineering changes to the original structure, the castle still forms a coherent architectural design, being one of the few medieval constructions in Ukraine that is relatively well preserved.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the Australian {{government}} decided to purchase two passenger jets for <b>strategic</b> <b>transport,</b> primarily to mitigate what it {{saw as the}} risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million. Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers. The first {{was transferred to the}} RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No.37 Squadron. They were formed into No.33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2February 1981. The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, Highland and Islands <b>Strategic</b> <b>Transport</b> Partnership (HITRANS) {{discussed}} with Caledonian Sleeper {{the possibility of}} establishing a rail sleeper service between Wick and Thurso to Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Under current plans the service would use Mark 3 carriages which are already in use on other services.|$|E
25|$|The <b>strategic</b> <b>transport</b> {{importance}} of the road bridge– {{and the threat of}} closure by 2019 if major structural work was not successful– led to fears of serious economic consequences, especially as work on a new crossing was estimated to take up to 11 years. Scottish Transport Minister Nicol Stephen commissioned a new study, which priced a second Forth Road Bridge at £300 million, in 2003. The Forth Estuary Transport Authority voiced support for a new bridge in 2005, and in 2006 the UK Transport Secretary, Alistair Darling, spoke in favour of the idea.|$|E
25|$|It was {{initially}} {{suggested that the}} new bridge would be funded via the Scottish Futures Trust, an alternative to public-private partnership funding for major public-sector schemes. However, the Scottish Government announced in December 2008 that public funding would be used. As part of the Scottish Government's <b>Strategic</b> <b>Transport</b> Projects Review, the new Forth crossing was priced at between £1.72 billion and £2.34 billion. Under the revised scheme, the existing bridge will be retained for public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and the new bridge was to be operational by 2016.|$|E

25|$|Being {{centrally}} {{located on the}} Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a <b>strategic</b> <b>transport</b> hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan-wide public transport system, which is managed by and known as the Adelaide Metro. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the O-Bahn Busway, metropolitan railways (with diesel and electric lines), and the Adelaide-Glenelg Tram, which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of Hindmarsh. There are further plans to extend the tram to Port Adelaide and Semaphore. A CBD tram loop too, is being considered and the latest Adelaide Airport master plan has also revealed a tram extension to the airport in the near future.|$|E

This may be to compensate for the scrapping of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link and the station was part of the original proposal. The station would also thought to be delivered sooner.|$|R

500|$|In 1963, the United States Air Force {{started a}} series of study {{projects}} on a very large <b>strategic</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft. Although the C-141 Starlifter was being introduced, they believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft.

500|$|The Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche was {{intended}} to be an advanced five-blade armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter. The Comanche was specifically tailored to the role of armed scout to replace the U.S. Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, which is an upgraded version of a Vietnam War-era observation helicopter. It was both smaller and lighter than the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter that it had been intended to accompany. The RAH-66 was powered by a pair of LHTEC T800 turboshaft engines, each capable of generating up to 1,563 hp (1,165 kW) of power. The RAH-66's fuselage was [...] long and composed of composite materials; it was designed to be capable of fitting more readily onto transport ships, enabling the Comanche to be more rapidly deployed to flash points and other rapidly-developing situations.

500|$|No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron's home in Canberra {{was renamed}} RAAF Base Fairbairn in March 1962, and the unit was redesignated No.34 Squadron on 13June 1963. That year, the {{squadron}} carried Queen ElizabethII {{for the first}} time. In October 1964, two second-hand Vickers Viscount turboprop transports were obtained to supplement the Dakotas and Convairs; the two piston-engine types were withdrawn after the delivery of two Hawker Siddeley HS748s beginning in April 1967 and three Dassault Falcon 20 jets (known as Mystere in RAAF service) in June. Two BAC 1-11 jets joined the squadron on 19January 1968, and the two Viscounts were retired in March the following year. The wholesale re-equipment of the VIP fleet in the late 1960s was controversial, and questions were raised in Parliament regarding its cost and operations. The so-called [...] "VIP affair" [...] led to more stringent guidelines governing No. 34 Squadron's tasking, requiring approval for flights {{to be made by}} the British Royal Family, the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, or the Minister for Air. Eligibility criteria were also codified, and potential passengers included Federal ministers, opposition leaders, [...] "individuals of similar status and importance visiting Australia", two-star officers and above, and other dignitaries of similar status. During the 1970s one of No.34 Squadron's BAC 1-11s experienced an engine failure over the Tasman Sea while carrying Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to New Zealand. The aircraft made a safe landing in Australia, but the incident led the RAAF to investigate using three- or four-engined aircraft for future VIP flights involving long over-water legs. The government eventually purchased two Boeing 707s from Qantas to perform long-range VIP flights and to improve the RAAF's <b>strategic</b> <b>transport</b> capabilities. Entering service in 1979, they joined the newly established No.33 Flight (later No.33 Squadron) in 1981. More 707s were acquired between 1983 and 1988, and four were converted for air-to-air refuelling in the early 1990s.|$|E

The invasion of Panama was the first combat deployment for the AH-64, the HMMWV, and the F-117A. Panamanian radar units were jammed by two EF-111As of the 390th ECS, 366th TFW. These aircraft were deployed against the 16,000 members of the PDF.|$|R
