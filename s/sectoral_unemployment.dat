40|$|In this paper, {{in order}} to study the impact of {{offshoring}} on sectoral and economywide rates of unemployment, we construct a two sector general equilibrium model in which labor is mobile across the two sectors, and unemployment is caused by search frictions. We find that, contrary to general perception, wage increases and <b>sectoral</b> <b>unemployment</b> decreases due to offshoring.

If the search cost is identical in the two sectors, or even if the search cost is higher in the sector which experiences offshoring, the economywide rate of unemployment decreases. We also find multiple equilibrium outcomes in the extent of offshoring and therefore, in the unemployment rate. Furthermore, a firm can increase its domestic employment through offshoring. Also, such a firm's domestic employment can be higher than a firm that chooses to remain fully domestic. When we modify the model to disallow intersectoral labor mobility, the negative relative price effect on the sector in which firms offshore some of their activity becomes stronger. In such a case, {{it is possible for}} this effect to offset the positive productivity effect, and result in a rise in unemployment in that sector. In the other sector, offshoring has a much stronger unemployment reducing effect in the absence of intersectoral labor mobility than in the presence of it. Finally, allowing for an endogenous number of varieties provides an additional indirect channel, through which <b>sectoral</b> <b>unemployment</b> goes down due to the entry of new firms brought about by offshoring. ...|$|E

We use provincial household debt and <b>sectoral</b> <b>unemployment</b> data and follow Mian and Sufi (2012) to isolate the effect of household debt on Spanish unemployment. We find that the level of household sector debt in Spanish provinces in 2007 is a highly significant determinant of the subsequent increase in provincial unemployment from 2007 to 2010. Our estimates indicate that approximately 1 / 3 of the increase in overall Spanish unemployment over that period can be traced back to high household debt levels.

The present paper proposes an alternative "structural" explanation in which the privately-optimal response of workers and firms within a unionised high-wage industry leads to inefficiently low levels of labour transfer and a correspondingly high rate of <b>sectoral</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Subsidisation of the declining industry under these circumstances reduces efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-sector, two-factor trade model with labor market frictions in which workers {{search for a}} job also when they are employed. On the job search (OJS) is a key ingredient to explain the response to trade liberalization of <b>sectoral</b> employment, <b>unemployment</b> and wage inequality. OJS generates wage dispersion and it leads to a reallocation of workers from less productive firms that pay lower wages to more productive ones. Following a trade liberalization the traditional selection effects are more severe than without OJS and the tradable sector experiences a loss of employment, while {{the opposite is true}} for the non tradable sector. Starting from autarky, the opening to trade has a positive effect on employment but it increases wage inequality. For an already open economy, a further increase of trade openness can, however, lead to an increase of unemployment. The dynamics of labor market variables is obtained in closed form. The model predicts overshooting at the time of implementation of a trade liberalization, then the paths of adjustment follow a stable transitional dynamics. ...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{estimates}} of the annual unemployment rate from 1870 to 1913 were constructed by the Board of Trade, initially in 1888, and updated thereafter. This is still the series which is widely used and cited. It is based on records of the number unemployed in various trade unions {{and it has a}} number of well known flaws. The index is weighted by membership of reporting unions and is heavily skewed towards engineering and the metal trades. Some important sectors are largely omitted. We reconstruct <b>sectoral</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates based on union records and supplement this with (crude) estimates for certain other sectors based on proxies for employment. These are weighted according to labour force shares but the index still excludes agriculture and services. The basic cyclical pattern is preserved but the new series has a higher mean and a lower standard deviation than the Board of Trade index. The wide swings in unemployment during the 1870 s are confirmed but the amplitude of fluctuations in the 1880 s and 1890 s is smaller in the new index than in the old. More tentatively, unemployment increases over time in the new index relative to the old. 1870 - 1913; Measurement; UK; Unemployment...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of an adequate pool of suitable labour {{is a key}} location factor for the labour-intensive hotel and restaurant business. Yet, in spite of high unemployment (jobless rate: 17. 3 percent) and schemes to attract seasonal workers from abroad, the sector still encounters considerable difficulties in filling job vacancies. Of the many approaches towards elucidating the mystery of high levels of unemployment concurrent with a perceived scarcity of workers, key contributions are the high seasonal fluctuations in demand and the mismatch theory. The phenomenon of seasonal unemployment may {{be understood as a}} special aspect of demand scarcity. The seasonal dependence of tourism demand generates variations which in turn cause personnel to be set free at a grand scale {{at the end of a}} season. The mismatch theory goes a long way towards explaining a large part of the problems encountered in filling job openings while <b>sectoral</b> <b>unemployment</b> remains high. Key elements of the structural imbalance are qualifications and age, availability in terms of geography and time, and earnings expectations (including working conditions and career options). Overall, it appears that the future supply of an adequate number of qualified labour is a growing problem, because the need for operations to position themselves in the quality segment will raise the labour and qualification threshold.

40|$|Excerpt] Concern that {{structural}} factors impede efficient {{labor market}} performance is evidenced in both statistical analyses of economic potential and policy proposals for selective employment subsidies. Estimates {{of the level}} and expected growth of full-employment GNP have recently been revised downward, as has the 3. 2 unemployment multiplier implicit in Okun 2 ̆ 7 s Law (see U. S. Council of Economic Advisers and George Perry). These indications of structural changes in labor markets reinforce statistics showing excessively high unemployment rates for youths and blacks, and labor force participation rates that are increasing for women and decreasing for men. The simultaneous concern with high inflation and high measured unemployment, {{in the context of}} major changes in labor force composition and increased variance in <b>sectoral</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates (see Perry), has brought forth numerous and sizable selective employment subsidy policies (SESP) in both the United States and Western Europe. The SESP, changes in potential GNP, and Okun 2 ̆ 7 s Law are not unrelated phenomena. This paper explores that relationship. Section I presents a brief taxonomy of the primary SESPs which are currently being discussed in Western industrialized countries. Section II provides the economic rationale underlying these measures. Section III explores the relationship of SESP to the prospective growth of aggregate output, in the context of Okun 2 ̆ 7 s Law.
