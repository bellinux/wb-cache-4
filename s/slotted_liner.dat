30|$|No {{sufficient}} data were found regarding well failures in geothermal wells of the Menegai geothermal field. The main challenges experienced during drilling of high-temperature wells {{in that area}} were incidents of stuck pipe between well depths of 2100  m and 2200  m, where magma was encountered. Drilling of the MW- 01 well was performed with partial and total circulation losses. The drill string got stuck {{at the end of}} drilling at 2206  m (Makuk 2013; Mbia 2014). During drilling the MW- 03 well, the similar situation occurred at depths of 1187 and 2112  m. The well MW- 04 yielded cuttings of freshly quenched volcanic glass at a depth of 2080  m. Drilling close to this magma resulted in problems such as stuck pipe at 2117  m and the drill bit damages, due to extremely high temperatures. After unsuccessful fishing operations, around 20  m of bottom hole assembly, composed of a drill bit, sub, stabilizer, and two drill collars was abandoned inside the well. The completion was carried out with a <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> above the ‘fish’. At final depth, rather low permeability values were encountered. Only intermittent and partial losses were experienced at the deepest well sections and no serious circulation loss problems were encountered (Mbia 2014). The MW- 06 well (also called MW- 05) yielded freshly quenched volcanic glassy cuttings at a depth of 2172  m. Drilling in the close vicinity to magma resulted in challenges such as stuck pipe at 2203  m. Similarly, as in MW- 04, the bottom hole assembly with the length of 21  m, composed of a drill bit, sub and two drill collars was left in the wellbore and the borehole was completed with a <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> above the ‘fish’ (Makuk 2013; Mibei 2012).|$|E
40|$|The Hawaii Geothermal Project well HGP-A has {{undergone}} a two-year testing program which included cold water pumpdown tests, flashing flows with measurements of temperature and pressure profiles, and noise surveys. These tests and the data obtained are discussed in detail. While the pumpdown tests conducted right after the <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> had been installed and the mud removed indicated that the well had very poor permeability, HGP-A was flashed successfully on July 2, 1976. Maximum quiescent bottomhole temperature following that initial flash {{was measured to be}} 358 °C. Comparison of subsequent discharges shows that with each succeeding test, the flow rate has increased, possibly due to the displacement of drilling mud embedded in the well-bore surface. The flow rates range from a maximum of 101 Klb/hr at wellhead pressure of 51 psig to a throttled 76 K 1 b/hr at 375 psig wellhead pressure, with possible electrical power production of 3. 0 to 3. 5 MWe. Temperature and pressure profiles taken during flow tests indicate that the fluid in the wellbore is a mixture of liquid and vapor at saturation conditions. The absence of a liquid level during flashing discharge confirms that flashing is occurring in the formation. Pressure drawdown and buildup analyses yield a value of transmissibility (kh) of approximately 1000 millidarcy-feet with a pressure drop across the apparently damaged skin of 500 - 600 psi. The pressure profiles taken during flashing flow consist roughly of three approximately constant gradient lines that intersect at the junction of the casing and the <b>slotted</b> <b>liner,</b> and at approximately 4300 feet depth, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} major production zones are near bottomhole and in the vicinity of 4300 feet. Furthermore, the data points on the log-log Horner type plot seem to fall on two different but consecutive straight-line approximations.

40|$|The {{functions}} of a regeneratively-cooled nozzle are to (1) expand combustion gases to increase exhaust gas velocity while, (2) maintaining adequate wall temperatures to prevent structural failure, and (3) transfer {{heat from the}} hot gases to the coolant fluid to promote injector performance and stability.

A channel wall nozzle is designed with an internal liner containing a series of integral coolant channels that are closed out with an external jacket.

30|$|A {{variety of}} other {{datasets}} {{can be used as}} a proxy for the favorability of each stratigraphic unit to host fracture permeability and fluid flow. Pressure–temperature-spinner logs, for example, may reveal discrete flowing intervals in wells correlated to specific faults or lithologic intervals in the 3 D geologic map.

Well construction reports (detailing depth of the casing ‘shoe,’ above which the well has been cemented with steel casing and therefore sealed off from the formation) can also provide information relevant to which lithologic intervals tend to host permeability intervals. In a productive geothermal field, intervals along production or injection wells that are cased with <b>slotted</b> <b>liners,</b> otherwise open to fluid flow, and/or correspond with fault zones can be interpreted within lithologies favorable for hosting permeability and fluid flow. If flowing intervals are not faulted, geothermal fluids may reside with primary stratigraphic permeability that is charged with upwelling fluids from nearby faults (Siler et al. 2016 a).|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} the thermo-mechanical response of channel wall nozzle under cyclic working loads, the finite volume fluid-thermal coupling calculation method and the finite element thermal-structural coupling analysis technique are applied. In {{combination with the}} material low-cycle fatigue behavior, the modified continuous damage model on the basics of local strain approach is adopted to analyze the fatigue damage distribution and accumulation with increasing nozzle work cycles. Simulation results {{have shown that the}} variation of the non-uniform temperature distribution of channel wall nozzle during cyclic work plays {{a significant role in the}} thermal-structural response by altering the material properties; the thermal–mechanical loads interaction results in serious deformation mainly in the front region of <b>slotted</b> <b>liner.</b> In particular, the maximal cyclic strains appear in the intersecting regions of liner gas side wall and symmetric planes of channel and rib, where the fatigue failure takes place initially; with the increase in nozzle work cycles, the residual plastic strain accumulates linearly, and the strain amplitude and increment in each work cycle are separately equal, but the fatigue damage grows up nonlinearly. As a result, a simplified nonlinear damage accumulation approach has been suggested to estimate the fatigue service life of channel wall nozzle. The predicted node life is obviously conservative to the Miner’s life. In addition, several workable methods have also been proposed to improve the channel wall nozzle durability...|$|E

Mud gelling and coagulation was experienced at 2488  m. An attempt of freeing the drill string with explosive materials failed due to high temperatures decomposing the explosive charges. Another attempt of side-tracking the well with coil tubing also failed and another ‘fish’ was left inside the hole. A back-off fishing procedure proved to be successful at 2013  m; however, around 400  m of drill string was left at the well bottom.

40|$|April 2006, page 1) briefly dis-cussed {{recovery}} considerations specific {{for heavy}} oils, particularly the large yields from some foamy oil reservoirs. Like foamy oil, sand pro-duction (simultaneous extraction of sand {{along with the}} oil) —the subject {{of this part of}} the article—has been associated with enhanced heavy oil recovery. Also as with foamy oil, sand production is not well understood mathematically, and the petroleum industry is attempting to evalu-ate its impact on reservoir performance, in terms of both well deliverability and ultimate recovery. Sand: Control and Exploitation Sand long represented little more than a costly problem and a safety hazard for the petroleum industry. Sand-related problems include: ■ erosion of equipment, such as valves, pump stators, tubing, and surface pipes; ■ subsidence of the reservoir matrix and collapse of casings; ■ blocked tubing assemblies and plugged surface facilities, leading to well blockage; ■ decreased conductivity of the reservoir matrix and, consequently, reduced efficiency of oil recovery; ■ need for disposal procedures; and ■ need for extensive work to replace or repair equipment and clean wells.

30|$|The NJ- 11 {{well in the}} Nesjavellir {{geothermal}} field was drilled in 1985 to a final depth of 2265  m. During drilling operations, multiple overpressurized feed zones were encountered which later resulted in circulation gain and wellhead pressure rise of 5 – 6 bars after circulation ceased. First fluid losses and main feed zone were found {{at a depth of}} 1226  m. Immediately after drilling, geothermal fluids with a flow rate of 35  l/s, flowed up the annulus between casing and drill string. This rather unexpected incident had to be quenched with cold water. After a temperature survey, accompanied with pumping 44  l/s of cold water into the well, interzonal flow and possible underground blow-out conditions occurred. It was observed that potentially supercritical fluids, with pressures above 220 bars and temperatures of more than 380  °C were entering the main feed zone at 1226  m. High temperatures damaged the float valve in the drill string and fluid leakage was observed on top of the lubricator at the wellhead assembly. Controlling the well after drilling operations with cold water proved to be immensely difficult and unsuccessful. The NJ- 11 well was partially abandoned by inserting a 200  m plug made from gravel and the well was eventually completed with a <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> down {{to the top of the}} gravel plug.

This thesis presents the development of a correlation that will correct for error in a horizontal well's productivity calculations made by neglecting frictional pressure drop in the wellbore. The advantage of this method is the ease of application compared to other methods that have been developed to correct for wellbore pressure drop. It also significantly improves the accuracy of the productivity estimates. The specific tasks achieved in this work include the following: The development of the productivity error correlation to correct for wellbore (frictional) pressure drop along the horizontal productive well length. A non-parametric regression program, GRACE, was used to analyse several simulated productivity data and to develop a Productivity Error (P. E.) correlation. The correlation, which was simplified using the Table Curve program, is a function of horizontal well length, viscosity, well diameter, wellbore roughness, and production rate. The validation of two commonly used productivity relationships that were derived by assuming either a constant wellbore pressure or a uniform flux. The validation was done with simulated data to support the use of these relationships with the productivity error correlation that was developed. The aim was to ensure that these relationships are valid over the range of values that were used in this study. Due to the significant effect of wellbore roughness on horizontal well productivity, an extensive literature search was also conducted for materials that will help to determine the true roughness of screen and <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> horizontal well completions.

Phase 1 ended prematurely when the drill bit intersected a very permeable fault zone during the redrilling of target stimulation well 34 - 9 RD 2. A hydraulic stimulation was inadvertently achieved, however, since the flow of drill mud from the well into the formation created an earthquake swarm near the wellbore that was recorded, located, analyzed and interpreted by project seismologists.

The initial pumping to condition the wells was completed during December 2003. The PB- 1 well, drilled immediately adjacent to the Nopal I ore body, was continuously cored to a depth of 250 m, terminating 20 m below the top of the measured water level. The PB- 2 and PB- 3 wells, which were drilled on opposite sides of PB- 1 at a radial distance of approximately 40 to 50 m outside of the remaining projected ore body, were also drilled to about 20 m below the top of the measured water level. Each test well was completed with 4 -inch (10. 2 -cm) diameter PVC casing with a <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> below the water table. Initial conditioning of all three wells using a submersible pump at low pump rates [less than 1 gallon (3. 8 1) per minute] resulted in measurable draw down and recoveries. The greatest drawdown ({approx} 15 m) was observed in PB- 2, whereas only minor (< 1 m) drawdown occurred in PB- 3. For PB- 1 and PB- 2, the water turbidity decreased as the wells were pumped and the pH values decreased, indicating that the contamination from the drilling fluid was reduced as the wells were conditioned. Test wells PB- 1 and PB- 2 showed increased inflow after several borehole volumes of fluid were removed, but their inflow rates remained less that the pumping rate. Test well PB- 3 showed the smallest drawdown and least change in pH and conductivity during initial pumping and quickest recovery with a rise in measured water level after conditioning. The 195 gallons (750 l) of water pumped from PB- 3 during conditioning was discharged through a household sponge. That sponge showed measurable gamma radiation, which decayed to background values in less than 12 hours. Preliminary interpretations include filtration of a radioisotope source with a short half-life or of a radioisotope that volatized as the sponge dried, such as Rn- 222 and its short-lived daughters. No filtration was used during the pumping of PB- 1 or PB- 2...|$|E
40|$|Non-uniform {{distribution}} of flow rate along horizontal wells results in early water/gas coning, early breakthrough of water/gas during flooding, etc. For injector wells, injection flow rate profile along the horizontal length leads to low sweep efficiency and to large oil-filled by-passed zones. In the current work, a variable {{distribution of}} flow open area along a horizontal well, {{with or without}} sand control, is proposed, to correct the flow rate profile along it. An uniform flow profile is achieved by means of unevenly spaced slots or perforations along the liner or sand control device. An analytical model was developed for flow inside and around the horizontal well with unevenly spaced slots or perforations along the liner or along the sand control device. The model couples flows in well and in the reservoir in well vicinity. The analytical model provides an explicit formula for slot/hole density along liners or screens in injection/production horizontal wells. Applications of the model to design horizontal well in cases of injection and production, with or without sand control, with inflow control device are discussed. The technology has been successfully applied in some oilfields onshore and offshore Brazil, where horizontal producer wells were equipped with specially perforated and <b>slotted</b> <b>liners.</b> The purpose is to homogenize flow along horizontal producer or injector wells, in order to delay gas and water coning and improve the sweep. The varying slot/perforation density is calculated by the analytical model, and the calculated option was implemented in some wells. P. D. Fernandes and M. G. F. da Silva and P. Bedrikovetsk...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental approach to design, perform, and evaluate stimulation treatments for SAGD producers completed with <b>slotted</b> <b>liners.</b> Heavy oil production {{from a high}} temperature sandstone reservoir declined due to the blockage of <b>slots</b> in horizontal <b>liners.</b> Blocking materials were mainly presented by silicon-based scales, migrated fines, and numerous iron species. Previously, wells were mainly treated by HCl and a high pH chelating agent. These treatments did not improve the production significantly but corroded liners even more. Three liners were pulled out from the wells. Blocking and scaling materials were collected from the slots and walls of these liners for analysis. The experimental process included static acid solubility tests using 15 wt% HCl at room temperature, SEM, and XRD analysis. Also, it was proved that hydrochloric acid is not an optimal solution for blockage removal in these producers. Additionally, organic solvent preflush {{proved to be an}} effective potential improvement in the treatment design. Oil sand samples were collected from the reservoir. The mineralogy of these samples was analyzed in detail. Organic matter was removed, and the rock samples were separated in sand, silt, and clay fractions. Presence of kaolinite, illite, muscovite, incomplete hydroxide interlayer smectite was proved by XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and AAS. Also, interstratification of mica and kaolinite was observed. These results were used to make a decision concerning the choice of compatible treatment fluid. Seven stimulation treatments were conducted in five different wells using foamed chelating agent (GLDA). Flowback emulsion was separated and prepared for analysis which included ICP and GLDA titration. Additionally, the decomposition of GLDA at reservoir conditions was mimicked using aging cells. Decomposition products were identified using GC-MS and were found to be glutaric and aminodiacetic acids. Possible improvements in the treatment?s program and recommendations were formulated based on the obtained data. For example, the soaking time was reduced from 6 to 4 hours after the first treatment. Production data analysis proved the effectiveness of the treatment design. Overall, it was shown that only a systematic approach could be useful to design a successful treatment and achieve a positive impact...|$|R

40|$|Production at {{economical}} {{rates from}} tight gas reservoirs {{in general is}} very challenging not only due to the very low intrinsic permeability {{but also as a}} consequence of several different forms of formation damage that can occur during drilling, completion, stimulation, and production operations. The common strategies used in tight gas reservoirs development are hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well drilling. However in many cases of tight gas reservoirs, the key factors that control well productivity and formation damage mechanisms are not well understood, since it is challenging to characterise them in tight formations. In this thesis I demonstrate how different well and reservoir parameters control well productivity and damage mechanisms in tight gas reservoirs. Reservoir simulation model for Whicher Range tight gas field is built and run. Analytical and numerical simulation approaches are integrated with core flooding experiments and tight gas field data analysis in order to characterize the key reservoir parameters and understand the effects of different parameters on well productivity. Using core flooding experiments data analysis, the relative permeability curves are generated for Whicher Range tight gas reservoir, and quantitatively is shown how the phase trapping damage can be reduced by use of oil based drilling fluid instead of water based fluid. A new technique of welltest analysis was introduced for tight gas reservoirs that can reduce uncertainties in estimation of average reservoir permeability, and also a new correlation that can determine permeability of the natural fractures in tight formations is proposed in this study. I study and analyse different well completion, production and reservoir data from Whicher Range tight gas field in order to identify why production rates are significantly lower than expectations, and investigate possible remedial strategies to achieve viable gas production rates. Based on this research, drilling long horizontal deviated wells using non-aqueous fluids in underbalanced conditions may be more efficient than hydraulic fracturing. As the optimum strategy to further improve the well productivity, drilling the well with a high deviation to intersect multiple sand lenses; orienting the wellbore direction perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress to intersect higher permeability conduits and control wellbore instability issues; completing the well as open-hole to have the advantage of enlarged wellbore caused by large wellbore breakouts; running <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> to control wellbore collapse; open-hole perforation in the direction of maximum horizontal stress to reach a deeper formation penetration; and unloading the wellbore from drilling and fracturing fluids can help achieve commercial gas production rates from tight gas reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|With illustrations. The Hawaii Geothermal Project, {{a coordinated}} {{research}} {{effort of the}} University of Hawaii funded by the County and State of Hawaii, as well as ERDA, was initiated in mid- 1973 {{in order to identify}} and help develop geothermal energy on the Big Island of Hawaii. To develop a geothermal resource, a number of stages preliminary to production are required: exploration and selection of a site for drilling; exploratory drilling; testing to determine critical characteristics of the well or wells; and [...] optionally [...] operating a model plant to test output potential. By the spring of 1974 Phase I of the Project had been completed, when a site for an exploratory well was located and permission for drilling was obtained from the private corporation owning the site. After the competitive bidding process was completed, a drilling contract was awarded in November, 1975 and actual drilling began in December of last year. The drilling was completed late in April, 1976, when a depth of approximately 6, 400 feet had been penetrated [...] approximately 6, 000 feet below sea level. A <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> for the bottom portion of the well was installed in June, 1976. The well flashed spontaneously on 3 July and was blown to rid it of drilling debris on 22 July 1976, after which testing of its physical properties was begun. From the beginning of the Hawaii Geothermal Project it has been recognized that the successive steps of geothermal development starting with drilling must be carefully scrutinized to ascertain in a timely way if there would be any adverse effects on the environment and local ecosystems, and, should they occur, that it was necessary to identify and recommend measures to minimize such impacts. For this reason, in the summer of 1975, once the drill site had been selected and long before the drilling began, baseline data were collected on critical aspects of environmental conditions as they existed before any significant disturbance by the Project. These included ground water supply, air, soil and the flora, as well as the archaeology of the area surrounding the drill site. In February, 1976 the area was studied to see if it provided a habitat for birds which are endemic, or otherwise of special interest. Generally, the area examined for environmental impact lies within a circle having a radius of approximately a half mile {{from the center of the}} four-acre drill site. However, the testing of ground water included sampling wells and a spring more' than a mile from the site. Additional tests of the water and air were conducted at the site in June, 1976, after the drilling was completed but before the well was blown to free it of debris accumulated during drilling. The results of that testing, along with results obtained before the drilling began, are summarized in this assessment statement. The results of the pre-drilling studies were such as to enable the University of Hawaii, under the regulations of the Hawaii Environmental Quality Commission, to issue a negative declaration concerning the exploratory hole [...] i. e. that the drilling of the well seemed to pose no significant threat to the environment in the vicinity of the well site in Puna, Hawaii. It is hoped and intended that the environmental data established by thisstudy will serve as baselines from which to measure changes which may be associated with geothermal development, not only in the area immediately neighboring the present drill site, but, with appropriate adjustments, for development which may occur elsewhere in the Puna District. How transferable the baselines may be to other areas, say other districts of the Island of Hawaii or to other islands within this archipelago, is a question which must be examined in context as further geothermal exploration is undertaken.

40|$|GEOTHERMAL ENERGY CHALLENGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This {{feasibility}} study investigates whether a geothermal district heating system, which accesses Hot Sedimentary Aquifer (HSA) resources underlying a brownfield site at Guardbridge in northeast Fife, {{can be developed}} in a cost-effective manner. This project’s scope is to assess the available geological information and estimate the hot saline aquifer heat supply, calculate the current heat demand at the Guardbridge site, Guardbridge village, and the nearby towns of Leuchars and Balmullo, and to incorporate future Guardbridge development plans (provided by the University of St Andrews) and anticipated growth in housing stock (from Fife Council) to estimate future heat demand. The capital, maintenance and repair costs for the geothermal well and designed district heating network are used to develop economic models {{for a number of}} district heat network scenarios. A key aspect of this study is an evaluation of the opportunities to cost effectively de-risk deep geothermal exploration in Central Scotland, and to outline the potential for developing geological heat storage systems. The study identifies the key legislative and environmental issues, risks and uncertainties associated with any exploration and production, involves stakeholder engagement, and makes recommendations for a Phase 2 stage for geothermal heat development at Guardbridge. Two of the key outputs from this {{feasibility study}} will be an economic model and business case based on different heat demand options, and an optimised model of well design based on different exploration strategies. Both are transferable to similar operations at other geothermal sites. The key objectives are therefore to: (a) design a geothermal well that will be drilled in Phase 2 of the project, and secure valuable information on Fife regional sub-surface geology and geothermal properties of the primary aquifer, (b) explore how advanced drilling techniques, such as directional drilling, can be deployed to improve geothermal recovery, (c) demonstrate how a geothermal system can integrate with an existing biomass heating installation to optimise both schemes and provide a district heat network for on-site industries and the local community, (d) evaluate the potential for storage of seasonal heat energy in the subsurface (a first in Scotland), and (e) assess the relative merits of water treatment and on-site recycling, reinjection or disposal to sea. A regional geological model was constructed using available data from the British Geological Survey, published data and academic theses. The sub-surface geology was interpreted from surface geology and extrapolating the local behaviour of geological structures into the Guardbridge area. Modelling the geology involved defining the orientation and width of a natural fault zone, which could be a significant influence on the behaviour of the Hot Sedimentary Aquifers. The rock units of interest in this study are the Upper Devonian Scone Sandstone, Glenvale Sandstone, Knox Pulpit and Kinnesswood formations, and the latter two units are previously identified as having the highest potential to be highly productive aquifers. The presence of a major fault near the Guardbridge site means that the target aquifers are at very different depths {{on either side of the}} fault. The report therefore investigates and evaluates three well options to target the different aquifers at the varying depths on either side of the fault. Hydrogeological modelling was conducted using FEFLOW® to evaluate the behaviour of the fault on fluid flow rates, and to predict the necessary conductivities to produce reasonable, economic and sustainable rates of fluid extraction. Although not an accurate model of the Guardbridge site, and limited by a significant lack of data constraining the important parameters, the flow simulations suggest that fracture permeability in the aquifers and underlying rocks is needed to sustain the flows recommended by this study, and re-injection would be required if a producing well was to be sustainable over many decades. Regionally developed rock quality predictors have been used to estimate the permeability and temperature of the target aquifer intervals in the three selected well options at, or near, Guardbridge. Oil field well simulation tools have been used to estimate water flow rates, temperature profiles, and circulating rates from different geological models of the wells. Two of the wells, GB- 1 and ES- 1, are not expected to penetrate enough high permeability sandstone to support the minimum water flow rates of 5 l/s and so are ruled out as viable aquifer producers. GB- 2 is a deviated well that penetrates the Kinnesswood and Knox Pulpit formations, the best quality regional aquifers, in a zone where the fault may enhance the permeability even more, and has potential to supply 5 to 20 l/s of water at a surface temperature of 25 oC (± 2 oC). Such a well will be produced using an electric submersible pump which will require 20 - 40 kw of power to deliver 15 l/s of flow (although the volumetric rate will vary with the rock quality). GB- 2 is taken forward and drilling designs are provided with three outcomes: 1) a dry hole scenario; 2) a 5 l/s scenario; and, 3) a 15 l/s scenario. The vertical wells have been modelled as heat pump circulating wells, and therefore would not produce any aquifer water at the surface. Only deeper wells, up to 2500 m, have the potential to give surface temperature increase of 5 oC at reasonable circulation rates (e. g. 8 l/s). A deep GB- 1 well as a heat pump could be taken forward in Phase 2 as an alternative heat source. The proposed GB- 2 deviated well can be drilled across the fault from the Guardbridge site to a depth of 1200 m. A casing string set will isolate the shallow geology and a <b>slotted</b> <b>liner</b> used to prevent hole collapse of the target intervals. Such a well will require a 100 tonne conventional drilling rig and well control, logging and coring tools will assess the aquifer quality. In the most likely case, the drilling phase will take 24 days, including rig mobilisation and demobilisation. If coring and logging demonstrate that the well will not flow adequately, then the well will be suspended. Low cost options have been investigated that would allow exploratory wells to be drilled and this could result in the recovery of regionally significant data on the performance of the aquifers at depth, although none of the boreholes could be completed to production stage due the drilling technology employed. The drilling scenarios investigated do not include a re-injection well, in order to create an economically viable district heating network project, even though very preliminary hydrogeological modelling demonstrates that re-injection is required if the geothermal well is to be sustainable over 30 + years. Alternative management of produced water investigated in this report are: water disposal-tosea and partial-full water recycling and re-use on site. The first option could have environmental consequences on the adjacent Eden Estuary, which is part of the Tay River and Eden Estuary Special Protection Area, and these potential impacts would need formal assessment by a competent authority (Fife Council and SNH) as part of a Habitat Regulations Appraisal, and an Environmental Impact Assessment is most likely required. The second option reduces the environmental impacts on the estuary, but has additional CAPEX and OPEX costs which are estimated. The opportunity to be innovative about partial water recycling and resale should be investigated in Phase 2. The heat demand is based on preliminary district heating network layouts at different scales, based on the demand analysis. Demand has been assessed at Guardbridge and the nearby towns of Leuchars and Balmullo, using the Scotland Heat Map and future development data provided by the University of St Andrews and the Fife Development Plan. These various options provide an indication of the potential annual and peak heating demands that can then be compared against the geothermal heating potential, and an economic modelling tool was developed to analyse the performance of the overall system, including key performance indicators to evaluate the financial viability. This analysis leads to a preliminary network design and an economic model of the potential scheme. The District Heating Opportunity Assessment Tool (DHOAT) designed for the Danish Energy Agency analyses the Heat Map data and preliminary network designs and provides peak and annual demands and key performance indicators, namely total heat demand and indicative CAPEX, OPEX, REPEX and heat sales. All input parameters are modelled with an uncertainty of ± 10...|$|E

40|$|In {{parallel}} {{with a recent}} experimental study {{of the use of}} <b>slotted</b> tunnel <b>liners</b> with variable perforated screens to give interference-free aerodynamic damping derivatives, the corresponding problem is considered theoretically. The principle, that wall interference usually changes sign when slots in the roof and floor of a rectangular tunnel are completely sealed, has prompted these complementary studies with systematic variation of a porosity parameter that can govern the intermediate wall conditions. A theory for small frequency parameter and subsonic compressible flow, which has already explained serious interference effects observed experimentally, is extended to the more general tunnel boundary conditions. With the aid of a special similarity rule for compressible flow, the six necessary interference parameters are determined by a judicious amalgam of exact and approximate data for incompressible flow, including allowance for elliptic loading over a finite wing span. The corrections to oscillatory lift and pitching moment are formulated. By iterative calculation the theoretical method is applied to pitching motion of the unswept tapered and cropped delta planforms chosen for the related half-model experiments. The most favourable wall porosity for low interference is similar in theory and experiment for the two wings. A recommended practical procedure for approximating to interference-free wall conditions is thus corroborated by theoretical calculation and is also extended to give residual corrections...|$|R
