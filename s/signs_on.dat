It was {{the first}} FM station to <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> in the Clarksville/Hopkinsville radio market area, and the whole westernmost segment of Kentucky. Paducah's WPAD-FM (now WDDJ) and WKYX-FM <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> in the months after.|$|R
5|$|As {{it connects}} to I-580, I-205 is a frequently-congested major {{commuter}} {{route to the}} Bay Area. <b>Signs</b> <b>on</b> eastbound I-580 instruct travelers to take I-205, SR120, and SR99 to reach Modesto instead of using the direct, but non-freeway, route SR132. I-205 also serves to connect the Bay Area with popular weekend destinations such as Yosemite, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. The Altamont Commuter Express provides commuters with an alternate route over Altamont Pass to San Jose and San Francisco, the latter through a transfer to BART.|$|E
5|$|Backhoes {{and dump}} trucks {{gradually}} removed the debris and sand from San Blas. Dozens of storeowners, municipal employees, and volunteers in Puerto Vallarta worked {{to clear the}} debris caused by the storm. The remaining stores, bars, and shops placed <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> their windows describing they were open in effort to attract the tourists still in the town. By about {{two months after the}} hurricane, most hotels, restaurants, and shops were reopened.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
50|$|The station first <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> {{the air on}} September 1, 1955 as KARD-TV; it was {{the fourth}} {{television}} station to <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> in the Wichita-Hutchinson market, after KAKE (channel 10) - which <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> in October 1954, KEDD (channel 16) - which <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> in August 1953, and KTVH (channel 12, now KWCH-DT) - which <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> in July 1953. It was initially an independent station, but joined NBC on May 1, 1956 when its former affiliate KEDD shut down. As a result, Wichita became one of the smallest U.S. cities to have three television stations that each maintain exclusive affiliations with one of the major networks. Channel 3 also took the NBC affiliation from KAKE, which had only been with the network since it <b>signed</b> <b>on</b> the previous year.|$|R

5|$|Riley began sending poems to {{his brother}} again in February 1873. About {{the same time he}} and several friends began an {{advertisement}} company. The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that would be visible from a distance. The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October he traveled to South Bend where he took a job at Stockford & Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the short duration of his job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|E
5|$|The A82 {{runs through}} some of the Gaelic-speaking areas in Scotland, known as the Gàidhealtachd. In 2003, the Scottish Government {{announced}} that it would install bilingual <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> a number of trunk roads, including the A82 from Tarbet to Inverness. Transport Minister Lewis Macdonald hoped that the signs would improve the tourism experience in the Highlands, as well as improve awareness of Scottish Gaelic.|$|E

5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|Upon the alphabet's acceptance, {{its first}} user was its {{principal}} architect, George D. Watt, who began writing the meeting {{minutes of the}} early Bishops in a cursive form of it in 1854. Almost immediately after its publication, church members began experimenting with it, and by 1855 travel writers Jules Remy and Julius Brenchley published a chart of the new alphabet which differed heavily from the 1854 version. Some early Mormons, such as Thales Hastings Haskell, began writing their personal journals in the new alphabet. Remy further reported that during his time in Salt Lake City, he saw <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> the street and above shops using the new alphabet.|$|E
5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|The reforms, {{especially}} the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent {{half a million}} Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. New York Times cites reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. A spirited non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, painting over and turning street <b>signs</b> (<b>on</b> one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed {{back out of the}} country after a day's wandering), defiance of various curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months, and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems (see below). There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by self-immolation (such as that of Jan Palach), but there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained Soviet-controlled until 1989, when the Velvet Revolution ended pro-Soviet rule peacefully, undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non-violent resistance twenty years earlier. The resistance also became an iconic example of civilian-based defense, which, along with unarmed civilian peacekeeping constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar <b>signs</b> <b>on</b> their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E
