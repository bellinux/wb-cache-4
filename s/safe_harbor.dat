5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still afloat after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, {{it might have been}} possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a return to a <b>safe</b> <b>harbor.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{its defense}} against the injunction, Napster also cited the Audio Home Recording Act (17 U.S.C. §§ 1001-10). and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> clause (17 U.S.C. § 512). The Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Court's finding that {{downloading}} MP3 files is {{not covered by the}} Audio Home Recording Act. The Ninth Circuit disagreed slightly with the District Court on the <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> issue, however, finding that the contributory infringement does not necessarily exclude a party from <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> protection. The court held that the <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> issue would be explored further at trial.|$|E

40|$|Bankruptcy law {{establishes}} proceedings {{designed to}} rehabilitate debtors while protecting creditors, but {{a series of}} <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> effectively exempts from bankruptcy proceedings certain financial contracts known as derivatives. Accordingly, when a party to a derivative contract goes bankrupt, the counterparty may terminate the contract and seize what it is owed from the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s assets. Congress enacted these <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> to combat the risk of systemic failure by maintaining liquidity in troubled markets; in doing so, however, they allowed counterparties to engage in opportunistic behavior and inefficiently consume a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s limited assets. Because these two consequences may harm the debtor and its creditors, the <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> may merely substitute one kind of systemic risk for another. This Note argues that these <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> might more effectively combat systemic risk if they did not permit counterparties to terminate derivatives that are more valuable to the debtor. this is likely true of an insurance-like derivative known as the credit default swap (CDS). Just as insurance contracts may not be terminated-because maintaining insurance is crucial both to debtor rehabilitation and creditor protection-certain CDSs should not be eligible for termination under the <b>safe</b> <b>harbors.</b> Narrowing the <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> might help eliminate unnecessary costs arising from bankruptcy and thereby better reduce systemic risk...|$|R

40|$|The DMCA is {{a decade}} old, which, in Internet time, {{may well be}} closer to a century. Although the DMCA <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> have helped to foster {{tremendous}} growth in web applications in our Web 2. 0 world, several very basic aspects of the DMCA <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> remain uncertain. These uncertainties, along with the relative lack of litigation over the DMCA {{in the past ten}} years, have threatened to undermine the whole purpose of the DMCA <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> by failing to inform the public and technology companies of what steps they need to undertake to fall within the <b>safe</b> <b>harbors.</b> In several high profile cases against MySpace, YouTube, and other Internet sites, the clarification of the DMCA <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> could prove to be just as important to the Internet as their enactment in 1998. This Essay has attempted to clear up two of the biggest uncertainties regarding the DMCA 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to vicarious liability, and the so-called 2 ̆ 2 red flags 2 ̆ 2 theory of knowledge {{on the part of the}} Internet service provider. Specifically, under a proper interpretation of the DMCA, courts should (i) reject the 2 ̆ 2 loophole 2 ̆ 2 theory that posits that the DMCA <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> provide no immunity from vicarious liability at all, and (ii) require a high burden for proving a 2 ̆ 2 red flags 2 ̆ 2 theory by requiring knowledge of facts that show specific and 2 ̆ 2 obvious 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 blatant 2 ̆ 2 infringement. This Essay offers five principles for courts and Congress to consider in applying or amending the DMCA <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> in the future. The DMCA <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> should be made truly 2 ̆ 2 safe 2 ̆ 2 harbors, in a way that encourages greater investment in and the development of speech technologies on the Internet, all while encouraging copyright holders to share the burden of reducing infringement by utilizing the DMCA notice and take-down procedure...|$|R
25|$|DMCA Title II, the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act ("OCILLA"), {{creates a}} <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> for online service {{providers}} (OSPs, including ISPs) against copyright infringement liability, provided they meet specific requirements.

OCILLA {{also includes a}} counternotification provision that offers OSPs a <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> from liability to their users when users claim that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing.

25|$|Pinterest has a {{notification}} system that copyright holders {{can use to}} request that content {{be removed from the}} site.

Pinterest users cannot claim <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> status and as such are exposed to possible legal action for pinning copyright material. Because Pinterest allows user to transfer information, intellectual property rights come to play.

25|$|Patent {{infringement}} typically {{is caused}} by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in {{the claims of the}} granted patent. There is <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This <b>safe</b> <b>harbor</b> does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug. In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{liability}} remains {{perhaps the}} only meaningful remedy for rights owners {{when it comes to}} the widespread copyright and trademark infringement on the Internet. It is often extremely difficult and costly to reach the direct infringers. Right holders thus seek, under various theories of indirect liability, to hold liable those who provide the means that enable the violations. While trademark and copyright doctrines of secondary liability stem from the same roots in common law, they have evolved separately. Courts have applied secondary liability differently depending on whether the infringement pertains to copyright or trademark, with secondary liability construed more narrowly in trademark than in copyright. In addition, the <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> enacted in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) grant Internet service providers liability limitations for monetary and injunctive relief. These <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> apply to certain types of intermediary activities—namely, mere conduit, caching, hosting and linking. While the DMCA’s <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> scheme has been successful in shielding intermediaries from liability (and thus allowing new services to flourish), the statute lacks clarity and coherence, which sometimes makes the outcomes difficult to predict. Moreover, the statute’s lack of clarity may lead to unintended consequences, particularly in connection with potential abuses of the “notice and takedown” procedure. On the other hand, activities that fail to qualify for <b>safe</b> <b>harbors</b> are analyzed under the ordinary rules of secondary liability, which continue to evolve in courts...|$|R
