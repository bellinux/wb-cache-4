5|$|England {{started their}} second innings with {{a deficit of}} 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the {{premature}} {{end of the second}} day due to bad light. The following morning, they made slow and steady progress as Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. The four men in the off <b>side</b> <b>ring</b> had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were few scares.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—between bat and pad for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards, leaving the score at 64/2, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings and took the score to 121 at lunch without further loss. Hutton and Compton were 42 and 37 respectively. Compton started slowly but had accelerated as the adjournment approached. The morning's batting had been relatively slow, with only 67 runs scored in 100minutes, of which Hutton added only 23. The morning session also featured a tight spell of 13 overs by Ring. The leg spinner did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders. At the other end, Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. There were four men in the off <b>side</b> <b>ring</b> and they had {{much work to do}} as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed steadily and both Johnston and Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were no other scares. Towards the end of the morning session, the second new ball became available but Bradman decided to bide his time. He allowed Johnston to rest after his morning spell and used Lindwall and Miller—delivering off spinners—to bowl with the old ball for the last half hour before lunch break so that the trio could use the adjournment to recuperate before attacking with the new ball.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} effects of the rain on the pitch, the humid {{conditions}} assisted the Australian fast bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Led by Lindwall, who took 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52, and Ring did not get a chance to bowl. Ring then made nine before being caught by Jack Crapp in the slips as Australia replied with 389. [...] England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears late on day two and resumed at 1/54 the next morning. During the first session, Ring bowled a tidy spell of 13 overs as Denis Compton and Len Hutton added only 67 runs for the session. Ring did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders. There were four men in the off <b>side</b> <b>ring</b> and they had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed steadily although Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton. Later in the day, Ring dismissed debutant Allan Watkins for two to take his only wicket of the match. Watkins lofted a delivery from Ring to the leg side straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The hosts were eventually bowled out early on the fourth morning for 188, sealing defeat by an innings and 149 runs. Ring had taken 1/44 after sending down the most overs in the innings (28), including 13 maidens.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThiostrepton (TSR), often {{referred}} as {{to a parent}} compound in the thiopeptide family, is a bimacrocyclic member that features a quinaldic acid (QA) moiety-containing <b>side</b> <b>ring</b> appended to the characteristic core system. QA biosynthesis requires an unusual ring-expanding conversion, showing a methyl transfer onto and a rearrangement of the indole part of L-tryptophan to give a quinoline ketone. Herein, we report that the process involves {{the activities of the}} radical methyltransferase TsrT, aminotransferase TsrA, dehydrogenase TsrE, and cyclase TsrD. TsrU, a stereospecific oxidoreductase, catalyzes the further conversion of the ketone into an enantiomerically pure S-alcohol. Elucidation of this chemistry, which is common in the biosynthesis of a number of thiopeptides sharing a QA <b>side</b> <b>ring</b> system, facilitates analog generation, as shown by the achievement of region-specific fluorination of thiostrepton with the improved antibacterial activity...|$|E

40|$|Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a {{cryptographic}} primitive that hides {{memory access}} patterns {{as seen by}} untrusted storage. This paper proposes Ring ORAM, the most bandwidth-efficient ORAM scheme for the small client storage setting in both theory and practice. Ring ORAM is the first tree-based ORAM whose bandwidth is in-dependent of the ORAM bucket size, a property that unlocks multiple performance improvements. First, Ring ORAM’s overall bandwidth is 2. 3 × to 4 × better than Path ORAM, the prior-art scheme for small client storage. Second, if memory can perform simple un-trusted computation, Ring ORAM achieves constant on-line bandwidth (∼ 60 × improvement over Path ORAM for practical parameters). As a case study, we show Ring ORAM speeds up program completion time in a secure processor by 1. 5 × relative to Path ORAM.

40|$|SummaryThiostrepton (TSR) is an archetypal thiopeptide {{antibiotic}} {{possessing a}} quinaldic acid (QA) moiety in the <b>side</b> <b>ring</b> system. According to {{the mechanism of}} TSR previously known to target bacterial ribosome, we recently designed and biosynthesized several TSR derivatives that varied in QA substitution. Utilizing these thiopeptide antibiotics to treat the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium marinum, we herein report a novel mode of action of TSRs, which induce ER stress-mediated autophagy to enhance host cell defense. This intracellular response, which is sensitive to the modification of the QA group, serves as an indirect but unignorable mechanism for eliminating intracellular pathogens. TSRs are thus the only type of antibiotics, to our knowledge, with the dual action on both the parasitic bacteria and the infected host cells. The newly observed mechanism of TSRs may inspire the future change {{in the treatment of}} intracellular pathogens, by taking host response into account...|$|E
