5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that {{if she was going to}} do nothing else <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E

25|$|Edith Shain {{wrote to}} Eisenstaedt {{in the late}} 1970s {{claiming}} to be {{the woman in the}} picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she thought <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a journal}} entry {{written in the}} 1970s, Oates sarcastically {{addressed}} her critics, writing, [...] "So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses {{to look at it}} that way; many more titles and <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well...</b> what?...give up all hopes for a 'reputation'? [...] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge a new book by Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist? Where does one start?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... 3But I {{want you}} {{to realize that the}} head of every man is Christ, {{and the head of the}} woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 4Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 5But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head {{uncovered}} dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. 6For if a woman does not cover her head, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. 7 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 8For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 10It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. 11Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 12For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 13Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 15but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 16If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mother thought}} for a moment that she would call her son back; but then she bethought herself that <b>she</b> also <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be without him. So the young earl, showing plainly by his eyes that he knew that much was the matter, went back with Fitzgerald towards the lodge.|$|R
6000|$|She {{did nothing}} but talk about [...] "seam and gusset and band," [...] and how fast she was getting on, and how good the linen was, and what sort was the best, till Jessie thought <b>she</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have been sewing all day as with her {{thoughts}} running on nothing else.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Personally,' Uta answered, 'I should prefer Mr. Oswald. To live {{always with}} Mr. Le Breton {{would be like}} living with an abstraction. No woman would ever care for him; <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> marry Spinoza's Ethics or the Ten Commandments. He's a perfect model of a socialist, and nothing else. Mr. Oswald has some human nature in him as well.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Dashwood smiled, {{and said}} nothing. Marianne lifted up {{her eyes in}} astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have held her tongue.|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be hung for a sheep {{as for a}} lamb. She {{invited him}} out of the {{mausoleum}} of a parlour into the kitchen.|$|E

60|$|Day declined, but its exit was not {{marked by}} much {{difference}} in the very feeble light, {{and the two men}} held steadily on. The moon came out. As far <b>as</b> appearances went <b>she</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have stayed in, for nobody saw her that night. Her mere existence somewhere in the sky, however, rendered the indescribable chaos visible. Hours passed by, but still the two men held on their way persistently.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little {{below the}} edge of the hill Almia stopped, and, turning toward the Commander-in-Chief, <b>she</b> said, 'You <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> surrender.

6000|$|... 'Ma says chits {{and jewels}} have no {{business}} together,' pursued Georgiana, 'and that's the reason why I have no trinkets except this, but I suppose my aunt Hawkinson was of a different opinion, because she left me this, though I used to think <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have buried it, for it's always kept in jewellers' cotton. However, here it is, I am thankful to say, and of use at last, and you'll sell it, dear Sophronia, and buy things with it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{can have}} a pair of mine," [...] said Felicity, who {{probably}} thought that since Sara was certain to yield to temptation, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be garbed decently for her transgression.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} those {{children}} are gone crazy about their acting," [...] said Mrs. Langford; [...] "and how Mr. Langford can encourage them in it I cannot think. So silly of Bee {{to go off}} in this way, when <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have sent by Martin!" [...] And her head being pretty much engrossed with her present occupation, {{she went out to}} obey a summons from the kitchen, without much perception of the consternation that prevailed in the drawing-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] said <b>she,</b> [...] "we <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> go {{back and}} take the first one." [...] So she turned and began to retrace her steps--the two gentlemen {{accompanying}} her. But {{when they got back}} they found that the one which Mr. Parkman had first selected was gone. It had been taken by another customer.|$|R
60|$|Heda {{asked where}} Nombe was and why supper was not ready, for Nombe played {{the part of}} cook and parlourmaid combined. I told her {{something}} of what had happened, whereon Heda, who did not appreciate its importance in the least, remarked that <b>she,</b> Nombe, <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have put on the pot before she went and done sundry other things which I forget. Ultimately we got something to eat and turned in, Heda grumbling a little because she must sleep alone, for she had grown used to {{the company of the}} ever-watchful Nombe, who made her bed across the door-hole of the hut.|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke with}} a certain asperity. She felt that Ann Veronica had duped her in that dream, and {{now that she had}} come up to London <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> speak her mind.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{am going}} to {{telegraph}} to my father about this,” said Phil, a little later. “If this vessel can get a cargo for Barbados <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> sail for that port as anywhere.” ...|$|E
60|$|The postman {{turned up}} a side-path, and the young girl, as though {{deciding}} within herself that if she could not go shopping at once <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get back for the skimming, retraced her steps.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Stand by her! What {{danger is}} she in? She has {{the law on}} her side; she has popular {{sentiment}} on her side; she has plenty of money and no conscience. All she wants with me is to load up all her moral responsibilities on me, and do as she likes {{at the expense of}} my character. I can't control her; and she can compromise me as much <b>as</b> <b>she</b> likes. I <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be her husband.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> {{have talked}} to the wind that whistled past them, for Pluto urged on his horses, and went faster than ever. Proserpina {{continued}} to cry out, and screamed so long and so loudly that her poor little voice was almost screamed away; {{and when it was}} nothing but a whisper, she happened to cast her eyes over a great broad field of waving grain--and whom do you think she saw? Who, but Mother Ceres, making the corn grow, and too busy to notice the golden chariot as it went rattling along. The child mustered all her strength, and gave one more scream, but was out of sight before Ceres had time to turn her head.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} thought {{came into her}} naughty little heart, that, since she would be {{suspected}} of having looked into the box, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> do so at once. Oh, very naughty and very foolish Pandora! You should have thought only of doing what was right, and of leaving undone what was wrong, and not of what your playfellow Epimetheus would have said or believed. And so perhaps <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> if the enchanted face on {{the lid of the}} box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at her, and if she had not seemed to hear, more distinctly than before, the murmur of small voices within. She could not tell whether it was fancy or no; but there was quite a little tumult of whispers in her ear,--or else it was her curiosity that whispered,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She rose {{slowly to}} her feet. The {{absolute}} serenity of his manner bespoke an impregnability of purpose before which the words died away on her lips. She realized that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> plead with the dead! ...|$|E

60|$|Dick leant {{over the}} table, and descried a small slipshod {{girl in a}} dirty coarse apron and bib, which left nothing of her visible but her face and feet. <b>She</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have been dressed in a violin-case.|$|E
60|$|They {{arrived at}} the hotel {{and sat on the}} terrace. A Chinese boy brought them cocktails. Edward was most anxious to hear all the news of Chicago and bombarded his friend with eager questions. His {{interest}} was natural and sincere. But the odd thing was that it seemed equally divided among a multitude of subjects. He was as eager to know how Bateman's father was as what Isabel was doing. He talked of her without a shade of embarrassment, but <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have been his sister as his promised wife; and before Bateman had done analysing the exact meaning of Edward's remarks he found that the conversation had drifted to his own work and the buildings his father had lately erected. He was determined to bring the conversation back to Isabel and was looking for the occasion when he saw Edward wave his hand cordially. A man was advancing towards them on the terrace, but Bateman's back was turned to him and he could not see him.|$|R
5000|$|As part of Destiny's {{eleventh}} birthday, Kate {{has arranged}} {{they go to}} the London premiere of the film [...] "Milky Star", in which Danny has a cameo as himself, where hopefully they'll be able to meet him and tell him Destiny is his daughter. The plan fails, as only Sunset seems to notice the two. Kate realises she hasn't planned how to get home, and they're stranded in London till morning. <b>She</b> decides they <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> use the time to seek out Danny at his home in Robin Hill. Destiny climbs over the fence and comes across Sunset in the garden. The two become fast friends and Sunset believes her story about them being sisters, but Destiny and Kate get thrown off the premises when Sunset's mother Suzy discovers them.|$|R
60|$|I suppose, madam, {{that you}} must {{sometimes}} have noticed {{one of the top}} candles of a chandelier, when the room gets hot, suddenly bending over and drooping and shedding tears of hot paraffine on the candles below, and perhaps on the table; and if you can remember what that overcome candle looked like, you will have an idea of what Miss Pondar looked like when she found out Lord Edward was a dog. I think that for one brief moment she hugged to her bosom the fond belief that I was intimate with the aristocracy, and that a noble lord, had he not departed this life, would have been the first to welcome me home, and that she--she herself--was in my service. But the drop was an awful one. I could see the throes of mortified disappointment in her back, as she leaned over a bed of pinks, pulling out young plants, I am afraid, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> weeds. When I looked at her, I was sorry I let her know it was a dog I mourned. She has tried so hard to make everything all right while we have been here, that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have gone on thinking that it was a noble earl who died.|$|R
