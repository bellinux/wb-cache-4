40|$|In a {{previous}} study of Quaas et al.  (2008) the radiative forcing by anthropogenic aerosol due to aerosol–cloud interactions, RF aci, was obtained by a statistical analysis of satellite retrievals using a multilinear regression. Here we employ a new <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> to obtain the fitting parameters, determined using a nonlinear least square <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> {{for the relationship between}} planetary albedo and cloud properties and, further, for the relationship between cloud properties and aerosol optical depth. In order to verify the performance, the results from both <b>statistical</b> <b>approaches</b> (previous and present) were compared to the results from radiative transfer simulations over three regions for different seasons. We find that the results of the new <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> agree well with the simulated results both over land and ocean. The new <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> increases the correlation by 21 – 23  % and reduces the error compared to the previous approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares two {{different}} approaches for providing QoS in the Internet backbone. The first, denoted as simple approach, {{is a simple}} method of Admission Control performed by a weighted-fair-queuing scheduler. This approach guarantees QoS with a suitable overprovisioning of transmission resources. The second approach, denoted as basic <b>statistical</b> <b>approach,</b> is a full-featured statistical framework, based on the central limit approximation, for estimating the delay bound violation probability associated to each traffic class, given the offered traffic and the schedulers’ configuration. Both approaches adopt the dual-leaky-bucket (p, r, b) regulated traffic model in order to characterize the aggregate traffic flows. At first, we analyze the characteristics of both approaches in order {{to point out the}} respective pros and cons. Then, we propose an enhanced version of the basic <b>statistical</b> <b>approach,</b> the enhanced <b>statistical</b> <b>approach.</b> Our novel approach, as opposed to the basic <b>statistical</b> <b>approach,</b> performs a joint optimization of the regulator’s parameters and of the network capacity instead of a separate optimization. Our study shows that the enhanced <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> outperforms both the basic <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> and the simple approach and offers the highest potential for a better utilization of transmission resources. The basic and the enhanced <b>statistical</b> <b>approaches</b> assume that traffic is Gaussian. The simple approach has looser constraints on the statistical behavior of traffic, but it requires overprovisioning of transmission resources to guarantee the required QoS in terms of packet delay and loss...|$|R

The <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> overcomes the limitations of the dictionary based <b>approach.</b> The <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> is developed by utilizing the statistical information about the association of adjacent characters in Chinese text collected from the Chinese corpus.

They were quite successful in explaining several prominent features of the global nuclide distributions and many other aspects, while there are controversial conclusions on the origin of the even-odd effect in the nuclear-charge yields. We analyze the ingredients of the main <b>statistical</b> <b>approaches</b> to the even-odd effect in fission and show up that many of their deficiencies rely on unrealistic assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that the large body of experimental results, obtained in the recent years to a great part at GSI, Darmstadt, is very successfully reproduced by a new stringent <b>statistical</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R

Recent studies on constrained Markov Bayesian polynomial (CMBP) framework take the first step towards bridging the gap between rule-based and <b>statistical</b> <b>approaches</b> for DST. In this paper, the gap is further bridged by a novel framework [...] recurrent polynomial network (RPN). RPN's unique structure enables the framework to have all the advantages of CMBP including efficiency, portability and interpretability. Additionally, RPN achieves more properties of <b>statistical</b> <b>approaches</b> than CMBP. RPN was evaluated on the data corpora of the second and the third Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC- 2 / 3). Experiments showed that RPN can significantly outperform both traditional rule-based <b>approaches</b> and <b>statistical</b> <b>approaches</b> with similar feature set.

Apart from obvious mathematical objections to citing correlation coefficients to four significant figures from Snyder's relatively inaccurate analytical data, several more fundamental criticisms are leveled at the <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> of Dasgupta. These relate to compositional zoning and disequilibrium in the minerals, inhomogeneities {{of the samples}} caused by inclusions and exsolved phases, measured site population data for the major cations in olivines and pyroxenes, {{and the importance of}} coupled substitutions in the crystal structures.

The linguistic approach used the E χ ATOLP tool [19] to identify noun phrases from a corpus previously noted by the PALAVRAS parser [75]. The <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> used the NSP package to identify terms that contained an absolute frequency superior to a given value. Also for the <b>statistical</b> <b>approach,</b> they removed (i) stopwords; (ii) text structural demarcations, such as ‘Introduction’ and ‘References’; and (iii) the candidate terms whose words began with capital letters in order to remove proper nouns, such as ‘São Paulo’. The extracted terms were evaluated {{with the support of}} a gold standard of n-grams. As a result, the authors state that the <b>statistical</b> <b>approach</b> presents high simplicity in its execution. However, they obtained better results when using the linguistic approach. The values obtained by the tool, for a corpus of the JPED corpus, have the F-measure = 34.48 % for bigrams and the F-measure = 38.37 % for trigrams [68].|$|R
