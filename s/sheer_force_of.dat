5|$|Cornelio Saavedra, who {{was aware}} of the conspiracy, {{considered}} it a plot by peninsulars to secure political power over the criollo peoples. He marched with the Regiment of Patricians swiftly to the Plaza, and thwarted the mutiny. There was no violence in the operation, as the criollos forced the rebels to give up just by the <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> numbers. Thus, Liniers stayed in office as viceroy. All the heads of the mutiny were sentenced to prison at Carmen de Patagones, and the militias that took part in it were dissolved. The only peninsular militias remaining were those of Andaluces and Montañeses, who did not join the mutiny; criollos obtained the military command, and the political power of Saavedra increased even more.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough's insatiable {{ambition}} {{made him}} the richest of all Anne's subjects. His family connections wove him {{into the fabric of}} European politics (his sister Arabella became James II's mistress, and their son, the Duke of Berwick, emerged as one of LouisXIV's greatest Marshals). His leadership of the allied armies consolidated Britain's emergence as a front-rank power. He successfully maintained unity among the allies, thereby demonstrating his diplomatic skills. Throughout ten consecutive campaigns during the Spanish Succession war, Marlborough held together a discordant coalition through his <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> personality and raised the standing of British arms to a level not known since the Middle Ages. Although in the end he could not compel total capitulation from his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise from a minor to a major power, ensuring the country's growing prosperity throughout the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Madlax and Margaret {{meet and}} {{embark on a}} search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who {{supposedly}} knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.|$|E

5|$|The Evil Campaign follows an {{alternative}} {{version of the}} War in the North. Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the Nazgûl to the North to muster wild Goblins. His lieutenants lead the Goblin army and launch {{an assault on the}} Elven forest of Lórien. Despite heavy resistance, the forest is overrun, with Celeborn slain and Galadriel having fled to Rivendell; even Caras Galadhon collapses under the <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the massive invasion. The Mouth peers eagerly into the captured Mirror of Galadriel for his next attack, as his Goblins celebrate their triumph over the Elves amidst the ruins of the once-mighty ancient stronghold. Another group of Goblins, led by the Goblin King Gorkil, attacks the Grey Havens by land and sea. The Elven port is destroyed and captured, and the march across Eriador begins; Hobbits of the Shire are chosen as the next target. Gorkil's horde manages to crush the Hobbits and burn their country to the ground, but Saruman's servant Gríma Wormtongue, suddenly appears with a large army of Isengard Uruks and claims the land for his master. The Goblins annihilate the well-trained army and kill Wormtongue, taking the Shire for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister Iris {{in the small town}} of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and places her hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E

25|$|A {{philosophical}} Radical of {{a somewhat}} mid-19th century type, and highly {{suspicious of the}} later opportunistic reaction (in all its forms) against Cobdenite principles, he yet retained {{the respect of the}} majority whom it was his usual fate to find against him in British politics by the indomitable consistency of his principles and by <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> character and honesty of conviction and utterance. His legacy was a purely moral one; although in May 1870 he married Mrs. Rose Mary Ayling, the union produced no heirs. Mrs. Ayling was already married when she met John Morley and the couple waited to marry until her first husband died several years later (another similarity to John Stuart Mill). She was never received into polite society, and many of his colleagues, including Asquith, never met her. Morley had three siblings, Edward Sword Morley (1828–1901), William Wheelhouse Morley (1840-Abt. 1870), and Grace Hannah Morley (1842-1925).|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Union {{soldiers}} {{found the}} uncompleted short trench {{in back of}} the fort which allowed them an easier opportunity to climb onto the fort's parapet.

Soldiers of the 12th West Virginia Infantry Regiment were reported to be the first to cross into the fort after their flag had been planted at the top of the wall.

25|$|The film {{touches on}} themes such as free will vs. determinism, {{the role of}} chance in people's destiny, and obscure cause-effect relationships. Through brief flash-forward {{sequences}} of still images, Lola's fleeting interactions with bystanders are revealed to have surprising and drastic effects on their future lives, serving as concise illustrations of chaos theory's butterfly effect, in which minor, seemingly inconsequential variations in any interaction can blossom into much wider results than is often recognized. (However, another explanation is that Lola's interactions with them didn't really cause anything. It's just that each person inherently has vastly different possibilities of life trajectory, a different version of which is explored and shown in the three iterations.) The film's exploration {{of the relationship between}} chance and conscious intention comes to the foreground in the casino scene, where Lola appears to defy the laws of chance through <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> will, improbably making the roulette ball land on her winning number {{with the help of a}} glass-shattering scream.|$|E

Rose served as deputy adjutant-general on Pasha's staff at the Battle of El Mesden in January 1841 and then became senior British officer on Pasha's staff later that year. He became British consul-general for Syria and Lebanon in August 1841 and found himself preventing feuds between the Maronites and Druzes. On one occasion in 1841, he rode between them at imminent risk to his life and by the <b>sheer</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> a stronger will stopped the conflict. On another occasion he rescued 700 American missionaries from Mount Lebanon and took them to Beirut walking himself all the way so that his horse could be available to old women. He transferred to the diplomatic service in January 1848 and Lord Palmerston appointed him secretary of the embassy at Constantinople in January 1851. He became chargé d'affaires in the absence of Sir Stratford Canning during a diplomatic crisis over Russian demands that they be allowed to give protection over all Christians in Turkey. He so strengthened the hands of the Ottoman Porte that the Russian attempt to force a secret treaty upon Turkey was foiled. He was promoted to brevet colonel on 11 November 1851.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} bioreactors re-taining mercury from contaminated industrial wastewa-ter was analyzed at the laboratory scale, and its response to mechanical perturbations (gas bubbles and shaking) {{as well as}} to physical (increased temperature and hy-draulic load) and chemical stresses (increased mercury concentration) likely to occur during on site operation was studied. Two packed-bed bioreactors with 80 -cm 3 lava chips as biofilm carrier were inoculated with nine Hg(II) -resistant natural isolates of a- and g-proteobacte-ria. Chloralkali wastewater containing ionic mercury (3. 0 to 9. 7 mg/L Hg 2 +), amended with sucrose and yeast ex-tract, flowed through the bioreactors at 160 mL/h. During the 16 -month investigation the bioreactors showed no sign of depleted performance in terms of mercury-retaining capacity. After 16 months, both bioreactors still retained 96 % of the mercury load. The performance of the bioreactors was sensitive to mechanical perturba-tions (e. g., <b>sheer</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> gas bubbles). Shifts to higher Hg 2 + inflow concentrations initially decreased the mer-cury retention efficacy slightly. However, the bioreactors could adapt to Hg 2 + concentrations of up to 7. 6 mg/L within several days. Old biofilms were less affected than the younger ones. The performance of the bioreactors was not affected by an increase in temperature up to 41 °C and an increased volumetric load (up to 240 mL/h). The bioreactors regained activity spontaneously after the stress had stopped. Recovery could be accelerated by increased nutrient concentration, although this may lead to blocking of the packed bed. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons...|$|R
50|$|The Mi-24's favoured munition was the 80 mm S-8 rocket, the 57 mm S-5 having proven {{too light}} to be effective. The 23 mm gun pod was also popular.
