2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer <b>surface</b> <b>filtration.</b> In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In <b>surface</b> <b>filtration,</b> the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest <b>surface</b> <b>filtration,</b> microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E

5000|$|Beer is {{mechanically}} filtered by flowing {{the beer}} through layers of filter material; {{the two main}} techniques are <b>surface</b> <b>filtration</b> and cake filtration. Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g. hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters fine enough to strain colour and body from the beer. The normal filtration ratings are defined as rough, fine or sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration yields a beer which is nearly transparent and not cloudy, although observation of the scattering of light through the beer will reveal the presence of some small particles. Finally, as its name implies, sterile filtration is fine enough that almost all microorganisms in the beer have been removed. Beer which has been filtered is usually held in [...] "bright tanks" [...] at the brewery before bottling or additional treatment.|$|E

Previously we {{have shown}} that relative glomerular mesangial expansion was an important correlate of renal dysfunction in diabetes. To extend the understanding of structural functional relationships, 37 patients with type I diabetes mellitus for 5 to 33 years were studied with multiple creatinine clearance (CCr), urinary albumin excretion, and blood pressure measurements, and percutaneous renal biopsies. Glomerular volume and percent sclerosed glomeruli were determined; quantitiatve stereology was performed to determine relative glomerular structural parameters. Per glomerulus we calculated mesangial volume and capillary <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> and per patient we estimated capillary <b>filtration</b> <b>surface.</b> Capillary <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> per glomerulus or per patient were highly predictive of CCr (r = + 0. 78, r = + 0. 79, P < 0. 001). There was a significant but weak relationship between CCr and mesangial volume. However, mesangial volume and glomerular volume together were highly predictive of both CCr and <b>filtration</b> <b>surface.</b> Mesangial volume was increased and <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> decreased in the hypertensive patients and the patients with urinary albumin excretion less than 250 mg/ 24 hr. Thus, it appears that mesangial expansion within a relatively large glomerulus has less influence on filtration than does a similar increase in mesangial volume within a smaller glomerulus. There is a striking relationship between glomerular filtration rate and <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> in diabetes throughout the range from hyperfiltration to significant hypofiltration...|$|R

This does not account properly for the transition from depth filtration to cake filtration.

When the <b>surface</b> <b>filtration</b> regime is entered, only a two-dimensional surface is available for deposition. With a fixed amount of test dust per particle batch, either the simulation is inefficient because the amount is chosen appropriately for the <b>surface</b> <b>filtration,</b> and many more flow fields are computed than necessary during the depth filtration, or the simulation has to be stopped after the depth filtration because too high particle concentrations would yield unrealistic overlapping particles and too high pressure drop in the cake filtration regime.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether ACE inhibition increases renal <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> area in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). MethodsSHR were treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril at a high dose (3 mg/kg/day) or a low dose (0. 1 mg/kg/day) during the period of hypertension development, from 7 to 14 weeks of age. Some animals were treated concomitantly with the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist, S 16118. Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure and body weights were measured twice weekly. At termination of treatment, glomerular number and volume, length, and surface area of glomerular capillaries and renal <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> area were estimated using unbiased stereological techniques. ResultsThere were significant dose-related reductions in blood pressure with high- and low-dose perindopril treatment. Neither low- nor high-dose perindopril treatment had any effect on glomerular number or size or glomerular capillary length and surface area. Hence, there was no significant difference in total renal <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> area between any of the experimental groups (8721 ± 610 mm 2 in untreated SHR and 7879 ± 338 mm 2 and 8767 ± 437 mm 2 in the low and high dose perindopril-treated groups, respectively).

The diameter of the generated polydisperse particles was between 6 and 800 nm. Deposition was evaluated with the curves of pressure drop {{as a function of}} time.

Thirty normo- or microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients having a renal biopsy were followed every 6 months for a mean of 6. 2 years. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) {{at the time of}} biopsy, determined by iohexol clearance, correlated with <b>filtration</b> <b>surface</b> per glomerulus, but no other quantitative microscopic morphometric parameter.

The GFR increased and decreased in a parabolic manner in two patients. Seven of the nine patients with a statistically significant decline in renal function did not show any appreciable worsening of albuminuria, while two patients developed persistent proteinuria. Thus, in renal biopsy-proven normo- or microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, glomerular hyperfiltration is closely associated with an increased glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>surface.</b> An elevated GFR predicts its subsequent decline, which may occur without worsening of albuminuria...|$|R

However the XCT measurement posts many challenges to surface texture assessment of AM parts.

This work proposes a novel strategy that the <b>surface</b> <b>filtration</b> and roughness parameterisation techniques can deal with triangular mesh. Based on the link between the Gaussian cutoff wavelength and the diffusion time, the proposed linear diffusion equation can achieve a Gaussian filtering effect on complex surfaces.
