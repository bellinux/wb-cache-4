30|$|In recent years, the {{synchronization}} {{problem of}} complex networks has attracted {{more and more}} attention from different areas, such as mathematics, physical science, communication, engineering, and so on. There are some control schemes to accomplish the synchronization of a complex network, such as pinning control [4 – 7], adaptive control [8, 9], impulsive control [10, 11], and the like. Pinning control {{is one of the}} effective methods in the synchronization control of a complex network, and this way is simple, practical, and economic. Because pinning controllers are applied to merely need a small part of nodes to drive the system in order to achieve the synchronization of complex network, and it is impossible to achieve synchronization by controlling all nodes in the reality. In the pinning control of a complex network, it is common knowledge {{that one of the most}} challenging problems is how to <b>select</b> <b>pinned</b> nodes to guarantee the convergence of the pinning process. In [5], the authors have proved that a class of linear coupled complex networks can achieve synchronization when the coupling strength is sufficiently large by pinning a part of nodes.|$|R
30|$|From (3.11) {{we can see}} that, for the nodes without pinning controllers. it is {{necessary}} to make their degrees g_i > p + q/cρ _. When the coupling strength c is very large, the pinning condition is easily to be arrived. In other words, the degree of each node satisfies C < 0 [6]. But, if c is not very large, then the nodes with low degrees should be controlled by controllers. As we all know, the nodes with low degrees receive a little information from other nodes, which need to be synchronized by controllers because of the nonlinearity of single node. Similarly, the nodes with high degrees receive more information from other nodes, that is, controlling one node with high degrees is equivalent to controlling some or dozens of nodes. Therefore, we should choose two kinds of nodes with low and high degrees in the undirected network. Firstly, we rearrange the nodes by size of degree in descending order. Then, we <b>select</b> <b>pinned</b> nodes from both sides to the middle. In this way, the nodes with low and high degrees can be taken into consideration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The rapidly rising incidences of {{counterfeit}} Inte-grated Circuits (ICs) in {{the semiconductor}} supply chain pose a significant {{threat to the}} electronic industry. These ICs may suffer from functional, performance or reliability issues and can affect design houses, chip manufacturers, system designers as well as end users. The standard chip/package/system level tests are often inadequate in detecting various forms of counterfeit ICs. On the other hand, design approaches that enable IC authentication are often not attractive due to significant design effort, hardware overhead and test cost. In this paper, we propose a novel defense against counterfeiting attacks through a “chip locking approach”, where an IC is made non-operational by locking <b>select</b> <b>pins</b> through insertion of Antifuse (AF) devices in input/output circuitry. It can be unlocked through application of a hard-to-clone key. The key is internally stored in a one-time programmable non-volatile memory.

Through mathematical analysis and simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed mech-anism provides high level of protection against all major forms of counterfeiting attacks (reselling, remarking and cloning) at ultralow overhead (< 0. 01 % area).
