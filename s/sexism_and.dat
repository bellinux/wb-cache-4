5|$|Just {{like most}} punk songs, Girlschool’s lyrics usually have short and direct texts, often {{reflecting}} the wild rock 'n' roll lifestyle and treating sex and romance {{as seen from}} a feminine point of view, {{with the use of}} reverse <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> tongue-in-cheek sense of humour.

5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the <b>sexism</b> <b>and</b> heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E

5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and <b>sexism,</b> <b>and</b> new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E
5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, <b>sexism,</b> <b>and</b> class difference.|$|E
