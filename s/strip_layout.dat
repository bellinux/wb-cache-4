Later strips, such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates, were usually only half that size, with two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, {{such as the}} New Orleans Times Picayune, or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] When Sunday strips {{began to appear in}} more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to follow a standardized <b>strip</b> <b>layout,</b> which provides newspapers with the greatest flexibility in determining how to print a strip.One notable distinction among Sunday comics supplements was the supplement produced in a comic book-like format, featuring the character The Spirit. These sixteen-page (later 8 page) standalone Sunday supplements of Will Eisner's character were included with newspapers from 1940 through 1952.During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller, to save the expense of printing so many color pages. The last full-page comic strip was the Prince Valiant strip for 11 April 1971. The dimensions of the Sunday comics continued to decrease in recent years, as did the number of pages. Sunday comics sections that were 10 or 12 pages in 1950 dropped to six or four pages by 2005. One of the last large-size Sunday comics in the United States is in the Reading Eagle, which has eight Berliner-size pages and carries 36 comics. It's banner headline is [...] "Biggest Comics Section in the Land". Another big-size comic section is that of The Washington Post which carries 41 strips in eight broadsheet pages although it also contains a sudoku and a Jumble puzzle. Canadian newspaper comic sections are unique not only because of being printed on Saturdays, but these usually are also part of the entertainment or lifestyle section. A notable exception is that of the Winnipeg Free Press which publishes an eight-page comic-only tabloid section.|$|E

40|$|Open {{cut mining}} in Australia {{is facing the}} {{greatest}} challenge in its hilstory in attempting to compete not only with other operations internationally, but also with underground operations domestically. Most flat dip and shallow depth surfacemineable coal reserves have been depleted {{during the last two}} decadc:s and new open cut operations must extract deeper coal deposits. As open cut coal mines move into deeper areas andl the stripping ratios increase, the relative cost of overburden removal also increases. It therefore becomes even more important to design the mine around the optimum overburden removal scheme. The deeper mines are usually multi-sc:am operations with a more complex geology and with more geotechnical and hydrological problems. Deeper mines are subjected to greater problems requiring more detailed mine planning and design, such as selection of the optimUJm mining method and pit layout. In planning and design of such operations, the number of alternative methods which nl~ed to be considered is consequently greater. Dragline productivity and its stripping capabilities are directly affect,~d by the selection of digging method, <b>strip</b> <b>layout</b> and pit geometry. Every mine has a unique combination of geological conditions. The operating methods that work well at one mine may not necessarily work at another site. Selection of an optimal stripping method, <b>strip</b> <b>layout</b> and pit geometry for a given dragline must be considered with respect to the geological conditions of the mine.

40|$|During recent years, the Australian coal {{industry}} has increasingly used large walking draglines {{as the dominant}} waste removal equipment in open cut coal mines. Because {{of the nature of}} the coal formations, dragline operations in Australian coal mining situations are quite complex and draglines are frequently used in applications beyond their normal capabilities. With the current trend to increasing dragline sizes in most of the Australian coal mines, the draglines become the highest capital investment item in these mines. It is therefore necessary to give detailed attention to the optimising operating procedures of the dragline. Dragline productivity and its stripping capabilities are directly affected by the selection of digging method, <b>strip</b> <b>layout</b> and pit geometry. Every mine has a unique combination of geological conditions. The operating methods that work well at one mine may not necessarily work at another site. Selection of an optimal stripping method, <b>strip</b> <b>layout</b> and pit geometry for a given dragline must be considered with respect to the geological conditions of the mines. With increasing geological complexity of Australian strip mines, it is becoming more important to use sophisticated techniques such as computerised mine planning methods to assist in optimising the dragline operations. A computerised dragline simulation model (CADSIM) has been developed for use in selection of optimum strategies for a dragline operation. The procedure developed links with a geological ore body model to develop a geological database for simulation. CADSIM model can be used in selection the most cost effective dragline digging method. A specific simulation language, 2 ̆ 2 DSLX 2 ̆ 2, was used to program seven common and innovative dragline methods currently used in Australian open cut mines. The DSLX language uses predefined functions to build strip geometry, working benches, blast profiles and spoil piles.

40|$|The nesting of {{two-dimensional}} shapes is {{a common}} problem, where raw material has to be economically cut. As for the single-pass single-row <b>strip</b> <b>layout,</b> several algorithms, based on established methods, have been proposed. Moreover, it should be noticed that the optimum layout should also consider a few constraints, like grain orientation for subsequent forming operation, correct bridge width, and the commercial roll of metal width {{in order to make}} solutions applicable in real industrial environments. Most of the procedures until now shown in literature are quite complex and often ignore these real constraints. They usually make use of sliding techniques and are not able to effectively work with relatively multiple-connected figures. In particular, most of the different proposed procedures are based on the No Fit Polygon (NFP) computation of non-convex polygons, which often generates holes. This work is a proposal for a more efficient method, which can be used in heuristic procedures. In order to overcome some faults of most of the former methods presented in literature, in this paper a new geometric entity called “No Fit Path” (NFPh) of non-convex polygons is applied. It allows researchers to find solutions of nesting problems even when there are NFP faults due to degenerate solutions. Moreover, the No Fit Path allows researchers to easily read, modify, or share their results, overcoming all those problems arising from the usual large amount of information and from the different origins and formats of the obtained data. Given two non-convex polygons, the algorithm is able to calculate their NFPh very quickly and without any approximation by a polygon clipping method. In this paper a totally automated procedure has been developed. This procedure firstly obtains the “No Fit Path” (NFPh); secondly, between all the existing positions on the NFPh, the algorithm searches the optimal one, minimizing the global waste. The proposed approach also allows designers to set an optimal orientation of the shapes on the roll of metal, taking account of the grain orientation in order to obtain the best mechanical characteristics for the cut pieces...|$|E

A database of standard die elements is created by parametric programming, which is an enhanced feature of AutoCAD. The greatest advantage achieved by the system is the rapid generation of the most efficient <b>strip</b> and die <b>layouts,</b> including information about the tool configuration...|$|R
40|$|The axial {{decay of}} Saint-Venant end effects is {{investigated}} for anti-plane shear deformations of semi-infinite generally laminated anisotropic strips. Imperfect bonding conditions are imposed at the interfaces. The analytical approach, using a displacement field which decays exponentially in the axial direction, {{gives rise to}} a transcendental equation for the real eigenvalues. The decay rate for the stresses is given in terms of the smallest positive eigenvalue. Laminated <b>strips</b> with periodic <b>layout</b> ale then considered. In the presence of imperfect bonding, the effective shear elastic moduli, computed through a homogenization method, depend on the total number of slipping interfaces in the laminate. Numerical examples confirm that the decay lengths computed with effective shear moduli represent the asymptotic values (for an increasing number of layers) for those of periodically laminated strips...|$|R
