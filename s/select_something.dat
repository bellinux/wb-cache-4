50|$|In {{the first}} section of the article Asheim goes over the {{difference}} of censorship of a book by the law or by a town, versus the choice of a librarian not to <b>select</b> <b>something</b> for her library. He states that the librarian is not censoring because she is making a choice that only affects her specific institution, whereas the choice the censors are making affect an entire town or nation. The librarian is not saying that the book cannot be circulated, only that she is not going to circulate it. Patrons are still able to get it elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Audition {{pieces are}} not always from the show the actor is being {{considered}} for; an actor wishing to be cast in Hamlet may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do {{have a range of}} audition pieces and <b>select</b> <b>something</b> appropriate; an actor auditioning for Hamlet would have a dramatic Shakespearean monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an Oscar Wilde comedy, or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character).|$|E

50|$|In 1967. {{the fashion}} {{journalist}} Felicity Green {{was asked by}} the Fashion Museum, Bath to choose the most representative look for that year for their Dress of the Year collection. Green worked for the Daily Mirror, and wanted to pick something that reflected the type of quality ready-to-wear clothing available from good department stores anywhere in the country, rather than expensive high-end clothing that the average Mirror reader could never afford. She had also noticed that trouser ensembles were increasingly accepted in a wider range of contexts, and therefore, chose Bond's slim-cut orange, pink and yellow striped trousers, jacket and blouse for the Slimma label. The shoes were made by Saxone, also a widely-known and accessible High Street brand, although the hat was a custom one-off design by Edward Mann. 1967 marked {{the first time that the}} Dress of the Year was widely reported in the British fashion press, with Green contributing a significant article for the Mirror discussing her decision to <b>select</b> <b>something</b> that did not include an actual dress. The Adel Rootstein mannequin selected to model the look represented the African-American model Donyale Luna.|$|E
5000|$|Mowry taught {{thousands}} of undergraduates and mentored over fifty doctoral students in his career. He allowed graduate students to [...] "make {{their own decisions}} and use my own intervention {{as little as possible}} in making those decisions.". He worked vigorously with his students when they were selecting their dissertation topics to urge them to <b>select</b> <b>something</b> [...] "significant" [...] but also allowed students to select topics that could succeed without intrusive supervision. [...] His own mentor, John D. Hicks had played a similar role for Mowry and encouraged him to not write on a second rate figure but rather to find a [...] "big subject." [...] When Mowry suggested the Progressive Movement, Hicks said [...] "Fine, go ahead. That's big enough!" [...] Mowry's first teaching position was as an instructor then an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1938-1942. During World War II (1942-1944) he worked as a policy analyst for the Army Quartermaster Corps and then for the War Production Board. Mills College in California invited Mowry to become their May Treat Morrison Professor of American History. He taught there from fall 1944 to 1947 and also published Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Movement (1946) and did most of the research for his next book The California Progressives (1951). He left California for a professorship at the University of Iowa but in 1950 he returned to California this time as a full {{professor of history at the}} University of California at Los Angeles. He served as professor, department chair, (1955-1967) and also Dean of the Division of Social Sciences (1959-1967). He wrote The Era of Theodore Roosevelt (1958) and The Urban Nation (1965) and co-authored three additional books while at UCLA. He was invited as a visiting professor to the University of Strasbourg (1950-1951), University of Rennes (1951), Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1953-1954), University of Marseilles, Nice, (1958), University of California at Berkeley, Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) and Columbia University. He lectured in Italy, Japan, and India, and served as the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Visiting Professor of American History at Oxford University in 1960-1961. He returned to Chapel Hill in 1967 as the William Rand Kenan Professor of History. He wrote Another Look at the Twentieth-Century South (1973).|$|E
30|$|The as-if body {{loop and}} the body loop {{demonstrate}} the working of predicted sensory effects and sensed actual effects, respectively, as highlighted in the Sect.Â  2. These processes are mainly considered to be unconscious processes involving multiple options for responses evaluated in parallel, to determine an adequate response associated to a stimulus (cf. [40]). Through this parallel internal action simulation mechanism, the agent will not select a random option but the one which has the strongest valuated feeling. Therefore, depending on the weight values attached to each option at that particular moment, the model will show different behaviours in simulations. This purely unconscious mechanism may be interrupted by the effects of awareness (which will be explained later) to <b>select</b> <b>something</b> different by adding some bias to the mentioned process. Being a cyclic process, the effects of an injected bias may {{have the ability to}} compete with other options to finally provide a GO signal.|$|E

This paper explores the implications of rudimentary requirements for effective view navigation, namely that, despite the vastness of an information structure, the views must be small, moving around must not take too many steps and the route to any target be must be discoverable. The analyses help rationalize existing practice, give insight into the difficulties, and suggest strategies for design...|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} tree aspect which dominated the gameplay {{of the first}} game is largely absent in the sequel, where decision making is more focused on <b>selecting</b> <b>something</b> on-screen rather than the choice between rigid alternatives. For example, upon entering a room, the player can choose between several actions, such as looking around the room, examining a wardrobe or examining a bodybag. These choices are not presented as text choices {{as they were in}} the first game, but are instead available directly in the in-game interface.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays XML {{documents}} are prezented into the Web more than ever. Using XLink hyperlinks, a docu-ment can refer different portions {{of information in}} different documents into the Web. With XLink hyperlinks the XML documents in the Web can be investigated from querying point of view not just while browsing these docu-ments. There are few implementations regarding XLink recommendation and just two implementations regarding quering XML documents using XPath/XQuery expressions in presence of XLink hyperlinks. On the other side XPath/XQuery has many implementations and wide support from IT leaders in the world. In this paper it is shown another way of using XPath/XQuery to query XML documents in presence of hyperlinks. The paper shows a model and its implementation. To materialize the new model it is used Saxon-B processor, with which was created an ex-tention named BOTA.

40|$|The current {{designs of}} {{conventional}} Electronic Service Guides (ESGs) are an increasingly inefficient way for users {{to discover and}} <b>select</b> <b>something</b> to watch from the large amounts of digital broadcast content for Mobile TV available on handsets. One of the options to improve the design involves personalizing media selection from the existing Electronic Service Guide. The opportunity to deliver personalization has been made easier by the rapid pace of convergence. The overall aim of the project is to explore how to realize personalized ESG based on shifting contexts in converged digital broadcast and 3 G environments. This report covers a review of various aspects influencing ESG design, {{an analysis of the}} stakeholders involved in mobile TV, and the planning, implementation and analysis of a case study based on a broadcaster. On this basis, an ESG design is proposed and preliminary work has been done on a prototype. The report concludes with a brief discussion of ESGs for Mobile TV and suggestions for future work.

40|$|What I {{have tried}} to do in this and in all my writing on the early days of this country is what the artist does when he paints a sketch of a Canadian scene or a Canadian person. I {{have tried to}} <b>select</b> <b>something</b> that is {{beautiful}} or significant or interesting or essential to an understanding of ourselves. I have tried to tell the stories of personalities, {{men and women who have}} by their human qualities, aspirations, and activities, given substance to our history, whose loves and hates and fears and achievements have been woven into the very fabric of our Canadian consciousness. I have tried to say, as the painter says, âhere is something I think you would like to know,â âhere is something that has significanceâ or âhere is something that may evoke your love or pride or indignation I as the case may be. â (IO:x) This, in very simple terms, has been my aim here - to paint a picture, or rather a series of pictures of the North Shore, past and present, from the viewpoint of the human geographer.

Rather, I have selected from the accounts of yesteryear certain aspects which have an attraction for me personally, in the hope that these might also be of interest to others.

In an âextended presentâ, future research is increasingly transformed into an evaluation technique: the future is essentially dependent {{on the way in}} which something new is identified and ordered. It is concerned both with discarding irrelevant terms from the complex of simultaneity and with <b>selecting</b> <b>something</b> that is specific, important, complex, insecure, is not yet in existence or only appears diffuse. This intelligent modularisation of possibilities is becoming the core competence of future research. In any case, the focus is no longer on the intrinsic value of what is new, of what is yet to be: the future.|$|R

In addition, the research explored the effect of presenting this information in differing formats through the use of an online tool versus providing information in a tabular format.

However, when given very specific detail about cost-emission trade-offs and how to achieve them they appear to be more comfortable <b>selecting</b> <b>something</b> with reasonable ambition...|$|R
50|$|Selections, cut buffers, and {{drag-and-drop}} are {{the mechanisms}} {{used in the}} X Window System to allow a user to transfer data from one window to another. Selections and cut buffer are typically used when a user selects text or some other data in a window and pastes in another one. Drag-and-drop is used when a user <b>selects</b> <b>something</b> in a window, then clicks on the selection and drags it into another window. Since the two windows may be handled by two different applications, these mechanisms require two different clients connected with the same X server to exchange data. The X Window System core protocol includes some requests and events that are specific to selection exchange, but the transfer is mainly done using event sending and window properties, which are not specific to selection transfer.|$|R
40|$|After {{five years}} in Industrial {{engineering}} career, I thought that {{the best choice for}} my project was to <b>select</b> <b>something</b> connected with mechanical engineering {{and at the same time}} a topic that I have a great passion for. Nowadays, in 2014, the world is suffering a strong economic crisis that involves a lot of fields but especially the petrol sector. Furthermore, in the last few years the laws against CO 2 emission are becoming stronger and stronger and more restrictive. In order to bring into clear view this problem, this project attends to study the road mobility of the last years and to accomplisch a forecast for 2020, it examines not only the spanish production in the last decade, but also analyzing the critical parameters of the engine. To guide the reader and to make the project more understandable for people that are not expert in this fierd, this review is also supported by graphics and figures. All the data and numbers related to the engine parameters are provided by specialized publications as Automobil Revue. On the other hand, regarding the production numbers, these are obtained by the websites of several automotive brands. In the end, this study provides numerous considerations for the future of automotive sector and also the path that can be followed in order to achieve a better engine efficiency. Since the automotive brands are becoming aware of the importance of the environment, car manufacturers are trying to develop a more eco-friendly vehicles. In addition, these improvements can help us not to waste all natural resources and to preserve the world around us...|$|E

60|$|Trade {{is carried}} on with the natives {{by means of a}} {{standard}} valuation, called {{in some parts of the}} country a castor. This is to obviate the necessity of circulating money, of which there is little or none, excepting in the colony of Red River. Thus, an Indian arrives at a fort with a bundle of furs, with which he proceeds to the Indian trading-room. There the trader separates the furs into different lots, and, valuing each at the standard valuation, adds the amount together, and tells the Indian (who has looked on the while with great interest and anxiety) that he has got fifty or sixty casters; at the same time he hands the Indian fifty or sixty little bits of wood in lieu of cash, so that the latter may know, by returning these in payment of the goods for which he really exchanges his skins, how fast his funds decrease. The Indian then looks round upon the bales of cloth, powder-horns, guns, blankets, knives, etcetera, with which the shop is filled, and after a good while makes up his mind to have a small blanket. This being given him, the trader tells him that the price is six castors; the purchaser hands back six of his little bits of wood, and <b>selects</b> <b>something</b> else. In this way he goes on till all his wooden cash is expended; and then, packing up his goods, departs to show his treasures to his wife, and another Indian takes his place. The value of a castor is from one to two shillings. The natives generally visit the establishments of the Company twice a year--once in October, when they bring in the produce of their autumn hunts; and again in March, when they come in with that of the great winter hunt.|$|R

Every young man has his own ideal, {{as a matter of}} course, and they are all exactly alike. Now, I do not intend to repeat all the stale old saws of out-of-date wiseacres. Most of them are even more foolish than the follies they reprove. Take, for instance, the statement that [...] "beauty fades." [...] Absurd; everyone knows perfectly well that, as the years creep on, beauty simply gets more highly coloured. And then, [...] "beauty is only skin-deep." [...] Fantastically wrong! Some of it is not that; and, for the rest, is a woman like a toy balloon?--just a surface? To hear that proverb from a man is to know him at once for a phonographic kind of fool. The fundamental and enduring grace of womanhood goes down to the skeleton; you cannot have a pretty face without a pretty skull, just as you cannot have one without a good temper.|$|R
5000|$|RCA Victor {{introduced}} home phonograph disk recorders in October 1930. These phonographs {{featured a}} large counterbalanced tone arm with horseshoe magnet pick-up. These types of pick-ups {{could also be}} [...] "driven" [...] to actually move the needle and RCA took advantage of that by designing a system of home recording that used [...] "pre-grooved" [...] records. The material that the records were made from (advertised as [...] "Victrolac") was soft and {{it was possible to}} somewhat modulate the grooves using the pick-up with proper recording needle and a fairly heavy weight placed on the pick-up. The discs were only six inches in diameter so recording time at 78rpm was brief. Larger size Victor blanks were introduced late in 1931, when RCA-Victor introduced the Radiola-Electrola RE-57. These machines were capable of recording at 33 rpm as well as 78 rpm. One could <b>select</b> to record <b>something</b> from the radio or one could record using the hand-held microphone.

From gaze-tracking to {{linguistic}} content ascription, Bogdan tells us, the competences displayed in primate social interaction are adaptations, and as such, designed to enable effective action. What we have on our hands is thus "neither a (naive) logos nor literally about the psyche " (p. 2). It is, rather, a specialized kind of practical know-how, concerned with "external relata" [...] agents and relevant aspects of a context of interaction. Bogdan prefers therefore to use the term "interpretation, " whose "Ursense " he glosses as "organisms making sense of each other in contexts where this matters biologically " (p. 10). Interpretation is "a modality <b>selected</b> for doing <b>something</b> about a subject's goals and behaviors " (p. 30) in situations where these have a bearing on the goals (and therefore the biological interests) of the interpreter. The interpreter's "categorization prism [...] . articulates a network of nodes and routes of practical involvement " (p. 60).
