The technique utilizes a Hybrid computer simulation of the compressor momentum equation into which actual transient data are used to provide all terms but the desired compressor characteristic. The compressor force characteristic {{as a function of}} corrected flow and speed result from the computation. The critical problem of data filtering is addressed. Results for a compressor operating in a turbofan engine are presented and comparison is made with the conventional compressor map.

40|$|There is a {{possibility}} that the exchange of the piping system may change the <b>surge</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a compressor. The piping system of a plant is not always {{the same as that of}} a test site. Then it is important to evaluate the effect of piping systems on surge characteristics in centrifugal compressors. Several turbochargers combined with different pip-ing systems were tested. The lumped parameter model which was simplified to be solved easily was applied for the prediction of surge point. Surge lines were calculated with the linearlized lumped parameter model. The difference between the test and calculated results was within 10 %. Trajectory of surge cycle was also examined by solving the lumped parameter model. Mild surge and deep surge were successfully predicted. This study confirmed that the lumped parameter model was a very useful tool to predict the effect of piping systems on surge characteristics in cen-trifugal compressors, even though that was a simple model...|$|E
40|$|Local scour due to tsunami is {{damaging}} {{especially on}} shallow foundation. Although relatively {{in a short}} duration, tsunami attack may scour material around buildings that led to destruction. A number of formulae on local scouring due to flood and tsunami have been available. The local scouring pattern and depth produced by tsunami may be affected by tsunami duration and tsunami surge Froude number and hence different to that resulted by flood which normally have much longer duration and lower Froude number. The research used a relatively short flume to create short duration tsunami surge that run-up on 1 : 20 beach slope and hit a vertical cylinder on land. Both the pattern {{and the depth of}} local scouring around the cylinder were observed and the results were compared with similar research but with different tsunami <b>surge</b> <b>characteristic.</b> It was shown that the maximum scour depth was significantly deeper than the final scour depth. When compared with other experimental study of local scour due to tsunami, the present local scour maximum depth seemed to be slightly less. This could have been caused by the relatively short duration of the present experiment. It was also found that the sidewall effect was insignificant when the ratio of cylinder diameter to the flume width was less then approximately 0. 15...|$|E
40|$|Compressor {{operation}} at low air flows {{for a given}} speed is limited by unstable flow conditions, commonly called surge. An investigation of surge in centrifugal compressors (reference 1) showed that the pulsation of pressures and velocities occurred when {{the slope of the}} compressor characteristic curve was positive and that the magnitude and frequency, as well as the incidence of surge, depended on the capacity and resistance of the total system. Although the theory presented in reference 1 is applicable to axial-floe compressors, little experimental information is available on the <b>surge</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the individual stages of axial-flow compressors, or on the variation of the <b>surge</b> <b>characteristics</b> with operating conditions.

40|$|The {{nature of}} rogue events is their unlikelihood {{and the recent}} unpredicted decade-long {{slowdown}} in surface warming, the so-called hiatus, may be such an event. However, given decadal variability in climate, global surface temperatures were never expected to increase monotonically with increasing radiative forcing. Here surface air temperature from 20 climate models is analyzed to estimate the historical and future likelihood of hiatuses and “surges” (faster than expected warming), showing that the global hiatus of the early 21 st century was extremely unlikely. A novel analysis of future climate scenarios suggests that hiatuses will almost vanish and surges will strongly intensify by 2100 under a “business as usual” scenario. For “CO 2 stabilisation” scenarios, hiatus, and <b>surge</b> <b>characteristics</b> revert to typical 1940 s values.

We find a linear relation between sea level rise and dune erosion volume, the exact linear relation being dependent on the local hydrodynamical boundary conditions. The process driving higher erosion appears to be sea level rise, allowing waves to attack the dune at a higher level. Additional simulations illustrate that a change in the offshore wave angle, potentially produced by changes in storm tracks, could influence the erosion volume with the same order of magnitude as sea level rise. Finally, simulations with different mitigation options (i. e., sand nourishments) illustrate the strong effect of the location of the added sand to the reduction in the dune erosion volume...|$|R

The small radial distortions investigated also had engine over that obtained with the uniform inlet pressure distribution.

Circumferential-type inlet flow distortions were investigated, which covered a range of distortion sector angles from 20 deg to 168 deg and distortion levels up to 22 percent. The presence of inlet airflow distortions at the compressor face resulted in a substantial increase in the local pressure ratio in the distorted region, primarily for the inlet stages. The local pressure ratio in the distorted region for the inlet stages increased as either the distortion sector angle decreased or the percent distortion increased. The average compressor-surge pressure ratio was much more sensitive to inlet airflow distortions at lower engine speeds than at engine speeds near rated. Hence, compressor-surge margin reduction due to inlet airflow distortion was quite severe at the lower engine speeds. Although the average compressor-surge pressure ratio was generally reduced with inlet flow distortion, local pressure ratios across the distorted sector of the compressor were obtained during surge and were significantly greater than the normal compressor-surge pressure ratio.

A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model in a horizontal direction (2 DH) coupled with a storm-surge model has been employed for the study. Numerical experiments with three different cyclone translation speeds show that when the surge height is directly forced by the cyclonic wind speed especially within the RWM (Radius of Maximum Wind), faster translation speed produces reduced surge height as the cyclone gets less time to force the water. On the other hand, at locations outside the RMW, surge waves travel as a propagating long wave where higher surges are produced by faster moving cyclones. It is found that surge arrival times {{are more and more}} affected by tidal phase when cyclone translation speed is reduced. Analysis of seven hypothetical parallel cyclone paths show that local bathymetry and complex coastline configurations strongly influence the surge height and surge arrival time along the Bangladesh coast.

Previous research has provided recommendations on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design and installation practices, endorsement of EMI/RFI immunity and SWC test criteria and test methods, and determination of ambient electromagnetic conditions at nuclear power plants.
