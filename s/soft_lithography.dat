25|$|Micro-contact {{printing}} or <b>soft</b> <b>lithography</b> {{is analogous}} to printing ink with a rubber stamp. The SAM molecules are inked onto a pre-shaped elastomeric stamp with a solvent and transferred to the substrate surface by stamping. The SAM solution {{is applied to the}} entire stamp but only areas that make contact with the surface allow transfer of the SAMs. The transfer of the SAMs is a complex diffusion process that depends on the type of molecule, concentration, duration of contact, and pressure applied. Typical stamps use PDMS because its elastomeric properties, E = 1.8 MPa, allow it to fit the countour of micro surfaces and its low surface energy, γ = 21.6 dyn/cm². This is a parallel process and can thus place nanoscale objects over a large area in a short time.|$|E

40|$|Narrative Highlight Text: Chemical {{synthesis}} methods provide {{means to}} produce high yields of metal nanoparticles with precise radii. Catalytic, electrical and optical applications ultimately stand {{to benefit from}} nanoparticles with sub- 20 nm sizes. However, approaches to pattern chemically synthesized nanoparticles on surfaces are fewer. As a result, physical–based methods have emerged as an alternative where nanoscale features and elements are explicitly patterned followed by physical vapor deposition to deposit the metal, often at relatively lower temperatures. Examples include conventional electron beam <b>lithography,</b> <b>soft</b> interference <b>lithography</b> and nanoimprint. Yet, in general, physical patterning methods yield two-dimensional (2 D) nanostructures, often intended to emulate, or serve as models for, 3 D features. Thus, chemical synthesis methods provide the best control over individual nanoparticle shape while physical methods are best for organizing the model nanoparticles over large areas.

The perfluorinated polyether material was found to be well suited to transfer the mold pattern into the resist by a direct imprinting process at low cost. Moderate deformations of the polymer mold structures occurring during the high pressure imprint are systematically studied. Features of decreased size are found to be more sensitive to pattern distortions. An optimized pattern design with increased structure density and constant pattern ratio is developed to minimize deformation effects. Imprints performed {{on the basis of these}} design rules result in reduced deformations and repeal their size dependence. The improved pattern transfer, especially for small structural elements, turns the direct and cost-effective soft UV-NIL into an interesting technique also for patterning tasks in the lower nanometer range...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} {{aspects of}} a <b>soft</b> nanoimprint <b>lithography</b> technique for operation at resolutions that approach the 1 -nm regime. Systematic studies using polymer molds made with single walled carbon nanotubes (diameters between 0. 5 and 5 nm) and high-resolution electron beam patterned layers of hy-drogen silsesquioxane (line widths and heights 10 and 20 nm, respectively) as templates reveal a dependence of the resolution limits on the polymer processing conditions. In particular, using a single choice of polymers for the molds and the molded materials, imprint {{results show that the}} conditions for spin casting and curing the polymers determine, to a large degree, the resolution and repli-cation fidelity that can be achieved. Optimized procedures enable imprinted polymer surfaces that have a root mean squared surface roughness of 0. 26 nm or lower and a resolution as high as 1 nm. These characteristics are significantly better than previous results obtained using these same polymers with unoptimized conditions. A diversity of molded polymers, including Bisphenol-F epoxy resin, polyacrylic acid, and polyurethane, show similar high-fidelity imprinting capabilities. Different procedures enable accurate relief replication for features with modest aspect ratios and dimensions of 10 nm. The results indicate that choice of processing conditions is, in addition to materials selections, extremely important in achieving high-fidelity <b>soft</b> nanoimprint <b>lithography</b> in the 1 – 10 -nm regime.

The lithographic characteristics of both polymers have been determined for 300 eV X-rays. With low doses (1 MGy), developed lines 40 ± 5 nm wide were created in poly(methyl methacrylate). At higher doses an exposure spreading phenomenon sub-stantially increases the lateral dimensions of the developed patterns. The spreading mechanism has been identified as the point-spread function of the zone plate lens. The per-formance of focused <b>soft</b> X-ray <b>lithography</b> is compared to other direct write methods. The practicality of a dedicated focused soft X-ray writer instrument is discussed. ...|$|R

Unfortunately, this method is not ideal for microlenses because the nanoholes around the periphery show significantly smaller diameter {{than that of the}} central ones, and some are even blocked, causing a large deviation of the focal length from the design. Therefore, developing a versatile and large-area fabrication technique for microlenses is crucial for their practical applications; nonetheless, the effective method using the current top-down or bottom-up approaches still remains a big challenge. Moreover, it is worthwhile to investigate the random defects on the focusing performance and the coupling effect between adjacent microlenses.|$|R
