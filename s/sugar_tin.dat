The paper traces the transformation of Gogodala attitudes to such products in terms of the development of a 'national culture' as well as a more globalising Christianity. It suggests that, for the Gogodala, consumption is an arena for what Foster has termed 'everyday nation making'. Yet, in this case, 'the nation' is understood and realised through a metaphoric association with Christian others, particularly Europeans. The basis of national subjectivity for the Gogodala, then, is an enduring relationship between Gogodala and expatriate Europeans. Alison Dundo...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} the work of Deaton and Laroque (2003) by formulating a {{nonlinear}} model of commodity prices. The paper makes three distinct contributions. First, a nonlinear model is constructed that explains long-run dynamics of commodity price behavior; secondly, more recent data is employed by updating the price, income and production indices; and finally advanced econometric techniques are adopted in order to investigate whether there is empirical evidence to support the theoretical underpinnings of the nonlinear model. Higher power tests broadly reverse the empirical findings of Deaton and Laroque’s (2003) model of commodity prices, lending support to the underlying theory proposed in this paper. Tests for cointegration provide evidence that the long-run relationship between world commodity production and world income for key commodities such as <b>sugar,</b> copper, and <b>tin</b> may be better explained by non-linear behavior...|$|R

Each filled the tin dish at the water filter opposite the stove, and retired with the whole stock in trade to the platform of the car. There he knelt down, supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or one elbow crooked about the railing, and made a shift to wash his face and neck and hands; a cold, an insufficient, and, if the train is moving rapidly, a somewhat dangerous toilet.|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{measures}} put {{in place}} by the Uganda Government ten years ago to combat Vitamin A deficiency, the number of children suffering from this deficiency remains high. Objective: To determine whether sugar may be used as a vehicle for vitamin A fortification. Design: Cross- sectional descriptive study Setting: Kamuli district in Uganda Patients: One thousand one hundred and four children, and one thousand one hundred and two mothers or care-takers participated in the study. Sugar consumption patterns for the two age groups were determined. The methods of sugar storage in households were also determined. The children were aged 12 to 36 months, and mothers /caretakers 16 to 45 years. Results: The overall proportion of households where sugar was consumed in the last seven days was 89. 2 % for children, and 88. 3 % for mothers / caretakers. Sugar was stored in covered tins in 67 % of the households, and in covered baskets in 28 % of households. Conclusion: Sugar is a potential vehicle for fortification with vitamin A for Kamuli district. Storage of <b>sugar</b> in covered <b>tins</b> and baskets means that the stability of the vitamin A in the fortified sugar might not be affected by exposure to light.

40|$|This {{workshop}} {{presents a}} model of the causes of commodity production cycles adapted from Goodman (1974), Exercise 10. Any raw material with the following characteristics is a commodity: ¤ It is undi ¯ erentiable. Thus no producer can obtain higher price or better trading terms through advertising or product modi ± cation. The producers must accept the open market price which prevails at the time of sale. ¤ Variable production costs (labor and materials) are small compared to ± xed costs. Thus, in the short term, output of the commodity will be relatively insensitive to price changes. ¤ For commodity users, the commodity price is {{only a small fraction of}} the ± nal product cost. Therefore, consumption is relatively price inelastic in the short run. More than twenty important commodities (for example, oil, cocoa, <b>sugar,</b> jute, and <b>tin)</b> change hands in the commodity trade. This trade accounts for a large share of the foreign exchange earnings of many less economically developed countries. The price and production rate of commodities is unstable and often varies from one year to the next by ± ve to twenty- ± ve percent. Commodity production cycles cause signi ± cant di ° culties for producers, dis-tributors, manufacturers, and consumers. As a result, individual countries and international agencies have invested considerable e ¯ ort in various stabilization schemes. None have been totally successful, and many have been absolute fail-ures. 3. 1 Commodity Production Model The following model illustrates a possible structure underlying long-term com-modity uctuations.

60|$|I {{had come}} over the hills on foot and alone in serene summer days, {{plucking}} the raspberries by the wayside, and occasionally buying {{a loaf of bread}} at a farmer's house, with a knapsack on my back which held a few traveller's books and a change of clothing, and a staff in my hand. I had that morning looked down from the Hoosack Mountain, where the road crosses it, on the village of North Adams in the valley three miles away under my feet, showing how uneven the earth may sometimes be, and making it seem an accident that it should ever be level and convenient for the feet of man. Putting a little rice and <b>sugar</b> and a <b>tin</b> cup into my knapsack at this village, I began in the afternoon to ascend the mountain, whose summit is three thousand six hundred feet above the level of the sea, and was seven or eight miles distant by the path. My route lay up a long and spacious valley called the Bellows, because the winds rush up or down it with violence in storms, sloping up to the very clouds between the principal range and a lower mountain. There were a few farms scattered along at different elevations, each commanding a fine prospect of the mountains to the north, and a stream ran {{down the middle of the}} valley on which near the head there was a mill. It seemed a road for the pilgrim to enter upon who would climb to the gates of heaven. Now I crossed a hay-field, and now over the brook on a slight bridge, still gradually ascending all the while with a sort of awe, and filled with indefinite expectations as to what kind of inhabitants and what kind of nature I should come to at last. It now seemed some advantage that the earth was uneven, for one could not imagine a more noble position for a farm-house than this vale afforded, farther from or nearer to its head, from a glen-like seclusion overlooking the country at a great elevation between these two mountain walls.|$|R
40|$|The {{volatility}} of commodity prices has become {{once again a}} matter of profound and controversial debates for both political and academic spheres worldwide {{in the framework of}} the global economy severely distressed by the recent economic turbulences. Although commodity markets were already notorious for their price instability, the events the world economy experienced in the years 2000 s offered new connotations to this phenomenon. In the first decade of this millennium, the commodity markets have struggled with high volatility, with prices reaching historical peaks just to crash dramatically some months later and very soon to restart their rise. The significant increase in volatility generated many debates about its triggering factors, the implications in terms of risk exposure of economic actors, but also the need for reconfiguring regulatory policy frameworks. The quest for the most appropriate means to deal with commodity price turbulences has known different stages over the years. Decision makers worldwide have sought alternatives, formulated and tested various mechanisms whose central aim was to mitigate price fluctuations. Governments formulate and implement consistent regulatory policies whose international coordination is a ‘sine qua non’ condition for stabilizing these markets. However, the turbulences on commodity markets often generate policy responses that sometimes exacerbate rather than mitigate the price instability. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the subject of governance regarding commodity price stabilization, offering a retrospective look at the mechanisms implemented over the years, with a central focus on the International Commodity Agreements – instruments through which in the previous decades the producer and consumer governments worldwide pursued price stabilization for some key commodities like <b>sugar,</b> coffee, cocoa, <b>tin</b> and natural rubber. After analyzing the effectiveness of the International Agreements and debating their reason for failure and the lessons learned, the paper approaches the shift towards a different paradigm imposed by the current context of a globalized world economy where all actions and policies aim for market liberalization. As the price volatility is rarely the outcome of a singular cause, the results of the present paper suggest that combined solutions – public intervention and market-based – must be formulated in order to effectively tackle the problem of price instability...|$|R

There were more country faces and country garbs to be seen, though it was still, on the whole, a regular-featured and well-dressed crowd, with still very few but American visages. It seemed to be also a very frugal-minded crowd, and to spend little upon the refreshments and amusements provided for it. In these, oddly enough, there was nothing of the march of mind to be observed; they Were the refreshments and amusements of a former generation. I think it would not be extravagant to say that there were tons of pie for sale in a multitude of booths, with lemonade, soda-water, and ice-cream in proportion; but I doubt if there was a ton of pie sold, and towards the last the venerable pastry was quite covered with dust. Neither did people seem to care much for oranges or bananas or peanuts, or even pop-corn,--five cents a package and a prize in each package. Many booths stood unlet, and in others the pulverous ladies and gentlemen, their proprietors, were in the enjoyment of a leisure which would have been elegant {{if it had not been}} forced. There was one shanty, not otherwise distinguished from the rest, in which French soups were declared to be for sale; but these alien pottages seemed to be no more favored than the most poisonous of our national viands. But perhaps they were not French soups, or perhaps the vicinage of the shanty was not such as to impress a belief in their genuineness upon people who like French soups. Let us not be too easily disheartened by the popular neglect of them.
