5000|$|In the mid-2000s, Schnabel {{wanted to}} direct a film version of the novel Perfume by Patrick Süskind. Schnabel wrote a highly {{detailed}} script himself in which it had a stream of consciousness-driven narrative. Schnabel said that he wanted his film be more about the interior desire of the story’s protagonist Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, “the notion wasn't to make the guy more like you or me but to make him different, the way he was. And we had to reorganize our chromosomes, our moral chromosomes, so we could see that orgy is happening, instead being shocked by seeing this, you sit and you're thinking, [...] "Hey, I wanna sit through this and watch because I wanna see if that perfume works!" [...] And so, I had written a script and I thought that this man could smell {{all the way to}} Alaska or Egypt”. [...] "I wanted to make Perfume because I thought it was about somebody who created something that was so beautiful that he couldn't share it with anybody, because they fell under the spell of it and they lost their critical faculties. So they never knew, and he couldn't share his accomplishment with anybody. It drove him nuts", said Schnabel. Schnabel also described certain scenes in his script. “it starts with him Grenouille climbing up this mountain and than he eats a salamander while he's climbing up this rocky crag and at first you think, [...] "That's a little weird that he did that". And than he jumps up in the sky he throws his arms in the air and than he crawls into this hole. And than, the camera pushes into his head and you start to see inside his head like he's dreaming, you start to go in, or you think a story is going to be told to you and as we push in we see him sitting in some fancy clothes and as he takes a drink from one of these glasses, it has a date on it and it takes you back to this place (sometime in the 18th century), Paris. So, you think that the narrator is this man, who is drinking from those glasses. And if you haven't read the book, you think he must have been a rich guy at one time and then he must of had some trouble and he's telling us a story. That's viable and reasonable interpretation of what you'r seeing. And you watch the movie, and about an hour into the movie, Grenouille climbs back on that mountain and gets into the cave and narrator starts to say that he slept for 7 years and he would have stayed there probably {{for the rest of his}} life except the fabric of his dream starts to fall apart and he realizes that his scent was a scent afar and that terrified him and as you watch you see the guy who's the narrator starting to crawl up on top on a couch in this library with all the bottles there and everything is turning into, first mist and than the room is starting to disappear and so is he's starting to disappear. And you realize that the narrator was a dream at that point and the guy screams and you see this hole and you see the landscape and the next thing you see is just a P.O.V. that's running down a hill until finally the sky arrives at somewhere where people from their villages start running away from him. And the next thing you see is a sack over the head of the camera and a 'clunk' and you hear somebody saying, [...] "His journeyman's papers". And the next thing you see is Christopher Walken standing in front saying, [...] "Okay, let's look at him." [...] And they take the sack cloth off his head and you <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> with a long beard, talons for fingernails and then your story begins and so what you wouldn't know is that the narrator was a dream and in the process of doing that I had written the scene where you see Egypt, you see Alaska.” Bernd Eichinger, who owned the rights to the novel at the time, disliked Schnabel's script and two had a series of disputes over the project. Schnabel’s version was Perfume was never made but Schnabel did eventually transferred his unique approach of his ‘’Perfume’’ script into his 2007 film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.|$|E
