This paper presents a numerical method that is used to analyze magnetic systems for <b>switching</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> in particular the switching resonant dc-dc converters. The method uses the harmonic balance technique combined with finite element methods and {{is referred to as the}} harmonic balance-finite element method (HBFEM).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThe subject of <b>switching</b> mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> was examined. A comparison between linear regulators and <b>switching</b> mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> {{was made to}} show the options available for {{the various types of}} convertors. Two <b>switching</b> mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> were constructed and tested. The operating efficiency of both systems was found to be more than eighty percent over the specified input voltage and load current conditions. The <b>switching</b> mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> circuits required additional components in the design due to the complex pulse width regulation, pulse amplification, and self start circuit required for the system operation.

In this paper, lightning characteristics of electronic equipment’s <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> are studied. Firstly impulse generator is developed.
