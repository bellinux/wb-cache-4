5|$|In 2011, Kalam was criticised {{by civil}} groups over his {{stand on the}} Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he {{supported}} {{the establishment of the}} nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people.

5|$|In their 2004 {{study of}} lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco {{residents}} {{felt a sense}} of collective righteousness after Washington's death, as they <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> the presence of evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E

5|$|Of {{far greater}} {{importance}} to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the negative {{effect that the}} extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> bullying, reckless, and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{an integral part of}} natural order.|$|E

5|$|Alec Coxon took match {{figures of}} 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 not {{out in the}} middle-order. He came into the team as an all-rounder, even though his {{performances}} {{during the rest of}} the English season had been mediocre; he had a batting average of 20.25 for the summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Schenn was a highly-regarded prospect, ranked fifth among draft-eligible North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. Some scouts <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a mix between Calder Trophy and Norris Trophy nominee Dion Phaneuf and two-time Stanley Cup {{champion}} Adam Foote. E. J.

5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring to {{negotiate}} with the Catholic Party, which held power for much of his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed.|$|E

5|$|When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without {{surviving}} legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was {{the oldest}} person yet to assume the British throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended {{to spend most of}} his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular among the people, who <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Van, {{one of the}} largest cities in Turkish (Western) Armenia, Khrimian became a celibate priest (vardapet) in 1854 {{after the death of his}} wife and daughter. In the 1850s and 1860s he served as the abbot of two {{important}} monasteries in Turkish Armenia: Varagavank near Van and Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush. During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople—the most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community—from 1869 to 1873 and resigned due to pressure from the Ottoman government which <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Returning from Europe, he encouraged Armenian peasants to follow the example of Christian Balkan peoples by launching an armed struggle for autonomy or independence from the Ottoman Turks.|$|E
5|$|Hans von Halban {{had proved}} to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with Mackenzie or the NRC. The Americans <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a {{security}} risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI). In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R. Steacie became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.|$|E

5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the young}} would-be {{candidate}} {{was offered the}} opportunity of succeeding the party leader, Clement Davies, in the Welsh seat of Montgomeryshire, when Davies decided to retire. There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where the party had long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951. In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for North Cornwall, Dingle Foot, whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring North Devon constituency. The Torrington local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a possible successor in North Cornwall. Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, the party had finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the clergy}} who served under him in Armagh {{recommended}} that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently. Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland. The British government also objected, favoring Patrick Curtis instead, as they <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> more friendly to their interests. The Vatican agreed, and Pope Pius VII appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the sees of Philadelphia or Madras; Conwell chose Philadelphia. Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop William Poynter, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, assisted by Fathers James Bramston and Joseph Francis Carpue.|$|E
