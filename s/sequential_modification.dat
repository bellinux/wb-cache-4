50|$|In summary, allorecognition, {{the ability}} to {{distinguish}} self from non-self, is basic to all life, unicellular as well as multicellular. The earliest recognition systems were innate, and {{were based on the}} recognition of self molecules. The evolution of multicellular forms brought about selective pressures for ever-increasing sophistication to innate immune systems. Adaptive immune systems, based on the recognition of non-self, have arisen independently in two lines of chordates, and exploit molecules and cellular systems which had a previous role in innate immune responses. Allorecognition as it currently exists in mammals can be traced back as the result of <b>sequential</b> <b>modification</b> to immunity mechanisms dating back to some of the earliest multicellular organisms.|$|E
50|$|Mannose is a {{dominant}} monosaccharide in N-linked glycosylation. N-Linked glycosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins. It is {{initiated by the}} en bloc transfer on Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to nascent glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum in a co-translational manner as the protein entered through the transport system. Glucose is hydrolyzed on fully folded protein and the mannose moieties are hydrolyzed by ER and Golgi-resident mannosidases. Typically, mature human glycoproteins only contain three mannose residues buried under <b>sequential</b> <b>modification</b> by GlcNAc, galactose and sialic acid. This is important as the innate immune system in mammals is geared to recognise exposed mannose residues. This activity {{is due to the}} prevalence of mannose residues, in the form of mannans, on the surface of yeast. The human immunodeficiency virus displays considerable amount of mannose residues due to the tight clustering of glycans in its viral spike. These mannose residues are the target for broadly neutralizing antibodies.|$|E

Here, we investigate the enigmatic evolutionary origins of Janthinidae, a family of marine snails that raft passively in the neuston, a vast oceanic surface habitat, by constructing floats of mucus bubbles. We present the first molecular phylogeny including Janthinidae, which confirms that janthinids are derived from Epitoniidae (wentletraps) — benthic predators and parasites of sea anemones and corals. Our data {{support the hypothesis that}} floats and rafting evolved via modified epitoniid egg masses rather than by juvenile droguing.

Polyoxin, a group of structurally-related peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics, is produced by Sreptomyces cacaoi var. asoensis (S. cacaoi hereafter) and Streptomyces aureochromogenes (Chen et al., 2009). As the chemical structure of polyoxin mimics UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine, a building block for fungal chitin biosynthesis, it functions as a potent chitin synthetase inhibitor by targeting fungal cell wall biosynthesis (Endo and Misato, 1969; Endo et al., 1970). Polyoxin has therefore been widely used as an agricultural fungicide to control phytopathogenic fungi due to its distinctive action mode (Chen et al., 2009).|$|R

However, a balance was found to exist between alkali exposure time, concentration and resulting fibre integrity. The conditions used resulted in a loss in fibre weight, fibre moisture content and tensile strength. Sequential treatments with acetylation or silane resulted in a 15 - 21 % strength recovery from that of the alkali treated composite.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{implementation}} of bio-orthogonal click chemistries {{is a topic}} of growing importance {{in the field of}} biomaterials, as it is enabling the development of increasingly complex hydrogel materials capable of providing dynamic, cell-instructive microenvironments. Here, we introduce the tetrazine− norbornene inverse electron demand Diels−Alder reaction as a new cross-linking chemistry for the formation of cell laden hydrogels. The fast reaction rate and irreversible nature of this click reaction allowed for hydrogel formation within minutes when a multifunctional PEG-tetrazine macromer was reacted with a dinorbornene peptide. In addition, the cytocompatibility of the polymerization led to high postencapsulation viability of human mesenchymal stem cells, and the specificity of the tetrazine−norbornene reaction was exploited for <b>sequential</b> <b>modification</b> of the network via thiol−ene photochemistry.

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, the cell-division cycle (CDC) - 6 {{protein is}} essential to promote the assembly of pre-replicative complexes in the early G 1 phase of the cell cycle, a process requiring tight regulation to ensure that proper origin licensing occurs once per cell cycle. Here we show that, in late G 1 and early S phase, CDC 6 is found in a complex also containing Cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) - 2 and the acetyltransferase general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN 5). GCN 5 specifically acetylates CDC 6 at three lysine residues flanking its cyclin-docking motif, and this modification is crucial for the subsequent phosphorylation of the protein by Cyclin A-CDKs at a specific residue close to the acetylation site. GCN 5 -mediated acetylation and site-specific phosphorylation of CDC 6 are both necessary for the relocalization of the protein to the cell cytoplasm in the S phase, {{as well as to}} regulate its stability.

To clarify this, we exposed rabbit alveolar macrophages to analogs with different modifications of the diethylaminoethoxy group and then searched for biochemical signs of cell damage, formation of vacuoles and inclusion bodies, and {{interference with the}} degradation of surfactant protein A, used as a tracer of the endocytic pathway.

40|$|Covalent {{modification}} {{by small}} ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO) regulates p 53 transcription activity through an undefined mechanism. Using reconstituted sumoylation components, we purified SUMO- 1 -conjugated p 53 (Su-p 53) to near homogeneity. Su-p 53 exists in solution as a tetramer and interacts with p 300 histone acetyltransferase {{as efficiently as}} the unmodified protein. Nevertheless, it fails to activate p 53 -dependent chromatin transcription because of its inability to bind DNA. With <b>sequential</b> <b>modification</b> assays, we found that sumoylation of p 53 at K 386 blocks subsequent acetylation by p 300, whereas p 300 -acetylated p 53 remains permissive for ensuing sumoylation at K 386 and alleviates sumoylation-inhibited DNA binding. While preventing the free form of p 53 from accessing its cognate sites, sumoylation fails to disengage prebound p 53 from DNA. The sumoylation-deficient K 386 R protein, when expressed in p 53 -null cells, exhibits higher transcription activity and binds better to the endogenous p 21 gene compared with the wild-type protein. These studies unravel a molecular mechanism underlying sumoylation-regulated p 53 function and further uncover a new role of acetylation in antagonizing the inhibitory effect of sumoylation on p 53 binding to DNA...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we outline an {{efficient}} system for detection of dim small targets {{that consists of}} three main parts: clutter rejection, track-before-detect (TBD), and detection subsystems. Detection and tracking of dim targets requires accumulation of sensor signal in {{time in order to}} resolve the target. There exist a number of powerful methods for detecting small low observable targets with stationary dynamics in image sequences provided by infrared (IR) and other imaging sensors. However, these methods need to be extended to handle maneuvering targets. We use a multiple switching model along with an optimal nonlinear filtering method to build {{an efficient}} TBD algorithm. We demonstrate that banks of interacting (nonlinear) Bayesian Matched filters (BIBMF) can be utilized for this purpose. The target’s dynamics is modeled by jump-linear systems.

We identified the genomic processes driving antigenic diversity in genes encoding VESA (ves 1) through comparative analysis within and between three Babesia species, (B. bigemina, B. divergens and B. bovis). Ves 1 structure diverges rapidly after speciation, notably through the evolution of shortened forms (ves 2) from 5 ' ends of canonical ves 1 genes. Phylogenetic analyses show that ves 1 genes are transposed between loci routinely, whereas ves 2 genes are not. Similarly, analysis of sequence mosaicism shows that recombination drives variation in ves 1 sequences, but less so for ves 2, indicating the adoption of different mechanisms for variation of the two families. Proteomic analysis of the B. bigemina PR isolate shows that two dominant VESA 1 proteins are expressed in the population, whereas numerous VESA 2 proteins are co-expressed, consistent with differential transcriptional regulation of each family. Hence, VESA 2 proteins are abundant and previously unrecognized elements of Babesia biology, with evolutionary dynamics consistently different to those of VESA 1, suggesting that their functions are distinct...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sequential</b> <b>modifications</b> of histones {{form the}} basis of the histone code that {{translates}} into either gene activation or repression. Nuclear receptors recruit a cohort of histone-modifying enzymes in response to ligand binding and regulate proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. In Drosophila melanogaster, the steroid hormone ecdysone binds its heterodimeric receptor ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle to spatiotemporally regulate the transcription of several genes. In this study, we identify a novel cofactor, Drosophila lysine ketoglutarate reductase (dLKR) /saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), that is involved in ecdysone-mediated transcription. dLKR/SDH binds histones H 3 and H 4 and suppresses ecdysone-mediated transcription of cell death genes by inhibiting histone H 3 R 17 me 2 mediated by the Drosophila arginine methyl transferase CARMER. Our data suggest that the dynamic recruitment of dLKR/SDH to ecdysone-regulated gene promoters controls the timing of hormone-induced gene expression. In the absence of dLKR/SDH, histone methylation occurs prematurely, resulting in enhanced gene activation. Consistent with these observations, the loss of dLKR/SDH in Drosophila enhances hormone-regulated gene expression, affecting the developmental timing of gene activation.

40|$|Two {{different}} approaches for introducing pathogenic mutations into the β-amyloid precursor protein gene in mouse {{embryonic stem cells}} were compared. Both approaches require two <b>sequential</b> <b>modifications</b> of the targeting locus by homologous recombinations. One approach was a “targeting-in-out” procedure {{that is based on}} a double-replacement strategy, and the other was a “hit-and-run” procedure that makes use of an unstable genomic duplication after vector integration. Both approaches showed similar targeting frequencies for the first step. In the targeting-in-out procedure, targeted-in embryonic stem cell clones with the desired mutation and an intron-located selection cassette were obtained at a high frequency after the first step. Targeting out, however, resulted not only in the expected loss of the intron-located selection cassette but also in unavoidable reversion to wild type. In contrast, pure mutants, i. e., those without additional genomic changes, were generated by the hit-and-run procedure. Although targeted-in embryonic stem cells might be used to generate animals with modified β-amyloid precursor protein, the hit-and-run procedure appears to be the superior way to target gene modifications in vivo, leading to pure, correct mutants. For further improvements, optimization of the homologous recombination efficiency could be envisaged...|$|R

Hence, a <b>sequential</b> phase <b>modification</b> method is put forward to solve the coupling problems in multi-input multi-output non-Gaussian random vibration test.

By using a gelonin radioimmunoassay, the immunoreactivity of gelonin in three hormonotoxins was determined with gelonin and modified gelonin as standards. The gelonin equivalent in our hormonotoxins was in agreement with the values determined by spectrophotometric and gel-electrophoresis methods. As the immunoreactivity of gelonin-SPDP was not further altered after conjugation to its carrier protein ovine lutropin, a specific radioimmunoassay of gelonin could be used to evaluate the molar ratio of the conjugates prepared by using SPDP as cross-linker and gelonin-SPDP as a standard...|$|E

Testicular spermatozoa acquire fertility only after one or two weeks of transit through the epididymis. At the end of this several meters long epididymal tubule, the male gamete is able to move, capacitate, migrate through the female tract, bind to the egg membrane and finally fuse to the oocyte to obtain a viable embryo. All these sperm properties are acquired after <b>sequential</b> <b>modifications</b> occurring either at the level of the spermatozoon or in the epididymal surroundings. Considerable research efforts ongoing in various laboratories are aimed at elucidating the events accompanying sperm maturation and the role of the epididymis in creating an ideal fluid environment for this process to take place...|$|R

The feasibility and reproducibility of the process are demonstrated by patterning GaN(0001) films by the ALE process using photoresist as an etch mask. The demonstrated ALE is deemed to be useful for the fabrication of nanoscale structures and high electron mobility transistors and expected to be adoptable for ALE of other materials.

40|$|Global {{tests are}} a key {{research}} endpoint in multivariate studies. They provide an omnibus assessment of the overall effects across the multivariate outcomes. This global evaluation is clearly of high practical value {{in the field of}} neuroimaging, which has become increasingly important in recent years. Existing global testing methodologies, however, fail to accommodate the demands of neuroimaging studies that have typically small sample sizes and highly correlated local outcomes. In this thesis a novel class of multivariate global tests is developed. The proposed tests are based on a formal framework for using prior information and accumulated data to learn the effect direction. This framework is used to construct test statistics that target the estimated effect direction, rather than the whole multivariate space, for detecting global effects. Adaptive designs are employed to allow for <b>sequential</b> <b>modifications</b> of the test statistics, based on accumulated data, without inflating the type I error. A major focus in our methodology is power performance. The proposed tests are shown to be optimal in terms of predictive power. Furthermore, a power characterisation allowing us to explain the behaviour of our tests and perform simple power analysis is derived. An extensive power analysis, including comparisons to alternative global tests, is performed. Applications to neuroimaging studies are illustrated through two real examples. Our results show that the developed methodology can be particularly useful in cases where the sample sizes are small and prior information about the effect direction is available...|$|R
