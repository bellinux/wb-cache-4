40|$|Saltation and {{apparent}} movement are related phenomena: Both generate illusory stimuli in-between the actually activated stimulus sites. This dissertation examines spatio-temporal stimulus parameters where both phenomena create equivalent percepts. In these cases {{it is assumed}} that cortical representations adapt identically to the properties of both <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns</b> – saltation {{and apparent}} movement. Furthermore it is tested whether repetitive stimulation results in plastic changes of the cortical map and related perceptual changes. Another focus lies on the integration of the <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns</b> over both body halves. We used varying numbers of vibrotactile point stimuli that were presented on a horizontal array around the trunk. In two pilot studies and three main studies with a total of 139 subjects we reached the following conclusions: In accordance with neural network models stimuli presented close together in time are expected to belong together. Therefore both <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns</b> generate indistinguishable percepts at short interstimulus intervals (< 100 ms); the same applies for short stimulus durations (< 50 ms). Increasing the number of tactors – and thus decreasing inter-tactor distance – tends to improve the integration of both <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns</b> into a percept of continuous movement. Vibration frequency affects the quality of illusory movement as well as the similarity of both patterns. Further studies exploring the spatial resolution of low- and high-frequency vibrotactile <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns</b> on hairy skin are needed to clearly explain this result. An effect of repetitive stimulation on the comparability of both <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns</b> could not be found – presumably because plastic changes in the cortical map of body sites like the trunk – which are less innervated and rarely used to explore the environment compared to the fingers – might require more stimulus repetitions. Crossing the body midline impairs comparability of both <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns,</b> however in the majority of cases saltation and apparent movement generate indiscriminable percepts when presented unilaterally or bilaterally indicating that integration of spatio-temporal stimuli occurred over the body midline – yet interstimulus intervals might differ due to interhemispheric transmission time. The results of this dissertation shed further light on the processing of spatio-temporal stimuli and might also be used in the design of tactile torso displays...|$|R

The disruptive effect of the textured background on orientation judgments remained when no texture elements were present {{in the vicinity of the}} contour. This suggests that the generation of occlusion-defined contours relies as much on an evaluation of the surfaces at either side of the contour as being opaque as it does on local encoding of occlusion cues close to the contour.

We controlled normal subject’s wrist angles (angle of radial/ulnar flexion and palmar/dorsi flexion) with <b>stimulus</b> <b>patterns</b> created by this method.

40|$|Abstract. A {{neural network}} model for a {{mechanism}} of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection {{of a number of}} modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells', which show charac-teristics similar to simple cells or lower order hyper-complex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells " similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher " during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each <b>stimulus</b> <b>pattern</b> has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that <b>stimulus</b> <b>pattern.</b> That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one <b>stimulus</b> <b>pattern.</b> The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all.

Error rate did not benefit from adding additional cues if convexity was present, suggesting that responses were based on convexity as the predominant figural determinant. However, reaction time became shorter with additional cues even if convexity was present. For example, when symmetry and wide base were added, figure–ground segregation was facilitated.

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of the fly's movement detection system is analysed using the visually induced yaw torque generated uring tethered flight as a behavioural indicator. In earlier studies usually {{large parts of the}} visual field were exposed to the movement stimuli; the fly's response, therefore, represented the spatially pooled output signals {{of a large number of}} local movement detectors. Here we examined the responses of individual movement detectors. The <b>stimulus</b> <b>pattern</b> was presented to the fly via small vertical slits, thus, nearly avoiding spatial integration of local movement information along the horizontal axis of the eye. The stimulus consisted of a vertically oriented sine-wave grating which was moved with a constant velocity either clockwise or counterclockwise. In agreement with the theory of movement detectors of the correlation type, the time-course of the detector signal is modulated with the spatial phase of the <b>stimulus</b> <b>pattern.</b> It can even assume negative values for some time during the response cycle and thus signal the wrong direction of motion. By spatially integrating the response over sufficiently large arrays of movement detectors these response modulations disappear. Fi-nally, one obtains a signal of the movement detection system which is constant while the pattern moves in one direction and only changes its sign when the pattern reverses its direction of motion. Spatial in-tegration thus represents a simple means to obtain a meaningful representations of motion information...|$|E

40|$|Various Op {{artists have}} used simple {{geometrical}} patterns {{to create the}} illusion of motion in their artwork. One explanation for the observed illusion involves retinal shifts caused by small involuntary eye movements that observers make while they try to maintain fixation. Earlier studies have suggested a prominent role of the most conspicuous of these eye movements, small rapid position shifts called microsaccades. Here, we present data that could expand this view with a different interpretation. In three experiments, we recorded participants' eye movements while they tried to maintain visual fixation when being presented with variants of Bridget Riley's Fall, which were manipulated such as to vary the strength of induced motion. In the first two experiments, we investigated the properties of microsaccades for a set of stimuli with known motion strengths.

In the third experiment, we varied the <b>stimulus</b> <b>pattern</b> across a larger range of parameters and asked participants to rate the perceived motion illusion.
