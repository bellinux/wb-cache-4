5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a <b>solid</b> <b>bar</b> with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a <b>solid</b> <b>bar.</b> The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E

25|$|The {{parallel}} mount {{accepts a}} <b>solid</b> <b>bar</b> {{parallel to the}} drum shell. There are many bar sizes and profiles, mostly either round and knurled or hexagonal. There is a some compatibility, {{but it is not}} universal. Some manufacturers such as Tama Drums and Gibraltar Hardware even produce a single fitting that can be used either singly as a hanging tom mount, or in sets of three to attach the floor tom legs.|$|E
25|$|The R31 Skyline {{was also}} {{produced}} in Australia, with a 3.0L motor (RB30E) available in sedan or wagon form, {{as well as}} a four-cylinder version called the Nissan Pintara. The wagon had the same front style as the coupe and sedan—the only difference being that it lacked the four round brake lights that had been a consistent element of Skyline design (except for the R31 series one/two which had rectangular taillights with a <b>solid</b> <b>bar</b> through the centre which was also shared by the Pintara). These cars were manufactured in Australia due to the heavy import laws which made it expensive to bring cars into Australia.|$|E

25|$|A simple device theorised {{to detect}} the {{expected}} wave motion is called a Weber bar — a large, <b>solid</b> <b>bar</b> of metal isolated from outside vibrations. This type of instrument was the first type of gravitational wave detector. Strains in space due to an incident gravitational wave excite the bar's resonant frequency and could thus be amplified to detectable levels. Conceivably, a nearby supernova might {{be strong enough to}} be seen without resonant amplification. With this instrument, Joseph Weber claimed to have detected daily signals of gravitational waves. His results, however, were contested in 1974 by physicists Richard Garwin and David Douglass. Modern forms of the Weber bar are still operated, cryogenically cooled, with superconducting quantum interference devices to detect vibration. Weber bars are not sensitive enough to detect anything but extremely powerful gravitational waves.|$|E
500|$|For the 1904–05 season, Aberdeen {{adopted a}} black and gold striped shirt, {{which led to the}} team being nicknamed [...] "the Wasps". This strip, with only minor variations, was worn until just {{before the start of the}} Second World War. The blue shorts lasted until 1911, and then were {{replaced}} with white ones. Socks were black with gold trim, either as stripes or as a <b>solid</b> <b>bar</b> at the turndown.|$|E
500|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two parallel transmission lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them. [...] The branch lines are spaced λ/4 apart and represent sections of a multi-section filter design {{in the same way}} as the multiple sections of a coupled line coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines. [...] The main and coupled line are [...] of the system impedance. [...] The more sections there are in the coupler, the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines. [...] High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations. [...] A similar limitation applies for coupling factors looser than low coupling also requires narrow tracks. [...] Coupled lines are a better choice when loose coupling is required, but branch-line couplers are good for tight coupling and can be used for [...] hybrids. [...] Branch-line couplers usually do not have such a wide bandwidth as coupled lines. [...] This style of coupler is good for implementing in high-power, air dielectric, <b>solid</b> <b>bar</b> formats as the rigid structure is easy to mechanically support.Matthaei et al., pp.809–811Räisänen and Lehto, p.127 ...|$|E
25|$|Induction motors may {{be further}} divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors and Wound Rotor Induction Motors. SCIMs have a heavy winding {{made up of}} <b>solid</b> <b>bars,</b> usually {{aluminum}} or copper, joined by rings {{at the ends of}} the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|The first length {{standards}} {{to use this}} technique were rectangular section <b>solid</b> <b>bars.</b> A blind hole was bored at each end, to {{the depth of the}} neutral plane, and the calibration marks were made at this depth. This was inconvenient, as it was impossible to measure directly between the two marks, but only with an offset trammel down the wells.|$|R
50|$|Mergenthaler Linotype {{dominated}} the printing industry through the twentieth century. The machines were so well designed, major parts remained virtually unchanged {{for nearly a}} hundred years. A particularly notable success was Linotype's Legibility Group of typefaces, used {{by most of the}} world's (Latin-alphabet) newspapers for much of the twentieth century. The ruggedness of the Linotype system, which cast lines as <b>solid</b> <b>bars</b> of type, aided this dominance.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePhysical visualizations, or data physicalizations, encode data in {{attributes}} of physical shapes. Despite a considerable {{body of work}} on visual variables, " physical variables " remain poorly understood. One of them is physical size. A difficulty for solid elements is that " size " is ambiguous – it can refer to either length/diameter, surface, or volume. Thus, it is unclear for designers of physicalizations how to effectively encode quantities in physical size. To investigate, we ran an experiment where participants estimated ratios between quantities represented by <b>solid</b> <b>bars</b> and spheres. Our results suggest that <b>solid</b> <b>bars</b> are compared based on their length, consistent with previous findings for 2 D and 3 D bars on flat media. But for spheres, participants' estimates are rather proportional to their surface. Depending on the estimation method used, judgments are rather consistent across participants, thus the use of perceptually-optimized size scales seems possible. We conclude by discussing implications {{for the design of}} data physicalizations and the need for more empirical studies on physical variables...|$|R
50|$|A {{square frame}} made of <b>solid</b> <b>bars</b> is not rigid but tends to bend at the corners. Bracing {{it with an}} extra {{diagonal}} bar would be heavy. A wire would be much lighter but would stop it collapsing only one way. To hold it rigid, two cross-bracing wires are needed. This method of cross-bracing can be seen clearly on early biplanes, where the wings and interplane struts form a rectangle which is cross-braced by wires.|$|R
