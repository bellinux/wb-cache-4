5|$|One might <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> the {{hermeneutic}} {{style was}} cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. The impetus for the cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{mission was}} not {{equipped}} to provide evidence for biosignatures or complex organic compounds; it showed an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to ones theorized for the primordial Earth. Scientists <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> the atmosphere of early Earth was similar in composition to the current atmosphere on Titan, with the important exception {{of a lack of}} water vapor on Titan.|$|E
5|$|Chesney's family {{originated}} from Quesnay-Guesnon in the Calvados region of Normandy near Bayeux in France, {{but they had}} settled in the Midlands of England and held lands there, particularly in Oxfordshire. His parents were Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot. His brother William de Chesney remained a layman, {{and became one of}} Oxfordshire's leading landowners. Another brother, Reginald, was the abbot of Evesham Abbey. Chesney's sister Agnes was married to Robert Foliot, steward to the Earl of Huntingdon. Agnes and Robert were probably the parents of Gilbert Foliot, later Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Although it is a <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> Foliot's mother was a sibling of Chesney, it is certain that Chesney was Gilbert's uncle.|$|E

2500|$|Prominent newspapers, {{among them}} The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal {{condemned}} the fates of Wolfowitz and Riza. Christopher Hitchens described {{the removal of}} Riza and Wolfowitz as [...] "character assassination." [...] He <b>surmised</b> <b>that</b> this was all due to personal conflict between the U.S. and European branches at the World Bank. Further, he <b>surmised</b> <b>that</b> this was retribution for Wolfowitz's support of the Iraq war.|$|R

5|$|Though {{there was}} never a {{permanent}} Alaska Native settlement at the site of Fairbanks, Athabascan Indians have used the area for thousands of years. An archaeological site excavated {{on the grounds of the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks uncovered a Native camp about 3,500 years old. From evidence gathered at the site, archaeologists <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> Native activities in the area were limited to seasonal hunting and fishing. In addition, archeological sites on the grounds of nearby Fort Wainwright date back 10,000 years. Arrowheads excavated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks site matched similar items found in Asia, providing some of the first evidence that humans arrived in North America via the land bridge.|$|E
5|$|Tyler was a slaveholder, at {{one point}} keeping forty slaves at Greenway. Although he {{regarded}} slavery as an evil, and {{did not attempt to}} justify it, he never freed any of his slaves. Tyler considered slavery a part of states’ rights, and therefore the federal government lacked the authority to abolish it. The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented, but historians <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> he cared for their well-being and abstained from physical violence against them.In December 1841, Tyler was attacked by abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt, with the unsubstantiated allegation that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves, and later sold them. A number of African American families today maintain a belief in their descent from Tyler, but {{there is no evidence of}} such genealogy.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and Haddock later realise that Calculus {{has gone}} missing, and <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> {{he has been}} kidnapped by the same {{individual}} who placed Tarragon in a coma. The police set up road blocks, but the kidnappers switch cars {{and are able to}} evade them. Tintin visits a hospital where the seven stricken members of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition are housed; he is astonished that at a precise time of day, all awaken and scream about figures attacking them before slipping back into their comas. Haddock is dejected by Calculus' abduction, but upon learning that police have spotted the kidnapper's car at a port, he and Tintin race there, believing that the abductors seek to board a boat with Calculus and take him abroad. At the docks, they spot Alcazar boarding a ship to South America; he reveals that Chiquito has disappeared and {{that he was one of}} the last descendants of the Inca, with Tintin surmising that Chiquito must be one of Calculus' captors.|$|E

5|$|Traces of red pigment {{still remain}} on the figure's body that was {{originally}} painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By Raman spectroscopy the red pigment is identified as red ochre, the black pigment, amorphous carbon ("lamp black") and the white pigment gypsum. Black pigment is also found on {{the background of the}} plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes. The pubic triangle and the areola appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur. They <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now {{remain on the}} relief.|$|E

25|$|Schlesinger and Warner Bros. had {{problems}} with Clean Pastures from the start. Hollywood censors alleged that the film ran afoul of the Hays Production Code because it burlesqued religion. Later commentators <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> the censors also objected to the portrayal of a Heaven run by African Americans. In 1968, the short's stereotypical portrayal of black characters prompted United Artists to withhold it from distribution {{as one of the}} infamous Censored Eleven.|$|E
25|$|Compact stars ({{neutron star}}s). A neutron star is much cooler than 1012 K, {{but it has}} been {{compressed}} by the supernova creating it to such high densities, that it is reasonable to <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> quark matter may exist in the core. Compact stars composed mostly or entirely of quark matter are called quark stars or strange stars, yet at this time no star with properties expected of these objects has been observed.|$|E

Ellie begins a relationship with Presidential Science Advisor Ken der Heer. With the help of her Soviet colleague Vaygay Lunacharsky, Ellie is able to set up redundant monitoring of the signal so that a telescope remains pointed at Vega at all times. A third message is discovered describing plans for an advanced machine. With no way of decoding the 30,000 pages, SETI scientists <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> there must be a primer that they have missed.|$|E
25|$|NGC 7052 is an edge-on {{spiral galaxy}} in Vulpecula at a {{distance}} of 214 million light-years from Earth. It has a central dusty disk with a diameter of 3700 light-years; there is a supermassive black hole with a mass of 300 million solar masses in its nucleus. Astronomers <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> the disk is the remnant of a smaller galaxy that merged with NGC 7052. Jets can be seen emanating from the galaxy, and it has very strong radio emissions. This means that it is also classified as a radio galaxy.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{reported}} that the crime {{had taken place in}} a nearby Weehawken, New Jersey motel named the Park Avenue Hotel. A New Jersey judge had later signed an arrest warrant on Thursday, July 27, 2006. Videotape recovered from the hotel showed Coleman leading Moore through the premises. Police <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> Coleman beat, raped, and strangled Moore before stuffing her body into a duffel bag for disposal. It appeared that Coleman tried to remove his DNA evidence from her body by cutting Moore's fingernails and cleaning her body with alcohol.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not known}} when Bishopstone was first {{inhabited}} or what it was called but fragmentary records from Saxon times indicate that the whole Chalke Valley area was thriving. It is <b>surmised</b> <b>that</b> the village was originally known as Eblesborne, but by 1166 it had been acquired by the See of Winchester and was known as Bissopeston. It is also <b>surmised</b> <b>that</b> Eblesborne meant that {{the land and the}} burna (river) was once owned by a man called Ebbel.|$|R

25|$|He {{was brought}} to trial later that same year, {{but this time it}} was {{for his role in the}} Sullan proscriptions. At the insistence of Cato the Younger, who was then quaestor, all men who had profited during the proscriptions were brought to trial. For his involvement, Catiline was accused of killing his former {{brother-in-law}} Marcus Marius Gratidianus, carrying this man’s severed head through the streets of Rome and then having Sulla add him to the proscription to make it legal. Other allegations claimed that he murdered several other notable men. Despite this, Catiline was acquitted again, though some <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> it was through the influence of Caesar, who presided over the court.|$|E
25|$|Some spiders, such as Pholcus phalangioides, will prey {{on their}} own kind when food is scarce. Also, females of Phidippus johnsoni have been {{observed}} carrying dead males in their fangs. This behavior may be triggered by aggression, where females carry over hostility from their juvenile state and consume males just as they would prey. Sih and Johnson <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> non-reproductive cannibalism can occur due to a remnant of an aggression trait in juvenile females. Known as the “aggressive spillover hypothesis,” this tendency unselectively to attack anything that moves is cultivated by {{a positive correlation between}} hostility, foraging capability, and fecundity. Aggression at a young age leads to an increase in prey consumption and as such, a larger adult size. This behavior “spills over” into adulthood, and shows up as a nonadaptive trait that manifests itself through adult females preying on males of their same species.|$|E
25|$|Greenaway’s {{relationship}} with the Cold War era and the (second) Red Scare was extremely complicated. Primarily, Greenaway was a strong proponent of intellectual freedom. In the 1950s he served as chair for the Intellectual Freedom Committee, {{a branch of the}} American Library Association which tasks itself with protecting the privacy rights of library patrons. In 1950 he led an unsuccessful fight against the “Ober Oath,” one of many “loyalty oaths” directed at libraries put in place by the United States government. However, Greenaway also supported anti-communist measures by the United States and was privately thought by many to be a supporter of Joseph McCarthy. Greenaway argued that one of the main purposes of public access to information was to educate the masses against beliefs he found undesirable, such as communism. One may perhaps <b>surmise</b> <b>that</b> Greenaway was himself politically conservative but nevertheless respected and believed in the value of freedom to information.|$|E
