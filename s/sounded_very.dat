5|$|By 1977, {{a second}} wave of the punk rock {{movement}} was breaking in the three countries where it had emerged, {{as well as in}} many other places. Bands from the same scenes often <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2010, Trenyce {{joined the}} Michael Jackson tribute concert revue Thriller – Live {{as the leading}} female vocalist during a European tour. She reprised her role when the show played at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End. She starred in the concert for three years, from 2010 until 2013, {{performing}} material from different periods in Jackson's career. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trenyce said that the audience was initially hesitant to hear a woman interpret Jackson's music. Theatreworld's Geoff Billingsley praised Trenyce's performance, writing that her voice <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> similar to Jackson's and describing her as an improvement over the previous female lead Cleo Higgins.|$|E
25|$|The same year, N*E*R*D, {{consisting}} of Williams, Hugo and Haley, released their first album, In Search of..., in Europe, {{where the first}} Kelis album was better received. The album <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> much like their previous production work; the group decided that they should make their work as N*E*R*D sound different, and re-recorded the album with the rock band Spymob.|$|E

25|$|Also in 2002, Akita {{released}} Merzbeat, {{which was}} seen as a significant departure from his trademark abstract style in that it contains beat-oriented pieces. This has sparked some controversy among fans, though some reviewers pointed out that it <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> similar to Aqua Necromancer (1998) which features samples of progressive rock drumming. Merzbird (2004) and Merzbuddha (2005) followed in a similar vein with sampled beats combined with Merzbow's signature harsh noise.|$|E
25|$|After {{the decline}} of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became {{influenced}} by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as contemporary R, which <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> different from the original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994. Mainstream record label marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on hip-hop.|$|E
25|$|In a 2012 pilot program, SMRT trains began {{announcements}} of station {{names in}} both English and Mandarin Chinese {{so as to}} help Mandarin Chinese-speaking senior citizens cope better with the sudden increase in new stations. However, this received mixed reactions from the public. Some people {{pointed out that there}} were senior citizens who did not speak Mandarin, while others complained of feeling alienated. In reaction to this, SMRT claimed that the announcements were only recorded in English and Mandarin because the Malay and Tamil names of stations <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> similar to the English names.|$|E

25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her fore part was sunk very deep, and we watched her with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> fearful.|$|E
500|$|Del Rey {{opined that}} the track's demo <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> {{different}} to Auerbach's reproduction. When Del Rey first played [...] "West Coast" [...] to her record label, Interscope Records, they were dissatisfied with its chorus being slower in {{beats per minute}} than its verses. They responded to the her, stating, [...] "None of these songs are good for radio and now you're slowing them down {{when they should be}} speeded up". In an interview with The Guardian, Del Rey explained that she felt [...] "murky" [...] with her life during the song's writing, and it was that feeling which influenced it to sound disconnected from mainstream pop.|$|E
500|$|Drowned God {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with many}} critics complimenting the game's ideas and imagery while giving a less favorable response to its audio, puzzles, and execution. GameSpot reviewer Vince Broady {{wrote that the}} game <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> promising, and might [...] "also raise awareness of the thread of deception that runs throughout recorded history." [...] Steve Ramsey of Quandary said Drowned God presented its massive assortment of conspiracy theories entertainingly. Ray Ivey of Just Adventure called Drowned God [...] "the strangest, creepiest, most psychedelic adventure game I've yet to come across." [...] Although Ivey did not understand much of the game, he found it enjoyable, because [...] "it made sense to the game's characters and creators." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a very ironic paradox, {{black metal}} and crust punk have {{recently}} started to embrace one another. Members of Darkthrone and Satyricon have lately {{claimed that they}} love punk, while among crusties, black metal is the latest fashion. In fact, the latest album by crust punk band Skitsystem <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> black metal--while the latest black metal opus by Darkthrone <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> punk! This would have been unimaginable in the early 90s.|$|R

500|$|Dylan first {{performed}} [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] {{in public}} on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, [...] "He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told him I {{was there that}} night and he performed it." [...] Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg {{to be an important}} influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet.|$|E
500|$|Its {{development}} {{was motivated by}} Lopez's Latin heritage and pays homage to her career-beginnings as a dancer. Interpolated within the song are recurrent elements of the 1982 Bolivian composition [...] "Llorando se fue" [...] written by Gonzalo and Ulises Hermosa, a composition that gained notoriety when it was sampled by Kaoma in their 1989 single [...] "Lambada". Lopez described [...] "On the Floor" [...] as an evolution of her classic sound and as something which <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> current. The debut and release of [...] "On the Floor" [...] coincided with Lopez's appointment as a judge on the tenth season of US reality TV show American Idol, {{as well as several}} other product endorsement deals. American Idol also provided a platform to debut the single's music video, as well as the stage for Lopez's first live performance of the song.|$|E
500|$|Enamorada de Ti {{received}} mixed reviews. A {{writer for}} Semana News called the duets [...] "unique collaborations". Domingo Banda, also writing for Semana News, said that Selena's voice <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> much alive and vibrant again. Enrique Lopetegui of the San Antonio Current wrote that diehard Selena fans [...] "will take the new pop duet of 'Amor Prohibido' with Camila's Samo over the cheesy cumbia original anytime". Lopetegui described [...] "Cobarde", [...] "Si Una Vez", and [...] "No Quiero Saber" [...] as [...] "unplugged" [...] {{because of their}} [...] "superb acoustic guitar". Furthermore, Lopetegui complimented the technology used in the album to [...] "change the tempo of Selena's original track without changing the pitch, and her duet with Christian Castro is proof of technology put to good use". He found [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] and the title track [...] "unbearable", however, and advised his readers {{to be prepared to}} skip them.|$|E

500|$|Gary Rydstrom and {{his team}} at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom {{employed}} different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, {{he felt that the}} Atlanteans should have a [...] "more organic" [...] sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.|$|E
500|$|Hetfield and Ulrich fired Mustaine on {{the morning}} of April 11 after a gig in New York, because of his drug and alcohol problems, overly {{aggressive}} behavior, and clashes with bandmates. On Whitaker's recommendation, Metallica recruited Kirk Hammett, who played in Exodus and was a one-time student of Joe Satriani. Hammett learned the songs on his flight to New York, and started recording the album with Metallica barely a month later. Metallica met producer Paul Curcio at Music America studios in Rochester, and recorded the album in two weeks. Unable to afford a hotel during the recording sessions, the band members lived in people's houses in Rochester and at the Music Factory in Jamaica, Queens, where Anthrax held rehearsals. Curcio had set the studio equipment as if he were recording an ordinary rock band. He thought the initial tapes <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> distorted, and tried to compensate by turning down the knobs. Metallica resented Curcio's involvement because he seemed uninterested and had little impact on the sound. Although Zazula wanted Hammett to replicate Mustaine's solos, Hammett's guitar solos on the album were partially based on Mustaine's original solos, with the first four bars of most solos written by Mustaine before his departure. Despite their differences, Mustaine's contributions to the early years of Metallica were still acknowledged, and he received four co-writing credits on Kill 'Em All. Zazula was not satisfied with the initial mix because he thought the drums were too loud and the guitars were too low in the mix. The remix was done by sound engineer Chris Bubacz, according to Zazula's instructions. The final cost for the record was $15,000, which nearly bankrupted Zazula. [...] "This was mortgage money I'm spending, not something I've got put by I'm going to invest," [...] he said later. Zazula had a hard time finding a distributor for the record, but he eventually convinced Relativity Records to distribute the album in the U.S. and Canada, and Music for Nations in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Around 3:00am on 12 January 1964, 600–800 poorly armed, mainly African insurgents, {{aided by}} some of the {{recently}} dismissed ex-policemen, attacked Unguja's police stations, both of its police armouries, and the radio station. The attackers had no arms, being equipped only with spears, knives, machetes, and tire irons, having only the advantage of numbers and surprise. The Arab police replacements had received almost no training and, despite responding with a mobile force, were soon overcome. Okello himself led the attack on the Ziwani police HQ, which also happened to be the largest armory on the island. Several of the rebels were shot down, but the police were overwhelmed by sheer numbers, with Okello impressing his men with his courage by personally attacking a police sentry and having wrestled his rifle from him, used it to bayonet the policeman to death. [...] Arming themselves with hundreds of captured automatic rifles, submachine guns and Bren guns, the insurgents took control of strategic buildings in the capital, Zanzibar Town. At about 7:00 am, Okello made his first radio broadcast from a local radio station his followers had captured two hours earlier, calling upon the Africans to rise up and overthrow the [...] "imperialists". At the time, Okello only referred to himself as [...] "the field marshal", which prompted much speculation on Zanzibar about just who was this mysterious figure leading the revolution who spoke his Swahili with a thick Acholi accent, which <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> strange on Zanzibar. Within six hours of the outbreak of hostilities, the town's telegraph office and main government buildings were under revolutionary control, and the island's only airstrip was captured at 2:18pm. In the countryside, fighting had erupted between the Manga as the rural Arabs were called, and the Africans. The Manga were armed with their hunting rifles, and once the arms seized from the police stations reached the rebels in the countryside, the Manga were doomed. In Stone Town, the most fiercest resistance was at the Malindi police station, where under the command of Police Commissioner J.M Sullivan (a British policeman who stayed on until a local replacement could be hired), all of the rebel attacks were repulsed, not least because the insurgents tended to retreat whenever they came under fire. Sullivan only surrendered the Melindi station late in the afternoon after running out of ammunition, and marched his entire force (not one policeman had been killed or wounded) down to the Stonetown wharf to board some boats that took them out to a ship, the Salama to take them away from Zanzibar. Throughout Stone Town, shops and homes owned by Arabs and South Asians had been looted while numerous Arab and South Asian women were gang-raped. The Sultan, together with Prime Minister Muhammad Shamte Hamadi and members of the cabinet, fled the island on the royal yacht Seyyid Khalifa, and the Sultan's palace and other property was seized by the revolutionary government. At least 80 people were killed and 200 injured, the majority of whom were Arabs, during the 12 hours of street fighting that followed. Sixty-one American citizens, including 16 men staffing a NASA satellite tracking station, sought sanctuary in the English Club in Zanzibar Town, and four US journalists were detained by the island's new government.|$|E

2500|$|Adamski's 1955 book Inside the Space Ships, which {{describes}} his claimed travels through Earth's solar {{system in a}} UFO, is considered by some critics to be a [...] "remake" [...] of his 1949 science fiction book, ghostwritten for Adamski by Lucy McGinnis, and entitled Pioneers of Space. It described a fictional voyage through the solar system that, critics noted, <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> similar to the space travels described by Adamski in Inside the Space Ships.|$|E
2500|$|Becker and Fagen met in 1967 at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. As Fagen {{passed by}} a café, The Red Balloon, he heard Becker {{practicing}} the electric guitar. In an interview, Fagen recounted the experience: [...] "I hear this guy practicing, and it <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> professional and contemporary. It sounded like, you know, like a black person, really." [...] He introduced himself to Becker and asked, [...] "Do {{you want to be}} in a band?" [...] Discovering that they enjoyed similar music, the two began writing songs together.|$|E
2500|$|Berry {{was also}} {{responsible}} for toning down the lyrics of the song [...] "Welcome to the Occupation." [...] Stipe's original lyric was [...] "Hang your freedom fighters" [...] which, given the Reagan administration's active support for the contra [...] "freedom fighters" [...] in Nicaragua, <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> violent and militant, although Stipe himself countered that the line could be taken multiple ways ("hang" [...] as in either [...] "lynch" [...] or [...] "frame on a wall"). Berry's objection ultimately led the line to be changed to [...] "hang your freedom higher." ...|$|E
