The telescope sometimes operates in a wide-field prime focus configuration, in which case the secondary is removed and a three element field-correcting lens inserted, which provides an effective f/2.8 focus with a 60 arcmin field of view (40 arcmin unvignetted). Changing between the Cassegrain and Nasmyth foci takes a matter of seconds and may be done during the night; switching to and from prime focus requires replacing the <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror</b> with a prime focus assembly during daytime (the two are mounted back-to-back) which takes around 30 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1636 Marin Mersenne {{proposed}} a telescope {{consisting of a}} paraboloidal primary mirror and a paraboloidal <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror</b> bouncing the image {{through a hole in}} the primary, solving the problem of viewing the image. James Gregory went into further detail in his book Optica Promota (1663), pointing out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was shaped like the part of a conic section, would correct spherical aberration as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refractors. The design he came up with bears his name: the [...] "Gregorian telescope"; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas and after some fruitless attempts, was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope into practical use.|$|E
2500|$|The SSI was an 800-by-800-pixel {{solid state}} camera {{consisting}} of an array of silicon sensors called a charge-coupled device (CCD). Galileo {{was one of the}} first spacecraft to be equipped with a CCD camera. [...] The optical portion of the camera was built as a Cassegrain telescope. Light was collected by the primary mirror and directed to a smaller <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror</b> that channeled it through a hole in the center of the primary mirror and onto the CCD. The CCD sensor was shielded from radiation, a particular problem within the harsh Jovian magnetosphere. The shielding was accomplished by means of a [...] thick layer of tantalum surrounding the CCD except where the light enters the system. An eight-position filter wheel was used to obtain images at specific wavelengths. The images were then combined electronically on Earth to produce color images. The spectral response of the SSI ranged from about 0.4 to 1.1micrometres. The SSI weighed [...] and consumed, on average, 15 watts of power.|$|E

50|$|The {{practical}} {{effect of}} having a central obstruction in a telescope is that the central disc becomes slightly smaller, and the first bright ring becomes brighter {{at the expense of}} the central disc.

50|$|In the Gregorian design, {{the primary}} mirror creates a real image before the <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror.</b> This allows for a field stop to be placed at this location, so that the light from outside {{the field of view}} does not reach the <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror.</b> This is a major {{advantage}} for solar telescopes, where a field stop (Gregorian stop) can reduce the amount of heat reaching the <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror</b> and subsequent optical components.

5000|$|The IRTF is a 3.0 m (118" [...] {{effective}} aperture) classical Cassegrain telescope. The Cassegrain focus f/ratio is f/38 and {{the primary}} mirror f/ratio is 2.5. Several aspects of the design of IRTF are optimized for IR observations. The <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror</b> is undersized to prevent the instrument from seeing the thermal emission from the telescope structure around the primary mirror. The primary mirror itself is 126" [...] in diameter, but only the center 118" [...] is used. A small mirror {{in the center of}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror</b> prevents the instrument from seeing its own thermal emission. The f/ratio is long to have a small <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror,</b> again to minimize the telescope's thermal emission. The mirror coatings are chosen to have minimal thermal emission. The emissivity of the telescope is usually below 4%. The <b>secondary</b> <b>mirror</b> is mounted on a chopping mechanism to rapidly switch the pointing of the telescope from target to sky at up to 4 Hz.|$|E
