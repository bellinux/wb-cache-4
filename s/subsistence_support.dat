Racial and ethnic influences on outdoor recreation participation are viewed from four theoretical perspectives. For each perspective, practices are presented that would remove or lessen socioeconomic barriers that constrain access. The marginality perspective holds that historical barriers in education and employment have negatively affected income available for recreation. Educational practices that help individuals surmount marginality factors include those that are offered for free or reduced cost and provide necessary equipment or transportation. The subcultural hypothesis states that cultural factors are more significant than socioeconomic constraints in explaining recreation participation among minority groups.

40|$|Human dentitions from Oakwood Mound were {{examined}} to ascertain dental health in this population. Attrition rate, carious lesions, and antemortem tooth loss were scored for each adult.

The attrition rate supports {{the hypothesis that the}} individuals interred in Oakwood Mound shared similar subsistence strategies. The prevalence of carious lesions suggests a dependence on carbohydrates as a major dietary resource. High rates of antemortem tooth loss also may have resulted from reliance on this food source, although this connection is not as direct as the caries data. These data, along with more recent data on Langford <b>subsistence,</b> <b>support</b> the notion that these groups strongly relied on maize agriculture as a dietary staple.

40|$|Twenty-two {{states now}} exclude {{children}} born to women on welfare from the calculation of families 2 Ì† 7 welfare benefits. This program of subsistence benefit withholding {{is known as the}} 2 Ì† 2 family cap 2 Ì† 2 or the 2 Ì† 2 child exclusion; 2 Ì† 2 children denied benefits under the program are called 2 Ì† 2 cap babies. 2 Ì† 2 After reporting on the status and context of child exclusion policies in the U. S., including evidence of their disparate racial impact, this article examines child exclusion policies through a global lens. The United Nations has urged all countries to develop formal population policies and over the past two decades, most have. The U. S. has not done so, yet the child exclusion serves as a de facto population policy utilized in almost half of the states. Comparing this approach to other global approaches to population, the article surveys international human rights law as well as comparative case law and national population policies of India, China and several African countries. It concludes that the U. S. child exclusion policy is a uniquely harsh program in the global context, that manipulates <b>subsistence</b> <b>support</b> originally intended to assist children by focusing punitive measures on a impoverished, racially disparate population...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, several {{measures}} {{have been developed to}} provide assistance to persons defined as victims of trafficking. This article describes and discusses the organization of barriers and access to assistance (such as housing, medical assistance and <b>subsistence</b> <b>support)</b> for this group in Norway, taking as its starting point the daily practice of social workers and using an institutional ethnographic approach. Of great significance to access to assistance are the different administrative statuses that trafficking victims are assigned and move between, thus having rights granted or taken away. The negotiation of these administrative categories and navigation of conflicting legislation become a central aspect of social workersâ€™ daily practice. Persons defined as â€˜trafficking victimsâ€™ are eligible for a special residence permit, while assistance in Norway in practice is provided through the universal welfare system. Â  â€˜Human traffickingâ€™ and â€˜trafficking victimâ€™ are operational categories in criminal law and immigration legislation, but they are not administrative categories for welfare provision. Instead, being defined as a trafficking victim functions as an inroad to assignation of other administrative categories (also dependent on residence and registration statuses) that determine what assistance is or is not available. Gaps and inconsistencies between institutional and legal complexes arise when one small group of people are awarded special measure rights within a universal system, creating a bureaucratically complicated and â€˜messyâ€™ path to assistance. This â€˜messinessâ€™ does not mean that it does not always work. However, it appears to work best for those who fit well with the modern Norwegian bureaucracy, e. g. in terms of being able to document identity and stay within one administrative status, and worst for those who do not. Hence, the system for victim assistance appears to be the least accessible for some of the least privileged members of the group it is intended for...|$|E

The town itself had five factories employing 700-800 people, mostly wives of fishermen working in local production. Yet, between 1930 and 1960, there was a considerable decline in fortunes, resulting in the closing of many of these factories, the reduction in fishing boats along the coast and the abandonment of many of the homes. The population was reduced by half and the fishing industry became a <b>subsistence</b> activity, <b>supporting</b> local consumption only.|$|R
