5|$|Tricholoma pardinum {{mushrooms}} may {{be confused}} with several edible grey-capped members of the genus Tricholoma, and some authorities recommend leaving all grey-capped Tricholoma mushrooms for experienced hunters. There are several superficially similar European species that could be mistaken for T.pardinum. The <b>smaller</b> T.terreum lacks a mealy smell and cap scales, is darker coloured and less robust, and has <b>smaller</b> spores measuring 5–7.5 by 4–5μm. The edible T.argyraceum somewhat resembles T.pardinum—but with finer scales, and gills and bruised parts that yellow with age. Unlike the preferentially montane T.pardinum, these lookalikes tend to fruit at lower elevations. T.atrosquamosum is <b>smaller</b> and darker than T.pardinum, and has a peppery aroma. T.orirubens has fine dark scales and pinkish gills, brittle flesh, and is generally <b>smaller.</b> T.myomyces is <b>smaller</b> than T.pardinum, has a thin, fibrous partial veil on young specimens, and elliptical spores measuring 5–6 by 3.5–4μm. The edible and highly regarded T.portentosum is of a similar size, though has a uniform grey cap that is never scaled.|$|E
