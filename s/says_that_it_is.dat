5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers {{in the area are}} so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|After Jon {{discusses}} the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa criticizes him for attacking without gathering more men and predicts that Ramsay will defeat them. Jon {{insists that the}} army is the largest one possible. When Jon asks Melisandre not to resurrect him if he dies in battle, she <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> up to the Lord of Light. Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving Stannis and Mance and acknowledge {{that they may have}} served the wrong king all along. Davos discovers the pyre where Shireen and the wooden stag he carved for her were burned.|$|E
50|$|Intuitively, {{the closed}} long ray {{is like a}} real (closed) half-line, except <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much longer in one direction: we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> long {{at one end and}} closed at the other. The open long ray is like the real line (or {{equivalently}} an open half-line) except <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much longer in one direction: we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> long at one end and short (open) at the other. The long line is longer than the real lines in both directions: we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> long in both directions.|$|R

5|$|In all {{versions}} of the tale, after marrying Gautama, Ahalya settles into his ashram (hermitage), which generally becomes the site of her epic curse. The Ramayana records that Gautama's ashram is in a forest (Mithila-upavana) near Mithila, where the couple practices asceticism together for several years. In other scriptures, the ashram is usually near the river bank. The Brahma Purana <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> near the river Godavari and the Skanda Purana (701–1200 CE) places it near the river Narmada. The Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) describe the ashram as near the holy city of Pushkar.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American {{man who had been}} a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan, but {{the director of the}} film is uncredited. Little is known of the production, but a review in The New York Dramatic Mirror made the assumption that the scenes were shot in the morning. The film starred Florence La Badie, who was the most prominent player of the Thanhouser Company and frequently in the leading roles of films including the The Million Dollar Mystery which would captivate the United States. The role of the father was played, Sidney Bracy, was a stage actor of considerable experience who claimed to have been affiliated with the Thanhouser players since 1910. Though Q. David Bowers <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> probably an incorrect assertion, it is possible that Bracy may not have been a full-time member of the company. Bracy's first credited work appears in 1913, but it would not be until The Million Dollar Mystery that Bracy would garner much attention in the role of Jones, the Butler. The role of the doctor was played by Arthur Bauer who was a veteran of the stage and film, through the Great Northern Film Company, before signing onto the Thanhouser Company. The announcement of Bauer's role at Thanhouser came after the release of sixteen films, including Adrift in the Great City, on March 21, 1914. Lila Chester, played the role of a nurse in the production. Chester was claimed by a Thanhouser publicist to have appeared in over 400 films by February 14, 1914. Bowers reasons that if these productions were with Thanhouser, than most of them had to be minor roles {{because of the lack of}} attention and credits she was given. The one reel drama film, approximately 1008 feet long, was filmed in New York City and New Rochelle, New York.|$|E

50|$|In the 1930s, the aerodrome {{may have}} moved further along Canewdon Road in Ashingdon.

Others <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have <b>been</b> at two separate locations in that road and others deny both suggestions and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only ever at one place in Canewdon Road.

50|$|The Laurentian was {{a society}} of Trinity College, Dublin, created during the {{academic}} year 1952-3.

The fact that the very society celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1963 makes the latter date seem more probable.|$|R

25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Maya, or the {{principle}} of illusion, is not new to oriental philosophy. The concept appears at least {{as early as the}} works of Indian philosopher Adi Shankara writing in the 9th century. Meher Baba makes a distinction, however, from the traditional interpretation of Maya as illusion itself, and <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that principle that causes one to be deceived into seeing the false as real.|$|E

25|$|Corydon also <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{because of}} Meliboeus himself that Corydon {{is able to}} enjoy a life in the woods, carefree, {{composing}} poetry/music rather than being exiled far away into obscurity. Corydon requests Meliboeus to favour, and perhaps edit, his work. Corydon also explains that a certain Iollas recently gave him a reed pipe, which was once owned by Tityrus. Meliboeus and Corydon agree that Tityrus was a very talented singer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive. One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox which <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.|$|E
25|$|Maxime Rodinson <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> most {{probable}} that Muhammad's conditions was basically {{of the same}} kind as that found in many mystics rather than epilepsy. Fazlur Rahman refutes epileptic fits for the following reasons: Muhammad's condition begins with his career at the age of 40; according to the tradition seizures are invariably associated with the revelation and never occur by itself. Lastly, a sophisticated society like the Meccan or Medinese would have identified epilepsy clearly and definitely.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} Songtsen Gampo was born at Gyama in Meldro, a region to the {{northeast}} of modern Lhasa), {{the son of the}} Yarlung king Namri Songtsen. The book The Holder of the White Lotus <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> believed that he was a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, of whom the Dalai Lamas are similarly believed to be a manifestation.

25|$|The Torah <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{because the}} Hebrews left Egypt with such haste {{that there was}} no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a {{reminder}} of the rapid departure of the Exodus. Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.|$|E
25|$|Formally, {{the joint}} {{hypothesis}} problem <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> never possible to test (sufficiently, to prove or disprove) market efficiency. A test of market efficiency must include some model for how prices may be set efficiently. Then actual prices can be examined {{to see whether}} this holds true. Usually this fails and then this supports the case that markets are not efficient. The joint hypothesis problem says that, when this happens, {{it shows that the}} model is not complete. There are some factors that are not accounted for.|$|E
