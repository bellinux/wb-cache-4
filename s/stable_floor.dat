6000|$|... 10. The Adoration of the Shepherds. This picture commences the [...] {{series of}} the upper room, which, as already noticed, is painted with [...] far less care {{than that of the}} lower. It is one of the painter's [...] inconceivable caprices that the only canvases that are in good light [...] should be covered in this hasty manner, while those in the dungeon [...] below, and on the ceiling above, are all highly labored. It is, [...] however, just {{possible}} that the covering of these walls may have been [...] an after-thought, when he had got tired of his work. They are also, [...] for the most part, illustrative of a principle of which I am more and [...] more convinced every day, that historical and figure pieces ought not [...] to be made vehicles for effects of light. The light which is fit for a [...] historical picture is that tempered semi-sunshine of which, in [...] general, the works of Titian are the best examples, and of which the [...] picture we have just passed, [...] "The Visitation," [...] is a perfect example [...] from the hand of one greater than Titian; so also the three [...] "Crucifixions" [...] of San Rocco, San Cassano, and St. John and Paul; the [...] "Adoration of the Magi" [...] here; and, in general, the finest works of [...] the master; but Tintoret was not a man to work in any formal or [...] systematic manner; and, exactly like Turner, we find him recording [...] every effect which Nature herself displays. Still he seems to regard [...] the pictures which deviate from the great general principle of [...] colorists rather as [...] "tours de force" [...] than as sources of pleasure; and [...] I do not think there is any instance of his having worked out one of [...] these tricky pictures with thorough affection, except only in the case [...] of the [...] "Marriage of Cana." [...] By tricky pictures, I mean those which [...] display light entering in different directions, and attract the eye to [...] the effects rather than to the figure which displays them. Of this [...] treatment, we have already had a marvellous instance in the [...] candle-light picture of the [...] "Last Supper" [...] in San Giorgio Maggiore. [...] This [...] "Adoration of the Shepherds" [...] has probably been nearly as [...] wonderful when first painted: the Madonna is seated on a kind of [...] hammock floor made of rope netting, covered with straw; it divides the [...] picture into two stories, of which the uppermost contains the Virgin, [...] with two women who are adoring Christ, and shows light entering from [...] above through the loose timbers of the roof of the stable, as well as [...] through the bars of a square window; the lower division shows this [...] light falling behind the netting upon the <b>stable</b> <b>floor,</b> occupied by a [...] cock and a cow, and against this light are relieved the figures of the [...] shepherds, for the most part in demi-tint, but with flakes of more [...] vigorous sunshine falling here and there upon them from above. The [...] optical illusion has originally been as perfect as one of Hunt's best [...] interiors; but it is most curious that no part of the work seems to [...] have been taken any pleasure in by the painter; it is all by his hand, [...] but it looks {{as if he had been}} bent only on getting over the ground. [...] It is literally a piece of scene-painting, and is exactly what we [...] might fancy Tintoret to have done, had he been forced to paint scenes [...] at a small theatre at a shilling a day. I cannot think that the whole [...] canvas, though fourteen feet high and ten wide, or thereabouts, could [...] have taken him more than a couple of days to finish: and it is very [...] noticeable that exactly in proportion to the brilliant effects of [...] light is the coarseness of the execution, for the figures of the [...] Madonna and of the women above, which are not in any strong effect, [...] are painted with some care, while the shepherds and the cow are alike [...] slovenly; and the latter, which is in full sunshine, is recognizable [...] for a cow more by its size and that of its horns, than by any care [...] given to its form. It is interesting to contrast this slovenly and [...] mean sketch with the ass's head in the [...] "Flight into Egypt," [...] on which [...] the painter exerted his full power; as an effect of light, however, [...] the work is, of course, most interesting. One point in the treatment [...] is especially noticeable: there is a peacock in the rack beyond the [...] cow; and under other circumstances, one cannot doubt that Tintoret [...] would have liked a peacock in full color, and would have painted it [...] green and blue with great satisfaction. It is sacrificed to the light, [...] however, and is painted in warm grey, with a dim eye or two in the [...] tail: this process is exactly analogous to Turner's taking the colors [...] out of the flags of his ships in the [...] "Gosport." [...] Another striking point [...] is the litter with which the whole picture is filled in order more to [...] confuse the eye: there is straw sticking from the roof, straw all over [...] the hammock floor, and straw struggling hither and thither all over [...] the floor itself; and, to add to the confusion, the glory around the [...] head of the infant, instead of being united and serene, is broken into [...] little bits, and is like a glory of chopped straw. But the most [...] curious thing, after all, is the want of delight in any of the [...] principal figures, and the comparative meanness and commonplaceness of [...] even the folds of the drapery. It seems as if Tintoret had determined [...] to make the shepherds as uninteresting as possible; but one does not [...] see why their very clothes should be ill painted, and their [...] disposition unpicturesque. I believe, however, though it never struck [...] me until I had examined this picture, that this is one of the [...] painter's fixed principles: he does not, with German sentimentality, [...] make shepherds and peasants graceful or sublime, but he purposely [...] vulgarizes them, not by making their actions or their faces boorish or [...] disagreeable, but rather by painting them ill, and composing their [...] draperies tamely. As far as I recollect at present, the principle is [...] universal with him; exactly in proportion to the dignity of character [...] is the beauty of the painting. He will not put out his strength upon [...] any man belonging to the lower classes; and, in order to know what the [...] painter is, one must see him at work on a king, a senator, or a [...] saint. The curious connexion of this with the aristocratic tendencies [...] of the Venetian nation, when we remember that Tintoret was the [...] greatest man whom that nation produced, may become very interesting, [...] if followed out. I forgot to note that, though the peacock is painted [...] with great regardlessness of color, there is a feature in it which no [...] common painter would have observed,--the peculiar flatness of the [...] back, and undulation of the shoulders: the bird's body is all there, [...] though its feathers are a good deal neglected; and the same thing is [...] noticeable in a cock who is pecking among the straw near the [...] spectator, though in other respects a shabby cock enough. The fact is, [...] I believe, he had made his shepherds so commonplace that he dare not [...] paint his animals well, otherwise one would have looked at nothing in [...] the picture but the peacock, cock, and cow. I cannot tell what the [...] shepherds are offering; they look like milk bowls, but they are [...] awkwardly held up, with such twistings of body as would have certainly [...] spilt the milk. A woman in front has a basket of eggs; but this I [...] imagine to be merely to keep up the rustic character of the scene, and [...] not part of the shepherd's offerings.|$|E
50|$|Joists must {{exhibit the}} {{strength}} to support the anticipated load {{over a long period}} of time. In more developed countries such as the United States, the fabrication and installation of all framing members including joists must meet building code standards. Considering the cross section of a typical joist, the overall depth of the joist is critical in establishing a safe and <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> or ceiling system. The wider the spacing between the joists, the deeper the joist will need to be to limit stress and deflection under load. Lateral support called dwang, blocking, or strutting increases its stability, preventing the joist from buckling under load. There are approved formulas for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden floor joist for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the joist depth required for a 14‑foot span is 9 inches. Many steel joist manufacturers supply load tables in order to allow designers to select the proper joist sizes for their projects.|$|E
50|$|Pi-Ramesses {{was built}} {{on the banks of the}} Pelusiac branch of the Nile. With a {{population}} of over 300,000, it was one of the largest cities of ancient Egypt. Pi-Ramesses flourished for more than a century after Ramesses' death, and poems were written about its splendour. According to the latest estimates, the city was spread over about 18 km2 or around 6 km long by 3 km wide. Its layout, as shown by ground-penetrating radar, consisted of a huge central temple, a large precinct of mansions bordering the river in the west set in a rigid grid pattern of streets, and a disorderly collection of houses and workshops in the east. The palace of Ramesses is believed to lie beneath the modern village of Qantir. An Austrian team of archaeologists headed by Manfred Bietak, who discovered the site, found evidence of many canals and lakes and have described the city as the Venice of Egypt. A surprising discovery in the excavated stables were small cisterns located adjacent to each of the estimated 460 horse tether points. Using mules, which are the same size as the horses of Ramesses' day, it was found a double tethered horse would naturally use the cistern as a toilet leaving the <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> clean and dry.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{occurrence}} of thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella in a sheep slaughterhouse in Brandenburg, Germany. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate, how these zoonotic agents are distributed within the slaughterhouse and the processing line. Simultaneously, an interrelation between slaughterhouse and the relevant sheep farms was to investigate. Investigations were carried out from July 2008 to August 2009. A total of 423 samples was obtained from 14 excursions. 320 samples using excision method at four process positions of the line, five points of the carcass (before depelting, after depelting, after evisceration and at chilling) and 103 environmental swab samples (floor of the lairage <b>stable</b> <b>floor,</b> fleece depelting machine, deposition board of carcasses after removing the fleece, doorknobs as well as wall of the chilling room and knifes) were collected. The excision samples were analysed for Aerobic Plate Count (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae Count (EC) and all samples qualitative for Campylobacter, Listeria, E. coli, Salmonella and Yersinia. Campylobacter and E. coli isolates were characterized by PFGE (Kpn I enzyme) and PCR respectively. Results: Hygiene For excision samples the mean APC (log 10 CFU/cm 2) was 3. 79, the mean EC (log 10 CFU/cm 2) was 1. 58. An increase in the number of bacteria during the process untill chilling was observed (process position 4). The microbiological carriage of the carcasses for APC and EB was significantly different depending upon the process position. Zoonotic agents Thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria spp. and E. coli were identified with an average of 20. 1 %, 11. 1 % and 60. 1 % of all samples respectively. Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella were not found in any sample here. Campylobacter was detected in 20. 1 % (85 of 423) by conventional technique, the highest detection rate was obtained in samples from lairage <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> samples (68. 2 %). Campylobacter was not detected in sterilisation bassins, at doorknobs or on the walls in the chilling room. The highest findings on the carcasses was in the chilling room (27. 5 %) (process position 4). The Campylobacter isolates were differentiated using conventional and PCR technique: C. jejuni (71. 3 % / 55. 7 %), C. coli (23. 8 % / 11. 4 %) and C. lari (5. 0 % / 14. 8 %) were detected. Listeria was detected in 11. 1 % (47 of 423) of samples, mostly in samples from lairage <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> samples (27. 3 %). Listeria was not detected in sterilisation bassins, on doorknobs, at the wall in the chilling room or on the deposition board of carcasses after depelting. The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found before depelting (12. 5 %) and in the chilling room (12. 5 %). Listeria isolates were L. ivanovii (57. 4 %; 27 of 47), L. denitrificans (27. 7 %; 13 of 47), L. monocytogenes (8. 5; 4 out of 47 %) and L. innocua (2. 1 %; 1 of 47) were found. E. coli was detected in 60. 1 % (254 of 423) of all samples, most of them were from the samples of the lairage <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> and fleece depelting machine (100. 0 % each). The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found in the chilling room (72. 5 %). For Campylobacter isolates using PFGE, a relationship between some sample qualities was observed: Within particular excursions and also for different ones, the patterns of PFGE indicate the same genetic sequences of Campylobacter. Hence, transfer of Campylobacter from farm in to the slaughterhouse and the meat production process can not be excluded. In conclusion, thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria and E. coli were identified on carcasses and in environmental samples especially in the lairage <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> samples. A transfer of these pathogens from the farms to the slaughterhouse can be assumed...|$|E
40|$|Context: Resistance {{training}} {{while using}} an instability-training device {{is known to}} increase activation of stabilizing muscle groups while decreasing the force generated by the prime movers during isometric contractions. Purpose: To investigate differences in squat kinetics during dynamic resistance training in an increasingly unstable training environment. Methods: Fourteen active men participated in this study. In each testing session, each participant performed 3 repetitions of squats with a 10 -repetition maximum (10 -RM) resistance, 40 % of their 10 -RM resistance, and 20. 45 kg. The 3 testing session consisted of standing on a <b>stable</b> <b>floor,</b> foam pads, or BOSU balls. All repetitions were recorded with an optical encoder to record barbell kinetics. Results: The transition from <b>stable</b> (<b>floor)</b> to very unstable (BOSU) resulted in high likelihoods (> 75 %) of clinically meaningful differences ranging from small to large (effect size [ES] 0. 31 – 1. 73) in factors relating to concentric kinetics, eccentric power, and squat depth, regardless of the resistance used for training. There were also likely differences at the heaviest resistance in peak concentric power (stable to foam: ES 2. 06; foam to BOSU: ES 0. 38), eccentric power (stable to foam: ES 1. 88; foam to BOSU: ES 0. 74), and squat depth (stable to foam: ES 0. 50; foam to BOSU: ES 0. 67). Conclusions: Resistance training in an unstable environment at an intensity sufficient to elicit strength gains of the prime movers results in deleterious effects in concentric squat kinetics and squat technique. Such observations are particularly evident on very unstable platforms...|$|E
40|$|The flexion-relaxation {{phenomenon}} {{consisting of}} an erector spinae silent period occurring with trunk flexion can place considerable stress upon tissues. Since individuals often flex their trunks while unstable, {{the purpose of}} the study was to examine the effect of an unstable base on the flexion-relaxation response. Fourteen participants flexed at the hips and back while standing on a <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> or an unstable dyna-disc. Hip and trunk flexion were repeated four times each with one-minute rest. Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were placed over the right lumbo-sacral erector spinae (LSES), upper lumbar erector spinae (ULES), lower abdominals (LA), biceps femoris and soleus. In addition to the flexion-relaxation phenomenon of the ES, a quiescence of biceps femoris and a burst of LA EMG activity was observed with the majority of stable trials. There was no effect of instability on the flexion-relaxation phenomenon of the ULES or LSES. The incidence of a biceps femoris silent period while stable was diminished with an unstable base. Similarly, the incidence of a LA EMG burst was curtailed with instability. Soleus EMG activity increased 29. 5 % with an unstable platform.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of short-term stability ball (SB) training on males and females by comparing the strength changes produced in the core muscles. Forty-two previously untrained subjects, mean age = 23. 62 ± 2. 89 years were matched by their maximum strength (back strength: male = 190 - 200 kg, female = 45 - 50 kg and abdominal strength: male = 110 - 120 kg, female = 35 - 40 kg 1 RM) and randomly placed in either one of these 3 groups; unstable SB group (n = 14), <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> group (n = 14) and control group (n = 14) who did no exercise. SB training showed greatest improvement (p < 0. 001) in back and abdominal strength (25. 79 % and 29. 51 % respectively), compared with the gain in floor training (FT) back and abdominal strength (10. 28 % and 8. 47 % respectively). Untrained female subjects achieved a higher percentage of improvement in strength compared to males in both back and abdominal muscles, and this is most evident in the SB training group. It is apparent that performing core training exercises on unstable surfaces stressed the musculature, possibly activating the neuro-adaptive mechanisms that led to the early phase gains in strength.

40|$|Analyzing nearly {{collapsed}} and broken structures gives good insights into possible architectural and engineering design mistakes and faults in the detailing and mismanagement of a construction by building contractors. Harmful vibration effects of construction operations occur frequently. The background reviews {{have demonstrated that}} the problem of the vibration serviceability of long-span concrete floors in buildings is complex and interdisciplinary in nature. In public buildings, floor vibration control is required in order to meet Serviceability Limit States that ensure the comfort of the users of a building. In industrial buildings, machines are often placed on floors. Machines generate vibrations of various frequencies, which are transferred to supporting constructions. Precision machines require a <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> with defined and known dynamic characteristics. In recent years there has been increasing interest in the motion of elastic bodies whose material properties (density, elastic moduli, etc.) are not constant, but vary with their position, perhaps in a random manner.

The horse business has not by far kept up with these cost savings solutions. Cleaning out stables and feeding horses are the most time-consuming tasks in horse stables today. The most common way to clean out the stable is still by shovel and wheelbarrow. The clean out process can easily be mechanized through semi- permanently beds with movable walls between the boxes so that the litter can be removed by a tractor or a loader. Other ways to simplify manure handling is to mechanize the transport of manure to the storage slab by installing rail-mounted carts or to have scrapers in culverts under the <b>stable</b> <b>floor.</b> A new system on the market for horse stables is Moving Floor™. The floor in the box is moved by compressed air whilst the horse is outdoors during the day, and both the moving of the floor and the filling of litter are controlled by a processor.

40|$|Despite {{surgical}} intervention, orbital floor fractures {{are associated}} with risks of persisting sensibility disturbances, enophthalmos and diplopia. Cheek asymmetry and trismus may result when the zygoma is dislocated. In evaluating the surgical results patients’ experiences of the outcomes have to be investigated. To investigate sequelae a questionnaire was sent to 107 patients previously treated for an orbital floor fracture (Paper I). Visual analogue scales (VASs) were used in a prospective study (Papers II and III) to assess patients’ experiences of persisting signs and symptoms. The possibility of using electronystagmography (ENG) equipment, normally employed in vestibular testing in ENT practice, for measuring bilateral vertical eye motility was investigated in a methodological study (Paper IV). Fractures were mainly due to assaults and falls. Sequelae were common (83 %). A high frequency of diplopia (36 %) was associated with antral packing. When <b>stable</b> <b>floor</b> implants replaced this technique, the subsequent prospective study revealed absence of severe cases of diplopia {{as well as a}} lower occurrence of diplopia (9. 5 %). Patients and doctors agreed on the presence of ‘objective’ signs (affected physical appearance and diplopia). Sensibility disturbances and reduced mouth opening capacity were not sufficiently reflected by the diagnostic assessment methods used, and these symptoms were underestimated by the clinicians. Surgery of the internal orbit involves risks. For this reason, operations for purely diagnostic purposes must be avoided. However, 21 % of the orbital floor operations {{in the present study were}} performed for purely diagnostic purposes. Surgeons did not apprehend the CT scans as being representative of the fracture. No test is at present available that can objectively establish entrapment of soft tissues as a cause of diplopia, although this is an absolute indication for surgery. However, vertical electro-oculography (vEOG) was shown to (i) objectively measure vertical eye motility; (ii) detect and verify mechanical restriction of vertical eye motility; and (iii) distinguish patients experiencing vertical diplopia from healthy test subjects with ‘normal’ eye motility. Both recognition of patients’ experiences and prolonged follow-ups in selected cases are important for treatment feedback, and are prerequisites for improvement of future surgical outcomes. Current diagnostic methods appear to be insufficient. Vertical electro-oculography is suggested as a simple, objective and noninvasive eye motility test with the potential of helping predict which patients will benefit or not benefit from orbital floor surgery...|$|E
40|$|This essay aims {{to review}} {{scientific}} literature to evaluate how housing and air quality {{can be improved}} for a better welfare for horses. The main focus of this essay was to show how horseboxes should be made safe, but also how <b>stable</b> <b>flooring,</b> other interior and air quality affects the horses housed there. Results from the review show that the infill planks {{need to be able}} to withstand a horse kick with an impact energy of at least 350 J to be regarded as kick resistant and that not all materials are suited as infill planks. Plastic infill planks are more resistant than Norway spruce and might be more suitable as a material in horseboxes. Using standing grids as a divider in the upper part of the box wall risks injury as a horse may get caught with its lower mandibular and in addition isn’t kick resistant. A steel mesh grid might be more suitable instead as it’s able to withstand a horse kick without breaking. A horse may also injure itself on stall fixtures like hooks and cribs, and it’s advisable to apply design solutions that minimizes the risk of injury. Stall flooring may also be a potential danger to the horse if not designed to be slip-free. The air quality in the stable should be free from a high concentration of ammonia, carbon dioxide, moisture and organic dust to minimize the risk of horses suffering from inflammation in the airways. Carbon dioxide is used as a measure of how well ventilated the stable is and high levels are an indicator of poor ventilation. Poor ventilation can cause moisture to build up and may result in mold growing in the stable interior. In addition to this, organic dust can accumulate when dusty hay and straw are used as food and bedding. However, organic dust can be reduced by switching to silage with a higher water content and using wood shavings as bedding material. It is important to take measures to ensure the safety of the horses housed in stables by designing stable interior with the intent to minimize the risk of injury. However, it is equally important to assess other parameters in horse housing, like herd-dynamics and feeding routines. Reducing situations where a horse may show aggression or fear caused by food-related frustration or from not being housed next to an affiliate may also reduce the risk of an injury...|$|R
40|$|Lava Beds National Monument {{contains}} lava caves with {{a variety}} of significant ice resources. Caves with seasonal melting of some ice resources provide an important source of water for wildlife within the monument and have had many historic uses over the past several decades. In other caves, perennial melting of previously <b>stable</b> ice <b>floors</b> is increasing, with some caves experiencing total ice loss where deposits were greater than 2 meters (6 feet) thick. Simple ice level monitoring has occurred in sixteen of the thirty-five known ice caves since 1990, supplemented with varying amounts photo monitoring. Though this monitoring reveals changes in the level of many ice floors, it does not detect changes in ice volume or differential changes across an ice floor (Thomas, 2010). To increase the quality of ice monitoring, Lava Beds staff are field testing and refining a combination of surface area and ice level measurements to estimate the change in volume of ice floors inside the five most significant ice caves within the monument. This new protocol is being established in accordance with the National Park Service Klamath Inventory and Monitoring Network’s Integrated Cave Entrance Community and Cave Ecosystem Long-term Monitoring Protocol (Krejca et al., 2011). The goal of this long-term monitoring protocol is to document changes in cave environments using several different parameters, including ice...|$|R
40|$|Tinnitus {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complaints}} in otolaryngology practice. Tinnitus may often be accompanied with hearing loss and vertigo. Tinnitus may impair the quality of life in advanced degrees. In very rare cases, it may cause suicide. In this report, we presented the case of a 61 -year-old female patient who attempted suicide due to tinnitus. She suffered from constant tinnitus in both ears since she had undergone serous otitis media two months ago. Despite medical treatment, tinnitus did not improve, and lately, she suffered from severe insomnia. Due to severe tinnitus and insomnia, she drank hydrochloric acid. She was consequently admitted to our emergency department by her family. On physical examination, the patient’s vital signs were <b>stable</b> and <b>floor</b> of the mouth mucosa, gingiva, and hard and soft palate had widely ulcerated areas. Severe laryngeal edema and ulceration was observed on laryngoscopic examination. The eardrum was myringosclerotic on otoscopic examination. The patient was closely followed for respiratory distress; however, tracheostomy was not required. The abovementioned case suggests that patients admitted with complaints of tinnitus should be questioned for severity of depressive symptoms, considering that the presence of depressive symptoms in these patients may result in an attempt of suicide. These patients should be evaluated not only in otolaryngology clinics but also in psychiatric clinics, and subsequently receive appropriate support...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of environmental and pre-milking sanitation on milk quality of dairy cow in the farmers. Milk quality were measured from samples that were taken from cows managed by farmers in Pakem, Sleman during the existing condition and implementation of treatment. Twenty three dairy cows were used to observed the effect of treatment, namely improve environmental sanitation and pre-milking. The treatment consisted of cleaning the <b>floor</b> <b>stable,</b> water and feed trough, washing the cow and udder, drying udder and discarded the first milk flow. The results showed that improving sanitation significantly decreased milk acidity from 0. 19 % to 0. 14 % and number of bacteria in milk. The treatments could also increase milk density and solid non fat. The study concluded that improving environmental sanitation and pre-milking gave significant effect to milk quality...|$|R
