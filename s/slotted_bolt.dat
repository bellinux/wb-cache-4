5000|$|A [...] "cartridge seal" [...] is a {{prepackaged}} seal that {{is common}} in more complex applications and were originally designed for installation in equipment where a component type seal was difficult due to the equipment design. Examples of this are horizontally split and vertical pumps. In 1975 the A W Chesterton Company designed the first cartridge seal that fit pumps with varying stuffing box bore sizes and gland bolt patterns. To accomplish this the seal utilized internal centering of the stationary parts and <b>slotted</b> <b>bolt</b> holes. This [...] "generic" [...] cartridge seal could be manufactured in higher production quantities resulting in a cartridge seal {{that could be used}} in all applications and pumps types. Cassette seals, patent no. 6,685,191 introduced by Gold Seals, Inc., utilize a replaceable inner [...] "cassette" [...] mounted in the cartridge end plate or gland, while modular cartridge seal systems makes it possible to replace only the parts subject to wear, such as sliding faces, secondary seals and springs, while keeping the seal's hardware (gland, sleeve, bolts).Cartridge seals can suffer from clogging due to the bigger space occupied inside the stuffing box, leading to dense or charged fluids not moving enough to centrifugate the solid particles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slotted</b> <b>bolted</b> {{connection}} elements (SBCEs) {{have been}} used extensively in steel frame structures to mitigate the dynamic response by providing hysteretic damping and nonlinear stiffness to the structure. But an analytical model on this energy dissipation mechanism is absent. This paper presents an analytical model to describe the shear force-deformation behaviour of such an element with two sliding steel plates and a single frictional interface. The initial stiffness and other model parameters can be adjusted within a relatively wide range to control its energy dissipation property. The SBCE is included into a single-degree-of-freedom steel frame, and the behaviour and effect of the structure are studied with cyclic and seismic base excitation. The SBCE is shown to perform effectively in vibration mitigation under the cyclic and earthquake loadings. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A hybrid {{finite element}} of a <b>slotted</b> <b>bolted</b> {{connection}} element (SBCE) is developed which constitutes a frictional damper and two truss elements. The damping mechanism of the damper {{is based on the}} micro-slip elements in the contact surface, and the damping properties can be designed for any specific requirements by adjusting several design parameters which in turn, depends on the physical parameters of the joint. Simulation studies are reported on the vibration mitigation of a suspension footbridge due to pedestrian loading with twenty-eight SBCEs. The dynamic load model reported in the London Millennium Footbridge [Struct. Eng. 79 (2001) 17] is adopted. Recommendations on the design of parameters of the dampers are given. The damping by energy dissipation in the structure is discussed with reference to the time response history of the structure and the hysteretic loops of the dampers.

40|$|Joints between {{concrete}} and steel elements in constructions are typically designed to transfer static shear force and sometimes bending moment. To enhance a structure&# 039;s ability to suppress earthquake or wind-induced vibrations, this research attempts to incorporate friction devices to the joint. In this new design, a large diameter pin replaces bolts {{in the web}} which allows rotation of beam about its centroid. Two friction devices called <b>Slotted</b> <b>Bolted</b> Connection (SBC) are incorporated in the tension and compression flanges of the beam. The research begins with an experimental investigation of an individual SBC specimen. Force-displacement hysteresis is obtained under cyclic axial loads. Coefficient of friction is then obtained from a nonlinear finite element model which is calibrated against experimental results. The research continues with a full-scale experiment of steel beam-to-concrete column. Moment-rotation hysteresis is acquired, and stiffness, strength and equivalent damping ratio is then determined. Results demonstrate that the proposed configuration is effective to dissipate input energy and produce effective damping to a structural system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract approved: Friction dampers {{have been}} used {{successfully}} to dissipate seismic energy in steel and concrete structures. The application is new to timber structures. The objectives of this research were to design a <b>slotted</b> <b>bolted</b> connection (SBC) and evaluate its potential as a passive energy damper in timber brace. The research was conducted in three phases: (1) preliminary tests, (2) single and dual SBC tests, and (3) tests of the dual SBC mounted to a timber brace. The preliminary tests showed that brass shims and compression spring washers contributed to repeatable performance, validated the SBC design using results from the literature, and demonstrated that an SBC with predictable hysteresis characteristics could be designed and fabricated. The expected slip force of 33. 4 kN per bolt was reached. In Phase II, tests with six single SBC specimens were conducted following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) cyclic test protocol. The six SBCs were later assembled in pairs to make three dua...|$|R

The intakes can be interchanged by <b>slotting</b> the <b>bolt</b> holes, but the added deck {{height of the}} GEN-3 engine means that sealing and port match will be compromised. Gen-3 intakes can be machined to fit Gen-2 engines by surface grinding the intake flanges and slotting the center holes.|$|R
30|$|This note {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} an improved <b>slotted</b> <b>bolted</b> connection for timber moment frames. In the improved connection, steel tubes are inserted into drill holes in glulam and fixed to the glulam with resin injection. Aluminum splice plates with curved slots, or curved elongated holes, are fastened mechanically by using high-strength bolts that go through the steel tubes. Since the compression due to bolt tension is fully supported by the steel tubes, the reduction of bolt tension due to shrinkage of the glulam can be avoided. The use of slotted aluminum splice plates allows stable energy dissipation due to smooth sliding between the aluminum splice plates and the end surfaces of the steel tubes within the specified range of rotation angle. Through quasistatic cyclic loading tests of two connection specimens, it was demonstrated that stable and nearly rigid-plastic hysteresis loops were obtained whose equivalent viscous damping ratio was more than 30 % {{in the range of}} rotation angle close to or greater than 1 / 50 radian. Although further improvement is necessary, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the present connection.|$|R

30|$|Direct and {{indirect}} loadings were studied on a composite tibia bone model (3 rd generation sawbones®) with a mid-diaphyseal defect 3.5  mm in size. A universal test machine (UTS®, Germany) {{linked to a}} multichannel measuring system (MGC-Plus with ML 55, HBM®) {{was used for the}} study. In the set-up for the direct loading, both bone ends were attached to the test machine. For the indirect loading, the struts were distally extended, leaving the distal bone end levitating with no direct contact to the base plate of the test machine (Fig.  3). The attachment to the test machine allowed a solely axial loading parallel to the mechanical axis of the composite bone. The bone was stabilised in a standard Ilizarov frame consisting of 4  ×  160 -mm rings and four connecting struts (Smith&Nephew®, Memphis). Two 1.8 -mm wires on each ring were drilled through the tibia in an anatomical position (60 ° angulation, new wires for every test series), and the tibia was placed more anteriorly in relation to the inner diameter of the ring to more realistically mimic the clinical application. The mid-diaphyseal defect was created with an oscillating saw. At the site of the defect, the distance between the bone and the inner diameter in the anterior-posterior direction was 4.5  cm anterior and 8.0  cm posterior. The wires were tensioned to 1, 100  N using the tensioning device that comes with the Ilizarov set and were attached to the rings with <b>slotted</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{with the}} scope of {{minimizing}} structural damage, several dampers were developed [1 - 2] and new replaceable hybrid composite steel devices [3] have been recently proposed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose and investigate a new replaceable hysteretic damper having a basic form of the art of building, minimally architecturally invasive, consisting of two or more dissipative steel columns directly connected to two consecutive floors linked to each other with X-shaped low/mild steel plates. The proposed Dissipative Column (DC) models are shown in Fig. 1 for two different end cases (models A, B). The elements can be considered as a sort of framed bi-pendulum, connected in parallel to the primary structure, able to react to the story drift D with a lateral force QD adding stiffness, strength and damping. The design concept of the DC element aims to obtain a lever mechanism by which a small inter-storey drift provides an amplified vertical drift in the Xplate ends reacting with shear forces, (Fig. 1 c)). X-shaped steel plates made of mild or Low Yielding Strength (LYS) steel [4] are also used as shear links between coupled elements. The top ends of two models are linked to upper floor through <b>slotted</b> <b>bolted</b> connections to allow vertical displacements. By yielding a large volume of steel, the shear devices dissipate substantial input energy under earthquake or strong wind also increasing damping in the entire system. The great advantages of DC elements, if compared with classical dissipative brace, are the reduced architectural invasiveness so that they are able to be integrated in any building, the ease of installation everywhere, their replacement after earthquakes and the stable behavior in cyclic reversal deformation. Axial forces should be designed in ordered to be transferred locally to a proper structural element...|$|R

25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a <b>slot</b> on the <b>bolt</b> carrier, forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R

50|$|When fired, {{propellant}} gases {{from the}} ignited cartridge following the projectile down the bore are vented through a gas port into a gas cylinder where they drive the piston and bolt carrier rearward. There is about 0.2 in of uninterrupted free travel calculated {{to permit the}} gas build-up in the bore to drop to a safe level before the carrier's cam <b>slot</b> rotates the <b>bolt</b> counter-clockwise to unlock. The locking lugs have no pitch therefore no primary extraction occurs during the unlocking sequence. A deeply seated spring-loaded claw extractor in the bolt head extracts the spent cartridge casing from the chamber and a spring-powered ejector fixed to the front feed mechanism trigger housing ejects the casing. The bolt carrier continues to the rear and compresses the recoil spring on its guide rod.|$|R
50|$|The cocking piece {{doubles as}} a safety and is {{attached}} {{at the rear of}} the bolt sleeve assembly and secures the firing pin. When the cocking piece ending in a cocking ring is pulled rearward and turned horizontal, the cocking piece sear can be placed in a recessed safety <b>slot</b> in the <b>bolt</b> plug. This <b>slot</b> is shorter than the firing slot so the firing pin cannot protrude past the face of the bolt cylinder. Any contact with the cartridge primer is thus prevented. The safe mode also prevents the action from being cycled hence preventing the bolt from accidental opening. The operating ring is quite large, making it easy to operate with gloves. When the operating ring is in the vertical position and pulled back by cycling the action or cocking it by hand the action is ready to fire.|$|R
5000|$|William Brophy, an American Army Ordnance officer when {{discussing}} comparable weapons stated: The Haskins [...]50 caliber {{is a single}} shot rifle requiring the shooter to remove the bolt after each round is fired. The shooter actually places {{the rim of the}} cartridge into a <b>slot</b> on the <b>bolt,</b> then inserts this combination into the receiver. The Haskins is an extremely accurate system. I have personally fired this weapon out to 1800 meters and acquired about an 80% first round hit probability. The weapon uses a removable muzzle brake, which at one time allowed the shooter to choose between several types of brakes. A note of caution here to anyone encountering this system. It is possible to install the muzzle brake on backwards which will send the after shock directly onto the shooter and spotter (not a pleasant experience).|$|R
5000|$|George Chinn {{notes about}} the 1907 model that: [...] "While it was gas {{actuated}} {{by means of}} a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a gear rack. This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an actuating lever. When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a cam <b>slot</b> in the <b>bolt,</b> the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The actuating lever turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Model 70 quickly {{established an}} excellent reputation with American sportsmen. It was a high-quality action of considerable strength, with 2 forward locking lugs and a Mauser-type non-rotating claw extractor. The key {{benefit of the}} Mauser-type extractor compared to later versions is that it captures the rim of a cartridge as it is fed upwards from the magazine and controls its journey forward into the rifle's chamber. This feed is called [...] "controlled round feeding" [...] (CRF) and is favored {{by a number of}} shooters who prefer rifles to feed reliably, especially those who pursue dangerous game. The ejector was of the blade type {{similar to that of the}} Mauser 98, but considered superior as it did not require a Mauser-type slot through the left locking lug; instead there was a <b>slot</b> in the <b>bolt</b> face below the locking lug, leaving both forward lugs solid and hence stronger. The main benefit of the blade type ejector is it is simpler and perhaps more reliable (being considered less susceptible to ingress of foreign matter) when compared to the later post-1964 plunger ejector in the bolt face controlled by a coil spring.|$|R
50|$|A {{crossbow}} is a bow {{mounted on}} a stick (called a tiller or stock) with a mechanism in it that holds the drawn bow string. The earliest designs featured a slot in the stock, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up {{through a hole in}} the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a trigger or tickler. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a nut to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular centre <b>slot</b> for the <b>bolt,</b> and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal sear or trigger face, usually of metal. These roller nuts were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or {{mounted on a}} metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally. Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal. Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little effort, allowing crossbowmen to aim better.|$|R
5000|$|The Israeli FAL {{first saw}} action in {{relatively}} small quantities during the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Six-Day War in June 1967, the War of Attrition of 1967 until 1970, {{it was the}} standard Israeli rifle. During the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 {{it was still in}} front-line service as the standard Israeli rifle, though increasing criticism eventually led to the phasing-out of the weapon. Israeli forces were primarily mechanized in nature; the long, heavy FAL slowed deployment drills, and proved exceedingly difficult to maneuver within the confines of a vehicle. [...] Additionally, Israeli forces experienced repeated jamming of the FAL due to heavy sand and dust ingress endemic to Middle Eastern desert warfare, requiring repeated field-stripping and cleaning of the rifle, sometimes while under fire. During the later stages of the Yom Kippur War, it was noted that some Israeli soldiers had informally exchanged their FALs for the far more reliable Soviet Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifles taken from dead and captured Arab soldiers. Though the IDF evaluated a few modified FAL rifles with 'sand clearance' <b>slots</b> in the <b>bolt</b> carrier and receiver (which were already part of the Commonwealth L1A1/C1A1 design), malfunction rates did not significantly improve. It {{should be noted that the}} sand cuts for the Israeli FAL models were inferior to the effective Commonwealth L1A1 sand cuts. [...] The Israeli FAL was eventually replaced by the M16 and the Galil (a weapon using the Soviet Kalashnikov operating system, and chambered in either 5.56×45 or 7.62 NATO), though the FAL remained in production in Israel until the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, {{selective}} fire {{assault rifle}} that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil spring {{wrapped around the}} piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: [...] "0"—used to launch rifle grenades, [...] "1"—used in normal operating conditions and [...] "2"—used in extreme environmental conditions or {{in the presence of}} heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a control cam riding in a helical guide slot machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The cam <b>slot</b> in the <b>bolt</b> carrier proceeds to actuate the camming stud in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port {{on the right side of}} the receiver housing.|$|R
50|$|The AR-18's {{action is}} powered by a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The gas piston is of 3-piece design to {{facilitate}} disassembly, with a hollow forward section with 4 radial gas vent holes fitting around a stainless steel gas block projecting rearwards from the foresight housing. The gas is vented from the barrel and travelled via a vent through the foresight housing into the hollow front section of the piston, which causes it to move rearwards a short distance. The rear end of the piston emerges through the barrel extension to contact the forward face of the bolt carrier, causing it in turn to move rearwards. The bolt itself is of similar configuration to the AR-15 with 7 radial locking lugs engaging corresponding recesses in the barrel extension, and the extractor in place of the 8th lug. The bolt is moved {{into and out of the}} locked position via a cam pin that engaged a helical <b>slot</b> in the <b>bolt</b> carrier, which rides on two metal guide rods (each with its own return spring) instead of contacting the receiver walls, providing additional clearance for foreign matter entering the receiver. Unlike the AR-15, the cocking handle fits directly into a recess in the bolt carrier and reciprocates with it during firing, allowing the firer to force the breech closed or open if necessary. The cocking handle slot has a spring-loaded cover that can be closed by the user to prevent debris entering the receiver, and it will open automatically as the bolt carrier moves rearwards after the first shot. The recoil springs are housed within the receiver, differing from the AR-15 which houses its more elaborate buffer mechanism in the buttstock. The AR-18's compact design enables the use of a side-folding stock with a hinging mechanism (which proved to be less than adequately rigid).|$|R
40|$|In general, {{machine tool}} {{structures}} like lathe, milling, broaching, and grinding machines, etc. {{are subjected to}} regular unwanted vibrations. These machine tool vibrations or chatter are deleterious to machining operations. It results in degraded quality on the machined parts, shorter tool life, and unpleasant noise, hence are to be necessarily damped out. The important characteristics of the machine tool structures for metal cutting are high damping and static stiffness which ensure manufacture of work pieces of the required geometries with acceptable surface finish at the required rate of production in the most economical way. The unwanted vibrations must be arrested in ordet to ensure higher accuracy along with productivity. In the present work, the chatter vibrations on a slotted table Horizontal Milling Machine have been damped out using composite structure {{as a substitute for}} the base of the work piece. Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy plates are fixed on to the slotted table as a secondary bed material and the workpiece is mounted on this bed for feeding to the rotating milling cutter. Initially four holes are drilled on each plate of the composite and a set of five plates of each type of composite are mounted for conducting the experiments. A mild steel specimen of similar dimension of the composite plate is placed on the pile of the composites and the setup is fixed to the <b>slotted</b> table using <b>bolts</b> and nuts. An up milling operation is carried out and the vibration signal is recorded on the screen of the digital phosphorus storage oscilloscope. The signal and RMS amplitude, frequency and time period of vibrations are recorded. The experiment is repeated for different sets of composite plates by decreasing the number and the corresponding readings are recorded and tabulated. Moreover, experiments are also conducted without any composite material below the mild steel specimen. It is observed that the vibration amplitude decreases with increase in number of layers of sheets of composites and then increases with increase in number of plates. Moreover, the optimum number of composites are also experimentally determined. The design of the experimental setup has been modeled using CatiaV 5 R 15. Apart from total damping of the system, emphasis has also been focused to find out the material damping of the composite materials so as to select the same for effective damping of the structures. An energy balance approach has been used for calculating the material damping of the fiber reinforced composites used in the experiment. ...|$|R
