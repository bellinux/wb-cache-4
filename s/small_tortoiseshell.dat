50|$|About 30 years ago, Hendrikje Ivo {{an antique}} dealer from Amstelveen, bought a <b>small</b> antique <b>tortoiseshell</b> bag inlaid with {{mother of pearl}} in England, dating back to 1820 and crafted in Germany. Hendrikje's {{interest}} in discovering {{the history of this}} first bag triggered a passion for collecting handbags. Before too long she had collected more than 3,000 bags. She soon decided to show part of the collection to the public. At first, the museum existed in two rooms of a villa in Amstelveen, but as the collection grew, the couple looked for a new location. Since June 2007, the museum is located in a 17th-century patrician house at the Herengracht, Amsterdam's most prestigious canal.|$|R
50|$|The Corsican <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> (Aglais ichnusa) {{looks very}} similar; {{whether it is}} a {{subspecies}} or a distinct species is yet to be determined. Nymphalis xanthomelas and Nymphalis l-album are also similar in appearance.|$|E
5000|$|For most adult butterflies, {{including}} the <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> butterfly, nectar {{is one of}} the main sources of nutrients. In order to obtain the nectar, the butterfly must be able to recognize distinct floral aromas and colours. The <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> butterfly is able to differentiate between various flowers through visual signals. [...] Tortoiseshell butterflies in particular tend to prefer colours at both ends of the visible light spectrum for humans, 400 nm and 600 nm. [...] These correspond to the colours violet and red respectively. This ability comes from their compound eye. The flowers depend on the butterflies for pollination, so it is a mutually beneficial relationship.|$|E
50|$|The main {{trees in}} this wood are oak, ash, hazel and blackthorn. There are flowers such as {{early purple orchid}} and twayblade, birds {{including}} treecreepers and tawny owls, while comma and <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> butterflies feed in open glades in summer.|$|E
50|$|Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, {{different}} birds, and mammals, like rodents, {{deer and}} roe deer, boars, {{and living in}} the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others.

50|$|Coombe Brook Valley Nature Park extends {{for about}} 450 {{yards to the}} south east towards Chester Park, known locally as the 'Gosey' as it lies within the medieval Gosthills Gully. Managed by Avon Wildlife Trust, the 1.6 hectare valley is a haven for {{wildlife}} including hazel, oak and sycamore trees, and mature scrub of hawthorn and elder. It provides habitat for birds such as the wren, greenfinch and spotted flycatcher, and butterflies including <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell,</b> peacock and speckled wood.|$|E
50|$|The ample heaths on {{the eastern}} side of the island provide {{habitats}} for many rare species of plants and animals which are adapted to the extreme conditions such as drought, warmth, wind. About 2,500 animal species and 150 species of plants have so far been recorded. 45% of those plants are on the IUCN Red List. Especially notable are the 600 species of butterflies that live in the heaths, <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell,</b> brimstone, painted lady and peacock butterfly among them.|$|E
50|$|Some typical mammals are roe deer, red deer, wild boar, badger, squirrel, beech marten, and rabbit. There is a {{great variety}} of insects too. Among the most {{attractive}} is the stag beetle, and, in the open areas, butterflies - swallowtail, admiral, <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell,</b> etc. Under protection are some rare and endangered animal species - 70 avian (common buzzard, goshawk, hawk finch, golden oriole, etc.) and 25 mammal species (including roe deer, wild boar, badger, hedgehog, pine marten, and bats).|$|E
50|$|Resident {{butterflies}} include {{large white}} (Pieris brassicae), small copper (Lycaena phlaeas), common blue (Polyommatus icarus), <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> (Aglais urticae), peacock (Aglais io), comma (Polygonia c-album), small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene), speckled wood (Pararge aegeria), grayling (Hipparchia semele) and wall (Lasiommata megera).

50|$|Delamere Forest {{encompasses}} broadleaved {{and mixed}} woodlands, blocks of coniferous plantation, {{as well as}} grassland and wetland. The area provides a habitat for numerous woodland bird species, including nuthatches, treecreepers, crossbills, siskins, tawny owls and great spotted and green woodpeckers. Dragonflies such as the southern hawker {{can be seen in}} the wetland areas; the nationally scarce white-faced darter has been observed at several sites within the forest, including Black Lake. Butterflies such as the <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> are common in the Old Pale area. Adders have been observed in the woodland, and mammals seen here include badgers, foxes and bats.|$|E
50|$|The <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> {{butterfly}} {{is severely}} affected by droughts. During periods of drought, the butterfly experiences a vastly reduced reproductive rate. The drought directly affects the Urtica leaves; {{the higher the}} nitrogen and water level in the leaves, the more rapid {{the growth of the}} larvae. During a drought, both of these levels drop significantly, leaving the tortoiseshell larvae nothing to feed on. The timing of rainfall is also a crucial factor. If there is not adequate rainfall in the early summer, then the plants {{will not be able to}} fully develop, leaving the larvae without a suitable source of nutrition. These butterflies actively produce smaller broods under these conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Obligate hibernators are {{animals that}} spontaneously, and annually, enter {{hibernation}} regardless of ambient temperature {{and access to}} food. Obligate hibernators include many species of ground squirrels, other rodents, mouse lemurs, the European hedgehog and other insectivores, monotremes, marsupials, and even butterflies such as the <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell.</b> These undergo what has been traditionally called [...] "hibernation": the physiological state where the body temperature drops to near ambient (environmental) temperature, and heart and respiration rates slow drastically. The typical winter season for these hibernators is characterized by periods of torpor interrupted by periodic, euthermic arousals, wherein body temperatures and heart rates are restored to euthermic (more typical) levels. The cause and purpose of these arousals is still not clear.|$|E
5000|$|Males’ {{reproductive}} successes {{are often}} limited by access to mates, whereas females’ reproductive successes {{are more often}} limited by access to resources. Thus, for a given sexual encounter, it will benefit the male to mate but the female to be choosy and resist. [...] For example, male <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> butterfly will compete {{in order to gain}} the best territory to mate. [...] Another example of this conflict {{can be found in the}} Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica. Males of this species are limited in reproduction primarily by access to mates, so they will claim a territory and wait for a female to pass through. Big males are, therefore, more successful in mating because they claim territories near the female nesting sites that are more sought after. Smaller males, on the other hand, will monopolize less competitive sites in foraging areas so that they may mate with reduced conflict.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> {{butterfly}} {{tends to}} enter hibernation by {{mid to late}} September. [...] Typically this butterfly will try to hibernate in dark sheltered locations. Because of this hibernation, they need to accumulate a lot of fat to survive the winter. The tortoiseshell needs at least 20% of its body weight in lipids in order to survive, making them much slower. [...] Towards {{the end of their}} foraging for hibernation, they are much more susceptible to attacks by birds because of their low muscle to body mass ratio. During the first few weeks of hibernation, tortoiseshell butterflies are very susceptible to predator attacks. Up to 50% of the population hibernating in any given area can be eaten. The butterflies that hibernate in areas containing more light, and that are accessible to rodents who can climb, are the most susceptible to this type of predation. [...] During hibernation tortoiseshell butterflies are able to supercool in order to keep from freezing. In sheltered areas, these butterflies can stand up to -21 degrees Celsius without freezing. However, they experience rapid weight loss during unusually mild winters.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, Leicestershire County Council {{took over}} clay {{workings}} and coal pits in the Sence Valley between Ravenstone, Ibstock and Heather and later transferred {{them to the}} Forestry Commission, which reclaimed the area as the Sence Valley Forest Park. It contains woodland, lakes linked to the River Sence, grassland and a wild flower meadow. An artificial nesting wall for sand martins has also been constructed alongside Horseshoe Lake. In this varied habitat, 150 species of bird have been recorded. The lakes provide habitat for heron, coot, tufted duck, pochard, wigeon and great-crested grebe. Kestrels nest each year and, though less evident in daytime, there are barn owls and short-eared owls. Raptors, marsh, hen and Montague's harrier, osprey, red-footed falcon, merlin, peregrine and buzzard have all been seen. The bird list for the park currently stands at 101 species. Long grassy areas have become home for many wild mammals including field vole, shrew, stoat, rabbit and fox. Water voles are present on streams feeding the river. Otters too are once again using the river. Among the species of bats are pipistrelle, Daubenton's bat and noctule. Insects in summer include gatekeeper butterfly, meadow brown, speckled wood, small skipper, green-veined white, peacock butterfly and <b>small</b> <b>tortoiseshell.</b> Around the lakes, damselflies such as common blue, blue-tailed and azure as well as dragonflies such as the southern hawker and brown hawker are also fairly abundant.|$|E
40|$|Species {{appropriate}} for a post market environmental monitoring (PMEM) should (i) have a small host range to ensure a comprehensive inventory, (ii) be representative and (iii) be common in agrarian landscapes. Rare species seem to be inappropriate (Aviron et al. 2009). We selected the <b>Small</b> <b>Tortoiseshell</b> (_Aglais urticae_) and the Peacock (_Inachis io_) the larvae of which are monophage on the Stinging nettle (_Urtica dioica_). We analysed the suitability of these species for PMEM by mapping patches of _U. dioica_ and populations of the butterflies in two different agrarian regions of Germany during maize anthesis. |$|E
40|$|The first {{mention of}} the {{presence}} of the <b>Small</b> <b>Tortoiseshell,</b> Aglais urticae, in the Maltese islands was by T. B Fletcher in 1904 - 05 who mentions that a specimen was "noticed" by Gervase F. Mathew on March 23 rd 1892. It was also repeatedly mentioned by a number of other authors (as either Aglais or Vanessa urticae) (Bainbridge-Fletcher, 1904, 1905; Caruana-Gatto, 1925; P. Borg, 1932; 1. Borg, 1939; De Lucca, 1950 and Sammut 2000)) but considerable doubt was cast on the validity of A. urticae records, so much so that Sammut (2000) regards these as based on probable misidentifications. non peer-reviewe...|$|E
