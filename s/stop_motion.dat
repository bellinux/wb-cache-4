5|$|NORAD's {{tracking}} of Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve, for example, was initiated in 1955 {{and has become}} an annual tradition. The <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animated film, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer remains an annual telecast on American televisionalmost fifty years after its debut, and Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! of 1957 has become a literary Christmas classic.|$|E
5|$|On December 6, 1964, NBC aired Rudolph the Redâ€“Nosed Reindeer, a <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> {{animated}} special {{produced by}} Rankin/Bass. The special {{was based on}} a 1949 song by Johnny Marks, which was based in turn on a 1939 poem by Robert L. May. The program has aired every year since 1964, making it the longest-running Christmas television special.|$|E
5|$|The reptilian alien {{creatures in}} the film were works of <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> {{animation}} by animator David W. Allen, marking the first chapter in a decades-long history of collaboration between Allen and Band. The alien spacecraft model featured in Laserblast was designed and built by Greg Jein in two weeks, and the musical score was written in five days by Joel Goldsmith and Richard Band, the first film score for both composers.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{released}} Ratatouille on high-definition Blu-ray Disc and DVD in North America on November 6, 2007. A new animated {{short film}} featuring Remy and Emile entitled Your Friend the Rat was {{included as a}} special feature, {{in which the two}} rats attempt to entreat the viewer, a human, to welcome rats as their friends, demonstrating the benefits and misconceptions of rats towards humanity through several historical examples. The eleven-minute short uses 3D animation, 2D animation, live action and even <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation, a first for Pixar.|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired by <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until {{near the end of}} production, and while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.|$|E
5|$|Laserblast has {{received}} overwhelmingly negative reviews and consistently {{ranks among the}} Bottom 100 list of films on the Internet Movie Database. Many critical reviews, however, cited Allen's <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation {{as one of the}} film's only redeeming qualities. A 1988 sequel was planned, but ultimately abandoned due to financial difficulties. Laserblast was featured in the seventh season finale of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000, marking the show's final episode on Comedy Central before the series moved to the Sci-Fi Channel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental and simulation studies that aimed at investigating {{the characteristics of the}} <b>stopping</b> <b>motion</b> of a ship with a single controllable pitch propeller (CPP) and single rudder. In a full-scale experiment, stopping tests were performed to compare the <b>stopping</b> <b>motion</b> between CPP ships and that of fixed pitch propeller (FPP) ships and the turning motion of a CPP ship was found to be less stable than that of a FPP ship, particularly under windy condition. A simulation study was also conducted to investigate the effect of wind on the <b>stopping</b> <b>motion</b> of CPP ships by which it can be proved that CPP ships are forced to turn her head windward and to drift leeward considerably under beam or quarter wind conditions. Based on the results of these full-scale and simulation studies, a method can be proposed to estimate the critical range of stopping maneuver without tug assistance and effective stopping maneuver for berthing and anchoring under windy condition...|$|R

5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites {{what he thinks}} is the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers hired Industrial Light & Magic {{to create}} the Martians using {{computer}} animation after their previous plan to use <b>stop</b> <b>motion,</b> supervised by Barry Purves, fell through because of budget limitations. Mars Attacks! was released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on December 13, 1996 and received mixed reviews from critics. The film grossed approximately $101 million in box office totals, which {{was seen as a}} disappointment. Mars Attacks! was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and earned multiple nominations at the Saturn Awards.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{style of}} {{animation}} {{is inspired by}} the paper cut-out cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans. Construction paper and traditional <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> cutout animation techniques {{were used in the}} original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by computer animation, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of animatics drawn in Toon Boom are provided by the show's storyboard artists.|$|E

5|$|Truckers {{was adapted}} as a <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> {{animation}} series for Thames Television by Cosgrove Hall Films in 1992. Johnny and the Dead {{was made into}} a TV serial for Children's ITV on ITV, in 1995. Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music were adapted as animated cartoon series by Cosgrove Hall for Channel 4 in 1996; illustrated screenplays of these were published in 1998 and 1997 respectively. In January 2006, BBC One aired a three-part adaptation of Johnny and the Bomb.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed {{precursor}} to Kenny {{first appeared in}} the first The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of <b>stop</b> <b>motion.</b> When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.|$|E
5|$|Muren {{found both}} <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Sleepy Hollows 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised {{the human and}} creature effects. Framestore also assisted on digital effects, and The Mill handled motion control photography. In part {{a reaction to the}} computer-generated effects in Mars Attacks!, Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to Sleepy Hollow many of the techniques they had used in <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation on Vincentâ€”such as forced perspective sets.|$|E
5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E

By the second pre-chorus, several passengers play ping pong, as Utada exercises. The second chorus has Utada dancing inside a party, whilst intercut scenes of different <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animations are seen. In the bridge section, it has a close-up of Utada {{in front of a}} forest-like backdrop again, and also has Utada sitting on a swing. The final chorus has the spacecraft falling onto the ground, and creates a vast field of flowers, trees, and grass. The final scene has the camera zooming out of the spacecraft next to a tree, riddled with vines and flowers.

5|$|Macau was {{substituted}} for Shanghai, while cinematographer Douglas Slocombe caught fever from June 24 to July 7 {{and could not}} work. Ford returned on August 8. Despite the problems during filming, Spielberg was able to complete Temple of Doom on schedule and on budget, finishing principal photography on August 26. Various pick-ups took place afterwards. This included Snake River Canyon, in Idaho, Mammoth Mountain, Tuolumne and American River, Yosemite National Park, San Joaquin Valley, Hamilton Air Force Base and Arizona. Producer Frank Marshall directed a second unit in Florida in January 1984, using alligators to double as crocodiles. The mine chase {{was a combination of}} a roller coaster and scale models with dolls doubling for the actors. Minor <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> was also used for the sequence. Visual effects supervisors Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston and a crew at Industrial Light & Magic provided the visual effects work, while Skywalker Sound, headed by Ben Burtt, commissioned the sound design. Burtt recorded Willie Scott's scream and roller coasters at Disneyland Park in Anaheim for the mine cart scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the game's animations were original, with very few borrowed from Grand Theft Auto III. For the characters, the team used motion capture and <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation techniques; cutscenes use the former, while gameplay movements {{use a combination of}} both techniques. The team encountered difficulty in animating motorcycle animations, {{due in part to the}} variety of models. Pedestrian character models use skins in Vice City, allowing the artists to produce more realistic characters. There are 110 unique pedestrian models throughout the game world alongside roughly 50 story characters; each character is rendered using twice the amount of polygons and textures found in Grand Theft Auto III. This also impacted the character physics, improving gameplay aspects such as weapon-hit accuracy. Some character models and scenarios were inspired by films such as The Godfather (1972), and the game's presentation was inspired by action television shows of the 1980s. The interplay between Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of Miami Vices Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|With computer-generated imagery {{looking to}} make up {{so much of the}} commercial, Kleinman {{attempted}} to use film of real elements wherever possible. To this end, 200 mudskippers were brought to the studio from South Africa for the final scene, arriving via Singapore. An entire afternoon was set aside for filming the mudskipper sequence. The footage obtained formed the major part of the final cut of the scene, with only one or two post-production changes: the addition of tail fins and animation of the expression of disgust that closes the piece. <b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> footage of other real elements was taken, including a stage-by-stage blowtorching of plants, used to show flora coming back to life in the reverse sequence, and shots of baking bread, used to model the geological changes to background rock formations. Additional real elements were to have been incorporated into the commercial, mostly from stock footage of several animal species, but only short segments of apes and lizards appeared in the final cut.|$|E
