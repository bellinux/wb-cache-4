50|$|Criticisms of {{the model}} have been {{that it is hard}} to park due to its large turning circle and low seating position, which mean that the end of the bonnet and corners are outside the driver's line of <b>sight.</b> The <b>doors</b> are very long and need plenty of space in a car park.|$|R

60|$|One bright {{summer day}} Johnny Chuck was {{out looking for}} a good breakfast of nice tender clover. He had wandered quite a long way from his snug little house in the long meadow grass, {{although}} his mother had told him never to go out of <b>sight</b> of the <b>door.</b> But Johnny was like some little boys I know, and forgot all he had been told.|$|R
60|$|My red neighbors {{interested}} me. The {{whole problem}} {{of their future}} was being worked out almost within <b>sight</b> of my <b>door.</b> Here {{the men of the}} Polished Stone Age and the men of gasoline engines and electrical telephones met and mingled in a daily adjustment which offered material of surpassing value to the novelist who could use it. Humor and pathos, tragic bitterness and religious exaltation were all within reach of my hand.|$|R
5000|$|The Irish {{who arrived}} during the famine years {{were among the}} poorest and least welcome {{immigrants}} in Boston. In 1850, a group of African Americans living on Elm Street signed a petition to keep the Irish out of their neighborhood. Advertisements for domestic servants often stipulated [...] "a Protestant woman", implying that an Irish Protestant would be acceptable; others specifically warned, [...] "no Irish need apply". NINA signs were a common <b>sight</b> on workshop <b>doors</b> and factory gates in Boston.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} go into my mother's room: my heart swelled when I passed Within <b>sight</b> of the <b>door.</b> Her {{portrait}} hung in the parlor, just over {{the place where she}} used to sit. As I cast my eyes on it I thought it looked at me with tenderness, and I burst into tears. My heart had long been seared by living in public schools, and buffeting about among strangers who cared nothing for me; but the recollection of a mother's tenderness was overcoming.|$|R
60|$|As {{his memory}} of that childish {{experience}} ran, he did at the very first <b>sight</b> of that <b>door</b> experience a peculiar emotion, an attraction, a desire {{to get to the}} door and open it and walk in. And {{at the same time he}} had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of him-- he could not tell which--to yield to this attraction. He insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginning--unless memory has played him the queerest trick--that the door was unfastened, and that he could go in as he chose.|$|R
50|$|Rush later {{described}} {{some early}} cases: On August 7, he treated {{a young man}} for headaches, fever and vomiting, and on the 15th treated his brother. On the same day a woman he was treating turned yellow. On the 18th {{a man in the}} third day of a fever had no pulse, was cold, clammy, and yellow, but he could sit up in his bed. He died a few hours later. On the 19th a woman Rush visited died within hours. Another physician said five persons within <b>sight</b> of her <b>door</b> died. None of those victims was a recent immigrant.|$|R

You turn down the first staircase you come to, follow it to the bottom, then take the corridor to the right and go on until you come to an open door. Two soldiers will be standing there on sentry, but they ask no questions of the warders. You had better wait when you get in <b>sight</b> of the <b>door</b> till you see that no one else is going out, or it might be noticed that you were a stranger and questions might be asked you. Now you had better lose no time, or the others may be out before you get there, and the door be shut.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The Big Bad Wolf {{has been}} a {{recurring}} character in Disney's House of Mouse, where he is voiced by Jim Cummings. His first appearance on this show featured him as a jazz artist called [...] "Big Bad Wolf Daddy" [...] (a parody of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy), performing a swing version of his song with the Pigs as his backup band (they are under a contract that states he will eat them {{if they do not}} play for him). In this episode, his tendency to destroy houses by exhaling is shown to be an allergy-like reaction to the <b>sight</b> of a <b>door.</b> Later appearances on House of Mouse, however, returned the Wolf to his more traditional role; one episode even featured a newly made short starring the character, based on the aforementioned Li'l Bad Wolf comic stories.|$|R

With it there has come a sense as though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world. I {{began to think of}} it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that I should never see that door again. Perhaps I was suffering a little from overwork--perhaps it was what I've heard spoken of as the feeling of forty. I don't know. But certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently, and that just at a time--with all these new political developments--when I ought to be working. Odd, isn't it? But I do begin to find life toilsome, its rewards, as I come near them, cheap. I began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly. Yes--and I've seen it three times." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{river or}} estuary, in <b>sight</b> of the <b>doors</b> and {{windows of the}} village, was haunted every day by numbers of gulls and curlews. These last {{numbered}} about {{one hundred and fifty}} birds, and were always there except at full tide, when they would fly away to the fields and moors. Of all my bird neighbours I think that these gave me most pleasure, especially at night, when lying awake I would listen by the hour to the perpetual curlew conversation going on in the dark--an endless series of clear modulated notes and trills, with a beautiful expression of wildness and freedom, a reminder of lonely seashores and mountains and moorlands in the north country. What wonder that Stevenson, sick in his tropical island--sick for his cold grey home so many thousands of miles away, wished once more to hear the whaup crying over the graves of his forefathers, and to hear no more at all! ...|$|R

"Well, once by my 'magic,' {{of which}} you have heard so much, I {{got the better of}} this man against his will and judgment, and, because of that soft heart of mine, I let him go; yes, I let the rare fish go when he was on my hook. It is well that I should have let him go, since, had I kept him, a fine story would have been spoiled and I should have become nothing but a white hunter's servant, to be thrust away behind the door when the white Inkosikazi came to eat his meat--I, Mameena, who never loved to stand out of <b>sight</b> behind a <b>door.</b> Well, when he was at my feet and I spared him, he made me a promise, a very small promise, which yet I think he will keep now when we part for a little while. Macumazahn, did you not promise to kiss me once more upon the lips {{whenever}} and wherever I should ask you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As he went on, talking wildly to himself, {{he passed}} the Union Workhouse. Opposite the gate, under the lee of a wall, some twenty men, women, and children, were huddled {{together}} on the bare ground. [...] They had been refused lodging in the workhouse, {{and were going to}} pass the night in that situation. As he came up to them, coarse jests, and snatches of low drinking-songs, ghastly as the laughter of lost spirits in the pit, mingled with the feeble wailings of some child of shame. The vicar recollected how he had seen the same <b>sight</b> at the <b>door</b> of Kensington Workhouse, walking home one night in company with Luke Smith; and how, too, he had commented to him on that fearful sign of the times, and had somewhat unfairly drawn a contrast between the niggard cruelty of 'popular Protestantism,' and the fancied 'liberality of the middle age.' What wonder if his pupil had taken him at his word? ...|$|R
60|$|As to Schomberg, he {{kept out}} of the way. He {{remained}} in the billiard-room, serving out drinks to the unspeakable Pedro with an air of not seeing the growling monster, of not knowing where the drinks went, of ignoring that there was {{such a thing as a}} music-room over there under the trees within fifty yards of the hotel. He submitted himself to the situation with a low-spirited stoicism compounded of fear and resignation. Directly the party had broken up, (he could see dark shapes of the men drifting singly and in knots through the gate of the compound), he would withdraw out of <b>sight</b> behind a <b>door</b> not quite closed, in order to avoid meeting his two extraordinary guests; but he would watch through the crack their contrasted forms pass through the billiard-room and disappear on their way to bed. Then he would hear doors being slammed upstairs; and a profound silence would fall upon the whole house, upon his hotel appropriated, haunted by those insolently outspoken men provided with a whole armoury of weapons in their trunks. A profound silence. Schomberg sometimes could not resist the notion that he must be dreaming. Shuddering, he would pull himself together, and creep out, with movements strangely inappropriate to the Lieutenant-of-the-Reserve bearing by which he tried to keep up his self-respect before the world.|$|R
5000|$|The 90-minute {{film was}} a horror story {{shot in a}} {{documentary}} style and appeared as part of BBC Drama's Screen One series. It involved BBC reporters performing a live, on-air investigation of a house in Northolt, Greater London, at which poltergeist activity {{was believed to be}} taking place. Through revealing footage and interviews with neighbours and the family living there, they discover the existence of a malevolent ghost nicknamed Pipes (the children in the house had asked their mother about noises heard, and she said it was the pipes, hence the name). As the programme proceeds, viewers learn that Pipes is the spirit of a psychologically disturbed man called Raymond Tunstall, himself believed to have been troubled by the spirit of Mother Seddons - a [...] "baby farmer" [...] turned child killer from the 19th century (probably inspired by Amelia Dyer). In the course of the programme Pipes makes various manifestations which become more bold and terrifying, until, at the end, the frightened reporters realise that the programme itself has been acting as a sort of [...] "national séance" [...] through which Pipes was gaining horrific power. Finally, the spirit unleashes its power to the fullest extent, dragging host Sarah Greene out of <b>sight</b> behind a <b>door</b> and then escaping to express poltergeist activity throughout the country. He takes control of the BBC studios and transmitter network, using the Ghostwatch studio as a focal point and possessing Michael Parkinson in the process.|$|R
60|$|When I {{left him}} there {{to go back}} to my room the steward was {{finishing}} dusting. I sent for the mate and engaged him in some insignificant conversation. It was, as it were, trifling with the terrific character of his whiskers; but my object was to give him an opportunity for a good look at my cabin. And then I could at last shut, with a clear conscience, the door of my stateroom and get my double back into the recessed part. There was nothing else for it. He had to sit still on a small folding stool, half smothered by the heavy coats hanging there. We listened to the steward going into the bath-room out of the saloon, filling the water-bottles there, scrubbing the bath, setting things to rights, whisk, bang, clatter--out again into the saloon--turn the key-- click. Such was my scheme for keeping my second self invisible. Nothing better could be contrived under the circumstances. And there we sat; I at my writing-desk ready to appear busy with some papers, he behind me, out of <b>sight</b> of the <b>door.</b> It would not have been prudent to talk in daytime; and I could not have stood the excitement of that queer sense of whispering to myself. Now and then glancing over my shoulder, I saw him far back there, sitting rigidly on the low stool, his bare feet close together, his arms folded, his head hanging on his breast--and perfectly still. Anybody would have taken him for me.|$|R
6000|$|At present, really, {{the light}} {{he had set}} down on the mantel of the next room would have to figure his sword; which utensil, {{in the course of}} a minute, he had taken the {{requisite}} number of steps to possess himself of. The door between the rooms was open, and from the second another door opened to a third. These rooms, as he remembered, gave all three upon a common corridor as well, but there was a fourth, beyond them, without issue save through the preceding. To have moved, to have heard his step again, was appreciably a help; though even in recognising this he lingered once more a little by the chimney-piece on which his light had rested. When he next moved, just hesitating where to turn, he found himself considering a circumstance that, after his first and comparatively vague apprehension of it, produced in him the start that often attends some pang of recollection, the violent shock of having ceased happily to forget. He had come into <b>sight</b> of the <b>door</b> in which the brief chain of communication ended and which he now surveyed from the nearer threshold, the one not directly facing it. Placed at some distance to the left of this point, it would have admitted him to the last room of the four, the room without other approach or egress, had it not, to his intimate conviction, been closed since his former visitation, the matter probably of a quarter of an hour before. He stared with all his eyes at the wonder of the fact, arrested again where he stood and again holding his breath while he sounded his sense. Surely it had been subsequently closed--that is it had been on his previous passage indubitably open! ...|$|R

Ascending by its steps the Mastabah subtending half the Eastern wall, Shaykh Hamid placed me so as to front the tomb. There standing in the burning sun, we repeated the following prayer: [...] "Peace be upon Thee, O our Lord Hamzah! O Paternal Uncle of Allah's Apostle! O Paternal Uncle of Allah's Prophet! Peace be upon Thee, O Paternal Uncle of Mustafa! Peace be upon Thee, O Prince of the Martyrs! O Prince of the Happy! Peace be upon Thee, O Lion of Allah! O Lion of His Prophet!" [...] After which, we asked Hamzah and his companions to lend us their aid in obtaining for us and ours pardon, worldly prosperity and future happiness. Scarcely had we finished, when, mounted on a high-trotting dromedary, appeared the emissary of Mohammed Kalifah, descendant of Al-Abbas, who keeps the key of the Mosque, and who receives the fees and donations of the devout. It was to be opened for the Turkish pilgrims. I waited to see the interior. The Arab drew forth from his pouch, with abundant solemnity, a bunch of curiously made keys, and sharply directed me to stand away from and out of <b>sight</b> of the <b>door.</b> When I obeyed, grumblingly, he began to rattle the locks, and to snap the padlocks, opening them slowly, shaking them, and making as much noise as possible. The reason of the precaution-it sounded like poetry if not sense-is this. It is believed that the souls of martyrs, leaving the habitations of their senseless clay, [FN#19] are fond of sitting together in spiritual ...|$|R
