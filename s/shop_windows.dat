5|$|Elections {{were held}} in May 1963, pitting Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the Akamba People's Party, and various {{independent}} candidates; the former were victorious with 83 seats out of 124. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta {{was sworn in as}} prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. He was the country's first Prime Minister to come from its indigenous population. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the Prime Minister, with exile as a punishment. Kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi's Delaware Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country's National Assembly. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in <b>shop</b> <b>windows,</b> and a likeness of his face was also printed on the new currency. In 1964, Oxford University Press published a collection of Kenyatta's speeches under the title of Harambee!.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of <b>shop</b> <b>windows</b> from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
25|$|Biba never {{exhibited}} {{anything in}} <b>shop</b> <b>windows,</b> believing instead {{that people would}} be intrigued and seduced to enter the shop by their captivating store interior seen from outside. It was not unusual for 30,000 people {{to pass through the}} doors on a Saturday. There was a BIBA store in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1973-75.|$|E
25|$|Gillray's {{plates were}} exposed in Humphrey's <b>shop</b> <b>window,</b> where eager crowds {{examined}} them.

In the <b>shop</b> <b>window</b> {{a number of}} Gillray's previously published prints, such as Tiddy-Doll the Great French Gingerbread Maker, Drawing Out a New Batch of Kings; His Man, Talley Mixing up the Dough, a satire on Napoleon's king-making proclivities, are shown in the <b>shop</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R

25|$|The late 1940s {{also saw}} a {{continuation}} of the group's disruptive surrealist activities across the city, with Morris's unexplained abandonment of a giant elephant skull on a Broad Street provoking a perplexed response from the police and press alike, and the city council strongly resisting Maddox's repeated attempts to stage a series of violent scenes involving nuns in city centre <b>shop</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1819 {{a series}} of anti-Jewish riots in Germany spread to several {{neighboring}} countries including Denmark, resulting in mob attacks on Jews in Copenhagen and many provincial towns. These riots were known as Hep! Hep! Riots, from the derogatory rallying cry against the Jews in Germany. Riots lasted for five months during which time <b>shop</b> <b>windows</b> were smashed, stores looted, homes attacked, and Jews physically abused.|$|E

25|$|Ueto's {{breakthrough}} {{came when}} she was cast {{as a high school}} student suffering from gender dysphoria, in the sixth season of the long-running TBS drama 3-nen B-gumi Kinpachi-sensei. Her critically acclaimed performance led to several leading roles and endorsements, eventually establishing herself as one of Japan's most recognizable faces. As one of Japan's most ubiquitous celebrities, Ueto constantly appears on billboards, <b>shop</b> <b>windows</b> and train adverts, and has held the annual title of CM Queen five times since 2004.|$|E
25|$|The protests slowly {{became more}} violent, and {{included}} heckling, banging on doors, smashing <b>shop</b> <b>windows,</b> and arson. Emily Davison, a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 Epsom Derby and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation. As many protesters were imprisoned {{and went on}} hunger-strike, the British government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.|$|E
25|$|The model town {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and longest {{established}} model towns in England. It depicts Wimborne at the time the model was made, in the 1950s. It is at 1:10 scale, resulting in the model of the Minster being several feet high. The model <b>shop</b> <b>windows</b> accurately show the goods which the real shops were selling at the time. The exhibition also includes a model railway based on Thomas the Tank Engine, which was opened by Christopher Awdry, and expanded in 2014. Children's story evenings are held at the model village.|$|E

25|$|There are {{numerous}} sealed stairways and exits in the mezzanine, including a sealed passageway from the Bond Street exit to Livingston Street one block north, {{which had a}} direct entrance to the former Loeser's Department Store. Part of the mezzanine tilework at this location still features navy blue and gold Art Deco designs, including large plaques bearing the store's logo. These had previously been <b>shop</b> <b>windows.</b> A control tower {{is located at the}} eastern (railroad south) end of the outer southbound platform, and is staffed at all times except late nights.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{witnesses}} reported {{groups of}} armed men on St Patrick's Street, the city's main shopping area. Some were uniformed or partially uniformed {{members of the}} Auxiliaries and British Army while others wore no uniforms. They were seen firing into the air, smashing <b>shop</b> <b>windows</b> and setting buildings alight. Many reported hearing bombs exploding. A group of Auxiliaries were seen throwing a bomb into {{the ground floor of}} the Munster Arcade, which housed both shops and flats. It exploded under the residential quarters while people were inside the building. They managed to escape unharmed but were detained by the Auxiliaries.|$|E
25|$|Estonia's {{authorities}} {{report that}} the violence started around 9:20 p.m. (EEST, UTC+3), as the protesters started to assault the policemen. Riot police responded by using water cannon and, according to BBC, firing tear gas to disperse the crowd. However, the crowd did not disperse and started committing acts of vandalism and rampant looting of nearby shops and buildings. By midnight the riots had spread around the centre of Tallinn, with massive damage to property—a total number of 99 cases of vandalism, including cars that had been turned upside down, broken and looted <b>shop</b> <b>windows,</b> pillaged bars and kiosks.|$|E

25|$|Waves {{of popular}} {{violence}} accompanied liberation in November and December 1918 {{and the government}} responded through the judicial punishment of collaboration with the enemy conducted between 1919 and 1921. <b>Shop</b> <b>windows</b> were broken and houses sacked, men were harassed, and women's heads were shaved. Manufacturers who had closed their businesses sought the severe repression {{of those who had}} pursued their activities. Journalists who had boycotted and stopped writing called for harsh treatment of the newspapers that submitted to German censorship. Many people stigmatized profiteers and demanded justice. Thus in 1918, Belgium was already confronted with the problems associated with occupation that most European countries only discovered at the end of World War II.|$|E
25|$|In early March 1912, {{along with}} over 100 others Allan {{participated in a}} window smashing protest in central London. The women {{secreted}} large stones and hammers under their skirts and, once in position, in a coordinated action they destroyed <b>shop</b> <b>windows</b> in Regent Street, Oxford Street, and the vicinity. Following this, the women patiently and calmly waited {{for the police to}} arrive. While police attention was diverted elsewhere by the protests, Emmeline Pankhurst and three others managed to get close enough to 10 Downing Street to throw stones through four of its windows. In the aftermath, along with many of her associates Allan was arrested, tried, and sentenced to four months in Holloway Prison.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows are}} mullioned and transomed, with {{originally}} {{eight or ten}} lights. The mullions and transoms are in wood and have ovolo mouldings with narrow fillets. Two eight-light windows are believed to date from the 17th century. The High Street bays have modern <b>shop</b> <b>windows</b> to the ground floor. The visible beams are ovolo moulded and feature brattishing, a form of decorative cresting. There is a slate roof, although like the other rebuilt merchants' houses on the High Street, number 46 probably originally had a tiled rather than thatched roof, a sign of wealth that was also an effective protection against the fires that destroyed parts of Hospital Street and Welsh Row in the 17th century. The timber frame uses soffit tenons with diminished haunch, a particularly high-quality type of carpentry joint invented early in the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 July, groups of British policemen and {{soldiers}} went on the rampage in Tel Aviv, breaking the windows of shops and buses, overturning cars, stealing a taxi and assaulting members of the Jewish community. Groups of young Jews then {{took to the streets}} and started stoning police foot patrols, which were then withdrawn from the city. On learning of the stonings, without waiting for orders, members of mobile police units temporarily based at the Citrus House security compound drove into Tel Aviv in six armoured vehicles. These policemen opened fire on two buses, killing one Jew and injuring three others on the first bus and killing three more Jews on the second. Policemen also beat passersby, smashed <b>shop</b> <b>windows,</b> and raided two cafés, detonating a grenade in one of them. In one café, they attempted to abduct a Jew, and were beaten back by the patrons. Five Jews were killed and 15 injured. The dead were identified as Tova Harson, Victor Yedidia Mizrahi, Ze'ev Noviakovsky, Kalman Reich, and Yosef Azpai.|$|E
25|$|On 15 October 2011, about 200,000 people {{gathered}} in Rome to protest against economic inequality {{and the influence}} of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on government. Many other protests occurred in other Italian cities the same day. In Rome masked and hooded militants wearing makeshift body armor, in black bloc fashion, participated in the protests centered in St John Lateran square and committed numerous violent acts, throwing Molotov cocktails and other homemade explosives, burning and blowing up cars, burning buildings, and smashing up property such as ATMs and <b>shop</b> <b>windows.</b> The Roman Catholic church Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano received extensive damage, including a statue of the Virgin Mary being thrown into the street and destroyed. Several unexploded petrol bombs were reportedly found on several streets by Italian police. Over 1,000,000 euros of damage (equivalent to over 1.3 million dollars) was recorded. At least 135 people were injured in the resulting clashes, including 105 police officers, several of whom were left in critical condition, and two news crews from Sky Italia. Two protesters had their fingers amputated by exploding smoke bombs. Almost 20 people have been arrested in connection with the violence. After the 15 October demonstration, people occupied the Santa Croce in Gerusalemme square and started camping as in other cities worldwide. The name of this Rome's group, related to international Occupy movement, is Accampata Roma.|$|E
