40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analytical}} description of depreciation methods applied to firm’s equipments for corporate accounting and balance sheet. Depreciation is a systematic allocation of fixed asset cost over its useful life. Several methods are applied to estimate depreciation cost: Straight-Line Method, Sum of Years Digits Method, Declining Balance Method, Declining Balance Method switched to Straight-Line Method, Interest Methods (<b>Sinking</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Method</b> and Annuity Method), Usage Methods (Machine Hours Method and Production Units Method), Depletion Method. Each of these depreciation methods have been examined in detail, concluding this work with an analytical and critical comparison between them...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> <b>method</b> {{is a way}} {{to repay}} a loan where the {{borrower}} pays the amount of interest accrued by the principal {{at the end of each}} time period and puts a certain amount in a sinking fund in order to repay the principal at the end of the loan. Usually, we assume that the interest rate on the sinking fund is the same during the entire time of the loan. In the study, we will depart from the usual assumptions and will look at different scenarios, including when changes of the interest rate on the sinking fund follows a normal distribution, a uniform distribution and ARIMA processes...|$|E
40|$|EVA (economic value added) is a {{residual}} income measure that subtracts the capital charge from the net operating {{profit after tax}} (NOPAT). The most important advantage of EVA {{is that it is}} the only performance measure to tie directly to the intrinsic market value of a company. EVA is the one measure that properly accounts for all the complex trade-offs involved in creating value. The characteristics of EVA accounting are that it is a historical cost accounting with earning power, its income concept is a realized income with earning power but a future oriented income, and it belongs to the enterprise theory in the entity theory. The problems of EVA accounting are that the traditional depreciation method may be used and it has a short-term characteristic. The solution of the problems are that we should use the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> <b>method</b> and use a change or improvement of EVA as the performance valuation indicator...|$|E
50|$|In modern finance, a <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> is a <b>method</b> {{by which}} an {{organization}} sets aside money {{over time to}} retire its indebtedness.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of corporate bonds contain a <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> provision. The wide use of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> has prompted both theoretical and empirical investigations. However, none has provided a satisfactory explanation {{for the existence of}} a <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> provision. The signalling implications of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> is examined, and it is shown that, under information asymmetry, the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> amortization rate provides a credible signal for the quality of the firm. In a separating equilibrium, better quality firms choose higher <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> amortization rates in their bond issues. A latent index model is proposed for testing the hypothesis of <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> signalling. The empirical evidence indicates that the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> amortization rate signals the credit quality of the firm...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{comparative}} analysis of Smith’s and Ricardo’s {{views on the}} <b>sinking</b> <b>fund.</b> It shows that Smith and Ricardo agreed in stressing the ineffectiveness of the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> as a policy instrument targeted at public debt repayment and tax-burden relief, pointing out that its actual workings had paradoxically helped to increase rather than reduce British total debt-load. Moreover, their explanation of the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> paradox integrates a defective fiscal commitment technology with powerful politicians’ incentives to siphon off the money stored in the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> to meet sudden increases of public expenditure whenever the occasion arose...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} that <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> foster {{corporate}} governance, either when {{they intend to}} build up the principal of bonds and financial hybrids to be repaid at maturity date, or to plan ahead the purchase of fixed assets in the future. To lay foundations, firstly we expand on the logic of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds,</b> by reviewing the standard model of capital formation. Proven drawbacks of this model, however, pave the way for our proposal of undertaking a portfolio management approach for which we furnish an iterative resetting program that deals with unavoidable imbalances of the underlying portfolio. Secondly, we develop the pragmatics of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds,</b> which focus on the choice problem attached to <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> and the fiduciary role expected from an appointed portfolio manager. Lastly, we move on to a protocol with suitable covenants to be embedded in a bond placement, so as to enhance the governance of those organizations that dare to avail themselves of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds.</b> <b>sinking</b> <b>fund,</b> corporate governance, bonds placement, financial hybrids, fixed assets, capital formation, portfolio management. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sinking</b> <b>funds</b> 2 {{can offer}} major {{benefits}} to property owners including reducing possible special levies from building lot owners. These funds are important {{building blocks for}} good asset management ownership, practices and systems. Currently these funds are frequently being either misrepresented or inadequately used. This presentation demonstrates the critical importance of using <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> correctly and the dangers of misuse or not using them at all. This paper {{is not intended to}} be an academic study, and instead is an open discussion from a practicing facilities manager working in the property sector. Based on literature review and selected industry professional and key stakeholder interviews, this paper considers: 1. The progress that has already been made in improving the adaption of reserve and <b>sinking</b> <b>funds.</b> 2. The current challenges for reserve and <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> and the potential impact of these for property owners and the wider community. 3. The challenges that need to be overcome to ensure <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> will perform as originally intended for buildings with multiple ownership. The outcomes {{of this paper is to}} raise the awareness of <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> problems and promote discussion on how to resolve them...|$|R
40|$|A <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> {{provision}} typically obligates {{the firm}} to amortize {{a portion of the}} debt issue prior to maturity. A sample of 169 new industrial debt issues was used to examine whether firms with certain characteristics related to agency problems tend to incorporate a <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> provision in the bond indenture. Sets of debt-issue and issuer-related variables were constructed to characterize firms with agency problems. Empirical results from both logistic and linear regression models show that leverage ratio, profit ratio, time to maturity, dividend payout ratio, and the life of assets are important factors affecting the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> decision of industrial firms. In general, firms with a high growth rate, high debt and dividend payout ratios, and a low profit ratio are inclined to adopt the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> covenant. Also, the longer the maturity of debts and the shorter the life of the assets supporting these debts, the higher is the probability that a <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> provision will be included in the bond indenture...|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the historiography of {{defining}} amortization {{as the source of}} further reproduction and creation due to the amortization of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds,</b> used by economic entities for future capital investments. Acting as the source of capital investments, <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> were established during the socialist era, {{as well as in the}} post-Soviet period, that is before the beginning of the 21 st century. However, starting from 2010, economic entities no longer have been creating <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> on the balance sheet and outside it, that corresponds to the international practice, in particular the rules and principles of International Financial Reporting Standards. The author proves that the amortization, recoverable in the price of goods (works, services), is the reimbursement of the past, not future expenditures. Accordingly, the <b>sinking</b> <b>funds,</b> as the source of future investments, cannot be made at the expenses of amortization charges. At the same time, the author analyzes the possible consequences of the legal right of enterprises to unchanged amortization installments in the reporting period with the extension of the life of depreciable fixed assets for the period when no amortization charges were calculated...|$|R
