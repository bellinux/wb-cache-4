5|$|A {{consequence}} of this design is that the m-derived half <b>section</b> <b>will</b> match a k-type section on one side only. Also, an m-type section of one value of m will not match another m-type section of another value of m except on the sides which offer the Zi of the k-type.|$|E
5|$|Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The {{original}} ball {{of cells}} develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance {{to this is}} known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior <b>section</b> <b>will</b> become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of {{construction}} is being undertaken {{as part of the}} NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's northern <b>section</b> <b>will</b> be grade separated, and a dual carriageway will be constructed from the Northern end of Tonkin Highway near Reid Highway, past Ellenbrook and through the Swan Valley to an interchange with Great Northern Highway and a new part of Brand Highway, with the extension continuing on as Great Northern Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. The project is funded by both the state and federal governments. Construction began in June 2017, and is scheduled to finish mid 2019.|$|E

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type <b>section</b> <b>will</b> have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|While {{the largely}} {{underground}} southern <b>section</b> <b>will</b> reach Ny Ellebjerg station from The Central Station by 2023. South of the Central Station will four new stations be built before the line terminus at Ny Ellebjerg. Three {{of these four}} stations will pass through the southern parts of Copenhagen's harbour. The northern terminus will presumably be moved farther and farther out at the peninsula, which constitutes {{a large part of}} Copenhagen's northern harbour part, as the city aims to rebuild typical harbour buildings with housing. However the political decisions on the M4 topic, so far only deals with a line with a total of 13 stations between Orientkaj and Ny Ellebjerg. In the end of 2019 will there be 4 Metro lines and 39 stations within the Copenhagen Metro system. And by 2023 will the Metro still comprises 4 lines, but 44 stations will be served instead of 39. Of the 44 stations in 2023, will 8 stations serve both Metro as well as S-train.|$|E
