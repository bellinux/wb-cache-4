40|$|PURPOSE: Retrieving {{sufficient}} {{relevant information}} online {{is difficult for}} many people because they use too few keywords to search and search engines do not provide many <b>support</b> <b>tools.</b> To further complicate the search, users often ignore <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> when available. Our goal is to evaluate in a realistic setting when users use <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> and how they perceive these tools. METHODS: We compared three medical search engines with <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> that require more or less effort from users to form a query and evaluate results. We carried out an end user study with 23 users who were asked to find information, i. e., subtopics and supporting abstracts, for a given theme. We used a balanced within-subjects design and report on the effectiveness, efficiency and usability of the <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> from the end user perspective. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant differences in efficiency but did not find significant differences in effectiveness between the three search engines. Dynamic user <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> requiring less effort led to higher efficiency. Fewer searches were needed and more documents were found per search when both query reformulation and result review tools dynamically adjust to the user query. The query reformulation tool that provided {{a long list of}} keywords, dynamically adjusted to the user query, was used most often and led to more subtopics. As hypothesized, the dynamic result review tools were used more often and led to more subtopics than static ones. These results were corroborated by the usability questionnaires, which showed that <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> that dynamically optimize output were preferred...|$|R

40|$|Local {{risks of}} climate change are {{predicted}} to intensify in the Netherlands. Therefore, national ambitions are set to become more resilient by adapting to climate change, for which municipalities are recognized as important actors. However, many municipalities encounter barriers that prevent them from working (further) on adaptation planning. Through the online knowledge platform spatial adaptation (KRA), tools are offered to support municipalities in their endeavors. The aim {{of this research is}} to provide recommendations for improving the suitability of the KRA <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> for addressing the main perceived barriers to Dutch municipal climate adaptation. This is done by prioritizing the perceived barriers (84 interviews), identifying the assumptions underlying the KRA <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> (1 interview + document analysis) and evaluating to what extent the available <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> are suitable for addressing these main barriers. Suitability is assessed based on two indicators: the match between the goals of the KRA <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> and the main barriers (reconstruction of policy theory), and the use and perception of the suitability of <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> by municipalities (interviews). The following central research question is formulated to guide the analysis: To what extent are KRA <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> suitable for addressing the main barriers to adaptation planning for Dutch municipalities? The main perceived barriers are a lack of urgency, a lack of knowledge of risks and measures, and limited capacity. A lack of urgency is considered the most significant barrier to adaptation planning. The goals of the KRA <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> match the main perceived barriers by municipalities. However, {{the extent to which the}} tools can help overcome these barriers is often limited. Tools for risk assessment are suitable for less-advanced municipalities that are taking initial steps towards adaptation planning. These tools can help increase a sense of urgency and develop knowledge of local risks and vulnerabilities. However, the tools are less suitable for more advanced municipalities, as addressing their barriers requires context-specific data, and knowledge of under-addressed risks and challenges, which the KRA <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> currently are not able to provide...|$|R

40|$|Objective Decision <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> are {{increasingly}} using audio-visual materials. However, disagreement exists {{about the use}} of audio-visual materials as they may be subjective and biased. Methods This is a literature review of the major texts for documentary film studies to extrapolate issues of objectivity and bias from film to decision <b>support</b> <b>tools.</b> Results The key features of documentary films are that they attempt to portray real events and that the attempted reality is always filtered through the lens of the filmmaker. The same key features can be said of decision <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> that use audio-visual materials. Three concerns arising from documentary film studies as they apply to the use of audio-visual materials in decision <b>support</b> <b>tools</b> include whose perspective matters (stakeholder bias), how to choose among audio-visual materials (selection bias) and how to ensure objectivity (editorial bias). Discussion Decision science needs to start a debate about how audio-visual materials are to be used in decision <b>support</b> <b>tools.</b> Simply because audio-visual materials may be subjective and open to bias {{does not mean that we}} should not use them. Conclusion Methods need to be found to ensure consensus around balance and editorial control, such that audio-visual materials can be used...|$|R
