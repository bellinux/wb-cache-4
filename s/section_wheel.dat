40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive wheel model that can quantitatively evaluate traction performance of ﬂexible/rigid wheelsdriving on deformable terrain. The proposed model exploits a terramechanics-based approach with taking account of pressures generated by wheel elasticity {{as well as}} terrain stiffness. Deﬂection of a ﬂexible wheel typically depends on a relative pressure between thewheel and terrain: the wheel will be signiﬁcantly deformed on rigid terrain whereas it will be hardly deformed on soft terrain. Therefore, the wheel-terrain interaction in the proposed model {{is divided into three}} contact sections: wheel front <b>section,</b> <b>wheel</b> deﬂected(ﬂat) section, and wheel rear section. The traction force of the wheel is obtained as an integral of normal and shear stresses generatedat each section. Simulation studies with varied wheel pressures, such as ﬂexible, semi-ﬂexible, and rigid wheels, are conducted tovalidate the proposed model. Also, traction performances of ﬂexible/rigid wheels are compared based on a metric called tractiveefﬁciency. The comparison implies an optimal wheel pressure of ﬂexible wheel for better traction performance...|$|E

2500|$|The E.115 {{appeared}} in 1937 with significant {{changes to the}} wing. The span was only slightly reduced (by 200mm or 7.9in) but continuous taper reduced the area by 20%. The ailerons were fabric covered. It could be powered by either the Praga B or D and was noticeably faster than earlier variants, even with the smaller engine. The E.115 also had a revised undercarriage, with single, streamlined steel struts hinged to the lower fuselage braced by [...] rods to the centre <b>section.</b> The <b>wheels</b> were spatted and the legs sprung with bungee cord inside the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The Astra C was {{initially}} {{designed as a}} single seat biplane, powered by a single 50 hp Renault engine in tractor configuration. It was constructed primarily as wooden framework sections, covered in canvas and wire-braced. The fuselage was of triangular cross <b>section,</b> with a <b>wheeled</b> main undercarriage plus nose skid and tail skid. The wings were of unequal span, and employed wing-warping for roll control.|$|R
50|$|Still at {{this time}} {{considered}} advanced was the car’s monocoque steel bodied construction (without a separate chassis), the rigidity of which was enhanced in 1959 through the addition of reinforcing box section lengths {{on each side of}} the floor <b>section.</b> The front <b>wheels</b> were independently sprung and the rear suspension followed the usual pattern of the time, combining a rigid rear axle with leaf springing.|$|R
50|$|A magnet {{combined}} with a rear shock absorber forms the folding mechanism. The magnet connects and locks the back <b>wheel</b> <b>section</b> to the frame. To fold the bike in half, the magnet disconnects with one movement and in a second, and without having to use one's hands, the rear wheel rotates forward, and the bike folds vertically. This mechanism also enables one to roll the half-folded bike on its rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{inherited}} from the Stradale was of tubular steel. The fuel tank was lined with rubber. The body was a coupé executed in fibreglass. The low sloping nose between raised <b>sections</b> over the <b>wheels</b> and depth of the windshield would be revisited on the Porsche Tapiro and Maserati Bora, while {{the definition of the}} rear elements will also appear in other cars styled by Giugiaro, notably the Alfetta GT.|$|R
50|$|The Honda CB600F Hornet was {{introduced}} for Europe in 1998, It {{was based on}} the CB250F that was restricted to 250 cc at its home-market (Japan) because of local laws (this bike was released only in Japan from 1996 or 1997 until 2015 when it was succeeded by the CB300F). The bike has a six-speed transmission. Its suspension consists of a single shock in the rear and a conventional telescopic fork in the front until it was succeeded by a upside-down fork in 2005. Its brakes are dual-disc, Nissin twin piston in the front and single-disc, Nissin single piston in the rear. It was given the 16 in diameter front wheel and 17 in, 180 <b>section</b> rear <b>wheel</b> setup from the Fireblade.|$|R
50|$|On April 1, 1835, the <b>section</b> from <b>Wheeling</b> to Cumberland was {{transferred}} to Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (now West Virginia). The last congressional appropriation was made May 25, 1838, and in 1840, Congress voted against completing the unfinished portion of the road, with the deciding vote being cast by Henry Clay. By that time, railroads were proving a better method of long-distance transportation, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was being built west from Baltimore to Cumberland, mostly along the Potomac River, and then by a more direct route than the National Road across the Allegheny Plateau of West Virginia (then Virginia) to Wheeling. Construction of the National Road stopped in 1839. Much of the road through Indiana and Illinois remained unfinished and was later transferred to the states.|$|R

50|$|The stair walker types use a {{long screw}} thread to extend and retract a 'foot' from the {{position}} at which the load is held. The two moving plates allow the item to be stepped down an arbitrary number of steps at any one time. To date the largest weight limit to be lifted by this method is 680 kg (cite). Some models using this approach also employ a third section to allow the load to be manipulated up and down independently of the base and <b>wheel</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} design of 100% low floor {{vehicles}} uses short carbody <b>sections</b> for the <b>wheels</b> and longer suspended sections. Examples {{of this are}} the Citadis and Combino. A similar, but somewhat older technique {{is one that has}} been developed by MAN. In 1990, it was the first 100% low floor tram. These trams are found in ten German cities (such as Bremen and Munich) and in the Swedish city Norrköping. In many other German cities there are trams with low floor between the outer bogies and single axle bogies under the centre section.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of mine workers were slaves, although skilled artisans were needed for building aqueducts and leats {{as well as}} the machinery needed to dewater mines and to crush and separate the ore from barren rock. Reverse overshot water-wheels were used to lift water, and sequences of such wheels have been found in the Spanish mines. A large <b>section</b> of a <b>wheel</b> from Rio Tinto {{can be seen in the}} British Museum, and a smaller fragment of a wheel found at Dolaucothi shows they used similar methods in Britain.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "winglet" [...] was {{previously}} {{used to describe}} an additional lifting surface on an aircraft, e.g., a short <b>section</b> between <b>wheels</b> on fixed undercarriage. Richard Whitcomb's research in the 1970s at NASA first used winglet with its modern meaning referring to near-vertical extension of the wing tips. The upward angle (or cant) of the winglet, its inward or outward angle (or toe), {{as well as its}} size and shape are critical for correct performance and are unique in each application. The wingtip vortex, which rotates around from below the wing, strikes the cambered surface of the winglet, generating a force that angles inward and slightly forward, analogous to a sailboat sailing close hauled. The winglet converts some of the otherwise-wasted energy in the wingtip vortex to an apparent thrust. This small contribution can be worthwhile over the aircraft's lifetime, provided the benefit offsets the cost of installing and maintaining the winglets.|$|R

This assembly was held at three points in [...] "live rubber" [...] with a steadying bearing forward of the flywheel. Suspension was by long semi-elliptic springs at each corner of the car controlled by Luvax shock absorbers combined with a front (anti-roll) torsion bar. The chassis was mounted on large <b>section</b> tyres. Spare <b>wheel</b> and tyre were stowed in a separate compartment below the luggage locker. Permanent hydraulic jacks were built into the chassis. Both springs and frame pass beneath the back axle.|$|R
40|$|Air {{flotation}} {{technology used}} in NASA's Apollo program has found an interesting application in Hawaii's Aloha Stadium near Honolulu. The stadium's configuration can be changed, by moving entire 7, 000 -seat sections on a cushion of air, for best accommodation of spectators and participants at {{different types of}} events. In most stadiums, {{only a few hundred}} seats can be moved, by rolling <b>sections</b> on <b>wheels</b> or rails. At Aloha Stadium, 28, 000 of the 50, 000 seats can be repositioned for better spectator viewing and, additionally, for improved playing conditions. For example, a stadium designed primarily for football may compromise the baseball diamond by providing only a shallow outfield. Aloha's convertibility allows a full-size baseball field as well as optimum configurations for many other types of sports and special events. The photos show examples. The stadium owes its versatility to air flotation technology developed by General Motors. Its first large-scale application was movement of huge segments of the mammoth Saturn V moonbooster during assembly operations at Marshall Space Flight Center...|$|R

5000|$|North Wheeling Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Wheeling, Ohio County, West Virginia. The district encompasses 134 contributing buildings and one contributing object in a 2 1/2-block <b>section</b> of northern <b>Wheeling,</b> known as [...] "Old Town". Most of the district consists of mid- to late-19th-century residential buildings. A number of popular architectural styles are represented, including Greek Revival, Italianate, and Late Victorian. Notable buildings include the Vigilant Engine House (c. 1891), William Goering House (1885), Alfred Paull House (1880s), Williams Duplex Tenement (1880-1884), George W.

30|$|The {{average in}} service {{deceleration}} achieved with manual driving during braking of the Metrocars has been measured at 0.5  m/s 2 by previous work, {{well below the}} full service braking figure of around 1.3  m/s 2 [43]. For ATO, the London Underground Central Line {{can be used as}} a point of comparison. This uses a target deceleration of 0.75  m/s 2 when running above ground and 1.15  m/s 2 in underground sections. The full service maximum here is also around 1.3  m/s 2, and this provides an illustration of the differences in deceleration levels for manual driving and ATO referred to above. However, when the Central line ATO system was first introduced, there were significant issues with low wheel/rail adhesion levels on above-ground <b>sections,</b> with <b>wheel</b> slide under braking resulting in unacceptable levels of wheel flats and station overruns. Low adhesion conditions on the line are most commonly reported during autumn, typically due a combination of light rain and fallen leaves on the rails. When these conditions are present, the ATO target deceleration is reduced to 0.55  m/s 2, in addition to other mitigation measures such as railhead treatment [44].|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of machine components under loading {{is an integral}} part of railway engineering design. It results in a mechanical contact and associated stress distribution, which may be an initiation point for failure modes such as fatigue, fretting or wear. In this study the reflection of ultrasound is used to investigate how real engineering components contact. It is a non-intrusive technique preserving the mechanics of the contact. The concept is simple; an acoustic wave bounces back from an incomplete interface. The higher the contact load, the more conformal will be the contact and hence more of the wave will be transmitted. A spring model is used to determine maps of contact stiffness from contact ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure is then used to determine the pressure. The technique has been used to study two railway engineering applications. The first was a wheel/rail contact. Measurements were taken using specimens cut from <b>sections</b> of <b>wheel</b> and rail. Both the tread/railhead and flange/gauge corner contacts were studied. The second was a wheel hub/axle interference fit. An actual wheelset was used, with a hollow axle to allow access for the ultrasonic transducer...|$|R
40|$|A {{broadband}} photometer {{experiment is}} {{being prepared for}} the Atmosphere Explorer-C, -D, and -E missions to record the solar irradiance in seven wavelength bands {{in the range from}} 40 to 1250 A. The experiment contains four spiral electron multipliers located behind a moving eight-position filter wheel. Six of the eight <b>sections</b> of this <b>wheel</b> contain metallic filters used to spectrally isolate the solar irradiance. In addition, three Al 2 O 3 diodes, two with filters, are being used to record the solar irradiance over the full range of orbital altitudes including those at which operation of multipliers with high voltages on open structures would be unsafe. A principal goal of the experiment will be to measure time dependence of the solar irradiance...|$|R

What occurs is that when the wheel is turned, the mainspring is tensioned via the chain, which is wound partially around the shaft. The click is the sound of one end of the sear engaging in the blind hole {{on the inside of the}} wheel, as described above, thus immobilising it.|$|R
