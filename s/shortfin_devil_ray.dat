50|$|The <b>shortfin</b> <b>devil</b> <b>ray</b> {{is a small}} {{eagle ray}} growing to a maximum width of 120 cm and a weight of 30 kg.

5000|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature have {{classified}} {{the conservation}} status {{of this species}} as [...] "data deficient". This is because the <b>shortfin</b> <b>devil</b> <b>ray</b> {{is the subject of}} both targeted and bycatch inshore fisheries, but insufficient records are kept to enable population trends to be estimated. However, it is vulnerable to over-fishing because of its low reproductive rate. Targeted fisheries occur in India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and this ray is caught in Indonesia especially for its gill rakers. These are valuable because of their use in traditional Chinese medicine. The flesh is used for human consumption, the skin is dried and deep fried, and the cartilage is used as a filler in the manufacture of shark fin soup.|$|E
