50|$|That night Fritz {{returns to}} the Bodega Bay Inn, where Paul and Susan, now working as a maid, are being {{questioned}} by reporter Lee Maxwell about the disappearances of Betty, Helga, Chuck and Hans. Later, Paul goes to the attic of the Ivory Tower, where André, along with the puppets, have been hiding. Toulon {{is working on a}} new puppet called Torch, and with the brain material from the four victims, Toulon plans to give himself and the puppets 50 more years of life and travel the Americas. Paul disapproves of this lifestyle and wants André to leave when the elixir is done brewing in two days. Lee, seeing Paul come from the attic, sneaks up there and sees Toulon and the puppets. He goes to the lounge to call his boss, and his killed by Fritz, who sets Blade up for the murder. Paul, thinking Blade killed him, attacks André and the puppets protect him from Paul. The puppets, André and Susan get Paul to bed to heal his wounds. Realizing that Fritz <b>set</b> <b>Blade</b> up, the puppets and André head back to the attic and finds Fritz there with the elixir in his hand. Fritz offers Toulon to go back with him to Germany, where they can bring Elsa back and all of Europe will provide him resources to aid her kind. After asking Leech Woman what to do, Toulon says no. Fritz shoots Leech Woman and Jester as Blade, Tunneler and Pinhead attack him. Toulon lunges at him, sending both men falling into water below. Fritz dies and Toulon manages to crawl out of the water alive but is close to death. He uses the fluid to sustain Leech Woman and Jester's lives. André dies once again, and is put back into the ground by Paul and Susan, now raising the puppets as their own children, finally coming into terms of appreciating them, just like Andre’ did.|$|E
40|$|More {{than just}} a box office flop that resurrected itself in the midnight movie circuit, Blade Runner (1982) {{achieved}} extraordinary cult status through video, laserdisc, and a five-disc DVD collector's <b>set.</b> <b>Blade</b> Runner has become a network of variant texts and fan speculations?a franchise created around just one film.

40|$|A time-domain Harmonic Balance {{method is}} applied to {{simulate}} the blade row interactions and vibrations of state- of-the-art industrial turbomachinery configurations. The present harmonic balance approach is a time-integration scheme that turns a periodic or almost-periodic flow problem into the coupled resolution of several steady computations at different time samples of the period of interest. The coupling is performed by a spectral time-derivative operator that appears as a source term of all the steady problems. These are converged simultaneously making the method parallel in time. In this paper, a non-uniform time sampling is used to improve the robustness and accuracy regardless of the considered frequency <b>set.</b> <b>Blade</b> row interactions are studied within a 3. 5 -stage high-pressure axial compressor representative of the high-pressure core of modern turbofan engines. Comparisons with reference time-accurate computations show that four frequencies allow a fair match of the compressor performance, with a reduction of the computational time up to a factor 30. Finally, an aeroelastic study is performed for a counter-rotating fan stage, where the rear blade is submitted to a prescribed harmonic vibration along its first torsion mode. The aerodynamic damping is analysed, showing possible flutter...|$|E

Primary emphasis {{was placed on}} theoretically and experimentally evaluating the aerodynamic, aeromechanical, and acoustic performance of GE-defined counterrotating blade concepts. Several blade design concepts were considered. Feasibility studies were conducted to evaluate a forward-swept versus an aft-swept blade application and how the given blade design would affect interaction between rotors. Two blade designs were initially selected. Both designs involved in-depth aerodynamic, aeromechanical, mechanical, and acoustic analyses followed by the fabrication of forward-swept, forward rotor <b>blade</b> <b>sets</b> to be wind tunnel tested with an aft-swept, aft rotor <b>blade</b> <b>set.</b> A third <b>blade</b> <b>set</b> was later produced from a NASA design that was based on wind tunnel test results from the first two <b>blade</b> <b>sets.</b> This <b>blade</b> <b>set</b> had a stiffer outer ply material added to the original blade design, in order to reach the design point operating line.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, the use of {{electric}} propulsion technologies within aircraft design has received increased attention. The characteristics of electric propulsion systems open up new areas of the aircraft design space, {{such as the use}} of distributed electric propulsion (DEP). In this approach, electric motors are placed in many different locations to achieve increased efficiency through integration of the propulsion system with the airframe. Under a project called Scalable Convergent Electric Propulsion Technology Operations Research (SCEPTOR), NASA is designing a flight demonstrator aircraft that employs many "high-lift propellers" distributed upstream of the wing leading edge and two cruise propellers (one at each wingtip). As the high-lift propellers are operational at low flight speeds (take-off/approach flight conditions), the impact of the DEP configuration on the aircraft noise signature is also an important design consideration. This paper describes efforts toward the development of a mulit-fidelity aerodynamic and acoustic methodology for DEP high-lift propeller aeroacoustic modeling. Specifically, the PAS, OVERFLOW 2, and FUN 3 D codes are used to predict the aerodynamic performance of a baseline high-lift propeller blade <b>set.</b> <b>Blade</b> surface pressure results from the aerodynamic predictions are then used with PSU-WOPWOP and the F 1 A module of the NASA second generation Aircraft NOise Prediction Program to predict the isolated high-lift propeller noise source. Comparisons of predictions indicate that general trends related to angle of attack effects at the blade passage frequency are captured well with the various codes. Results for higher harmonics of the blade passage frequency appear consistent for the CFD based methods. Conversely, evidence of the need for a study of the effects of increased azimuthal grid resolution on the PAS based results is indicated and will be pursued in future work. Overall, the results indicate that the computational approach is acceptable for fundamental assessment of low-noise high-lift propeller designs. The extent to which the various approaches may be used in a complementary manner will be further established as measured data becomes available for validation. Ultimately, it is anticipated that this combined approach may be used to provide realistic incident source fields for acoustic shielding/scattering studies on various aircraft configurations...|$|E
