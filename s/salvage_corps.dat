Why, {{if it were not for}} the heroes of the <b>salvage</b> <b>corps</b> we should be ruined altogether. It's my opinion, Joe, that the men of the <b>salvage</b> <b>corps</b> run quite as much risk as your fellows do in going through fire and smoke and working among falling beams and tumbling walls in order to cover goods with their tarpaulins and protect them from water." ...|$|E

60|$|Note 1. The <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> {{is a body}} of men {{appointed}} by the insurance offices to save and protect goods at fires, and otherwise to watch over their interests. They wear a uniform and helmets, something {{like those of the}} firemen, and generally follow close in their wake--in their own vans--when fires break out.|$|E
6000|$|The {{room had}} been a parlour and there were several damaged prints hanging on the walls, besides a {{quantity}} of detached paper hanging from them. Most of the furniture had been removed at the commencement of the fire; but a few broken articles remained, and one big old easy-chair, which had either been forgotten, or deemed unworthy of removal, by {{the men of the}} <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps.</b> [See note 1.] ...|$|E
60|$|How {{the firemen}} {{continued}} to do their desperate work, day and night, almost without rest, {{it is impossible to}} tell. Frank Willders said that, after the first night, he went about his work like a man in a dream. He scarcely knew when, or how, or where he rested or ate. He had an indistinct remembrance of one or two brief intervals of oblivion when he supposed he must have been asleep, but the only memory that remained strong and clear within him was that of constant, determined fighting with the flames. And Willie Willders followed him like his shadow! clad in a coat and helmet borrowed from a friend in the <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps.</b> Willie fought in that great fight {{as if he had been}} a trained fireman.|$|E

50|$|Local {{insurance}} companies formed the Underwriters <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> in 1886 {{at the end}} of a four-year-long process of negotiations. As a <b>salvage</b> <b>corps,</b> their goal was largely to assist firefighters in danger zones: employees rushed to burning buildings to try to save both lives and property, and they were accorded the same status as official firefighters while at fire zones.|$|E
50|$|The London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> (LSC) {{had been}} around {{for as long as}} London’s first {{properly}} organised fire brigade. The London Fire Engine Establishment had been created and maintained by the principal fire insurance offices of London. The London Fire Engine Establishment, established in 1833 under the command of Superintendent James Braidwood, had undertaken salvage work as part of its normal everyday fire extinguishing duties. Following Braidwood’s death at the great Tooley Street fire in 1861, and the arrival of Captain Eyre Massey Shaw, a new fire brigade for London was required. It was created in 1866 and called the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, still with Captain Shaw as its first Chief Officer. However, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act of 1865 was vague enough to enable the Metropolitan Board of Works, who controlled the new brigade at the time, to refuse responsibility for any salvage work without payment. The amount sought by the Metropolitan Board of Works for this service exceeded that for which an independent <b>salvage</b> <b>corps</b> could be maintained by the fire offices themselves. Therefore, it was decided {{at a meeting of the}} London Fire Engine Establishment on 22 December 1865 to establish a <b>salvage</b> <b>corps</b> independent of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. The London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> was founded by John Brookes Johnston of the Royal Insurance Company. The London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> commenced operations during January 1866. The original subscribers to the London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> were the Alliance, Atlas, Globe, Imperial, London, Protector, Royal Exchange, Sun, Union and Westminster fire offices, but membership varied subsequently.|$|E

50|$|The London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> was {{maintained}} by the fire offices of London. The corps was first formed in 1865 and began operations in March 1866. It {{was inspired by the}} Liverpool <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> which had been formed in 1842, to reduce the loss and damage caused by fires, to help mitigate the effects of fire and of fire-fighting and to salvage both premises and goods affected by fire.|$|E
50|$|Liverpool <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> was {{a service}} in Liverpool, England, founded and {{maintained}} by fire insurers, whose {{aim was to}} reduce the loss and damage caused by fires, to help mitigate the effects of fire and of fire-fighting and to salvage both premises and goods affected by fire. It was founded in 1842 and operated until April 1984, when its functions were transferred to the Merseyside Fire Brigade. Similar <b>salvage</b> <b>corps</b> also operated in London and Glasgow.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1930s {{the service}} was accused of {{participating}} in a criminal arson scandal. At the trial of Leopold Harris in 1934, he testified {{that he had had}} nearly every <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> officer [...] "in his pocket". Harris was later sentenced to 14 years in jail. Captain Brymore Eric Miles, chief of the insurance companies' <b>salvage</b> <b>corps</b> was sentenced to four years in jail for [...] "corruption and conspiring to pervert the administration of justice." [...] The arson ring took £500,000 in false insurance claims.|$|E
50|$|Cotton was {{the largest}} and most {{important}} trade in Liverpool Docks which handled half of Britain's cotton imports by 1800, and 90 percent by 1830. The Liverpool <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> operated the largest cotton recovery plant in the United Kingdom. Cotton has a very high salvage potential. In the hands of experts as much as 80% of even a badly burned bale of cotton can be recovered and sold for a similar value to that of the original cotton. Liverpool <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> returned many millions of pounds to the insurance companies from its work as salvors.|$|E
50|$|Safety {{considerations}} {{dictated that}} Liverpool <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> personnel wore uniforms and helmets {{similar to those}} of Local Authority Fire-fighters, although it was sufficiently different to make the Corps crews easily identifiable on the fire ground.|$|E

5000|$|In 1982, the Underwriters <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] Key to this {{designation}} was its place in local history, for {{it was the only}} Cincinnati-area corporation that worked closely with both insurance companies and the city's fire department.|$|E
50|$|The London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> {{attended}} the massive Crystal Palace fire in 1936. Taken {{from the fire}} report, they sent 3 Motor Tenders and 1 Motor Car, 22 men and the LSC Chief Officer. Although {{not in the same}} numbers as their fire brigade counterparts, salvagemen also died in the line of duty.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{appeals to}} the New York Board of Fire Underwriters and the City Council, the Fire Patrol's [...] "ratchets rang for the last time" [...] at 0800 on October 15, 2006.

50|$|Eight further pumps were {{requested}} at 05:56 {{to relieve}} the initial crews and to assist in damping down operations. As was the practice, the fire was also attended by the London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps,</b> whose principal task was damage control and to limit damage to property. This insurance industry funded organisation was abolished in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> {{came into}} {{existence}} in the 19th century. With the growth of cities, fires and insurance, underwriters in several cities established fire fighting services to reduce losses. As municipal fire brigades became more competent in the 20th century, the private fire companies cut back their services and emphasised salvaging property after the regular firemen had done their job.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the {{responsibility}} for the Journal was assumed by the Birmingham and Glasgow institutes, while the Yorkshire institute and the Manchester association prepared the educational programme, proposing that the Federation should act only as an examining body while local institutes undertook the teaching. [...] The Insurance Clerks’ Orphanage was established as an independent organisation in 1902, operating out of the offices of the London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the Secord World War the London <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> turned out on average seven times a day. The estimated cost of the eight principal fires in London for the first quarter of 1934 was £325,000. In its report the Insurance Companies the LSC stated, [...] "It is evident that the loss in material damage, trade and unemployment would have been much greater but for these activities." ...|$|E
5000|$|The New York Fire Patrol was a <b>salvage</b> <b>corps</b> {{created by}} the New York Board of Fire Underwriters which {{operated}} from 1839 until October 15, 2006. Their original mission was two-fold: to discover fires and to prevent losses to insured properties. The Patrol responded primarily to fires at commercial structures, however they would respond to high loss residential fires at times. During the fire the Patrol would spread canvas salvage covers, remove water, operate elevators and secure utilities.|$|E
5000|$|Glasgow <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> {{despatched}} {{a vehicle}} to the scene {{as part of the}} initial attendance, and their men began their normal fireground task of attempting to protect stock from fire and smoke damage by covering with plastic sheeting. On the [...] "Make Pumps 4" [...] message, a second salvage tender was despatched. Crews using breathing apparatus ("BA"), searching the building for the seat of the fire, found conditions very difficult with thick smoke and the crowded layout of the premises hampering progress.|$|E
50|$|The Glasgow Fire Service was {{initially}} alerted by a 999 call at 7.15pm from the foreman of the Eldorado Ice Cream Company which {{was near the}} whisky bond. He reported smoke coming from a second floor window of the warehouse. In response two pumps from West Station with Sub Officer James Calder in charge was sent, along with a Turntable Ladder from Central Station. Also responding initially was the Fire Boat 'St Mungo' and a Salvage Tender and crew of the Glasgow <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps.</b>|$|E
50|$|The United States did {{not have}} government-run fire {{departments}} until {{around the time of}} the American Civil War. Prior to this time, private fire brigades compete with one another to be the first to respond to a fire because insurance companies paid brigades to save buildings. Underwriters also employed their own <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> in some cities. The first known female firefighter Molly Williams took her place with the men on the dragropes during the blizzard of 1818 and pulled the pumper to the fire through the deep snow.|$|E
5000|$|... "For {{some time}} now the Management Committee of the Liverpool <b>Salvage</b> <b>Corps</b> has been {{increasingly}} concerned regarding its effectiveness. Whilst {{there is no doubt}} that the existence of a dedicated Corps maintaining specialist and extensive facilities has been of the greatest assistance over the years in safeguarding property after a fire, particularly in those areas of concentrated mercantile risks, the changing shape of commercial interests within the conurbation it serves and the ever widening dispersal of premises at risk leads to the unavoidable conclusion that a specialist service can no longer be justified".|$|E
