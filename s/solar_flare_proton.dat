40|$|Discussion {{of solar}} cosmic ray {{phenomena}} and related topics from the solar physical point of view. Since {{solar cosmic rays}} are usually produced by <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> {{it is necessary to}} understand the processes and mechanism of <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> especially the so-called <b>proton</b> <b>flares,</b> {{in order to understand the}} acceleration mechanism of solar cosmic rays and their behavior in both the solar atmosphere and interplanetary space. For this reason, a detailed discussion is given of various phenomena associated with <b>solar</b> <b>flares,</b> <b>proton</b> <b>flare</b> characteristics, and the mechanism of <b>solar</b> <b>flares.</b> Since the discovery of solar cosmic rays by Forbush, the interplanetary space has been thought of as a medium in which solar cosmic rays propagate. The propagation of solar cosmic rays in this space is therefore discussed briefly by referring to the observed magnetic properties of this space. Finally, some problems related to the physics of galactic cosmic rays are discussed...|$|R

In the study the incident radiation spectra are transported through the spacecraft structure/magnetic shield using the deterministic space radiation transport computer codes developed at Langley Research Center. The calculated exposures unequivocally demonstrate that magnetic shielding could provide an effective barrier against <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> <b>protons</b> but is virtually transparent to the more energetic galactic cosmic rays. It is then demonstrated that through proper selection of materials and shield configuration, adequate and reliable bulk material shielding can be provided for the same total mass as needed to generate and support the more risky magnetic field configuration...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for an intrinsically solar effect which may dominate such solar-terrestrial correlations as that reported by Chertkov (1976), where large H-alpha flares during 1967 - 1972 in solar active regions with overlying fields on a 100, 000 km scale and predominantly north-to-south orientation were more efficient {{in the production}} of geomagnetic disturbances than comparable flares in regions whose fields at the flare sites were directed south-to-north. In addition to being responsible for geomagnetic disturbance enhancements, this purely solar effect may cause solar wind velocity and <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> <b>proton</b> flux enhancements. If the effect can be generalized to other portions of the solar cycle, it could improve present understanding of the flare mechanism and therefore prove useful in the prediction of solar-terrestrial disturbances...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> <b>proton</b> fluxes {{are limited in}} magnitude by saturation effects inherent to the acceleration mechanism is explored. If cyclotron damping of Alfven waves acts to accelerate protons, the criterion that the damping time {{is comparable to the}} acceleration time provides a fast particle number density at which protons load the wave spectrum. The limiting flux at 1 AU is obtained by a volume integration over the acceleration region and redistribution into an interplanetary emission cone. A simplified explosion model permits a delineation between volume and surface acceleration mechanisms in terms of a temporal parameter, the effective duration of acceleration. It is concluded that the limiting flux may be a realistic concept, but that further investigation is warranted to sharpen the criterion...|$|E

The anisotropy versus time profiles during individual events are in general consistent with diffusive propagation, but several cases are observed where the decay is better described by an exponential time decay. The anisotropy amplitude evaluated at the time of maximum intensity for each event shows evidence for a gradual decrease with increasing distance from the sun which is qualitatively consistent with diffusive propagation and suggests that the effective interplanetary diffusion coefficient parallel to the magnetic field increases slowly with heliocentric distance...|$|R

After ordering the interplanetary data by its estimated coronal emission source location in heliographic coordinates, the multispacecraft measured proton fluxes are compared with coronal magnetic field structure infrared as observed in soft X-ray photographs and potential field calculations. Evidence for the propagation and possible acceleration of <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> <b>protons</b> on high magnetic loop structure in the corona is presented.

The acceleration time to a characteristic energy of about 20 MeV per nucleon can be as short as 10 sec.

40|$|Abstract. A {{statistical}} analysis of the contemporary (1954 – 1975) solar flare particle events has been made for the parameters F (integrated, proton fluence in cm– 2 in an event with kinetic energy above 10 MeV) and R 0 (the characteristic rigidity). These data are compared with the long-term averaged values determined from stable- and radio-nuclide measure-ments of lunar samples. The analysis shows that the ancient <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> <b>proton</b> spectrum was harder (higher R 0 values) compared to that observed in contemporary flares. A similar analysis {{can not be made}} for the mean long-term averaged flux (J, cm– 2 S– 1), since the contemporary averages suffer from an uncertainty due to the statistics of a single event. However, the average flux estimates for time durations 〈T 〉 exceeding 103 yr, are free from such uncertainties. The long-term averaged J values obtained over different time scales (104 – 106 yr) suggest a possible periodic variation in solar flare activity, with enhanced flux level during the last 105 yr. The available data rule out the occurrence of giant flares, with proton fluence exceeding 1015 cm– 2 during the last million years. Key words: solar flares—solar activity—long term variation...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A critical aspect of missions to the Moon or Mars is the safety and health of the crew. Radiation in space is a hazard for astronauts, especially high-energy radiation following certain types of solar flares. A solar flare event can be very dangerous if astronauts are not adequately shielded since flares can deliver a very high-dose {{in a short period of}} time. The goal of this research was to parameterize solar flare dose as a function of time to see if it was possible to predict the available warning time. This would allow astronauts to take corrective action and avoid receiving a dose greater than the recommended limit set by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). No consideration has been given to the design of the adequate shielding to protect against <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> <b>proton</b> events. Eight flares have been studied covering the period from 1986 to 1994. The results of this research show that the shielding provided by the astronaut's suits is enough to protect them against the solar proton events studied, but in case of a long duration mission to the Moon or Mars or even farther, the accumulated dose due to exposure to successive flares can be a problem. In this case the emphasis should be placed on the ability to predict flares. This is beyond the scope of our research but could represent the goal of future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{deep space}} and {{planetary}} exploration project have been acquiring {{more and more}} importance {{and some of them}} are now well established both in ESA and NASA programs. This paper presents the possibility to utilize both silicon and gallium arsenide solar cells as spacecraft primary power source for missions far from the Sun, in order to overcome the drawbacks related to the utilisation of radioisotope thermoelectric generators - such as cost, safety and social acceptance. The development of solar cells for low illumination intensity and low temperature (LILT) applications is carried out in Europe by ASE (Germany) and CISE (Italy) in the frame of an ESA programme, aimed to provide the photovoltaic generators for ROSETTA: the cometary material investigation mission scheduled for launch in 2003. The LILT cells development and testing objectives are therefore focused on the following requirements: insolation intensity as low as 0. 03 Solar Constant, low temperature down to - 150 C and <b>solar</b> <b>flare</b> <b>proton</b> environment. At this stage of development, after the completion of the technology verification tests, it has been demonstrated that suitable technologies are available for the qualification of both silicon and gallium arsenide cells and both candidates have shown conversion efficiencies over 25 % at an illumination of 0. 03 SC and a temperature of - 150 C. In particular, when measured at those LILT conditions, the newly developed 'Hl-ETA/NR-LILT' silicon solar cells have reached a conversion efficiency of 26. 3 %, that is the highest value ever measured on a single junction solar cell. A large quantity of both 'Hl-ETA/NR-LILT' silicon and 'GaAs/Ge-LILT' solar cells are presently under fabrication and they will be submitted to a qualification test plan, including radiation exposure, in order to verify their applicability with respect to the mission requirements. The availability of two valid options will minimize the risk for the very ambitious scientific project. The paper describes how the technical achievements have been possible with Si and GaAs LILT solar cells (including a comparison between measured and modelled l-V characteristics) and it presents the technology verification tests results...|$|E

Using these data, the intensity-time (IT) profiles, the anisotropy-time profiles, the energy spectra, and the pitch angle distributions of the solar protons near earth were deduced. It was found that the solar protons propagated essentially scatter-free from the sun to the earth. The solar protons had easy access to the IMF lines to earth; the time from the onset to maximum intensity and the shape of the IT profiles at earth as a function of energy could be explained by the diffusion of the <b>flare</b> <b>protons</b> near the acceleration region.

An attempt is made to identify the energy of the particles which are responsible for the waves. Intensity profiles of both waves and particles as a function of upstream distance are compared, taking into account the relation between the energy of the particles and the period of the waves. The considered approach makes it possible to identify protons with energies of a few hundred keV as being responsible for the waves in the extended foreshock.
