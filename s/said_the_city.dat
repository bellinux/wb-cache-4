5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E

25|$|According to Braves team {{president}} John Schuerholz, Turner Field required $150million in renovation costs merely for structural upkeep (i.e., not for fan experience improvements). He estimated that fan improvement renovations {{would have cost}} an additional $200million. The Braves were in talks in 2013 with the Recreational Authority over extending the team's original lease, Plant said, but those talks broke down. Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{could not afford to}} support the kind of renovations the Braves desired.|$|E

25|$|Ellerbe {{announced}} on August 26 {{that he would}} resubmit his ambulance staffing plan to the D.C. City Council for approval. He pointed to 22 new paramedic hires and 20 new ambulances {{as a sign that}} the city would be able to provide good quality EMS care during night hours. Wells <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> council should be credited for pushing DCFEMS to improve vehicle purchasing and personnel hiring. But DCFES spokesman Keith St. Clair said the council's criticisms, rejections of Ellerbe's proposals, and publicity about DCFEMS problems had had no effect. St. Clair asserted that Ellerbe began making changes long before the council began its hearings.|$|E
25|$|In 1136, the Novgorodians {{dismissed}} their prince Vsevolod Mstislavich. The year {{is seen as}} {{the traditional}} beginning of the Novgorod Republic. The city was able to invite and dismiss a number of princes over the next two centuries, but the princely office was never abolished and powerful princes, such as Alexander Nevsky, could assert their will in the city regardless of what Novgorodians <b>said.</b> <b>The</b> <b>city</b> state controlled most of Europe's northeast, from lands east of today's Estonia to the Ural Mountains, {{making it one of the}} largest states in medieval Europe, although much of the territory north and east of Lakes Ladoga and Onega was sparsely populated and never organized politically.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, Chief Ellerbe {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} reduce ambulance service between 1:00 A.M. and 7:00 A.M. and transfer these crews to service between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and noon. Ellerbe said the change would eliminate half of the 42 overnight paramedics and all 14 advanced life support ambulances. The remaining 21 paramedics would ride with fire engines or trucks (which typically respond to medical emergencies also). There would be no change to the 21 to 25 basic life support ambulances available, which are staffed by EMTs. Ellerbe <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> receives about 10 calls per hour overnight, but 20 per hour mornings. The proposal required D.C. City Council approval. The firefighters' union opposed the plan, arguing it would overload firefighters and reduced fire fighting ability. But the paramedics' union (Local 3721, American Federation of Government Employees), supported it.|$|E

500|$|In {{his annual}} budget address in City Council Chambers on October 15, 2008, Daley {{proposed}} a 2009 budget totaling $5.97 billion, including not filling 1,350 vacancies on the 38,000 employee city payroll and $150 {{million in new}} revenue from a then-obscure parking meter lease deal [...] to help erase a $469 million budget shortfall. The Daley administration employed an in-house staff of more than 50 public relations officers across City departments {{at a cost of}} $4.7 million, and millions more on seven private public relations firms. [...] "It's worth it", Daley said. On the first day of City Council hearings on Daley's 2009 budget proposal, several aldermen questioned the administration's public relations spending. On November 4, 2008, Jacquelyn Heard, the mayor's press secretary, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> would halt [...] spending on 10 public relations contracts that could have paid as much as $5 million each.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2004 Rock Hill Chief Financial Officer Don Cary said {{overspending}} put {{the city}} on track for bankruptcy by 2010. In June 2004 Mayor Robert Salamone abruptly announced his resignation effective in August, citing [...] "individuals who seek to impede or even halt our efforts at improving our city." [...] In October 2004 the city scaled back its plans for the McKnight site to administrative offices and a police station. The city sold the site to Mills Properties for $1.950 million in February 2005. A state audit in September 2005 <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> lost some $700,000 on the property.|$|E
2500|$|During his reign, it was <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> Council {{would vote}} {{according}} to Hamann's nod. In 1963, the State of California imposed Local Agency Formation Commissions statewide, but largely {{to try to}} maintain order with San Jose's aggressive growth. Eventually the political forces against growth grew as local neighborhoods bonded together to elect their own candidates, ending Hamann's influence and leading to his resignation. [...] While the job was not complete, the trend was set. The city had defined its sphere of influence in all directions, sometimes chaotically leaving unincorporated pockets to be {{swallowed up by the}} behemoth, sometimes even at the objection of the residents.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad {{called the}} city [...] "one of the state's {{economic}} superstars".

These new companies were reported in 1999 to have [...] "created up to 1,500 jobs in high tech businesses ranging from telecommunications companies to Internet providers to PC-oriented magazines".

In public statements Ulrich called the relief efforts a [...] "bureaucratic nightmare", <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> chosen contractors were incapable of handling the residents' needs, and recommended the head of <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> Build-it-Back program be fired by the Mayor.|$|R

2500|$|In August 2001, the Washington Times {{reported}} that the D.C. fire department's new $5.3 million radio system was so weak that [...] "dead zones" [...] existed in almost 50 locations, including such critical areas as {{the headquarters of the}} Metropolitan Police Department, the Harry S Truman Building (headquarters of the United States Department of State), the J. Edgar Hoover Building (headquarters of the FBI), the MCI Center (the city's main basketball and hockey arena), and Union Station (the city's Amtrak, MARC, VRE, and Washington Metro transportation hub). Firefighters' personal radios often could not communicate with headquarters or one another and eight months of complaints by firefighters led to no improvement. By January 2002, the problem still had not been corrected. Few <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> had to wait until $46.2 million in federal anti-terrorism funds were disbursed before the system could be fixed.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the first}} Judge Dredd story {{is set in}} [...] "New York 2099AD", prog 3 retconned that and said New York {{was just part of}} Mega-City One.

Prog 4 then established that Mega-City One was surrounded by wildernesses from the Atomic Wars. The 150 million population was later revised to 100 million in earlier strips and abruptly bumped to 800 million later on. The United States of the West concept was dropped entirely; a [...] "United Cities of North America" [...] of three megacities was mentioned in prog 42 and then itself dropped in favour of Mega-City One being an independent entity.|$|E
