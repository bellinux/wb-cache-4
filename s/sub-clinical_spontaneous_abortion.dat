We hypothesized that those female pregnant women with previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> (n- 100) will have higher anxiety and depression than female pregnant women without previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> (n- 100). Age and other sociodemographic parameters did not differ significantly between the groups of participants.

40|$|Introduction. The risk of {{developing}} mental illness is significantly increased during pregnancy. The most common obstetric complication is <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Women {{with a history of}} previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> are at higher risk {{of developing}} mental problems during their subsequent pregnancy. Aim. We examined the effects of a history of previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> on emotional problems during subsequent pregnancy. We examined 987 pregnant women at the 1 st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of semmelweis university in budapest, Hungary between 01 - 10 - 2012 and 31 - 08 - 2013. among them there were 265 pregnant women who had at least one episode of previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Material and methods. We measured depression using the EPDS test. anxiety was measured using the spielberger (STAI) tests. We designed a questionnaire to gather socio-demographic data. We used the chi-square test and Wald-Wolfovitz test to test for the statistical significance of associations. Results. We found that 24. 21 % of the sample had depression, and 8. 61 % of the sample had anxiety. According to the number of previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> we compared 3 groups: 722 women had no <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> previously, 169 women had one previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> and 96 women had 2 or more <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> before. Depression, anxiety and previous mental illness were examined in these groups. Those women who had <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> 2 or more times before got significantly higher scores in the EPDS test, than those who had no or just one <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> among them 28. 1 % had mental illness previously. We found that prior mental illness and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> are independent predictors of antenatal depression. Among those women who had 2 or more <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> before, the mean age and the number of single women was significantly higher, while the average level of education was significantly lower than in the other two groups. Conclusions. Higher age, lower level of education and the lack of partner relationship can be associated with the number of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions.</b> The number of episodes of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> and a history of mental illness are risk factors for depression during a subsequent pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common gestational conditions, with the {{morbidity}} of 1 % to 5 % in married women. It is a serious problem troubling women at the reproductive age. There are many factors causing <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion,</b> among them, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> resulting from endocrine abnormalities can be detected and treated. Prolactin is a major endocrine hormone participating in reproductive regulation and playing an important role in early pregnancy implantation and pregnancy maintenance. When there are unusual levels it is closely related to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion,</b> leading to a necessity to further study the relationship between them. International and domestic research developments in recent years about the correlation between prolactin and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> in {{hospitals}} were analysed from two sources—membership {{files of the}} Union of Rubber and Leather Workers (about 10 000 women) and records of the personnel of a rubber factory (about 1600 women). Two frequencies of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> were calculated for each population analysed: rate (No <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> X 100 /No pregnancies) and ratio (No <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> X 100 /No births). The two frequencies were increased for all union members compared with all Finnish women. The frequencies, however, did not appreciably differ when the pregnancies occurred during union membership {{as compared with the}} pregnancies before or after membership. The frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> was higher for the short-time union members than for those employed for longer periods, but the increased frequency did not correlate with union membership. The employees of a rubber factory had slightly fewer <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> on average than the community population. The women employed in the rubber factory for three to 23 months were found to have appreciably higher frequencies of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> than the women employed for longer periods. The present study showed the feasibility of using cases of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> {{in hospitals}} in an occupational study with longitudinal employment data. Women with short periods of employment appeared to have more <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> than those with longer periods of employment suggesting the presence of selection mechanisms, perhaps with some analogies to the “healthy worker effect” in occupational mortality studies. The presence of such selection mechanisms deserve serious consideration in occupational reproductive epidemiology...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} approach {{to estimate the}} total number of pregnancies that begin in a population during one calendar year and the probability of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> is described. This includes an indirect estimate of the number of pregnancies that result in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions.</b> The method simultaneously takes into account the proportion of induced abortions that are censored by <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> and vice versa in order to estimate the true annual number of <b>spontaneous</b> and induced <b>abortions</b> for a population. It also estimates the proportion of pregnancies that women intended to allow to continue to a live birth. The proposed indirect approach derives adjustment factors to make indirect estimates by combining vital statistics information on gestational age at induced abortion (from the 12 States that report to the National Center for Health Statistics) with a life table of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> probabilities. The adjustment factors are applied to data on induced abortions from the Alan Guttmacher Institute Abortion Provider Survey and data on births from U. S. vital statistics. For the United States in 1980 the probability of a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> is 19 percent, given the presence of induced abortion. Once the effects of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> are discounted, women in 1980 intended to allow 73 percent of their pregnancies to proceed to a live birth. One medical benefit to a population practicing induced abortion is that induced <b>abortions</b> avert some <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions,</b> leading to a lower mean gestational duration at the time of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether pituitary suppression before induction of ovulation reduces {{the rate of}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> in women with polycystic ovarian disease and primary recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions.</b> DESIGN [...] Closed, randomised, sequential trial. Pairs of women were allocated to each treatment by the toss of a coin. SETTING [...] Supraregional clinic for women who had had recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions.</b> SUBJECTS [...] Forty two women with polycystic ovarian disease and primary recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions.</b> INTERVENTIONS [...] Ovulation was induced by clomiphene or pituitary suppression with buserelin followed by pure follicle stimulating hormone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Preference for a particular treatment was noted. A preference occurred when one woman in a pair had a successful pregnancy (defined as one of over 12 weeks' gestation) and one had a spontaneous abortion; the preference was for the treatment resulting in the successful pregnancy. RESULTS [...] <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> occurred in 11 of 20 women given clomiphene compared with two of 20 who had pituitary suppression. Eleven preferences were found for buserelin and two for clomiphene. In seven pairs both women had successful pregnancies. One pair was discarded {{because one of the}} women did not become pregnant. The ratio of luteinising hormone concentration to follicular diameter was found to be a possible diagnostic indicator of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Pituitary suppression before induction of ovulation significantly reduces the risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> in women with polycystic ovarian disease and primary recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: An {{association}} between <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> and shift {{work has been}} suggested, but present research results are conflicting. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the relationship between <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> among nurses, shift schedules, and nights worked. Methods: This is a longitudinal study where we identified 914 females from a cohort of nurses in Norway who had worked the same type of shift schedule 2008 - 2010; either permanent day shift, three-shift rotation or permanent night shift. Information on age, work and life-style factors, as well as <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> during lifetime and the past three years (2008 - 2010) was obtained by annual questionnaires. Results: A higher prevalence of experienced <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> before study start (2008) was found among nurses working permanent night shift compared to other nurses. In a linear regression analysis, a risk of 1. 3 was found for experienced <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> before study start among permanent night shift nurses, with day shift as reference, when adjusting for age, smoking, caffeine and job strain, but the finding was not statistical significant (95 per cent confidence interval 0. 8 - 2. 1). Permanent night shift workers had a risk of 1. 5 experiencing <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> in 2008 - 2010 compared to day shift nurses, although not statistical significant (95 per cent confidence interval 0. 7 - 3. 5). The number of night shifts the past three years was not associated with experiencing <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> 2008 - 2010, but associated with a reduced risk of experiencing <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> during lifetime. The results must be interpreted in the light of a possible selection bias; both selections into the occupation of nursing and into the different shift types of the more healthy persons may have occurred in this population. Conclusion: No significant increased risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> among permanent night shift nurses compared to day-time nurses was found in this study, and no association was found between <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> and the number of worked night shifts.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a cohort study of 107 patients who achieved their first pregnancy after infertility treatment in a tertiary medical center. A homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was carried out. Patient demographic characteristics and pregnancy outcome were also recorded. Statistical comparison was made between patients with and without IR. Logistical regression analysis was used to assess the effect of IR and several other factors simultaneously on the risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> RESULTS: The incidence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> was 17. 8 %. The association of IR with the risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> was significant after adjusting for other risk factors. The effect of overweight/obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome was not statistically significant in the multivariate model. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study suggested that IR was an independent risk factor for <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Because of the high prevalence of IR in obese or polycystic ovarian syndrome patients, the risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> in these patients can be raised.

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to increase the}} understanding of the etiology of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> and repeated <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion,</b> and to evaluate possibilities of exposure assessment during pregnancy. Data from a Swedish population-based case-control study of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion,</b> performed in Uppsala County 1996 - 98, formed the base for the three first studies of the thesis. The final study population included 562 cases with a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> in gestational week 6 - 12 and 1, 028 pregnant controls frequency-matched to the cases according to week of gestation. Exposure information was assessed through in-person interviews using structured questionnaires, and through plasma measurements of folate and cotinine levels. Intrauterine tissue was sent for chromosomal analyses among cases with incomplete <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios to estimate the relative risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Women with folate levels < 5 nmo/l were at 60 % increased risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> as compared with women with folate levels 5. 0 - 8. 9 nmol/ 1. High maternal folate levels were associated with a non-significant trend towards a protective effect. Folate deficiency was predominantly associated with abnormal fetal karyotype, however we could not show a differential effect of folate between normal and abnormal fetal karyotype abortions. The use of a folic acid supplement, reported by < 5 % of all women, was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> The association between sociodemographic and anthropometric factors, obstetric history, and life style factors, with respect to risks of repeated <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion,</b> were explored among 108 cases with two or more consecutive first trimester <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> and 583 controls with at least two pregnancies. High and low maternal age, and previous <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> were found to be major risk factors. Smokers were at increased risk of repeated <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Among nonsmoking women with high caffeine intake there was an increased risk, whereas there was no such association among smokers. Folate deficiency was not associated with increased risk of repeated <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Measurement of plasma cotinine was used to assess the dose received from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and active smoking. The prevalence of ETS exposure (cotinine 0. 1 - 15 ng/ml) was 24 % among women with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> and 19 % among women with a normal pregnancy in the first trimester. Nonsmoking pregnant women exposed to ETS faced a 70 % increased risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> as compared with unexposed women. Active smoking was associated with a more than two-fold increased risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> ETS exposure was associated with normal, abnormal, and unknown fetal karyotype abortions. In a prospective follow-up of 953 women from early pregnancy until delivery, maternal selfreported information on active smoking, smoking cessation during pregnancy, and ETS exposure during pregnancy, was validated using cotinine measurements as gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated as measures of accuracy in gestational weeks 6 - 12 and 31 - 34. The validity of selfreported active smoking in early and late pregnancy was reasonably high. Among women reporting smoking cessation before the first interview and {{between the first and second}} interview, 13 % and 25 % misreported active smoking, respectively.

The ORs of late <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> (after the 12 th week of pregnancy) was increased for night work 3. 33 (1. 13 - 9. 87). Use of N 2 O (> 50 % of the deliveries) was not associated with increased risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> OR 0. 95 (0. 62 - 1. 47). Frequent or permanent shortage of staff was related to an increased risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> before the 13 th week of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that night work and high work load increase the risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ureaplasma urealyticum can colonize women {{genital tract}} and be {{isolated}} from the amniotic fluid of women with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The association of U. urealyticum with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> remains controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the frequency of U. urealyticum infection among pregnant women and its association with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> In this case-control study we included 109 women with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> with gestation age between 10 - 20 weeks (Cases), and 109 women with normal pregnancy with gestation age between 20 - 30 weeks (Controls) in Sanandaj, Iran. Using specific primers and extracted DNA from endocervical swabs, a PCR test was conducted for detection of U. urealyticum in both women groups. Total prevalence of U. urealyticum infection in women was 26 out of 218 cases (11. 92 %). The prevalence of U. urealyticum infection was 18 out of 109 (16. 5 %) and 8 out of 109 (7. 3 %) in case (<b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion)</b> and control groups, respectively. Using chi-square test, association between U. urealyticum infection and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Colonization of U. urealyticum in genital tract of women, and its asymptomatic feature in combination with other factors such as other microorganisms or cervical incompetence may induce <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> Further studies are needed to confirm this possibility...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} correcting <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> rates by taking into consideration {{the fact that a}} number of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> are "prevented" by induced abortions. This correction may be important in settings of high induced abortion incidence. The method is then applied to the data of the Italian region of Lombardy. The results obtained are compared to those obtained with previous correction methods, and it is concluded that the present method is useful and appropriate when data on induced and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> are available by gestational age...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This review {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions.</b> Although very high <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> rates have been reported for alcoholic women, it is still uncertain if {{this is due to}} the direct effects of alcohol or the indirect effects of alcoholism-related disorders such as cirrhosis. The higher rates of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> among alcoholics may also be due to their higher pregnancy rates. Studies in animals indicate that blood alcohol levels> 200 mg/dl can directly precipitate <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion.</b> The association between lower levels of maternal alcohol consumption and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> is much less clear. There is a definite effect of study site in these latter studies: those conducted in North America nearly always report statistically significant associations; those conducted in Europe or Australia nearly always report no significant associations. The reason for this difference is not related to differences in alcohol consumption. Possible explanations for this geographical difference include difference in the socioeconomic status of the women being studied and artefacts associated with the designs used to study these relationships...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{provide some}} insight into the {{aetiology}} of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion,</b> the contents of type V collagen was investigated in human decidual tissues in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> and normal pregnancy. METHODS: Collagens were extracted from decidual tissues in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> (n = 19) and normal pregnancy (n = 25). The different types of collagen alpha chains were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, and measured by densitometry. The relative amounts of the alpha 1 (III) and alpha 1 (V) chains were calculated by dividing the band intensities of the alpha 1 (III) and alpha 1 (V) chains by that of the alpha 1 (I) chain. RESULTS: The ratio of the alpha 1 (V) chain to that of the alpha 1 (I) chain in decidual tissues in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> was significantly lower than that found in normal pregnancy (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that type V collagen might {{play an important role in}} the maintenance of pregnancy and that decreased expression of this collagen could be associated with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion...</b>|$|R
40|$|Estrogen plays {{a crucial}} role in fetal and placental {{development}} through estrogen receptors. Association of estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR 1) polymorphisms with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> has been shown in some studies. Our main goal was to study the potential association of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> with the ESR 1 gene variations (PvuII and XbaI) in fetal tissue. Totally, 161 samples were recruited including 80 samples of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded fetal tissue from <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> and 81 samples of normal term placental tissue. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was performed for genotyping the rs 2234693 (A/G XbaI) and rs 9340799 (T/C PvuII) single nucleotide polymorphisms located in intron 1 of ESR 1. The results have been confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The different genotypes distribution was detected in two study groups. Haplotype analysis indicated that ppxx is protective genotype against <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> (P = 0. 01). In conclusion, the potential role of ESR 1 genetic variation in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> might be valuable in high-risk subjects, and that needs to be confirmed with future studies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> in {{hospital}} sterilising staff were analysed {{using data from}} a postal questionnaire and a hospital discharge register. The study included all the sterilising staff employed in Finnish hospitals in 1980; the controls were nursing auxiliaries. Data from the questionnaire showed that the frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> was 11. 3 % for the sterilising staff and 10. 6 % for the nursing auxiliaries. When the staff were concerned in sterilising procedures during their pregnancy the frequency was 16. 7 % compared with 5. 6 % for the non-exposed pregnancies. Adjustment for age, parity, decade of pregnancy, smoking habits, and intake of coffee and alcohol {{did not affect the}} differences. The increased frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> correlated with exposure to ethylene oxide but not with exposure to glutaraldehyde or to formaldehyde. Analysis of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortions</b> from the hospital discharge register confirmed the findings. Thus the results from the two independent analyses suggest that exposure to ethylene oxide {{in hospital}}s may carry a risk of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>abortion</b> among sterilising staff...|$|R
