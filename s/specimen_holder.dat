This allows imaging specimens prepared in vitreous ice, the preferred preparation technique for imaging individual molecules or macromolecular assemblies, imaging of vitrified solid-electrolye interfaces, and imaging of materials that are volatile in high vacuum at room temperature, such as sulfur.|$|E
25|$|Samples for SEM {{have to be}} {{prepared}} to withstand the vacuum conditions and high energy beam of electrons, and have to be of a size that will fit on the specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a <b>specimen</b> <b>holder</b> or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analyis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.|$|E
40|$|Double-stick carbon tape is {{frequently}} used in {{scanning electron microscopy}} to attach <b>specimens</b> to <b>specimen</b> <b>holders.</b> An excellent adhesive, double-stick carbon tape has the added advantage of being electrically conductive. However, recycling <b>specimen</b> <b>holders</b> has been problematic because carbon tape adheres tightly to the holder, making removal difficult.

40|$|We have {{increased}} the efficiency for containing and transferring pollen during chemical drying procedures for conventional scanning electron microscope (CSEM) viewing by replacing standard laboratory containers (glass test tubes, pipettes, etc.) in the final drying stage with smoothed and polished metallic conical wells. The wells, formed by drilling into one end of aluminum CSEM <b>specimen</b> <b>holders,</b> are approximately 4 mm deep, 8 mm in top diameter, and 1 mm in bottom diameter. The large surface area allows rapid elimination of dehydrant. Unlike standard containers, to which dry pollen sticks after evaporation or sublimation of dehydrant, the wells allow pollen to be easily collected, concentrated, and transferred to CSEM <b>specimen</b> <b>holders</b> with minimal loss of sample. The conical wells have been used with alcohol, Peldri-II, and hexamethyldisilazane drying procedures and therefore, universal application seems likely...|$|R
25|$|Modern TEMs {{are often}} {{equipped}} with <b>specimen</b> <b>holders</b> {{that allow the}} user to tilt the specimen {{to a range of}} angles in order to obtain specific diffraction conditions, and apertures placed above the specimen allow the user to select electrons that would otherwise be diffracted in a particular direction from entering the specimen.|$|R
25|$|TEM {{specimen}} stage designs include airlocks {{to allow for}} insertion of the <b>specimen</b> <b>holder</b> into the vacuum with minimal loss of vacuum {{in other areas of}} the microscope. The specimen holders hold a standard size of sample grid or self-supporting specimen. Standard TEM grid sizes are 3.05mm diameter, with a thickness and mesh size ranging from a few to 100μm. The sample is placed onto the meshed area having a diameter of approximately 2.5mm. Usual grid materials are copper, molybdenum, gold or platinum. This grid is placed into the sample holder, which is paired with the {{specimen stage}}. A wide variety of designs of stages and holders exist, depending upon the type of experiment being performed. In addition to 3.05mm grids, 2.3mm grids are sometimes, if rarely, used. These grids were particularly used in the mineral sciences where a large degree of tilt can be required and where specimen material may be extremely rare. Electron transparent specimens have a thickness usually less than 100nm, but this value depends on the accelerating voltage.|$|E

30|$|Several {{unconventional}} proposed {{improvements to}} general cryoEM have been reviewed in (Massover  2011) and might yield beneficial effects for cryoET and cryoSPT as well.

40|$|Abstract We have {{developed}} special <b>specimen</b> <b>holders</b> for double-sided low angle ion beam thinning and have systematically studied possible improvements {{of the resulting}} TEM specimens with respect to surface roughness, radiation-induced damage and contamination. The <b>specimen</b> <b>holders</b> are entirely made from graphite and were built for two different ion beam thinners. The design {{makes it possible to}} work at angles of incidence of 6 ° and lower and to precisely position the centre of rotation. The resulting specimen geometry was characterized with respect to a number of critical parameters. The surface topography was measured with atomic force microscopy, defect-induced localized strain was revealed by HRTEM and the thicknesses of contamination layers, carbon coating and amorphous oxide layers were quantitatively determined by electron spectroscopic imaging in an energy filtering TEM. It was found that the surface roughness not only decreases with decreasing angle of incidence, but also when the ion energy is lowered. In the low-angle regime, the thinning mechanism is based on the formation and propagation of ledges. Simultaneous ion bombardment from both sides {{has been found to be}} one of the most critical parameters...|$|R

50|$|Early {{problems}} that limited in situ electron microscopy included mechanical vibration at all scales (from the microscope {{itself to the}} sample), and thermal and electrical interference, particularly at the <b>specimen</b> <b>holder.</b> These problems all required fast capture times.

50|$|Today, the {{majority}} of microtomes are a knife-block design with a changeable knife, a <b>specimen</b> <b>holder</b> and an advancement mechanism. In most devices the cutting of the sample begins by moving the sample over the knife, where the advancement mechanism automatically moves forward such that the next cut for a chosen thickness can be made. The section thickness is controlled by an adjustment mechanism, allowing for precise control.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} tilting methods are the {{single-axis}} and the dual-axis tilting methods. The geometry of most <b>specimen</b> <b>holders</b> and electron microscopes normally precludes tilting the specimen through a full 180° range, {{which can lead}} to artifacts in the 3D reconstruction of the target. By using dual-axis tilting, the reconstruction artifacts are reduced by a factor of [...] compared to single-axis tilting. However, twice as many images need to be taken. Another method of obtaining a tilt-series is the so-called conical tomography method, in which the sample is tilted, and then rotated a complete turn.|$|R

50|$|The Darmstadt impact {{abrasion}} test was developed {{at a similar}} time but was not adopted by European Committee for Standardization. It involves dropping the test specimen onto a block of concrete and measuring the amount of wear or formation of holes. The specimen is held on {{the outer edge of}} a rotating arm and is travelling at speeds of up to 120 km/hr when it hits the surface. As the <b>specimen</b> <b>holder</b> is no longer driven, once dropped, the sample will slide on the concrete surface until it stops due to surface friction between it and the concrete surface.|$|E

The <b>specimen</b> <b>holder</b> is complemented with a measuring system, e.g. a distance sensor system of various kinds to complete the monitoring sensor. While bombarded by shot, the captured Almen round gets bent in direction of the attack. The linear transformation gets converted into an electric signal sent to a processing unit. With calibration discs, errors will be minimalized. For the offline measuring of an individual round, the online monitoring sensor or an appropriate device will also be used.|$|E
