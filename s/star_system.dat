5000|$|In {{the past}} {{scientists}} thought that planets {{would be unlikely}} to form around binary stars. However, recent simulations indicate that planets are just as likely to form around binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> as single-star systems. Of the 3457 exoplanets currently known, 146 actually orbit binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> (and 39 orbit multiple <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> with 3 or more stars). Specifically, they orbit what are known as [...] "wide" [...] binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> where the two stars are fairly far apart (several AU). Tatooine appears to be of the other type — a [...] "close" [...] binary, where the stars are very close, and the planets orbit their common center of mass.|$|R
5|$|Iota1 Normae is a {{multiple}} <b>star</b> <b>system.</b> The AB (mag 5.2 and 5.76) pair orbit {{each other with}} a period of 26.9years; they are 2.77 and 2.71times as massive as the Sun respectively. The pair are 128 ± 6light-years distant from Earth. A third component is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V with an apparent magnitude of 8.02.|$|E

5|$|The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 {{reported}} that observations {{of four of}} the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them—R and S Microscopii—are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, {{and the other two}} U and RY Microscopii are more difficult still. Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic <b>star</b> <b>system</b> composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low metallicity. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the <b>star</b> <b>system</b> has its origin in the galactic halo of the Milky Way.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} number of science fiction works have explored the imaginative possibilities of binary or multiple <b>star</b> <b>systems.</b> Many real <b>stars</b> near the Sun belong in this category.

40|$|Abstract. Accurate {{identification}} of physical binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> has become of increasing interest in recent years. The {{frequency of occurrence}} of binary and multiple <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> remains uncertain at the present time, and is a stumbling block {{to our understanding of}} the formation of <b>stars,</b> stellar <b>systems,</b> and planetary systems. Identification of physical binary <b>star</b> <b>systems,</b> with an estimated reliability of such identifications based on the theory of probability, is also important for current and future efforts to find binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> that are candidates for observations with the aim of determining their orbits and component masses. We shall present methods which allow the {{identification of}} physical binary stars in a probabilistic sense. The application of probability the-ory provides a more complete picture of the frequency of stellar binarity than simple methods based only on proximity or proper motion. We will also present preliminary results from the application of these meth-ods to Pulkovo’s observation program of binary <b>star</b> <b>systems,</b> and outline how such methods might be applied to present and future high precision astrometric catalogues. 1...|$|R
50|$|Multiple <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> or {{physical}} multiple <b>stars</b> are <b>systems</b> {{of more than}} two stars. Various multiple <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> may be called triple if they contain three stars; quadruple if they contain four stars, quintuple for five stars, and so on. These systems are smaller than open star clusters, which have more complex dynamics and typically have from 100 to 1,000 stars.|$|R
5|$|A close binary <b>star</b> <b>system</b> {{occurs when}} two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such <b>star</b> <b>system</b> with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E
5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary <b>star</b> <b>system,</b> changing in brightness as one star passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we have {{reviewed}} the present status of the theory of equilibrium configurations of compact binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> in Newtonian gravity. Evolutionary processes of compact binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> due to gravitational wave emission can be divided into three stages according to the time scales and configurations. The evolution is quasi-stationary until a merging process starts, since the time scale of the orbital change due to gravitational wave emission is longer than the orbital period. In this stage, equilibrium sequences can be applied to evolution of compact binary <b>star</b> <b>systems.</b> Along the equilibrium sequences, there appear several critical states where some instability sets in or configuration changes drastically. We have discussed relations among these critical points and have stressed the importance of the mass overflow as well as the dynamical instability of orbital motions. Concerning the equilibrium sequences of binary <b>star</b> <b>systems,</b> we have summarized classical results of incompressible ellipsoidal configurations. Recent results of compressible binary <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> obtained by the ellipsoidal approximation and by numerical computations have been shown and discussed. It {{is important to note that}} numerical computational solutions to exact equations show that compressibility may lead realistic neutron <b>star</b> binary <b>system...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} {{variable stars}} {{are those that}} undergo {{a dramatic change in}} their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary <b>star</b> <b>system</b> that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary <b>star</b> <b>system.</b> This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a European and American science team at the 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further {{raised the possibility of}} the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary <b>star</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} is in a binary <b>star</b> <b>system</b> and is accreting matter from its companion, {{a variety of}} {{phenomena}} may occur, including novae and Type Ia supernovae. It {{may also be a}} super-soft x-ray source if it is able to take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface. A close binary system of two white dwarfs can radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves, causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge.|$|E

This may be partly due to sample bias, as massive and bright stars tend to be in binaries and these are most easily observed and catalogued; a more precise analysis has suggested that the more common fainter stars are usually singular, and that up to two thirds of all stellar systems are therefore solitary.|$|R

Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
