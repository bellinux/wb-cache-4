The generator {{is assumed to}} be running at steady-state with a certain real and reactive power flow conditions when a sudden disturbance occurs. An example of the disturbance may be a sudden disconnection from the utility grid. The generator is modeled using the universal machine model and the grid is represented by a constant voltage source.

The nanotube is subjected to a constant current- or voltage bias and it is shown that when the electro-mechanical coupling exceeds a certain critical value the system becomes unstable to <b>self-excitations</b> of the mechanical vibrations accompanied by oscillations in the voltage drop and current through the nanotube. The critical value typically depends on the quality factor and some function of the mechanical and electronic relaxation times.

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for self-excited vibration of an automotive wiper. The self-excited vibration is generated by a stick-slip motion. It is of practical importance to suppress the self-excited vibration of the wiper. To find out modal coupling in the vibration of the wiper, simplified wiper is constructed. Movement of simplified wiper is separated into horizontal and vertical directions to simulate a motion of the actual wiper. The simplified wiper and the actual wiper are used for experiments. Static deformation of a wiper blade is measured. The blade is pressed on a glass surface. The wiper blade shows characteristics of soft-hardening spring involving a buckled deformation. Modal coupling in the self-excited vibration is examined by sweeping the wiper on a rotating glass table with constant angular velocity. Increasing a load pressed on the blade, coupling vibration is generated due to <b>self-excitations</b> along glass surface and parametric movements in vertical direction. The vibration amplitude is suppressed extremely when the load {{is close to the}} buckling load. Moreover, the maximum Lyapnov exponent of the dynamic response shows least number of the modes contributed to the self-excited vibration...|$|R
40|$|Drum brake squeal is {{a common}} discomfort. The main goal of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the mechanisms that generate drum brake squeal {{and to create a}} base for the search for solutions. A series of steps towards the understanding of these mechanisms are taken. Firstly, a simple model for friction-induced vibration is presented. The solutions to this model might be unstable in spite of a constant coefficient of friction. The essential thing observed is that a coupling between different modes is necessary to form instabilities. The coupling is shown to be between two translational degrees of freedom. Secondly, the mathematical model for friction-induced vibration is refined to take the flexibility of the drum, shoes and linings into account. This model is used to study the mechanisms that couple modes. The analysis shows that there are four mechanisms present in generating drum brake squeal. These mechanisms all occur owing to lining deformations, and the instability type is given the name "Lining Deformation Induced Instabilities". The mechanisms create waves that move in different directions. In a squealing brake, all the waves are superposed, which leads the solution towards a standing wave. A standing wave or synchronous vibration is always stable, and if a pure synchronous vibration is created, the noise would be eliminated at the source. The experimental partt of the investigation concerns the measurement of the vibration of a drum brake. The deflection shape is measured in operation, i. e. while the vehicle is running on a test ground. The deflection shape covers radial vibrations of the drum as well as radial and tangential vibrations of the leading shoe. The accelerometers are distributed both axially and tangentially on both the shoe and the drum. Finally, a finite element model for friction-induced vibration and noise generation is used to study the influence of different <b>self-excitations</b> on drum brake squeal. The model is semi-three-dimensional, with a two-dimensional drum and three-dimensional shoes. A contact element is derived that takes the friction variation into account as well as follower forces and negative. my. -velocity slope. For the brake analyzed, the results are: "Stick-Slip" is impossible for vehicle speeds over 0. 04 km/h. The destabilizing effect of the "Negative. my. -Velocity Slope" is less than the stabilizing effect of the material damping of the parts. "Self-Locking" is shown to be impossible. The "Lining Deformation Induced Instability" type results in great squeal propensity. The instabilities from "Follower Forces" are negligible. The rotation of the drum gives frequency shifts that stabilize the brake. The frequencies and mode shapes generated from the model with the lining deformation induced instability type show very good agreement with the measured ones. With the knowledge of the mechanisms behind and characteristics of drum brake squeal, a set of solution classes is outlined. A series of examples is given to show the usefulness of such classes as an aid in the creative process of generating solution principles...|$|R

50|$|The superradiant phase {{transition}} was originally {{predicted by the}} Dicke model of superradiance, which assumes that atoms have only two energetic levels and that these interact with only one mode of the electromagnetic field.The {{phase transition}} occurs when {{the strength of the}} interaction between the atoms and the field is greater than the energy of the non-interacting part of the system. (This is similar to the case of superconductivity in ferromagnetism, which leadsto the dynamic interaction between ferromagnetic atoms and the spontaneous ordering of excitations below the critical temperature.)The collective Lamb shift, relating to the system of atoms interacting with the vacuum fluctuations, becomes comparable to the energies of atoms alone, and the vacuumfluctuations cause the spontaneous <b>self-excitation</b> of matter.|$|E

Rado von Kövesligethy discovered laws of black body radiation before Planck and Wien.Hungary is famous for its excellent mathematics education which has trained numerous outstanding scientists. Famous Hungarian mathematicians include father Farkas Bolyai and son János Bolyai, designer of modern geometry (non-Euclidean geometry) 1820-1823. János Bolyai is together with John von Neumann considered as the greatest Hungarian mathematician ever. The most prestigious Hungarian scientific award is named in honor of János Bolyai. Paul Erdős, famed for publishing in over forty languages and whose Erdős numbers are still tracked;and John von Neumann, Quantum Theory, Game theory a pioneer of digital computing and the key mathematician in the Manhattan Project. Many Hungarian scientists, including Zoltán Bay, Victor Szebehely (gave a practical solution to the three-body problem, Newton solved the two-body problem), Mária Telkes, Imre Izsak, Erdős, von Neumann, Leó Szilárd, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller emigrated to the US. The other cause of scientist emigration was the Treaty of Trianon, by which Hungary, diminished by the treaty, became unable to support large-scale, costly scientific research; therefore some Hungarian scientists made valuable contributions in the United States. Thirteen Hungarian or Hungarian-born scientists received the Nobel Prize: von Lenárd, Bárány, Zsigmondy, von Szent-Györgyi, de Hevesy, von Békésy, Wigner, Gábor, Polányi, Oláh, Harsányi, and Herskó. All emigrated, mostly because of persecution of communist and/or fascist regimes. Names in psychology are János Selye founder of Stress-theory and Csikszentmihalyi founder of Flow- theory.

To find this capacitor value two nonlinear equations have to be solved. Different numerical methods for solving these equations are known from previous literature.

Here we consider in more details the mechanisms of mitral cell <b>self-excitation</b> and its physiological relevance. We show that both ionotropic NMDA and non-NMDA autoreceptors are activated by glutamate released from primary and secondary dendrites. In contrast to non-NMDA autoreceptors, NMDA autoreceptors are almost exclusively located on secondary dendrites and their activation generates a large and sustained <b>self-excitation.</b> Both intracellularly evoked and miniature NMDA-R mediated synaptic potentials are blocked by intracellular bis-(o-aminophenoxy) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) and result from a calcium-dependent release of glutamate. <b>Self-excitation</b> can be produced by a single spike, and trains of spikes result in frequency facilitation.

The reason is the growing emphasis on alternative energy sources, and the need for a suitable electric generator to match the requirement of operational simplicity and cost effectiveness. Although the induction generator has already emerged as an alternative choice to the synchronous generator in such areas as stand-alone wind energy farms and remote hydro-electric applications, research efforts are still directed to the understanding of <b>self-excitation</b> boundaries of the stand-alone unit.
