40|$|BACKGROUND: Prolonged cold {{preservation}} frequently causes delayed renal graft function {{resulting from}} tubular epithelial injury. Inhibition of signal transduction downstream from protein kinase C (PKC) may reduce renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and confer renal graft protection. We therefore evaluated {{the effect of}} <b>sotrastaurin,</b> a small-molecule inhibitor of Ca ²⁺ -dependent and Ca ²⁺ -independent PKC isoforms, in comparison with mycophenolic acid (MPA) on rat renal transplants with prolonged cold preservation. METHODS: Donor kidneys from male Lewis rats were cold stored in University of Wisconsin solution for 24 hr before syngeneic grafting. Recipients received <b>sotrastaurin</b> (30 mg/kg twice daily), MPA (20 mg/kg/day), or vehicle through gavage starting 1 hr after surgery. Renal function was evaluated by serum creatinine and histology on day 2 (acute injury) and day 7 (repair phase) after transplantation. Postreperfusion inflammation was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction of proinflammatory genes and histology. Signaling mechanisms were studied by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: <b>Sotrastaurin</b> enhanced immediate transplant function, attenuated epithelial injury, and accelerated renal function recovery compared with MPA. Despite the stronger anti-inflammatory capacity of MPA, only <b>sotrastaurin</b> treatment achieved significant cellular protection with persisting reduced apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells. Decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and p 66 Shc adaptor protein, both involved in cellular stress and apoptosis, were likely the responsible mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: The PKC inhibitor <b>sotrastaurin</b> effectively ameliorated ischemia-reperfusion organ damage and promoted cytoprotection in a clinically relevant model of extended renal cold preservation followed by transplantation. Pharmacologic targeting of PKC may be beneficial for recipients receiving renal transplants at risk for delayed graft function. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} all successes in {{transplantation}} medicine the search for new immunosuppressive substances is a urgent need.

The effectivity of this drug was tested in de novo transplanted patients. To expand the understanding of the mechanism of action we evaluated <b>Sotrastaurin</b> in detailed in vitro studies with human T-cells. We especially analyzed the impact on T-cell-activation processes. According to therapeutic concentrations in kidneytransplanted patients mononuclear cells were treated with different dosages of <b>Sotrastaurin.</b> This resulted in a significant reduction of the surface marker expression of ICOS, CTLA- 4, CD 71, CD 25, CXCR 3, Ox 40, CXCR 3 und PD- 1 on activated t-cells. The expression of the early t-cell-activation marker CD 69 was not affected. Furthermore the treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the crucial cytokines IL- 2 as well as IFN. The influence on proliferation, the endpoint of the t-cell-activation, showed to be significant and dose-dependent. The analyzed surface markers represent important signals within the rejection process. They bind cytokines, enable intercellular communication or act as costimuli. By impeding these activating processes the early phase of rejection is blocked. By inhibiting other important steps of the clonal t-cell-expansion, like the production of IL- 2 or the expression of the subunit of the IL- 2 -receptor CD 25, a reduction of t-cell-proliferation was observed in our studies.

40|$|MPA {{suppresses}} ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis {{and cell}} proliferation in T cells through TIF-IA, a GTP binding protein. • The combination of MPA and <b>sotrastaurin</b> potently suppresses T-cell proliferation and inhibits IL- 2 secretion through TIF-IA and ErbB 3 -binding protein 1 (Ebp 1). Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, an effective immunosuppressive drug. Both MPA and mycophenolate mofetil are highly specific inhibitors of guanine nucleotide synthesis and of T-cell activation. However, the mech-anism by which guanine nucleotide depletion suppresses T-cell activation is unknown. Depletion of GTP inhibits ribosomal RNA synthesis in T cells by inhibiting transcription initiation factor I (TIF-IA), a GTP-binding protein that recruits RNA polymerase I to the ribosomal DNA promoter. TIF-IA–GTP binds the ErbB 3 -binding protein 1, {{and together they}} enhance the transcription of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). GTP binding by TIF-IA and ErbB 3 -binding protein 1 phosphorylation by protein kinase C d are both required for optimal PCNA expression.

40|$|The calcineurin inhibitor, {{tacrolimus}} (TAC), inhibits {{the protein}} phosphatase activity of calcineurin, leading to {{suppression of the}} nuclear translocation of NFAT and inhibition of T cell activation. Apart from NFAT also the transcription factor NF-kB plays a key functional role in T cell activation. Therefore, blockade of the NF-kB activation cascade by immunosuppressive drugs prevents immune activation. Here we studied whether TAC blocks NF-kB activation in peripheral human T cells. After anti-CD 3 /CD 28 -activation of T cells from healthy volunteers, NF-kB (p 65) phosphorylation was measured by flow cytometry in CD 3 + T cells, CD 4 + helper T cells and CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells in the absence and presence of TAC 10 ng/mL, <b>sotrastaurin</b> 500 nM (positive control) and mycophenolic acid 10 mg/mL (negative control; n = 6). NF-kB transcriptional activity was measured by ELISA and intracellular TNFa protein, a downstream target, was measured by flow cytometry to assess the functional consequences of NF-kB blockade. Anti-CD 3 / 28 -activation induced NF-kB phosphorylation in CD 3 + T cells, CD 4 + T cells and CD 8 + T cells by 34 % (mean), 38 % and 30 % resp.

40|$|A {{polymorphic}} {{variant of}} the phosphatase PTPN 22 {{has been associated with}} increased risk for multiple autoimmune diseases. The risk allele is thought to function by diminishing antigen-receptor signals responsible for negative selection of autoreactive lymphocytes. We now show that PTPN 22 is markedly overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a common malignancy of autoreactive B lymphocytes. We also show that overexpression of PTPN 22 significantly inhibits antigen-induced apoptosis of primary CLL cells by blocking B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways that negatively regulate lymphocyte survival. More importantly, we show that PTPN 22 positively regulates the antiapoptotic AKT kinase, which provides a powerful survival signal to antigen-stimulated CLL cells. This selective uncoupling of AKT from other downstream BCR signaling pathways is a result of inhibition of a negative regulatory circuit involving LYN, CD 22, and SHIP. Finally, we show that PTPN 22 can be effectively down-regulated by the PKC inhibitors ruboxistaurin and <b>sotrastaurin,</b> resulting in enhanced killing of CLL cells exposed to proapoptotic BCR stimuli. Collectively, these data suggest that PTPN 22 overexpression represents a protective mechanism that allows autoantigen-activated CLL cells to escape from negative selection and indicate that this mechanism could be exploited for therapeutic purposes by targeting PTPN 22 with PKC inhibitors...|$|E

AEB-treated recipients exhibited similar glucose homeostasis as vehicle-treated controls, which was better than in sirolimus-treated recipients. Human islets cultured with AEB showed similar rates of β-cell apoptosis (p = 0. 98 by one-way ANOVA) and glucose stimulated insulin secretion (p = 0. 15) as those cultured with vehicle.

Interestingly, 'capping' the hydroxyl group at C 26 of a lead bryostatin analog, a position {{known to be}} crucial for binding to and modulation of protein kinase C (PKC), did not abrogate the anti-CHIKV activity of the scaffold, putatively indicating the involvement of a pathway independent of PKC. The work detailed in this study demonstrates that salicylate-derived analog 1 and two capped analogs (2 and 3) are not merely cytoprotective compounds, but act as selective and specific inhibitors of CHIKV replication. Further, a detailed comparative analysis {{of the effect of}} the non-capped versus the two capped analogs revealed that compound 1 acts both at early and late stages in the chikungunya virus replication cycle, while the capped analogs only interfere with a later stage process. Co-dosing with the PKC inhibitors <b>sotrastaurin</b> and Gö 6976 counteracts the antiviral activity of compound 1 without affecting that of capped analogs 2 and 3, providing further evidence that the latter elicit their anti-CHIKV activity independently of PKC. Remarkably, treatment of CHIKV-infected cells with a combination of compound 1 and a capped analog resulted in a pronounced synergistic antiviral effect.

Individuals who undergo transplantation must chronically be maintained on an immunosuppression regimen for rejection prophylaxis to help ensure graft survival. Current rejection prophylaxis consists of {{using a combination of}} calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, antimetabolite agents, and/or corticosteroids. These agents have collectively improved the short-term outcomes of renal transplantation, but improvements in late/chronic graft loss and recipient survival have lagged significantly behind challenging the field of transplantation to develop novel prophylactic agents. There have been several clinical trials conducted within the last 5 years in an attempt to bring such novel agents to the commercial market. These trials have resulted in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of extended-release tacrolimus, as well as belatacept, which has the potential to replace calcineurin inhibitors for rejection prophylaxis. Other trials have focused on the development of novel calcineurin inhibitors (voclosporin), costimulation blockade (ASKP 1240 and alefacept), kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib and <b>sotrastaurin),</b> and inhibitors of leukocyte migration (efalizumab). While these later agents have not been FDA-approved for use in transplantation, they remain noteworthy, as these agents explore pathways not previously targeted for allograft-rejection prophylaxis. The purpose of this review was to consolidate available clinical trial data with regard to the recent developments in rejection prophylaxis in kidney transplantation.

40|$|Brazil is {{a country}} with over 190 000 000 {{inhabitants}} and a health system composed of a large public, government managed system. Between 1999 and 2010 the number of deceased donors increased by 161 %, from 3. 8 to 9. 9 pmp, {{and the number of}} solid organ transplants increased by 121 %, from 2891 to 6402. This growth was a consequence of the creation of a well-organized national transplant program. Government funding, decentralization and educational investment in transplant coordinators and related professional were decisive. in 2009 Brazil was the second largest country in the absolute number of kidney transplants (n = 4259). There are significant region disparities in performance which are mainly due to the development status. Improvements in transplant and research regulations resulted in an increasing participation of Brazilian transplant centers in multicenter trials, reaching over 44 studies during the last 11 years. Brazilian centers have been involved in clinical trials using everolimus, sirolimus, fingolimod, mycophenolate mofetyl, mycophenolate sodium, tacrolimus modified-release, <b>sotrastaurin,</b> belatacept, JAK 3 inhibitor CP 690, 550 and valganciclovir. the still increasing number of transplants performed every year along with more efficient regulatory and sanitary analysis, organized clinical research programs and reduction in region performance disparities will eventually increase even more the participation of Brazil in trials worldwide.

40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) degrades {{angiotensin}} (Ang) II to Ang-(1 - 7), {{and protects}} against diabetic renal injury. Soluble ACE 2 fragments are shed from the proximal tubule, and appear {{at high levels}} in the urine with diabetes. High glucose-induced shedding of ACE 2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by the enzyme a disintegrin and metalloproteinase- 17 (ADAM 17). Here, we investigated the mechanism for constitutive shedding of ACE 2. Mouse proximal tubular cells were cultured and ACE 2 shedding into the media was assessed by enzyme activity assay and immunoblot analysis. Cells were incubated with pharmacologic inhibitors, or transfected with silencing (si) RNA. Incubation of proximal tubular cells with increasing concentrations of D-glucose stimulated ACE 2 shedding, which peaked at 16 mM, while L-glucose (osmotic control) {{had no effect on}} shedding. In cells maintained in 7. 8 mM D-glucose, ACE 2 shedding was significantly inhibited by the pan-protein kinase C (PKC) antagonist <b>sotrastaurin,</b> but not by an inhibitor of ADAM 17. Incubation of cells with the PKC-α and -β 1 -specific inhibitor Go 6976, the PKC β 1 and β 2 -specific inhibitor ruboxistaurin, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases- 2,- 8, and - 9, or an inhibitor of ADAM 10 (GI 250423 X) had no effect on basal ACE 2 shedding. By contrast, the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin significantly inhibited both constitutive and high glucose-induced ACE 2 shedding. Transfection of cells with siRNA directed against PKC-δ reduced ACE 2 shedding by 20 %, while knockdown of PKC-ε was without effect. These results indicate that constitutive shedding of ACE 2 from proximal tubular cells is mediated by PKC-δ, which is also linked to high glucose-induced shedding. Targeting PKC-δ may preserve membrane-bound ACE 2 in proximal tubule in disease states and diminish Ang II-stimulated adverse signaling...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} {{characteristics of a}} serous retinopathy associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition with binimetinib treatment for metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM) and uveal melanoma (UM), and to determine possible pathogenetic mechanisms {{that may lead to}} this retinopathy. DESIGN: Prospective observational, cohort-based, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty CM patients and 5 UM patients treated with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib (CM) or a combination of binimetinib and the protein kinase C inhibitor <b>sotrastaurin</b> (UM). METHODS: Extensive ophthalmic examination was performed, including Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study best-corrected visual acuity, applanation tonometry, slit-lamp examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy, digital color fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). In selected cases, additional examinations were performed, including visual field testing and electro-oculography (EOG). Blood samples were obtained from 3 CM patients and 3 UM patients to analyze the presence of autoantibodies against retinal and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) proteins. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual symptoms, visual acuity, fundus appearance, characteristics on OCT, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and EOG. RESULTS: Six CM patients (20 %) and 2 UM patients (40 %) reported visual symptoms during the study. The median time to the onset of symptoms, which were all mild and transient, was 3. 5 days (range, < 1 hour to 3 weeks). On OCT, subretinal fluid (SRF) was detected in 77 % of CM patients and 60 % of UM patients. In the 26 patients with SRF, the fovea was affected in 85 %. After the start of the medication, an EOG was performed in 19 eyes of 11 patients; 16 of these eyes (84 %) developed SRF on OCT. Fifteen of these eyes (94 %) showed an abnormal Arden ratio (< 1. 65). A broad pattern of anti-retinal antibodies was found in 3 CM patients and 2 UM patients tested, whereas anti-RPE antibodies were detected in all 6 tested patients. CONCLUSIONS: A time-dependent and reversible serous retinopathy can develop both in patients with metastatic CM and UM treated with binimetinib. A minority of patients develop visual symptoms, which are generally mild and transient. A cause of binimetinib-associated serous retinopathy may be toxicity of medication, but autoantibodies also may be involved...|$|E
