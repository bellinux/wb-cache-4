5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very <b>small</b> <b>in</b> Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively.

In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region {{own special}} {{ecological}} environment. Aiming at their particular climate characteristics, the green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region was studied. Through analyzing {{the problems of}} the green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, the study proposes five levels planning strategy, including developing the regional integrated green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, building the stable green network structure of town, improving quantity and quality of green space of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, strengthening winter landscape construction of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, and inheriting ice and snow culture of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region, in order to promote the sustainable development of green space system planning of <b>small</b> towns <b>in</b> cold region...|$|R

Although the support from Emir Abdullah was relatively <b>small</b> <b>in</b> quantity, the French authorities feared {{it was part}} of a plot by Abdullah and his British allies to oust the French from Syria. Hananu, meanwhile, was launching frequent hit-and-run operations against the French left flank in the area between Urfa and Antioch in an effort to support the Turks at the main battlefront in Gaziantep.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} moderating role of attempted dietary restraint {{on the amount}} of food consumed from <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages versus large food in large packages. Four experiments demonstrate that restrained eaters consume more calories from <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages, while unrestrained eaters consume more calories from large food in a large package. For restrained eaters, overconsumption of the <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages results from a lapse in self-control caused by the stress of perceiving conflicting food information: the <b>small</b> food <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packages is perceived as both diet food and high in calories.

30|$|Structural {{connectivity}} results (i.e., fiber density values) for {{the three}} groups are reported in Table  2, which shows the {{mean and standard deviation}} (SD) for the fiber density values of 16 connections. The values were computed from both hemispheres. Overall, nine connections were significantly different between PD and NC. Of these connections, seven connections were <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> PD compared with NC and two connections were <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> NC compared with PD (p <  0.05, corrected). Four connections were significantly different between SWEDD and NC. Among these connections, two connections were <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> NC and two connections were <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> SWEDD (p <  0.05, corrected). Nine connections showed significant differences between PD and SWEDD. Among these connections, seven connections were <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> PD and two connections were <b>smaller</b> <b>in</b> SWEDD (p <  0.05, corrected). PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex-thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and pallidum–thalamus connections. SWEDD patients showed significant differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and SN–thalamus connections. PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with SWEDD in associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen, pallidum–thalamus and putamen–thalamus connections. Associative cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–putamen and pallidum–putamen connections were commonly identified as significant in NC-PD, SWEDD-NC and SWEDD-PD comparisons, as shown in italic font in Table  2.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are <b>small.</b> <b>In</b> the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E

A country may be extremely <b>small</b> <b>in</b> area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small. This may occur if {{a large part of the}} country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E
