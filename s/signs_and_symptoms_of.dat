Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. Hypopituitarism is a rare disease, but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.|$|E

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories {{do not have the}} ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

40|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious acute complications of type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) and the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with T 1 D. This study was aimed at assessing the prevalence and associated factors of DKA in children with newly diagnosed T 1 D in Addis Ababa. A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted in selected hospitals in Addis Ababa. Children below the age of 12 years with DKA who were admitted to the pediatric ward in the selected hospitals between January 2009 and December 2014 and the residence of Addis Ababa were included. DKA was defined as children below the age of 12 years who have blood glucose level ≥ 250 mg/dl, ketonuria, and ketonemia and diagnosed being T 1 D patient for the first time. Descriptive statistics was performed using frequency distribution, mean, median, tables, and graphs. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the prevalence of DKA in children with newly diagnosed T 1 D. Of 395 DKA patients who were hospitalized during the five-year period, 142 (35. 8 %) presented with DKA at first diagnosis of diabetes. On the other hand 253 (64. 2 %) children with DKA had longstanding T 1 D. Independent factors associated with DKA include: Age category 2 - 4. 49 years, 7 - 9. 49 years and ≥ 9. 5 years (Adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 3. 14 [1. 21, 8. 06]), 3. 44 (1. 39, 8. 49) and 4. 02 (1. 68, 9. 60), respectively); parents' knowledge on the <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> DKA (AOR = 0. 51 [0. 27, 0. 95]); <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> DKA before the onset of DKA (AOR = 0. 35 [0. 21, 0. 59]) and infection prior to DKA onset (AOR = 3. 45 [1. 97, 6. 04]). The overall proportion of children diagnosed with DKA and new onset of T 1 D in Addis Ababa was high.

40|$|Introduction: Hypertension is a {{major public}} health problem and an {{established}} major risk factor for developing myocardial infarction (MI). However, {{majority of the population}} with hypertension does not have sufficient knowledge regarding early <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> MI as the <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> appear in a confusing way hence causes delay in seeking treatment. Aim of the Study: Assess the effectiveness of planned teaching program (PTP) on knowledge regarding early <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> MI among hypertensive patients. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental research approach with nonrandomized control group design was used. Through purposive sampling, sixty patients were selected (thirty in each experimental and control groups). Data were collected with interview method by using self-structured knowledge questionnaire. Pretest was taken, and PTP was administered to experimental group only. After 7 days, posttest was taken from both groups. Collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: In experimental group, mean pretest knowledge score was 13. 87 and posttest mean knowledge score was 23. 57. In control group, mean pretest knowledge score was 13. 97 and posttest mean knowledge score 13. 83. As per t-test, difference between mean posttest knowledge score (23. 57, 13. 83) of both groups was found statistically significant (t = 15. 767 ***, P< 0. 001). Conclusion: PTP significantly improved the knowledge of patients.

5|$|<b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> {{poisoning}} by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal {{in nature}} and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E

By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
