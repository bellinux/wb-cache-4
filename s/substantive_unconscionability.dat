5000|$|Unconscionability is {{a defense}} to the {{enforcement}} of a contract. Most jurisdictions in the United States determine unconscionability based on two prongs: procedural unconscionability and <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability.</b> Procedural unconscionability arises from [...] "contract formation" [...] issues such as inconspicuous terms or terms offered on a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it basis", while <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability</b> arises from [...] "overly-harsh" [...] or [...] "one-sided" [...] terms.|$|E
50|$|Procedural {{unconscionability}} {{is seen as}} {{the disadvantage}} suffered by a weaker party in negotiations, whereas <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability</b> refers to the unfairness of terms or outcomes. Most often the former will lead to the latter, but not always. The existence of the procedural unconscionability without <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability</b> may be sufficient to set aside a contract, but the latter, by itself, may not. As with issues of consideration, the court's role is not to determine whether someone has made a good or bad bargain, but merely whether that party had the opportunity to properly judge what was best in their own interests.|$|E
5000|$|To avoid {{a ruling}} of {{procedural}} unconscionability, some businesses began allowing consumers to reject ("opt out" [...] of) arbitration agreements {{at the time}} of entering into a contract without penalty. F. Paul Bland and Claire Prestel wrote that more consumers will fail to exercise an opt-out option (which may be inconspicuously placed in a contract and difficult to understand) than would affirmatively agree to arbitrate, citing consumer optimism that disputes will not arise and transaction costs. They added that having an opt-out option would only affect procedural unconscionability and would not apply to other defenses, nor would it prevent a ruling of unconscionability in jurisdictions where <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability</b> alone can make a contract term unenforceable. Deepak Gupta, who argued on behalf of the consumer respondents in Concepcion, said that those opt-out provisions are illusory since consumers would not likely opt out before a dispute arises. Plaintiffs and lawyers attributed the lack of opt-outs to consumers not being aware of the existence of the arbitration clause or not understanding the ramifications of not opting out. [...] Charles Gibbs wrote that consumers who opt out would only be able to join in a class action with other consumers who also opted out, and therefore such a class action would have less of a deterrent effect against the business.|$|E

Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., [...] (2000), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of California that defined the California {{standard}} for unconscionability.

40|$|This Article draws {{attention}} to a conceptual point that has been overlooked in recent discussions about the theoretical foundations of contract law. I argue that, rather than enforcing the obligations of promises, contract law concerns complaints against promissory wrongs. This conceptual distinction is easy to miss. If one assumes that complaints arise whenever an obligation has been violated, then the distinction does not seem meaningful. I show, however, that an obligation can be breached without giving rise to a valid complaint. This Article illustrates {{the importance of this}} conceptual distinction by focusing first on the doctrine of <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability.</b> I claim that the doctrine can be best explained by the way in which a party who engages in exploitative behavior may lose her moral standing to complain. It is because such a party has lost her moral standing to complain that the law, through unconscionability doctrine, bars her from bringing a legal complaint. This explanation avoids the oft-issued charge of paternalism and it also offers benefits over an alternative state-oriented account developed recently by Seana Shiffrin. Using the conceptual distinction behind this account of unconscionability, this Article further argues that recent theoretical debates about the relationship between contract law and morality have been largely misconceived. Those debates have focused on whether contract law and morality impose parallel obligations. Once one appreciates the difference between imposing obligations and recognizing complaints, the comparison looks quite different. Contract law recognizes valid complaints against broken promises, much as morality recognizes moral complaints...|$|E
40|$|When an {{individual}} signs {{a contract for}} voluntary repatriation through a private or public body, {{there may be a}} need to draw upon principles of contract law and to test contracts for unconscionability. In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, there may be procedural unconscionability when consent is only the result of fear of deportation or imprisonment, and <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability</b> when conditions after return include no access to basic necessities or persecution. At the same time, many asylum seekers and refugees do wish to return, despite conditions in the country of origin or because of conditions in the host country. Ethical issues regarding consent are therefore central. Yet, it is unclear how one would ensure consent under such conditions. While {{it may be possible to}} apply principles of paternalism and hypothetical consent in such cases, this may undermine the rights of those who wish to repatriate, and remove an option they otherwise would not have. This article argues that Parfit's Principle of Consent (CP) and Rights Principle (RP) may address these concerns and applies these principles to test for the unconscionability of two policies of repatriation of refugees and failed asylum seekers in Israel back to countries in Africa between 2009 and 2013. One policy was implemented by an NGO that repatriated failed asylum seekers to countries deemed safe, although returnees had no legal status to stay in Israel and were therefore at risk of deportation. A second NGO returned individuals to South Sudan, even though this was considered dangerous, but only returned South Sudanese who had the legal status to stay in Israel, as this was considered criteria for true voluntariness in the decision to return. By attempting to apply CP and RP in a test for unconscionability, this article addresses both the ethical dilemmas of repatriation of failed asylum seekers and refugees, as well as possible ways in which contracts, more generally, can be tested for unconscionability...|$|E
40|$|In the economy, {{contract}} {{formation and}} recontracting are costly, and these costs {{have important implications}} for contractual outcomes and economic objectives like efficiency. In this dissertation, I characterize systematically how reading costs and renegotiation costs affect contracting behavior, and I describe how third- party enforcement, conducted by institutions such as courts, might ameliorate efficiency problems associated with both types of costly contracting. Chapter I contains analysis of contracting and costly renegotiation using mechanism-design. The Renegotiation-Proofness Principle (RPP) is formalized: any state-contingent payoff vector that is implementable with renegotiation is also implemented by a mechanism in which renegotiation does not occur in equilibrium. The RPP is not valid. However, our more general monotonicity result confirms the RPP's "renegotiation is bad" message, because it shows the set of implementable state-contingent payoffs becomes larger as the costs of renegotiation increase. In the model of Chapter II, a buyer must incur a reading cost to understand payoffs sellers' contracts promise. An equilibrium with reading with reading exists in which the buyer reads offers with positive probability. Further monotonicity results characterize how the equilibrium depends two enforcement features. Increasing the lowest enforceable payoff reduces the equilibrium reading investment and encourages acceptance. And, reducing reading costs increases the buyer's reading probability, though the total reading investment is kept low. I indicate several existing institutional rules that limit contract payoffs or reduce reading costs. The penalty doctrine restricts private damages not to exceed harm; <b>substantive</b> <b>unconscionability</b> effectively excuses performance for a low payoff; and procedural unconscionability and disclosure regulations reduce reading costs. In Chapter III, interaction between a seller who offers a standard form contract and a buyer who reads it [...] under two-sided asymmetric information [...] reveals reading costs are not incurred in equilibrium. Payoff- based limitations on enforceable contracts therefore {{play a vital role in}} agreement, since any accepted contract will not have been read. An example and general discussion relate expected surplus generated in a no-reading equilibrium to contract payoff boundaries defined by enforcemen...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctrine}} of unconscionability, which a court may invoke to invalidate a contract, has a nonsubstantive and a substantive branch. Nonsubstantive unconscionability arises when certain factors, {{such as a}} lack of commercial sophistication, apparently prevent a contracting party from exercising his freedom to choose the terms of an agreement. <b>Substantive</b> <b>unconscionability</b> arises when a contract yields a result that affects a contracting party too harshly or that affects a noncontracting party adversely. Such contracts may include an agreement containing a disclaimer of warranties or an assignment of wages. These two branches of unconscionability hereinafter are labeled 2 ̆ 2 nonsubstantive 2 ̆ 2 factors or objections and 2 ̆ 2 substantive 2 ̆ 2 factors or objections, respectively. This article explores the nonsubstantive objections to the enforcement of a contract. These objections fall into four categories. The first category, poverty, involves those situations where a poor consumer, although he would prefer not to bear certain risks under a contract, can afford only with great difficulty an agreement that allocates these risks to the seller. The second category, market unresponsiveness, comprises two possible restrictions upon a contracting party 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of choice. First, a buyer accepting a standardized agreement may have to take terms that do not reflect his true preferences because the additional cost of particularizing the contract would exceed the additional benefit that he would derive from an individualized agreement. Second, a seller exercising monopoly power may offer a buyer fewer choices than would exist in a competitive market. The third category of nonsubstantive unconscionability, incompetency, addresses the problem of a buyer who may be too unsophisticated or too inept to make contracts that fully satisfy his preferences. The fourth category, lack of information, involves those situations where a contracting party lacks the information to make his preferences and purchases congruent, either because the information is unavailable or because the cost of finding and absorbing it exceeds, at the margin, the value of the information...|$|E
