5|$|The Russian army {{numbered}} nearly 98,000. It was {{commanded by}} generals Mikhail Krechetnikov and Mikhail Kakhovsky. The Russians {{also had an}} advantage in combat experience. The Russian plan called for Kakhovsky to advance through Ukraine, taking Kamieniec Podolski, Chełm and Lublin, and approach Polish capital of Warsaw from the south. Krechetnikov was to advance through Minsk, Wilno, Brześć Litewski and Białystok, and approach Warsaw from the north, where he was to link with Kakhovsky. Whereas the Russians had good intelligence network in Poland, and were mostly aware of Polish army distribution and strength; the Poles had much less intelligence, receiving contradictory and often erroneous reports, and unsure whether the war would even <b>start</b> <b>up</b> to the point the Russian troops crossed the border.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Bent {{was named}} interim captain of Aston Villa while Stiliyan Petrov {{continued}} {{to recover from}} leukaemia. On 28 August, Bent scored his first goal of 2012–13 in a 3–0 victory over League One team Tranmere Rovers {{in the second round}} of the League Cup, his first goal for Villa since February 2012. Bent lost the Villa captaincy to Ron Vlaar, after the Dutchman was appointed captain for the 2–0 victory against Swansea City on 15 September 2012 and thereafter. He scored his first league goal of the season on 22 September, in a 4–1 defeat away to Southampton. Bent then lost his starting place for the next league match against West Bromwich Albion, after the performances of Gabby Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke during the midweek League Cup victory over Manchester City saw the pair <b>start</b> <b>up</b> front.

5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and {{the grassy}} slopes may be undermined by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to <b>start</b> <b>up</b> spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting on the small islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E
