40|$|OBJECTIVES: Despite the {{widespread}} promotion of safety standards no epidemiological studies have adequately evaluated their effectiveness in preventing injury in falls from playground equipment. This study evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} the height and <b>surfacing</b> <b>requirements</b> of the New Zealand standard for playgrounds and playground equipment. SETTING: Early childhood education centres and schools in two major cities in the South Island of New Zealand. METHODS: Data were collected on 300 children aged 14 years or less who had fallen from playground equipment. Of these, 110 (cases) had sustained injury and received medical attention, while 190 (controls) had not sustained injury requiring medical attention. RESULTS: Logistic regression models fitted to the data indicated that the risk of injury being sustained in a fall was increased if the equipment failed to comply with the maximum fall height (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 7 to 13. 1), surfacing (OR = 2. 3; 95 % CI 1. 0 to 5. 0), or safe fall height (OR = 2. 1; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 4. 0) requirements. Falls from heights in excess of 1. 5 metres increased the risk of injury 4. 1 times that of falls from 1. 5 metres or less and it was estimated that a 45 % reduction in children attending emergency departments could be achieved if the maximum fall height was lowered to 1. 5 metres. CONCLUSIONS: Although the height and <b>surfacing</b> <b>requirements</b> of the New Zealand standard are effective in preventing injury in falls from playground equipment, consideration should be given to lowering the maximum permissible fall height to 1. 5 metres...|$|R

For this reason, DMLS would be useful for applications in the field of knee prosthesis. However, before DMLS components may be placed in the body, many requirements must be met for the implant to be considered safe and have long functionality in the body. One important aspect is surface roughness, which helps determine how well the components will osseointegrate with the bones in the body. The focus of this research was to determine the <b>surface</b> <b>requirements</b> of an established knee implant, which will be used as the criteria that DMLS must achieve for applications in this field. To determine the surface roughness values: Ra, Rq, and Rz, a profilometer was used on components of the knee implant and a DMLS tensile bar to make a comparison. The results showed that the DMLS part did not meet the roughest and smoothest <b>surface</b> <b>requirements</b> that were shown in the implant. According to this research, DMLS is not ready for applications in this field. However, the results in this research will allow DMLS to know the parameters needed to achieve this goal in future.

40|$|Abstract: At present, dry tool {{grinding}} {{is one of}} the most discussed research topics in modern manufacturing technology. There are several developments for grinding wheels and methods for determining optimum grinding parameters which enable good surface properties to be obtained. Another potential to achieve better surface quality for dry grinding is the intentional change in process kinematics. This change makes it possible to carry out the task of cooling, namely lubrication of the contact area, and cooling and evacuation of the chips. This paper proposes innovative face-grinding kinematics in order to improve the surface properties for {{tool grinding}}. First, the principles of the new grinding kinematics are described and, second, a method for optimization of the process parameters is presented in order to assure the given <b>surface</b> <b>requirements</b> for the face grinding of inserts with high productivity...|$|E

40|$|Children {{and young}} persons face a risky world from birth. How best {{to enhance their}} {{personal}} resilience and survival skills? Although rarely discussed in mainstream risk literature, {{this has been a}} topic of considerable controversy with apparently large variability in attitudes to children's risk exposure across Europe and beyond. The importance of raising capable and resilient children is of course self evident (Sandseter and Kennair, 2011). In the UK this conflict led in 1993 {{to the creation of a}} multi-actor body known as the Play Safety Forum (PSF, 1993), which has sought to promote a balanced approach to children's play. The PSF comprises a consortium of the four UK national play agencies, safety and child welfare organisations, and other agencies with interests in children and play including industry and standards-setting bodies. Major achievements include the publication of 'Managing risk in play provision' (PSF, 2008 a), 'Design for play' (PSF, 2008 b) and the introduction of risk-benefit assessment (PSF, 2015), the latter as a means of safeguarding what some regard as the essential and unavoidably risky elements of play. This paper will describe the history of these developments before discussing current challenges. In particular, the PSF has recently been concerned by proposals to rewrite or modify international Standards on play safety as promulgated by the ASTM in the USA and CEN in Europe in relation to <b>surfacing</b> <b>requirements</b> for fixed equipment, unsupervised, outdoor locations. Although this can involve highly technical considerations, playground standards on issues such as <b>surfacing</b> <b>requirements</b> do have major public policy implications for play provision both directly, through their significant cost implications and their sometimes detrimental effects on children and teenagers' play experiences, and indirectly, via their inherent philosophical leanings (Ball, 2004). Policy decisions should, of course, incorporate technical considerations, but also need to be sensitive to the wider aims and needs, in this case of developing children. This undoubtedly requires a multi-stakeholder approach drawing on expertise from widely different domains ranging over engineering, trauma, child development and health, with inputs from the social and natural sciences...|$|R
40|$|A {{cylinder}} liner possesses fairly intricate <b>surface</b> <b>requirements</b> {{due to its}} complicated functions. It needs to provide adequate surface roughness to resist wear {{as well as to}} store and retain lubricants during high temperatures. The liner surface texture is anisotropic, produced by the honing process, with resultant deep visible scratches left on it [1]. The prominence of the honing grooves observed suggests that surface texture significantly affects ring-pack performance, although this effect is not clearly understood. In this paper, a numerical model was developed to investigate the effects of groove characteristics on the lubrication condition and friction at the interface between the piston ring and {{cylinder liner}}. This model aims to solve the average Reynolds equation, which depends on the real surface topographies of the cylinder liner, and describes the influence of surface irregularities on the lubricant flow under hydrodynamic lubrication conditions, considering lubricant film rupture and cavitations. Numerical results help to determine the optimum lateral groove characteristics to reduce friction and then noxious emissions...|$|E

It seems likely that triggering is dependent on the overall ener-getics of cell-substratum interaction. Key words: adhesion, lamellae, Dictyostelium...|$|E

The reflected energy is less than 1 per cent for angles of reflection less than 40 Â°. When the Rayleigh wave impinges upon the less rigid medium, the reflected energy decreases as the angle of incidence increases; whereas for incidence at the more rigid medium, the reflected energy decreases at first, and then it increases as the angle of incidence increases.
