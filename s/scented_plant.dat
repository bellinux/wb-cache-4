5000|$|Dried <b>scented</b> <b>plant</b> {{material}} {{has been used}} in rooms since ancient times, in a variety of ways, including just scattering them on floors. In early 17th Century France fresh herbs and flowers were gathered—starting in spring and continuing throughout the summer. The herbs were left {{for a day or two}} to become limp, then layered with coarse sea salt. The aging mixture was stirred occasionally as layers were added to it. Often the mixture would ferment or even mold as the summer went by. In fall, spices would be added to the unsightly grey mix until a pleasant fragrance was achieved, then scent preserving fixatives (see below) were added. The finished potpourri was set out in special pots with perforated lids to perfume rooms.|$|E
50|$|The Oak Park Conservatory has {{professional}} staff. Its extensive {{network of}} volunteers works {{under the name}} of Friends of the Oak Park Conservatory (or FOPCON), since 1986. The Conservatory director hired in 1984, John Seaton, asked the volunteers to organize themselves, which they did in 1986; since then, they have raised over $840,000 for Conservatory improvements. Volunteers organize a plant sale in early May each year to raise funds for the Conservatory, and supply gardeners with an interesting variety of plants. It began as the Herb and <b>Scented</b> <b>Plant</b> Sale, and has changed over time to include edibles and ornamental plants, grown without pesticides in the greenhouses of the Conservatory. The volunteer web site includes information for gardeners, and the list of events for the year. Besides the plant sale, there are two perennial plant exchanges, spring and fall. Gardeners bring in healthy plants from their own gardens, to exchange for other types from plants brought by other gardeners. FOPCON also offers a garden walk through admirable local gardens as another fund raising event in June. Tours of the Conservatory are offered for groups and for schools, led by the volunteers.|$|E

50|$|The {{incident}} of {{the worship of}} the Golden Calf is narrated in the Qur'an and other Islamic literature. The Qur'an narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to Mount Sinai for Divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to fast for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a <b>scented</b> <b>plant</b> to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (Harun) was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Qur'an names Samiri raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had. Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt. There is a sharp contrast between the Qur'anic and the biblical accounts the prophet Aaron's actions. The Qur'an mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the Golden Calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned. The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that He had tried the Israelites in his absence {{and that they had}} failed by worshipping the Golden Calf.|$|E
40|$|The green organs, {{especially}} the leaves, of many Compositae plants possess characteristic aromas. To exploit the utility {{value of these}} germplasm resources, the constituents, mainly volatile compounds, in the leaves of 14 <b>scented</b> <b>plant</b> materials were qualitatively and quantitatively compared via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 213 constituents were detected and tentatively identified in the leaf extracts, and terpenoids (especially monoterpene and sesquiterpene derivatives), accounting for 40. 45 – 90. 38 % of the total compounds, were the main components. The quantitative results revealed diverse concentrations and compositions of the chemical constituents between species. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different groups of these Compositae plants were characterized by main components of α-thujone, germacrene D, eucalyptol, β-caryophyllene, and camphor, for example. On the other hand, cluster memberships corresponding to the molecular phylogenetic framework, were found by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) based on the terpenoid composition of the tested species. These results provide a phytochemical foundation {{for the use of}} these scented Compositae plants, and for the further study of the chemotaxonomy and differential metabolism of Compositae species...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand native scented plants may possess {{potential}} industry {{value as}} perfume ingredients. To provide the overall impression of New Zealand <b>scented</b> <b>plant</b> resource and {{to guide the}} future researches in this area, this submission begins with a literature review on chemical and sensory studies of several commonly found New Zealand scented plants. A New Zealand <b>scented</b> <b>plant,</b> mairehau (Leionema nudum) was chosen for compositional analysis of volatiles. First, during the 15 days natural dehydration after cutting from plants, mairehau twigs decreased in weight, but increased {{in the number of}} volatile compounds and their concentration. A negative linear regression with R 2 = 75. 2 % was observed between twigs weight and the number of volatile compounds. It was found that the metabolic change significantly altered the volatile characteristics from day 5 to day 9 during natural dehydration. The total 71 volatile compounds were grouped into 5 clusters in multivariate analysis according to their similarity in behaviour during 15 days of natural dehydration. For comparison between volatiles from different mairehau parts, a total of 33 (3 unidentified) and 37 (4 unidentified) compounds were found in samples of fresh mairehau twigs and mairehau flowers, respectively, and there were 15 compounds found in both. For the volatiles of homogenized mairehau samples, there were 99 and 92 compounds found in fresh samples and dry samples, with 73 and 55 compounds identified, respectively. Adding liquid Nitrogen during homogenization of fresh mairehau would give the volatiles a different dynamic status from those prepared under room condition; however, the number of volatile compounds did not significantly vary. The volatiles were sampled by SPME. In this study, the 100 µm PDMS fibre showed the best reproducibility and was chosen for the experiment. The regression models of adsorption amount on fibre predicted by adsorption time (at 25 °C and 35 °C) agreed with the theoretic ones. In addition, increasing the adsorption temperature from 25 °C to 35 °C would promote the adsorption amount on the fibre. GC-MS and NIST MS Database similarity searching were used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of mairehau volatile compounds. To overcome the peak overlapping problem in GC-MS and improve the accuracy of the results, a chemometric algorithm, MCR-ALS coupled with EFA was applied. The algorithm showed a better efficiency in volatile samples with low complexity. The whole algorithm was successfully coded and ran in R software, suggesting this open-source software was capable for carrying out chemometric process, as well as MATLAB (a mathematic tool that most of publications used for carrying out chemometrics). R scripts were supplied in appendixes of this submission, providing a good reference to those who want to apply this technique with R software, in processing their GC-MS data...|$|E
