2500|$|Chemical storage {{could offer}} high <b>storage</b> <b>performance</b> {{due to the}} strong binding of {{hydrogen}} and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of chemical storage systems are under investigation, which involve hydrolysis reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, ammonia borane and other boron hydrides, ammonia, and alane etc. [...] Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density. [...] For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30°C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0mol/L while methanol has a density of 49.5mol H2/L methanol and saturated dimethyl ether at 30°C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1mol H2/L dimethyl ether. [...] These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, safer storage tanks. The most promising chemical approach is electrochemical hydrogen storage, as the release of hydrogen can be controlled by the applied electricity. Most of the materials listed below can be directly used for electrochemical hydrogen storage.|$|E

40|$|The {{catalysis}} of NiFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles on {{the hydrogen}} <b>storage</b> <b>performances</b> of magnesium hydride synthesized by high-energy ball milling was studied {{for the first}} time. The H- 2 <b>storage</b> <b>performances</b> and catalytic mechanism were studied by pressurecompositiontemperature (PCT), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The nonisothermal dehydrogenation results display that the initial dehydrogenation temperature of 7 mol % NiFe 2 O 4 -doped MgH 2 is 191 degrees C, which is 250 degrees C {{lower than that of}} pristine MgH 2. The desorption kinetics displays that the MgH 2 + 7 mol % NiFe 2 O 4 sample could desorb 3. 79 wt % H- 2 within 1 h at 300 degrees C under H- 2 pressure of 0. 1 MPa. The absorption kinetics displays that the MgH 2 + 7 mol % NiFe 2 O 4 sample could absorb 2. 06 wt % H- 2 within 3 h near room temperature under H- 2 pressure of 4 MPa. The desorption activation energy of the MgH 2 + 7 mol % NiFe 2 O 4 sample is 59. 6 kJ/mol, decreasing 195. 3 kJ/mol as compared with pristine magnesium hydride. The reaction enthalpy and entropy of the MgH 2 + 7 mol % NiFe 2 O 4 sample during the dehydrogenation process are improved. The enhancement in the H- 2 <b>storage</b> <b>performances</b> of MgH 2 by adding NiFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles is primarily ascribed to intermetallic Fe 7 Ni 3 and (Fe,Ni) phases during the desorption procedure, which act as the real catalyzer in the 7 mol % NiFe 2 O 4 -doped sample.

The considered thermocline is based on molten salt heat transfer fluid (Solar Salts between 300 °C and 550 °C) and filled with quartzite. A 2 -D finite element heat transfer model is developed to determine the temperatures inside the vessel with mass flows input/output. The model includes heat conductivity of molten salt and quartzite rocks, heat transfer between the molten salts and the quartzite, as well as heat loss to the environment. Results of the model are compared to available experimental data as well as analytic results showing good agreement. Then, the thermocline <b>storage</b> with the <b>performances</b> predicted by the 2 -D code was integrated in a CSP plant previously modelled with the two-tank TES system. Plant management is kept equal to the two-tank configuration. A performance index is introduced to make a consistent comparison between the thermocline and the two-tank system: storage efficiency {{is defined as the}} heat withdrawn from the storage above 545 °C divided by the overall input in the storage. The defined index is equal to 100 % for the two tank system as thermal losses have a negligible impact. On the contrary, in thermocline storage, part of heat stored in the molten salt is in the thermocline region and this molten salt is not accounted as useful. The thickness of the thermocline is about 4 to 6 meter height out of 14 meters making the <b>storage</b> <b>performances</b> in the range of 65 %, hence significantly lower than in two-tank configuration.
