5000|$|After {{the enzyme}} rests, the mash is raised to its mash-out temperature. This frees up about 2% more starch, {{and makes the}} mash less viscous, {{allowing}} the lauter to process faster. Although mash temperature and viscosity are roughly inversely proportional, the ability of brewers and distillers to use this relationship is constrained {{by the fact that}} Î±-Amylase quickly denatures above [...] Any starches extracted once the mash is brought above this temperature cannot be broken down, and will cause a <b>starch</b> <b>haze</b> in the finished product, or in larger quantities an unpleasantly harsh flavor can develop. Therefore, the mash-out temperature rarely exceeds [...]|$|E
