5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} purple liquid forming the word 'JANET'. Jackson is then shown <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a planet in outer space, wearing a {{bodysuit}} adorned with jewelry, long ponytail, and mask. Various asteroids and dancers mounting planets in black latex attire and helmets are shown. Jackson flips her ponytail, revealing her face as cosmic dust is tossed about. Several dancers leap to other planets as Jackson descends to a cratered surface, performing abstract choreography with two dancers. Jackson jumps to another setting, shown in slow motion as the audio is filtered, landing on a white liquid surface with a crimson atmosphere. Backed by eight dancers, Jackson performs the song's choreography as various objects crash into the liquid. Jackson and the dancers fall into the liquid, with Jackson reemerging in a red catsuit. Jackson then performs a dance routine with six glowing spheres. The final sphere ascends upward as fourteen white liquid objects explode.|$|E

5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E
25|$|Loki flies {{away in the}} {{whirring}} feather cloak, {{arriving in}} the land of Jötunheimr. He spies Þrymr <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a mound. Þrymr reveals that he has hidden Thor's hammer deep within the earth and that no one will ever know where the hammer is unless Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies back, the cloak whistling, and returns to the courts of the gods. Loki tells Thor of Þrymr's conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} {{designed}} by architects Papineau Gérin-Lajoie Le Blanc, who met at McGill's School of Architecture in the 1950s (under the tutelage of John Bland), founded their company in 1960, and parted ways in 1973 before the airport opened its doors after Papineau and another architect, Gordon Buchanan Edwards, left the firm. Mirabel's terminal carried over the bureau's award-winning Expo 67 Quebec pavilion design. A minimalist dark glass box <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a concrete bunker housing maintenance services, the terminal was hailed as an architectural triumph when it first opened.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{had always}} been defined very closely to the {{language}}, now this language gradually changed, and although some people (like the famous scribe known as the Tremulous Hand of Worcester) could read Old English in the thirteenth century. Soon afterwards, it became impossible for people to read Old English, and the texts became useless. The precious Exeter Book, for example, {{seems to have been}} used to press gold leaf and at one point had a pot of fish-based glue <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of it. For Michael Drout this symbolises the end of the Anglo-Saxons.|$|E
25|$|North Melbourne has {{experienced}} 7 logo changes since its introduction, with 5 of them featuring a bounding kangaroo behind a shield {{of blue and}} white stripes. In 2016, North Melbourne introduced a new logo that featured a much fiercer looking kangaroo, with its head only, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the words 'North Melbourne' inside a shield. The change was welcomed as the previous logo (2007-2016) didn't seem to represent what they stood for or the direction they were heading. The new kangaroo looks slightly to the right, indicating that it is looking into the future.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Bob Log added a {{wireless}} set-up to his guitar {{in order to}} allow him to take part in more active antics about the venues in which he is playing. On a number of occasions, Bob has set sail atop his audience in an inflatable dingy or played portions of his set from the women's washroom. During various shows on his September 2009 UK tour Bob Log would enter/exit the stage whilst playing guitar <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the shoulders of Russell Gray, lead singer of Russell and The Wolves.|$|E

25|$|The overall {{forms of}} this {{structure}} can be simply {{described as a}} larger box <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> a smaller box with a central void (the atrium) connecting the two forms together. Looking at the profile of this building from afar, {{it seems like the}} large seven-story block is held up solely by the series of columns. The lower block is completely transparent, thus the definition of that space is lost when the building is viewed from a distance. The facades of this building are very planar, and its overall form is very geometrical and rectilinear. Stretching along the vertical axis, this building is bi-laterally symmetrical. Made almost entirely of glass, the building facades are very planar yet sophisticated. The only contrast to its smooth, sleek, glass façade is the soft, round, colossal columns which the larger box sits atop of and the large organic orbs which float inside the atrium.|$|E
25|$|After the {{verdicts}} penalized numerous clubs, Palermo's overall position for that season was elevated to fifth, meaning they had {{qualified for the}} 2006–07 UEFA Cup. In the transfer window, Palermo spent millions adding players to their squad, including Aimo Diana, Mark Bresciano, Fábio Simplício and Amauri, but sold World Cup winner Fabio Grosso to Internazionale. The events led several football pundits to tip Palermo {{to do well in}} the season ahead. A very exciting start saw Palermo <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the Serie A table in September 2006 after beating Catania 5-3 at home in the Sicilian derby. Another notable victory was a 2-0 away win to AC Milan at San Siro stadium. The team started well also in the UEFA Cup by knocking out West Ham United. However, this time around the group stage proved to be more difficult than the previous year, and Palermo finished last in a group that contained Celta de Vigo, Eintracht Frankfurt, Fenerbahçe SK and Newcastle United.|$|E

25|$|In the elections, the TDP {{allied with}} the Sanjaya Vichara Manch party and decided to field educated {{candidates}} who had a good name in the society and were not indulging in corruption, which was an innovative political concept at the time. NTR himself decided to contest from two assembly constituencies, Gudivada and Tirupati. NTR used many innovative ways of campaigning, such as being the first politician in India to use rath yatras for campaigning. However, it was MGR who had started the opentop van campaigning for elections, as {{it was felt that}} he can address the roadshows {{as an alternative to the}} mammoth meetings, which involves large amount of money as well as manpower. For this, he used a modified Chevrolet van which was given the name of Chaitanya Ratham. In this, NTR travelled across the state of Andhra Pradesh, crisscrossing all the districts. With his son Nandamuri Harikrishna, also a film actor, driving the van, NTR notched up over 75,000 kilometres during his campaign, a distinctive sight with the van's yellow party flags and banners and NTR <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the vehicle hailing the crowds. NTR campaigned for restoring the dignity of the Telugu people and advocated the forming a closer bond between the government and the common people, going into the elections with the slogan, Telugu Vari Atma Gauravam (lit. Telugu people's self-respect).|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{starship}} flying towards an island after being summoned by its local tribesmen. The island locals slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The starship then beams a pink bikini-clad electric green-haired Minaj down onto the beach and she begins to sing. She is presumably being worshipped as a goddess as she is carried away through the jungle by the island locals wearing a pale pink bikini with strands hanging off the bottom and short green hair, which is also worn during some kaleidoscope effects and in one scene of her on the beach singing. Minaj is then seen dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black bodysuit behind a glass box {{while some of the}} male islanders run up to her. The scene then shifts towards the volcano top at nighttime where Minaj is <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the box with some of the locals dancing around her. In the final scene, a blonde-haired Minaj, wearing a white fringed strapless bikini splattered with paint, is partying with the islanders. Intercut scenes show Minaj singing with kaleidoscope effects on her in the second outfit and some more kaleidoscope effects in the same outfit but under blacklights. It ends with her singing the last line while looking directly into the camera.|$|E
25|$|The final group stage {{involved}} the teams who won their groups: Brazil, Spain, Sweden, and 1930 FIFA World Cup champions Uruguay, who were making their first World Cup appearance since winning the inaugural tournament. The World Cup winner {{would be the}} team that managed to finish {{on top of this}} group. The final group's six matches were shared between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Brazil played all its final group matches at the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio while the games that didn't involve the host nation were played in São Paulo. Brazil won their first two matches with a 7–1 thrashing of Sweden and 6–1 rout of Spain. Before the decisive match, Brazil was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the final group and had one game left to play against Uruguay, in second and only a point behind. On 16 July, before a huge home crowd of 199,954 (some estimated as 205,000) in the Estádio do Maracanã, the host nation only had to draw against Uruguay and the trophy would be theirs. After such crushing victories over Spain and Sweden, it looked certain they would take the title, especially as the home nation went ahead in the second minute of the second half, thanks to a goal from Friaça; however, Uruguay equalised and then with just over 11minutes left to play, went ahead 2–1 when Alcides Ghiggia squeaked a goal past Moacyr Barbosa, and Uruguay was crowned World Cup champions for a second time. This stunning defeat surprised Brazil and {{is referred to as the}} Maracanazo.|$|E
