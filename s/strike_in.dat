5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> the spring of that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike {{took place in the}} aftermath of the Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a player}} is [...] "on the strikes", a string is often {{referenced}} by affixing [...] "in a row" [...] {{to the number}} of strikes bowled consecutively. Six <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> a row are sometimes referred to as a [...] "six pack". Six strikes and nine <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> a row can also be referred to [...] "wild turkeys" [...] and [...] "golden turkeys" [...] respectively. Any string of <b>strikes</b> starting <b>in</b> the first frame or ending [...] "off the sheet" [...] (where all of a bowler's shots from a certain frame {{to the end of the}} game strike) are often referred to as the [...] "front" [...] or [...] "back" [...] strikes, respectively (e.g. the 'front nine' for <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> frames 1-9, or the 'back six' for <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> frames 7, 8, and 9 with a turkey in the tenth). Twelve <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> a row is a perfect game; 36 consecutive strikes constitutes a 900 series.|$|R

5|$|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste. She was laid down on 12 September 1907 and launched from the slipway on 8 September 1908. The teak used on her deck was the only material Austria-Hungary purchased abroad to build her. A {{month and a half}} after her launch, she was towed to the harbor in Muggia for completion. During a severe storm that night, she broke loose from her moorings; with no crewmen aboard, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand drifted for several hours before running aground just off Izola. The following morning, the navy located her and started to refloat her. Completion was delayed by a welders' <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> 1908 and a riveters' <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> 1909. Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first ship of the class to be completed, and she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910.|$|E
