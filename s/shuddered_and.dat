5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car <b>shuddered,</b> <b>and</b> Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E
500|$|Auden's clipped, satiric, and ironic {{style in}} the 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as Charles Madge, who wrote in a poem [...] "there waited {{for me in the}} summer morning / Auden fiercely. I read, <b>shuddered,</b> <b>and</b> knew." [...] He was widely {{described}} as the leader of an [...] "Auden group" [...] that comprised his friends Stephen Spender, Cecil Day-Lewis, and Louis MacNeice. The four were mocked by the poet Roy Campbell as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named [...] "Macspaunday." [...] Auden's propagandistic poetic plays, including The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent of F6, and his political poems such as [...] "Spain" [...] gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of Austin Clarke who called Auden's work [...] "liberal, democratic, and humane", and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a [...] "characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image", to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact [...] "confined to bourgeois experience." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} of things that have happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently <b>shuddered</b> <b>and</b> slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E

500|$|In William Faulkner's novel, Sanctuary, a [...] "heaven-tree" [...] {{stands outside}} the Jefferson jail, where Lee Goodwin and a [...] "negro murderer" [...] are incarcerated. The tree is {{associated}} with the black prisoner's despair in the face of his impending execution and the spirituals that he sings in chorus with other black people who keep a sort of vigil in the street below:...they sang spirituals while white people slowed and stopped in the leafed darkness that was almost summer, to listen to those who were sure to die and him who was already dead singing about heaven and being tired; or perhaps in the interval between songs a rich, sourceless voice coming out of the high darkness where the ragged shadow of the heaven-tree which snooded the street lamp at the corner fretted and mourned: [...] "Fo days mo! Den dey ghy stroy de bes ba'yton singer in nawth Mississippi!"Upon the barred and slitted wall the splotched shadow of the heaven-tree <b>shuddered</b> <b>and</b> pulsed monstrously in scarce any wind; rich and sad, the singing fell behind.Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-nicknamed [...] "tree from hell" [...] due to its prolific invasiveness and the difficulty in eradicating it. In certain parts of the United States, the species has been nicknamed the [...] "ghetto palm" [...] because of its propensity for growing in the inhospitable conditions of urban areas, or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties, such as in war-torn Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|The distant guests fell, {{then the}} distant elevator, {{followed}} immediately by the ride elevator. California's version {{did not have}} a randomized drop sequence. The ride experience was identical in every drop shaft, regardless of which floor passengers boarded on. Two small drops occurred in pitch-black darkness, followed by a rise {{to the top of the}} tower as in-cabin lights flickered. The doors then opened out to reveal the view from the top floor before the ride drops briefly, pauses, and drops along the remainder of the shaft. The elevator then raised and immediately dropped without stopping, in complete darkness. The elevator then was raised to the top of the tower, <b>shuddered,</b> <b>and</b> fell to the bottom of the shaft, to the area in between the two loading floors (to assure each ride is identical), with the elevator being finally returned to its load level and horizontally pushed back into place at the boiler room service doors. The height of the ride is [...] and the elevator drop [...] in total.|$|E
