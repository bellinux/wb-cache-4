5000|$|Barry {{is almost}} always {{listening}} in on either phone or live conversations between Curtis and Michelle which annoys Curtis. A frequent running gag in the strip, each time this happens it starts with Barry saying something offensive about Michelle, which causes Curtis to chase after him. Barry runs to <b>Diane,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Mama, Curtis is trying to hit me for no good reason!" [...] Curtis responds by saying [...] "Don't fall for his 'innocent little boy' routine, Mom," [...] and begins to explain what Barry did. More often that not, Diane does not believe Curtis and usually gives Barry ice cream to calm him while scolding Curtis and sending him off to do chores. On a couple of occasions, Barry even confesses to having listened to the conversations (asking what does a certain phrase mean, or even offering to repeat what Curtis said). This prompts questions from some over whether Diane properly punishes him for lying and eavesdropping.|$|R

It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen.

5000|$|Diane's {{second round}} of IVF fails and she breaks down. Sinead comforts Diane, but Finn is glad as he [...] "feels if Diane wants a baby it means she doesn't want him". Diane is [...] "desperate" [...] for a baby, and steals a baby boy from the {{hospital}}. She goes {{to the hospital to}} see a nurse and when she gets there she finds the baby. Fletcher explained the situation to a reporter from What's on TV, saying [...] "The baby has been abandoned outside the hospital. Diane thinks it's an animal at first when she hears something crying - and when she looks it's a baby boy." [...] There is not a note left with the baby, so Diane reasons that his mother does not deserve to have him back and takes him home. Fletcher explained why Diane did not take the baby into the hospital: [...] "She believes that, in taking him home, she's doing the right thing and that she'll get in touch with social services." [...] But, Diane [...] "goes past the point of no return" [...] and feels a bond with the baby and falls in love with him. Fletcher defended <b>Diane,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "She's not a nut job. She's pumped full of hormones and the IVF hasn't worked. She's having a breakdown and she isn't thinking properly." ...|$|R
