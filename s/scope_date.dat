The need for leisure and recreation {{is one of}} the most essential higher-order needs, and local authorities can meet these needs through park delivery. The existing park literature in South Africa is limited in <b>scope</b> and <b>dates</b> back to the apartheid era, with little evidence pertaining to community neighbourhood park (CNP) use in townships. The aim of this paper is to determine the perceptions, preferences, needs and uses of CNPs in five black townships in Cape Town. Findings indicate that townships have few CNPs, which therefore require travelling greater distances by public transport for access. Due to a lack of private garden space, respondents visit CNPs regularly and spend more time there, participating in either active or passive recreation. The main concerns about CNPs include safety and maintenance, and a lack of CNP facilities. These concerns extend to the type of facilities that respondents want to develop in CNPs, to create their ideal setting. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{date palm}} Phoenix dactylifera has played an {{important}} role in the day-to-day life of the people for the last 7000 years. Today worldwide production, utilization and industrialization of dates are continuously increasing since date fruits have earned great importance in human nutrition owing to their rich content of essential nutrients. Tons of date palm fruit wastes are discarded daily by the date processing industries leading to environmental problems. Wastes such as date pits represent an average of 10 % of the date fruits. Thus, there is an urgent need to find suitable applications for this waste. In spite of several studies on date palm cultivation, their utilization and <b>scope</b> for utilizing <b>date</b> fruit in therapeutic applications, very few reviews are available and they are limited to the chemistry and pharmacology of the date fruits and phytochemical composition, nutritional significance and potential health benefits of date fruit consumption. In this context, in the present review the prospects of valorization of these date fruit processing by-products and wastes’ employing fermentation and enzyme processing technologies towards total utilization of this valuable commodity for the production of biofuels, biopolymers, biosurfactants, organic acids, antibiotics, industrial enzymes and other possible industrial chemicals are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Early Anglo-Saxon Period is characterised archaeologically by {{the regular}} {{deposition}} of artefacts in human graves in England. The <b>scope</b> for <b>dating</b> these objects and graves {{has long been}} studied, but it has typically proved easier to identify and enumerate the chronological problems of the material than to solve them. Prior {{to the work of}} this project, there was no comprehensive chronological framework for Early Anglo-Saxon Archaeology, and the level of detail and precision in dates that could be suggested was low. The evidence has been studied afresh using a co-ordinated suite of dating techniques, both traditional and new: a review and revision of artefact-typology; seriation of grave-assemblages using correspondence analysis; high-precision radiocarbon dating of selected bone samples; and Bayesian modelling using the results of all of these. This integrated strategy was focussed primarily on the later part of the Early Anglo-Saxon Period, starting in the 6 th century. The work has produced a new chronological framework, consisting of sequences of phases that are separate for male and female burials but nevertheless mutually consistent and co-ordinated. These will allow archaeologists to assign grave-assemblages and a wide range of individual artefact-types to defined phases that are associated with calendrical date-ranges whose limits are expressed to a specific degree of probability. Important unresolved issues include a precise adjustment for dietary effects on radiocarbon dates from human skeletal material. Nonetheless the results of this project suggest the cessation of regular burial with grave goods in Anglo-Saxon England two decades or even more {{before the end of the}} seventh century. That creates a limited but important discrepancy with the current numismatic chronology of early English sceattas. The digital data-set includes data-matrices and tables in spreadsheet form that are too large for paper publication. These are referred to in the printed report of the project as 'e-Figures'.

The methods of thermoluminescence (TL) and optical dating using {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) are briefly described, together with their limitations. Prominent results are: (i) the distribution of ages of Australian desert dunes shows peak activity at {{about the time of}} the last glacial maximum; (ii) the lake-full episodes of Lake Eyre are traced back to 140 ka; (iii) the ages of relict beach dunes in South Australia, when compared with independent geological ages based on δ 18 O records, show that luminescence dating can be used for ages to 500 ka and older; and (iv) the development of interior river systems has been traced. Among less common applications are: (i) the dating of Australia's youngest volcanoes at 5 - 4 ka (in these cases the luminescence signal was reset by heat); (ii) the determination of age vs depth of a deep-sea core; and (iv) the age of earthquakes (from the age of the infilling of fault scarps).

40|$|Objective: Dating {{violence}} is a significant health problem among youth that leads to adverse health outcomes, including injuries. Reciprocal violence (perpetrated by both partners) is associated with increased injury in adults, but very {{little is known about}} the prevalence and context for reciprocal violence, as well as injury rates, among youth. We sought to determine the prevalence and <b>scope</b> of reciprocal <b>dating</b> violence and injury occurrence among urban youth in a high-risk community. Methods: Analyses were based on data from the Youth Violence Survey, conducted in 2004, and administered to over 80 % of public school students in grades 7, 9, 11, and 12 (N= 4, 131) in a high-risk, urban school district. The current analyses were restricted to those who reported dating in the past year and who also reported any dating violence (n= 1, 158). Dating violence was categorized as reciprocal (the participant reported both violence perpetration and victimization) and non-reciprocal (the participant report either violence perpetration or victimization, but not both). 					 Results: Dating violence reciprocity varied by sex. Girls who reported any dating violence were more likely to report reciprocal dating violence (50. 4 %) than were boys (38. 9 %). However, reciprocity did not vary by race/ethnicity or grade level. Reciprocal dating violence was more common among participants who reported more frequent violence experiences. Reciprocal violence was also associated with greater injury occurrences relative to non-reciprocal relationships (10. 1 % versus 1. 2 %). Conclusion: Reciprocal dating {{violence is}} common among adolescents and leads more often to injury outcomes. In particular, relationships in which boys report reciprocal violence against their partner appear to lead to more frequent injury occurrences. These findings underscore the importance of addressing dating violence and factors that increase risk for reciprocal violence and therefore exacerbate injury occurrence.
