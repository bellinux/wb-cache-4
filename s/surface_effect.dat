In the present work, the terahertz wave dispersion characteristics of a nanoplate are studied with consideration of the <b>surface</b> <b>effects</b> as well as the nonlocal small-scale effects. Nonlocal elasticity theory of plate is used to derive the general differential equation based on equilibrium approach to include those scale <b>effects.</b> Scale and <b>surface</b> property dependent wave characteristic equations are obtained via spectral analysis. For the present study the material properties of an anodic alumina with crystallographic of direction are considered.

It can be found that the flexural wavenumbers with <b>surface</b> <b>effects</b> are high as compared to that without <b>surface</b> <b>effects.</b> The scale effects show that the wavenumbers of the flexural wave become highly non-linear and tend to infinite at certain frequency. After that frequency the wave will not propagate and the corresponding wave velocities tend to zero at that frequency (escape frequency).
