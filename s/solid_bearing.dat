5000|$|A {{plain bearing}} (in railroading {{sometimes}} called a <b>solid</b> <b>bearing)</b> is the simplest type of bearing, comprising just {{a bearing surface}} and no rolling elements. Therefore, the [...] (i.e., {{the part of the}} shaft in contact with the bearing) slides over the bearing surface. The simplest example of a plain bearing is a shaft rotating in a hole. A simple linear bearing can be a pair of flat surfaces designed to allow motion; e.g., a drawer and the slides it rests on or the ways on the bed of a lathe.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{conception}} of chain {{used as a}} telescoping column instead a horizontal rammer was by Eldridge E. Long, who was awarded a US patent for his “Lifting Jack” in 1933, which he believed was “particularly adapted for use upon automobiles”. [...] It used a double chain configuration, each chain linking <b>solid</b> <b>bearing</b> blocks that were stacked to resist compressive loads. In 1951, Yaichi Hayakawa was awarded a US patent for his “Interlocking Chain Stanchion” which eliminated bearing blocks by integrating the compressive path of force into the interlocking links of two roller-like chains. [...] The zipper action of back-to-back interlocking chains provided guideless chain travel regardless of orientation and path of travel.|$|E

40|$|A {{consistent}} {{thermodynamic model}} is developed for metal sorption on expanding 2 : 1 layer clays such as montmorillonite. The particle of clay, including lamellae and interlayers, is {{represented as a}} porous <b>solid</b> <b>bearing</b> a permanent negative charge (resulting from isomorphic substitution) with an infinite plane interface (i. e., edges) with the solution. Cation exchange occurs inside the clay particle {{as the result of}} the negative potential of the clay. Surface complexation reactions take place at the interface whose surface charge and potential are pH dependent. The potential in the bulk of the clay and near the interface, as well as the surface potential– surface charge density relation, are calculated taking into account the effect of the permanent negative charge. The results are discussed and compared with the classic Gouy–Chapman theory. A subroutine (Clayeql) with the new potential–charge relationships is implemented in the thermodynamic equilibrium program Mineql � 3. 0 and is used to fit an extensive published experimental data set on adsorption of transition metals on montmorillonite. The model is shown not only to fit satisfactorily all the data, but also to explain specific features of adsorption on clays compared to oxides. In particular, the increase in the surface concentration of protons with decreasing ionic strength is successfully reproduced and the weaker dependence of metal sorption on pH compared to oxides is correctly fitted. © 1999 Academic Press Key Words: smectites; double-layer; proton adsorption; ion exchange; surface complexation; Donnan equilibrium...|$|E

40|$|The high {{temperature}} performance of solid lubricated rolling elements {{was conducted with}} a specially designed traction (friction) test apparatus. Graphite lubricants containing three additives (silver, phosphate glass, and zinc orthophosphate) were evaluated from room temperature to 540 C. Two hard coats were also evaluated. The evaluation of these lubricants, using a burnishing method of application, shows a reasonable transfer of lubricant and wear protection for short duration testing except in the 200 C temperature range. The graphite lubricants containing silver and zinc orthophosphate additives were {{more effective than the}} phosphate glass material over the test conditions examined. Traction coefficients ranged from a low of 0. 07 to a high of 0. 6. By curve fitting the traction data, empirical equations for slope and maximum traction coefficient as a function of contact pressure (P), rolling speed (U), and temperature (T) can be developed for each lubricant. A solid lubricant traction model was incorporated into an advanced bearing analysis code (SHABERTH). For comparison purposes, preliminary heat generation calculations were made for both oil and <b>solid</b> lubricated <b>bearing</b> operation.

We studied particularly pertechnetate adsorption and could show that <b>solids</b> <b>bearing</b> long chain substituted imidazolium groups are highly efficient anion exchange materials often displaying high distribution coefficients between solid and liquid phases. We observed that the distribution coefficient of pertechnetate {{is a function of}} the presence of competing anionic species. As a consequence, our experiments allowed reproducing experimentally Hofmeister's series. However, pertechnetate adsorption on the material can completely be inhibited in the presence of highly fluorinated anions such as bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (NTf 2). This behaviour indicates a particularly imidazophilic behaviour of these anions, which have a particular importance due to their use in water immiscible ionic liquids. Finally, the adsorption process has been shown to be reversible. This feature is of importance in view of the regeneration of the anion exchange material...|$|R

In this short paper, we study some qualitative properties of the solution to systems of equations that describe the degradation in a linearized elastic solid due to the diffusion of a fluid. The model that is considered allows for the material properties of the solid to depend on the concentration of the diffusing fluid. While the load carrying capacity of a solid could decrease or increase due to the infusion of a fluid, we consider the case when degradation takes place. We are able to obtain results concerning the uniqueness of solutions to the problem under consideration. We also consider special anti-plane and quasi-static deformations of the body.

40|$|We {{present an}} electrostatically {{actuated}} rotary stage featuring liquid rings, which serve as both mechanical bearings and electric {{connections between the}} rotor and the substrate. The liquid rings are formed by confining a liquid inside hydrophilic grooves and repelling it from the superhydrophobic surfaces outside the grooves. Made of a fluid, the liquid-ring bearing avoids the dry friction of the <b>solid</b> <b>bearings,</b> significantly improving the reliability. Formed as rings, it avoids the resistance of contactangle hysteresis sliding over droplets, and hence dramatically reducing the static friction. Furthermore, surface tension facilitates the self-alignment of the rotor to the substrate and stator during the assembly and provides the stability against drift and shock during operation. Electrically, each liquid ring passes an independent electric signal, allowing a direct electrical path between the substrate and potential components on the rotor. A three-phase electrostatic rotary stage has been design, fabricated, and tested. The minimum torque to initiate the rotation is ∼ 2. 5 nṄm - hundreds of times smaller than droplet-based counterparts. The device has operated successfully by applying sequential voltages of 50 V DC between the rotor and the stators. The electric transmission has been verified by powering an LED on a rotating rotor.

40|$|Abstract: The {{synthesis}} and {{properties of}} a number of functionalized calix[4]pyrroles are described. To date, two generalized preparative approaches have been pursued. The first involves modifying the basic pyrrole-plus-ketone synthesis of calix[4]pyrrole by using modified precursors or by co-condensing more than one ketone with pyrrole. The second approach relies on the reaction of a pre-formed calix[4]pyrrole with an electrophile. In both cases, the resulting species can be subject to further manipulation. In this way a range of structures, including ones bearing ancillary recognition subunits, electro- or photochemical reporter groups, and/or water solubilizing substituents may be obtained. <b>Solid</b> supports <b>bearing</b> calix[4]pyrroles may also be produced in this way...|$|R

The final phase of the laboratory program involved the dissolution and characterization of materials from three cracked pellet fuel rods using a selected caustic/ nitric acid flowsheet. Laboratory results obtained from the initial dissolution studies identified several inconsistencies and potential problem issues with the behavior of materials from the color coded fuel rods. Based on these findings and influenced by the difficulties introduced by using the RCRA listed mercury during processing, the flowsheet selected for dissolving these aluminum clad fuel rods in F-Canyon dissolvers was the two- step caustic decladding/ nitric acid dissolution flowsheet. The final phase of the experimental program involved testing materials from three cracked pellet fuel rods using the selected flowsheet.
