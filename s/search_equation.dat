40|$|Abstract — Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is a swarm {{optimization}} technique. This algorithm generally used {{to solve}} nonlinear and complex problems. ABC {{is one of}} the simplest and up to date population based probabilistic strategy for global optimization. Analogous to other population based algorithms, ABC also has some drawbacks computationally pricey due to its sluggish temperament of search procedure. The solution <b>search</b> <b>equation</b> of ABC is notably motivated by a haphazard quantity which facilitates in exploration at the cost of exploitation of the search space. Due to the large step size in the solution <b>search</b> <b>equation</b> of ABC there are chances of skipping the factual solution are higher. For that reason, this paper introduces a new search strategy in order to balance the diversity and convergence capability of the ABC. Both employed bee phase and onlooker bee phase are improved with help of a local search strategy stimulated by memetic algorithm. This paper also proposes a new strategy for fitness calculation and probability calculation. The proposed algorithm is named as Improved Memetic Search in ABC (IMeABC). It is tested over 13 impartial benchmark functions of different complexities and two real word problems are also considered to prove proposed algorithms superiority over original ABC algorithm and its recent variants...|$|E

This paper proposes a new variant of ABC algorithm, namely, enhanced ABC with solution acceptance rule and probabilistic multisearch (ABC-SA) to address global optimization problems. A new solution acceptance rule is proposed where, instead of greedy selection between old solution and new candidate solution, worse candidate solutions have a probability to be accepted. Additionally, the acceptance probability of worse candidates is nonlinearly decreased throughout the search process adaptively. Moreover, {{in order to improve}} the performance of the ABC and balance the intensification and diversification, a probabilistic multisearch strategy is presented. Three different <b>search</b> <b>equations</b> with distinctive characters are employed using predetermined search probabilities.
