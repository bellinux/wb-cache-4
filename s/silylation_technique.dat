40|$|Palladium-catalyzed {{cross-coupling}} {{reactions are}} versatile methods for {{the synthesis of}} carbon-carbon bonds. The Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling protocols have achieved prominence in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals {{because of the high}} yields, tolerance for functional groups, and excellent stereoselectivities. However, there are features associated with each of these processes that limit the generality: the Stille tin reagents and byproducts are toxic; and the Suzuki boron reagents can be difficult to synthesize and purify. Environmentally benign arylsilane derivatives have emerged as powerful alternatives to conventional arylmetalloids for the Pd(0) -catalyzed aryl-aryl coupling reaction with organohalides and organo(pseudo) halides because they avoid the inherent limitations associated with traditional methodologies. It was previously reported that aryl(trialkoxy) silanes (also called siloxanes) are substrates for fluoride-promoted, Pd(0) -catalyzed coupling reactions with allylic ester and aryl derivatives providing cross-coupling products in high yields under mild conditions. However, few detailed studies of the synthesis of these useful cross-coupling reagents {{have been reported in the}} literature. In chapter one of this thesis, two methods for the synthesis of aryl siloxanes are studied and the optimal reaction conditions and the scope determined: (1) general reaction conditions for the synthesis of aryl(trialkoxy) silanes from aryl Grignard and lithium reagents and functional silanes have been developed; and (2) the scope of the palladium-catalyzed silylation of aryl halides with triethoxysilane to generate aryl(trialkoxy) silane derivatives has been expanded. In tandem, these two methods provide ready access to a wide range of aryl siloxane reagents for use in Pd(0) -mediated cross-coupling reactions, including highly functionalized siloxane intermediates in the synthesis of useful biologically active compounds. In the first part of chapter one, the synthesis of aryl siloxanes from the corresponding aryl organometallic reagent and tetraalkoxysilanes is described. Although examples in the literature have reported the use of a range of silicon electrophiles (including SiCl 4 and ClSi(OR) 3), tetraalkyl orthosilicates (Si(OR) 4) allow for the most direct and convenient synthesis of arylsiloxanes, in that they are commercially available, inexpensive, and air and moisture stable. Using the reaction conditions developed herein, o-, m- and p-substituted bromoarenes underwent equally efficient metallation and silylation. Mixed results were obtained with heteroaromatic substrates: 3 -bromothiophene, 3 -bromo- 4 -methoxypyridine, 5 -bromoindole, and N-methyl- 5 -bromoindole all underwent silylation in good yield, whereas a low yield of siloxane was obtained from 2 -bromofuran, and 2 -bromopyridine failed to be silylated. The synthesis of siloxanes via organo lithium and magnesium reagents is limited by the formation of di- and triarylated silanes (Ar 2 Si(OR) 2, and Ar 3 SiOR, respectively), and dehalogenated (Ar-H) by-products. Lower temperatures allowed for the formation of predominantly monoaryl siloxanes, without requiring a large excess of the electrophile. Optimal reaction conditions for the synthesis of siloxanes from aryl Grignard reagents entailed addition of aryl magnesium reagents to 3 equiv of tetraethoxy- or tetramethoxysilane at 30 degrees C in THF. Aryl lithium species were silylated using 1. 5 equiv of tetraethoxy- or tetramethoxysilane at 78 degress C in ether. The proposed mechanism of silylation involves formation of the anionic pentacoordinate monoaryl(tetraalkoxy) silicate (ArSi(OR) 4 -), which unexpectedly is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by a second equivalent of the aryl metalloid to form diaryl(dialkoxy) siloxane by-products. The reductive dehalogenation of the aryl halide starting material presumably occurs during the metallation step, and is an inherent limitation of the use of organometallic reagents. The second part of chapter one discusses an alternative to the preparation of arylsilanes from organomagnesium or lithium intermediates: the silylation of aryl halide derivatives by triethoxysilane (HSi(OEt) 3) in the presence of a Pd catalyst. As initially reported in the literature, the silylation reaction was limited to p-substituted, electron-rich aryl iodide substrates. As described in this thesis, a more general Pd(0) -catalyst/ligand system has been developed which activates bromides and iodides: palladium (0) dibenzylideneacetone (Pd(dba) 2) is activated with 2 -(di-tert-butylphosphino) biphenyl (Buchwald's ligand) (1 : 2 mole ratio of Pd : phosphine). Electron-rich, para- and meta-substituted aryl halides (including unprotected anilines and phenols) underwent silylation to form the corresponding aryl(triethoxy) silane in fair to excellent yield; however, ortho-substituted aryl halides failed to be silylated. Aryl chlorides were inert under the reaction conditions, and triflates were poor substrates for silylation, instead undergoing highly efficient reductive deoxygenation. The optimum silylation reagent is triethoxysilane; hexamethoxydisilane failed to be activated under a range of conditions. The major by-product of this reaction is reductive dehalogenation of the aryl halide starting material. Probable mechanisms for the silylation reaction and the reduction side-reaction are presented and discussed. The Pd-catalyzed silylation method is an excellent companion to the more traditional organometallic approach to the formation of the Ar-Si bond. Case in point, ortho-substituted aryl siloxanes are readily synthesized from the Grignard or lithium reagent. Unlike the metallation approach, the Pd-catalyzed <b>silylation</b> <b>technique</b> can be performed in the presence of a wide range of functional groups, including carbonyl-containing electrophiles, and protic moieties such as phenols or primary amines. In addition to the fluoride-promoted transfer of aryl moieties presented in chapter one, silanes have also been shown to transfer nucleophiles such as azide and cyanide anion. Chapter two presents the development of a high yielding silicon-based method for the preparation of alkyl nitriles, which serve as precursors to a variety of useful functional groups. Hypercoordinate cyanosilicate, prepared in situ by the reaction of cyanotrimethylsilane (Me 3 SiCN) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF), is an effective source of nucleophilic cyanide. Primary and secondary alkyl halides and sulfonates underwent rapid and efficient cyanide displacement in the absence of phase transfer catalysts with the silicate derivative; inversion of configuration was observed for optically active alkyl halide substrates. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride was the optimum activating agent, and a full equivalent of fluoride ion was required for reaction completion. A nearly 1 : 1 stoichiometry of substrate to cyanosilicate affected formation of alkyl nitriles in acetonitrile or dioxane; in contrast, traditional methodologies typically employ a large excess of reagents, toxic phase transfer catalysts or solvents such as DMSO, or heavy-metal cyanide salts. Relative to other cyanide sources, the hypercoordinate cyanosilicate was much less basic, thereby mitigating the formation of elimination (alkene) by-products. The Me 3 SiCN/TBAF system is significantly less reactive and less basic than tetrabutylammonium cyanide (TBA-CN), therefore the mechanism of reaction most like involves the in situ generation of a hypercoordinate cyanosilicate, rather than disproportionation of Me 3 SiCN and TBAF to form TBA-CN in situ...|$|E
40|$|The {{limiting}} factor of electron-beam direct writing is the electron scattering especially on realisitic process wafers with topography and therefore variable resist film thicknesses. The ultimate lithographic performance {{can only be}} achieved if the scattering effects are reduced by proximity correction and by the top surface imaging principle. The project target was to develop e-beam sensitive bilayer and top surface imaging (TSI) singlelayer resistprocesses using the <b>silylation</b> <b>techniques.</b> At the surface the silicon incorporation of exposed areas differs from unexposed areas. The transfer of the silicon containing resist structures into the bottom resist is effected by a dry development process which is a compromise between CD loss and anisotropy. Quarter micron structures with high resist aspect ratio are feasible. For demonstration the developed resist processes were utilized for the double layer metallization of a 0. 8 #mu#m CMOS technology. While for the contact and via hole layer a conventional single layer resist process is usable the metallization layers need surface imaging processes. The patterning results demonstrates {{that there is a}} high CD accuracy in spite of topography. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract: Gas chromatographyâ€“mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) is {{a widely}} used analytical technique in metabolomics. GC provides the highest resolution of any standard chromatographic separation method, and with modern instrumentation, retention times are very consistent between analyses. Electron impact ionization and fragmentation is generally reproducible between instruments and extensive libraries of spectra are available that enhance the identification of analytes. The major limitation is the restriction to volatile analytes, and hence the requirement to convert many metabolites to volatile derivatives through chemical derivatization. Here we compared the analytical performance of two derivatization <b>techniques,</b> <b>silylation</b> (TMS) and alkylation (MCF), used {{for the analysis of}} amino and non-amino organic acids as well as nucleotides in microbial-derived samples. The widely used TMS derivatization method showed poorer reproducibility and instability during chromatographic runs while the MCF derivatives presented better analytical performance. Therefore, alkylation (MCF) derivatization seems to be preferable for the analysis of polyfunctional amines, nucleotides and organic acids in microbial metabolomics studies...|$|R

The silylation of silanol (Siâ€“OH) on the catalysts was confirmed by diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, DRIFT spectroscopy and solid-state 29 Si MAS NMR <b>techniques.</b> <b>Silylation</b> with TMDS improves the catalytic performance of Ti/SiO 2 catalyst more significantly than with HMDS and this is mainly due to the steric bulk effects of trimethylsilyl groups from HMDS as compared to dimethylsilyl groups from TMDS. The silylation degree with TMDS {{was found to be}} higher than with HMDS and no changes in the silylation degree with TMDS was observed for silylation times longer than 2 h. Despite the silylation route employed, the silylated surface is hydrophobic which enhances not only in hydrogen peroxide efficiency but also and in selectivity to epoxide in the epoxidation of alkenes with H 2 O 2. These effects are more evident when the hydrogen peroxide concentration is higher and particularly for the catalyst modified with TMDS. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{versatile}} methods {{for the formation of}} aryl-aryl bonds is the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. Previous work in the DeShong laboratory has demonstrated the utility of aryl siloxanes for the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, as well as new synthetic methods for the formation of aryl siloxanes. The work reported herein details (1) the synthesis of aryl siloxanes using ortho-metallation techniques (2) the coupling of aryl bis(catechol) silicates with aryl triflates, and (3) the application of aryl siloxane coupling technology to the synthesis of colchicine and allocolchicine derivatives. The synthesis of aryl siloxanes had previously been performed using either metal-halogen exchange, or transition metal-catalyzed <b>silylation.</b> These <b>techniques</b> necessitate the use of an aryl halide as the starting material. The application of ortho-metallation conditions avoids this requirement and allows for the synthesis of siloxanes directly from the unfunctionalized arene. Using this approach, ortho-ether and carbamate siloxanes were prepared in good yields, however, o-benzamide siloxanes could not be prepared using this method. The coupling of aryl triflates with aryl siloxanes had previously proven problematic due to competitive hydrolysis of the triflate. The use of aryl bis(catechol) silicates as siloxane surrogates facilitated the coupling of aryl triflates and iodides bearing a range of functional groups in excellent yield. Additionally, aryl bromides could be successfully coupled by switching from conventional heating to microwave irradiation. The use of aryl siloxanes in the synthesis of the natural products colchicine and allocolchine was explored. It was found that the carbocyclic framework of colchicine could be constructed using an aryl siloxane coupling reaction; however, the reaction required the use of a stoichiometric amount of the palladium "catalyst. " This amount of catalyst was required because of the competition between a slow oxidative addition step, and a fast protodesilylation pathway that lead to the decomposition of the siloxane. The synthesis of the allocolchicine carbocyclic framework was successful utilizing a siloxane coupling reaction, and a phenanthrol ring expansion protocol as the key steps...|$|R
