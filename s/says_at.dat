The situation is becoming critical, it <b>says,</b> <b>at</b> the Pont Gibus at Wallers, at Mons-en-Pévèle, Pont Thibaut at Ennevelin, the pavé of the Duclos-Lassalle section at Cysoing, and at Camphin-en-Pévèle.|$|E
5|$|The pass at Thermopylae {{was thus}} {{opened to the}} Persian army, {{according}} to Herodotus, at {{the cost to the}} Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities. The Greek rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of battle. Herodotus <b>says,</b> <b>at</b> one point 4,000 Greeks died, but assuming the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle (as Herodotus implies), this would be almost every Greek soldier present (by Herodotus' own estimates), and this number is probably too high.|$|E
5|$|The only extant {{pieces of}} the Consolatio are fragments, of which seven were {{preserved}} by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Divinarum Institutionum (The Divine Institutes). In the work, Lactantius used the excerpt from the Consolatio both {{to point out the}} futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity, without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but also applauded Cicero for paralleling—albeit coincidentally—what the Bible <b>says</b> <b>at</b> times. However, the quotes preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context. MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using partial quotations in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas. Other excerpts from the Consolatio were preserved by Cicero himself, of which two sections were quoted by him in his Tusculanae Disputationes.|$|E

25|$|There is {{disagreement}} among Islamic scholars on proper {{interpretation of}} Islamic law on permissible sex between {{a husband and}} wife, with claims that non-vaginal sex within a marriage is disapproved but not forbidden. Anal intercourse and sex during menstruation are prohibited, as is violence and force against a partner's will.

25|$|According to {{what one}} {{character}} <b>says</b> <b>at</b> Mbh. 1.1.50, {{there were three}} versions of the epic, beginning with Manu (1.1.27), Astika (1.3, sub-parva 5) or Vasu (1.57), respectively. These versions would correspond to the addition of one and then another 'frame' settings of dialogues. The Vasu version would omit the frame settings and begin with {{the account of the}} birth of Vyasa. The astika version would add the sarpasattra and aśvamedha material from Brahmanical literature, introduce the name Mahābhārata, and identify Vyāsa as the work's author. The redactors of these additions were probably Pāñcarātrin scholars who according to Oberlies (1998) likely retained control over the text until its final redaction. Mention of the Huna in the Bhīṣma-parva however appears to imply that this parva may have been edited around the 4th century.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{has also}} been {{described}} as simultaneously embracing and parodying animated Christmas specials like A Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty the Snowman and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It {{has also been}} described as a commentary on the way Jewish children are overlooked during the Christmas holiday; this theme is overtly stated by Stan, who <b>says</b> <b>at</b> the end of the episode that Jews and Hanukkah [...] "can be cool" [...] as well as Christmas. M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy, said although the episode is irreverent in its treatment of Christmas, [...] "even if spearheaded by a singing turd, [...] is about as close as South Park ever comes to being sentimental and nostalgic". Literary critic Mark Caldwell said the fact that Kenny survived the episode demonstrates the episode's [...] "strong, albeit dutifully ironic, undercurrent of conventional holiday decency." ...|$|E

500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] <b>says</b> <b>at</b> the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Matt Roush from USA Today said Steve Railsback's performance as Duane Barry rivaled {{that of his}} portrayal of Charles Manson in the 1976 television miniseries Helter Skelter. An unnamed reviewer from the Contra Costa Times called the episode [...] "seminal". San Jose Mercury News said Railsback gave {{what was to be}} the [...] "ultimate X-Files performance" [...] in 2002 after the show had been cancelled. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called it [...] "a career best for Chris Carter" [...] and praised his writing and directing, noting that both were [...] "powerfully" [...] and [...] "passionately" [...] done. Shearman and Pearson also applauded the episode's simplicity, citing it as the factor that made the entry stand out from others. [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club named it an [...] "essential" [...] episode of The X-Files. Furthermore, he praised Railsback's performance, writing that [...] "there's a sweaty intensity to his best performances that makes him impossible to look away from; but you still can't accept anything he <b>says</b> <b>at</b> face value." ...|$|E
500|$|Kung Fu Hustle makes {{references}} {{to a wide}} range of films, animated cartoons, wuxia novels and other sources. Sing and Bone resemble George Milton and Lennie Small from the 1992 film Of Mice and Men. The housing arrangement of the Pig Sty Alley is similar to that of a 1973 Hong Kong film, The House of 72 Tenants. There are two {{references to}} Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer. [...] When Sing arrives at Pig Sty Alley, he plays skillfully with a soccer ball, then says, [...] "You're still playing football?". The second reference is the scene in which a clerk beats Sing up on a bus. The clerk also appeared in Shaolin Soccer as the leader of an opposing team who used hidden weapons to beat up the Shaolin soccer team. When Sing challenges a boy in the Pig Sty Alley, Sing calls him [...] "The Karate Kid", a reference to the 1984 film of the same name. During the altercation between Sing and the hairdresser, the hairdresser states, [...] "Even if you kill me, there will be thousands more of me!". This is a reference to a famous quote made by Lu Haodong, a Chinese revolutionary in the late Qing Dynasty. The scene in which Sing is chased by the Landlady as he flees from the Alley is a homage to Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, characters in the Looney Tunes cartoons, even including the pursuer's (the Landlady's) ill fate. In the scene in which Sing robs the ice cream vendor, a poster for the 1935 film Top Hat is in the background. As Sing arrives at the door to the Beast's cell in the mental asylum, he hallucinates a large wave of blood rushing from the cell door, similar to a scene in The Shining. The Landlady <b>says</b> <b>at</b> one point, [...] "Tomorrow is another day," [...] which is a line from the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and its 1939 film adaptation.|$|E
