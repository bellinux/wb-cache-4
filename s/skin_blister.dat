5000|$|The Iron Cross beetle Tegrodera aloga (also {{known as}} blister beetle or soldier beetle) is more harmful to humans than helpful. This is {{primarily}} due to a poisonous chemical called cantharidin. Cantharidin {{is one of the}} most widely known natural products of insects; in the Iron Cross beetle it is excreted through the leg joints and/or the antennal pores. (Ghoneim, Karem S.) It has drawn a lot of attention due to its toxicity to humans and the painful/fatal diseases it inflicts upon certain livestock. This chemical, C10H12O4, causes severe skin blisters (dermatosis) to humans within hours of exposure to it; it is not known how much of this substance it takes to cause a <b>skin</b> <b>blister.</b> The insect secretes this substance as a defense mechanism, or it can happen if it is crushed and comes in contact with skin.

Doses of 250 and 500 mg of each drug were given to fasting subjects in a crossover fashion. Serially obtained plasma, <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid, and urine samples were analyzed for cefprozil or cefaclor by validated high-pressure liquid chromatographic methods. After oral administration of 250 and 500 mg of cefprozil, mean concentrations in plasma rose to peak levels (Cmax) of 6. 1 and 11. 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, and those of cefaclor were 10. 6 and 17. 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life of cefprozil (1. 3 h) was significantly longer than that of cefaclor (0. 6 h), and as a result, the area under the curve for cefprozil was about two times greater than that for cefaclor. Both cephalosporins were primarily excreted unchanged in urine. The mean <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> Cmax values were 3. 0 and 5. 8 micrograms/ml for cefprozil and 3. 6 and 6. 5 micrograms/ml for cefaclor after the 250 - and 500 -mg oral doses, respectively. The mean Cmax values in <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid for both cephalosporins were comparable and were {{significantly lower than the}} corresponding Cmax values in plasma. However, the levels of cefprozil and cefaclor in <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid declined more slowly than they did in plasma. The <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid half-life estimates for cefprozil were significantly longer than they were for cefaclor. Parallel to the observation in plasma, the mean <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid areas under the curve for cefprozil were significantly higher than they were for cefaclor.

To explore whether plasminogen activators convert their substrate plasminogen into plasmin locally in the lesional skin we have analyzed the autoimmune blistering skin disease bullous pemphigoid. Enzyme activity was detected in bullous pemphigoid <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid by using a low molecular weight chromogenic substrate for plasmin. Enzyme activity was detected neither in suction blister fluid raised on normal skin nor in normal plasma. Immunoprecipitation or fractionation by molecular sieve chromatography of bullous pemphigoid <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid followed by testing in immunoassays disclosed putative plasmin/alpha 2 -macroglobulin complexes and plasmin/alpha 2 -antiplasmin complexes.

40|$|Introduction: Proteinases and proteinase inhibitors {{have been}} {{described}} {{to play a role}} in autoimmune <b>skin</b> <b>blistering</b> diseases. We studied skin lesional biopsies from patients affected by several autoimmune <b>skin</b> <b>blistering</b> diseases for proteinases and proteinase inhibitors. Methods: We utilized immunohistochemistry to evaluate biopsies for alpha- 1 -antitrypsin, human matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9), human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP- 1), metallothionein and urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). We tested 30 patients affected by endemic pemphigus, 30 controls from the endemic area, and 15 normal controls. We also tested 30 biopsies from patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), 20 with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), 8 with pemphigus foliaceus, and 14 with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Results: Contrary to findings in the current literature, most autoimmune <b>skin</b> <b>blistering</b> disease biopsies were negative for uPAR and MMP 9. Only some chronic patients with El Bagre-EPF were positive to MMP 9 in the dermis, in proximity to telocytes.

In the rat fracture model of CRPS, exaggerated sensory and sympathetic neural signaling stimulate keratinocyte and mast cell proliferation, causing the local production of {{high levels of}} inflammatory cytokines leading to pain behavior. The current investigation used CRPS patient skin biopsies to determine whether keratinocyte and mast cell proliferation occur in CRPS skin and to identify the cellular source of the up-regulated TNF-α, IL- 6, and tryptase observed in CRPS experimental <b>skin</b> <b>blister</b> fluid. Skin biopsies were collected from the affected skin and the contralateral mirror site in 55 CRPS patients and the biopsy sections were immunostained for keratinocyte, cell proliferation, mast cell markers, TNF-α, and IL- 6.

40|$|Abstract Background Bullous pemphigoid is a subepidermal {{blistering}} disorder {{associated with}} tissue-bound and circulating autoantibodies directed {{mainly to the}} hemidesmosomal component collagen XVII. While recapitulating the main immunopathological features of the human disease, frank <b>skin</b> <b>blistering</b> does not develop {{in the absence of}} skin rubbing in experimental pemphigoid models that have been established in neonatal mice. Moreover, due to their experimental design they only allow for short-term disease observation. In the present study we aimed to establish a model that reproduces the frank <b>skin</b> <b>blistering</b> seen in patients and allows for longer observation times. Methods Rabbit and sheep antibodies specific to several fragments of collagen XVII were generated and the purified antibodies were passively transferred into adult mice. Results Collagen XVII-specific IgG bound to the basal membrane of the skin and mucous membranes activating murine complement in vivo. Mice injected with collagen XVII-specific antibodies, in contrast to mice receiving control antibodies, developed frank <b>skin</b> <b>blistering</b> disease, reproducing human bullous pemphigoid at the clinical, histological and immunopathological levels. Titres of circulating IgG in the serum of mice correlated with the extent of the clinical disease. Mice receiving sheep antibodies specific to murine collagen XVII showed an early onset and a more active disease when compared to litter mates receiving specific rabbit antibodies. Conclusion This novel animal model for bullous pemphigoid should facilitate further investigations of the pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid and the development of innovative therapies for this disease. </p...|$|R
