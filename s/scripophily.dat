50|$|Using philately, <b>scripophily</b> and Esperanto, the Soviet {{authorities}} also {{hoped for}} promoting communist propaganda among the foreign proletariat. Filintern received a further boost from the SAT (Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda) Congress of 1926.|$|E

50|$|The First All-Union Philatelic Exhibition {{was held}} in Moscow in 1924-1925. Its full name was the First All-Union Philatelic, Scripophilic and Numismatic Exhibition.

50|$|Today, {{there are}} {{thousands}} of collectors worldwide (Scripophilists) in search of scarce, rare, and popular stocks and bonds. Collectors who come from a variety of businesses enjoy this as a hobby, although there are many who also consider <b>scripophily</b> a good investment.|$|E
5000|$|This {{practice}} was continued under the USSR, and in December 1923, some tsarist [...] issues {{were subject to}} export surcharge made by the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and <b>Scripophily.</b> For the same purpose, Soviet definitive issues of 1921 were also used.|$|E
5000|$|Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and <b>Scripophily</b> (Организация Уполномоченного по филателии и бонам в СССР (ОУФБ)) was {{established}} in Moscow in 1922 by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) for matters concerned with philately and bonds. An old Bolshevik [...] headed this organisation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scripophily,</b> the {{collecting}} of old {{stocks and}} bonds, gained {{recognition as a}} hobby around 1970. The word [...] "scripophily" [...] was coined by combining words from English and Greek. The word [...] "scrip" [...] represents an ownership right and the word [...] "philos" [...] means to love.|$|E
50|$|On 25 October 1926, a new {{association}} {{was established in}} Moscow by VTsIK and Sovnarkom decree. It replaced the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and <b>Scripophily.</b> SFA sold Soviet stamps to foreign dealers, Soviet philatelists, and schoolboys. These latter glued their stamps into school notebooks {{because of a lack}} of stamp albums.|$|E
5000|$|The {{creation}} of the Filintern was set up {{at a conference in}} Moscow in 22 to 30 June 1924.

At the conference opening, , the Commissioner for Philately and <b>Scripophily,</b> declared: ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1921, a Narkompochtel {{representative}} [...] worked {{within the}} RBF and proposed {{change in the}} philatelic policy. According to this proposal, the monopoly on foreign trade should have been extended and included the traffic in postage stamps, the revenue being used to aid street children. In 1922, Chuchin was appointed to head the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and <b>Scripophily.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{exhibition}} was organised from 15 December 1924 to 15 February 1925.

50|$|International trading {{tax stamp}} {{is kind of}} revenue stamps {{that were used in}} the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s for {{taxation}} of the trade in stamps. The latter were considered a commodity for which philatelists could be taxed. This type of taxation was introduced by the Soviet government in addition to revenue it collected from stamp sales. International trading tax stamps were issued by the Posledgol Central Commission of VTsIK, the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and <b>Scripophily</b> and, later, by the Soviet Philatelic Association.|$|E
5000|$|Two early philatelic public [...] {{existed in}} the Soviet Union. These were All-Russian Society of Philatelists (created in 1922) and Philatelic International (or Filintern {{organised}} in 1924).

50|$|A {{large part}} of <b>scripophily</b> is the area of {{financial}} history. Over the years there have been millions of companies which needed {{to raise money for}} their business. In order to do so, the founders of these companies issued securities. Generally speaking, they either issued an equity security in the form of stock or a debt security {{in the form of a}} bond. However, there are many varieties of equity and debt instruments. They can be common stock, preferred stock, warrants, cumulative preferred stocks, bonds, zero-coupon bonds, long term bonds (over 15 years) and any combination thereof.|$|E
50|$|A lot of {{companies}} either were never successful or went bankrupt, so that their certificates became worthless pieces of paper until the hobby of <b>scripophily</b> began. The mining boom in the 1850s, railroad construction in the 1830s, the oil boom in the 1870s, telegraphy (1850s), the automobile industry beginning around 1900, aviation (around 1910), electric power and banks in the 1930s, the airline wars and mergers in the 1970s, cellular telephones (1980s), long distance telephone service in the 1980s and 1990s, and most recently the Dot-com era and Enron all resulted in historically significant certificates being generated and issued.|$|E
