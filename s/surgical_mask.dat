Yearly vaccinations against {{influenza}} are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly.

He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of tracheitis forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a <b>surgical</b> <b>mask</b> {{to protect against the}} cold air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season.

40|$|Background: The SARS {{outbreak}} in 2003 {{has spawned a}} major controversy concerning protective performance facemasks for healthcare workers. This study reports a study on in-vivo protective performance of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> and N 95 respirators. Methods: Typical <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> and N 95 respirators used in Hong Kong hospitals were tested in comparison with those treated with nano-functional materials (called nano-masks) on various physical properties and in-vivo wear filtration efficiency, as well as usability test in hospitals for <b>surgical</b> <b>masks.</b> Results: Tests on physical properties showed that N 95 respirators had significantly lower air permeability and water vapor permeability than <b>surgical</b> <b>masks.</b> The in-vivo filtration tests illustrated that N 95 respirators filtered out 97 % of potassium chloride (KCl) solution, while <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> filtered out 95 % of KCl solution. Nano-masks show stronger water repellency and antibacterial activities, but no difference in usability, comparing with normal N 95 and <b>surgical</b> <b>masks.</b> Conclusions: <b>Surgical</b> <b>masks</b> can provide in-vivo filtration protection of 95 % filtration efficiency. N 95 respirators provide higher in-vivo filtration efficiency of 97 % with significant reduction of air permeability and water vapor permeability. Compared to normal surgical masks/respirators, the nano-masks can provide additional protective functions in stopping capillary diffusion and antibacterial activities.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundRapid {{identification}} of patients infected with influenza virus, precise case definition and strict hygiene measures {{are important for}} the prevention of nosocomial transmission. AimTo prove the usefulness of a case definition for rapid {{identification of}} patients with influenza and to investigate the effect of two-step hygiene management, including the continuous use of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> by hospital staff, on the rate of nosocomial infections. MethodsAll patients hospitalized between January and March 2015 with suspected influenza were enrolled. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza was performed. Infected patients were managed according to the national hygiene guidelines, including the use of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> by hospital staff during close contact with infected patients. When influenza activity increased, the continuous use of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> by hospital staff was implemented as an add-on measure. FindingsMost patients enrolled in this study were elderly (N= 212, mean age 75 years). Frequency of cough was the only clinical parameter of respiratory infection that differed between influenza-negative and influenza-positive patients. Compared with the targeted use of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> during close contact with infected patients, the continuous use of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> for the entire working shift resulted in a reduction of nosocomial infections from 31 % to 16 %, respectively (P< 0. 01). ConclusionDiscrimination between influenza A and other respiratory infections in elderly hospitalized patients was not possible based on clinical characteristics. With regard to hygiene management, the continuous use of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> by hospital staff seems to be effective {{for the prevention of}} nosocomial infections...|$|R

Among United States hospitalizations for nonmaternal and nonneonatal conditions in 2012, more than one-fourth of stays and half of hospital costs involved stays that included operating room (OR) procedures. The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of aseptic technique: the strict separation of [...] "sterile" [...] (free of microorganisms) things from [...] "unsterile" [...] or [...] "contaminated" [...] things. [...] All surgical instruments must be sterilized, and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire (scrubs, a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a <b>surgical</b> <b>mask),</b> and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Bioaerosols {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agents that cause post operating infections in hospitals. <b>Surgical</b> <b>masks</b> are recommended for prevention of bioaerosols transmition in operating rooms. This study aimed at evaluation of submicron particle  filtration efficiency of domestic and imported <b>surgical</b> <b>masks.</b> Materials and Methods:  In this cross sectional study, 5 types of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> that have the most utilization in operating rooms of country’s hospitals including domestic and imported <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> were tested. To evaluate all samples, the submicron particle filtration measurements were carried out based on ISIRI 6138 and American DOP standards. Filtration efficiency calculations and pressure drop measurements were performed and the results were analyzed using statistical tests. Results: Results showed that particle filtration efficiency of domestic and imported masks were 56. 130 % (± 10. 7) and 31. 906 % (± 7. 062) respectively. Also, filtration efficiency in domestic masks were more than imported masks (P> 0. 001). Among all samples, Arman mask had the most filtration efficiency (66. 5475 % ± 6. 14951), where the least (27. 8275 % ± 4. 44152) filtration efficiency (P> 0. 001) belongs to Blosom. The maximum mean of pressure drop in Arman mask (35 ± 2. 58 Pa) and the least mean of pressure drop in Zist filter mask (11 ± 1. 82 Pa) were observed. According to the effect of filtration efficiency and pressure drop on general quality of mask, the quality factor of masks were also evaluated. Results showed that Zist filter mask had the most quality factor (0. 068) while Blosom had the least quality factor (0. 016). Conclusion: This research showed that domestic <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> have a better quality toward imported <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> but can not obtained quality confirmed by standards, yet. To reduce respective infections and prevalence of diseases, it is recommended using filters with suitable physical characteristics and also carrying out test of <b>surgical</b> <b>masks</b> before supplying...|$|R
