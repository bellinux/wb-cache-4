5|$|The RFC 6520 Heartbeat Extension tests TLS/DTLS <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> links by {{allowing}} a computer {{at one end}} of a connection to send a Heartbeat Request message, consisting of a payload, typically a text string, along with the payload's length as a 16-bit integer.

5|$|On 28 June, {{the rebels}} ambushed a {{truckload}} of Italian soldiers, prompting the Italian Army commander in the NDH to warn the NDH government {{that he would take}} unilateral action to <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> routes. A further gendarmerie post was destroyed by the rebels, and in the evening the rebels captured the village of Avtovac, looting and burning it, and killing dozens of non-Serb civilians. The following day an Italian column cleared the rebels from Avtovac and relieved the hard-pressed NDH garrison in the town of Gacko. From 3 July, an NDH force of over 2,000 fanned out from Nevesinje, clearing towns, villages and routes of rebels. The rebel forces did not put up any significant opposition to the clearing operation, and either retreated into nearby Montenegro, or hid their weapons in the mountains and went home. By 7 July, NDH forces had regained full control of all towns and major transport routes in eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|The Heartbeat Extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) {{protocols}} {{was proposed}} {{as a standard}} in February 2012 by RFC 6520. It provides a way to test and keep alive <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule Münster, implemented the Heartbeat Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put {{the result of his}} work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. The defect spread with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable.|$|E

500|$|The {{attack was}} to begin at 5:30am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. The attack was {{originally}} planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed for 24hours {{at the request of}} the French. [...] During the late hours of 8 April and early morning of 9 April the men of the leading and supporting wave of the attack were moved into their forward assembly positions. The weather was cold and later changed to sleet and snow. Although physically discomforting for everyone, the north-westerly storm provided some advantage to the assaulting troops by blowing snow in the faces of the defending troops. Light Canadian and British artillery bombardments continued throughout the prior night but stopped in the few minutes before the attack, as the artillery recalibrated their guns in preparation for the synchronized barrage. At exactly 5:30am, every artillery piece at the disposal of the Canadian Corps began firing. Thirty seconds later, engineers detonated the mine charges laid under no man's land and the German trench line, destroying a number of German strong points and creating <b>secure</b> <b>communication</b> trenches directly across no man's land. Light field guns laid down a barrage that advanced in predetermined increments, often [...] every three minutes, while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages further ahead, against known defensive systems. During the early fighting the German divisional artilleries, despite heavy losses, were able to maintain their defensive firing. As the Canadian assault advanced, it overran many of the German guns because there was no means of moving them to the rear on account of many of the horses being killed in the initial gas attack.|$|E
