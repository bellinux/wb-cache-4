60|$|Barney <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> {{but when}} he saw the deep {{seriousness}} of the girl's eyes he changed his mind.

6000|$|... "Neither would I if I {{were in your}} place," [...] {{declared}} Peter. [...] "I wish Old Mother Nature {{had given}} me a coat like that." [...] He said this so wistfully that Seek-Seek, who had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> turned his head so that Peter might not know it. [...] "I'm afraid it wouldn't look so well on one as big as you," [...] he replied. [...] "Anyway, you wouldn't be able to hide from your enemies as you can now." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> too. Under these {{circumstances}} {{it is always}} supposed to be very funny if a man has got married. The notion of old Peter (whoever he is) being married is presumed to be simply killing. I kept on chuckling away quietly at the mere idea of it. I was hoping that I might manage to keep on laughing till the train stopped. I had only fifty miles more to go. It's not hard to laugh for fifty miles if you know how.|$|E

60|$|Little Joe Otter simply {{pointed to}} Grandfather Frog. Little Joe had laughed {{so much that}} he couldn't even speak. Spotty looked over to the big green lily-pad and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> too. Then he saw great tears rolling down from Grandfather Frog's eyes and heard little choky sounds. He stopped {{laughing}} and started for Grandfather Frog {{as fast as he could}} swim. He climbed right up on the big green lily-pad, and reaching out, grabbed the end of the fish tail in his beak-like mouth. Then Spotty the Turtle settled back and pulled, and Grandfather Frog settled back and pulled. Splash! Grandfather Frog had fallen backward into the Smiling Pool on one side of the big green lily-pad. Splash! Spotty the Turtle had fallen backward into the Smiling Pool on the opposite side of the big green lily-pad. And the fish which had caused all the trouble lay floating on the water.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the first}} night the whole pit and gallery, except certain members of the Fabian Society, <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> at the author and then, {{discovering}} that they themselves were being laughed at, sat there not converted--their hatred was too bitter for that--but dumbfounded, {{while the rest of}} the house cheered and laughed. In the silence that greeted the author after the cry for a speech one man did indeed get his courage and boo loudly. [...] "I assure the gentleman in the gallery," [...] was Shaw's answer, [...] "that he and I are of exactly the same opinion, but what can we do against a whole house who are of the contrary opinion?" [...] And from that moment Bernard Shaw became the most formidable man in modern letters, and even the most drunken of medical students knew it. My own play, which had been played with The Comedy of Sighs, had roused no passions, but had pleased a sufficient minority for Florence Farr to keep it upon the stage with Arms and the Man, and I was in the theatre almost every night for some weeks. [...] "Oh, yes, the people seem to like Arms and the Man," [...] said one of Mr Shaw's players to me, [...] "but we have just found out that we are all wrong. Mr Shaw did really mean it quite seriously, for he has written a letter to say so, and we must not play for laughs any more." [...] Another night I found the manager, triumphant and excited, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh had been there, and the Duke of Edinburgh had spoken his dislike out loud so that the whole stalls could hear, but the Prince of Wales had been [...] "very pleasant" [...] and [...] "got the Duke of Edinburgh away as soon as possible." [...] "They asked for me," [...] he went on, [...] "and the Duke of Edinburgh kept on repeating, 'The man is mad,' meaning Mr Shaw, and the Prince of Wales asked who Mr Shaw was, and what he meant by it." [...] I myself was almost as bewildered for though I came mainly to see how my own play went, and for the first fortnight to vex my most patient actors with new lines, I listened with excitement to see how the audience would like certain passages of Arms and the Man. I hated it; it seemed to me inorganic, logical straightness and not the crooked road of life and I stood aghast before its energy as to-day before that of the Stone Drill by Mr. Epstein or of some design by Mr Wyndham Lewis. He was right to claim Samuel Butler for his master, for Butler was the first Englishman to make the discovery, that it is possible to write with great effect without music, without style, either good or bad, to eliminate from the mind all emotional implication and to prefer plain water to every vintage, so much metropolitan lead and solder to any tendril of the vine. Presently I had a nightmare that I was haunted by a sewing machine, that clicked and shone, but the incredible thing was that the machine smiled, smiled perpetually. Yet I delighted in Shaw the formidable man. He could hit my enemies and the enemies of all I loved, as I could never hit, as no living author that was dear to me could ever hit.|$|E
5000|$|It was famously {{performed}} by Rudy Vallée as [...] "The Drunkard Song," [...] slightly changing the chorus. While recording the last verses of the song, Vallée <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> uncontrollably given the corny lyrics. He {{and his band}} recorded the song again without laughing, but Victor released both takes in 1934. He also performs the song in the film Sweet Music.|$|E
5000|$|Seagoon {{is often}} heard making a blatant word-twisting joke {{to a fellow}} {{character}} or the audience to which both he and the audience will <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b> When the audience dies out, Seagoon is often left laughing hysterically. He then notices his mistake in laughing at his own joke, stops and pretends to be clearing his throat.|$|R

5000|$|... "Psycho Circus" [...] {{was written}} by guitarist/vocalist Paul Stanley and Curt Cuomo {{specifically}} to fit {{the theme of the}} Psycho Circus Tour and album. According to producer Bruce Fairbairn, [...] "We didn't have an opener for the record. We didn't have anything that was going to start things off. And Paul just looked at me and said, 'check this. This is it...' We both sat there and {{looked at each other and}} <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b> Because that was it" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{version of}} the story is found in the 8th-century biography of Gregory by Paul the Deacon, and was repeated in the 9th-century one by John the Deacon. In this version, the Pope was saying Mass when a woman present <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> {{at the time of the}} Communion, saying to a companion that she could not believe the bread was Christ, as she herself had baked it. Gregory prayed for a sign, and the host turned into a bleeding finger.|$|E
50|$|The end was scripted to {{have the}} gang drive off together. The car failing <b>to</b> <b>start</b> {{at the end of}} the episode was an accident.

5000|$|His response: [...] "Interesting question! I {{think it}} might be the car {{accident}} syndrome, where sometimes you don't WANT to look, but you always end up turning your head to see what happens. They are so unrealistic and usually quite graphic with their violence, that it becomes almost silly, and you <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> and wonder how is the next person going to die. Maybe everybody just likes a really good villain, and I think Jason is probably in the top five." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carlton {{told the}} website Contactmusic.com {{of the first}} time she watched the single's music video, in which she is seen playing the piano while {{traveling}} through a variety of settings: I was in the studio and had just taken a break, when someone ran in the room and said, [...] "You're on MTV!" [...] We put it on and I just stared at the screen. After a few minutes, I just covered my eyes and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b> It seemed so surreal. The night after that, I heard the song on the radio for the first time. It was all so unbelievable.|$|E
5000|$|Leighann Lord {{was born}} in the South Jamaica {{neighborhood}} of Queens in New York City, and was raised by her West Indian parents. She attributes her interest in comedy to both her cultural heritage and to {{looking for a way to}} avoid being teased as a child. She reports [...] "People <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> with me and not at me. I was an 11-year-old sixth-grader with a game plan that led me in the right direction." [...] She attended Baruch College at the City University of New York where she studied journalism, creative writing and theater with an interest in show business; in 1989, she graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BA in Journalism and Creative Writing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{critics of}} the 1950s did not pay {{a great deal of}} {{attention}} to farce. Reviewing Simple Spymen, The Times said that the play [...] "may be austerely described as rubbish", but conceded that it was skilfully constructed, and well performed. [...] "Nothing daunts Mr. Leo Franklyn. He gets fun out of everything". Rix was praised for [...] "an evening of good, versatile clowning". In The Manchester Guardian, Philip Hope-Wallace declared the play to be better than its predecessor, Dry Rot, and said, [...] "Wallace Douglas produces this loud, cheerful, vulgar thing very competently. Mr Franklyn's professional skill is unfailing." [...] In The Daily Express, John Barber wrote that he hardly laughed at all [...] "yet all round me people choked with mirth". In The Daily Mirror, Chris Reynolds wrote, [...] "It is a success spelt with a capital S. The audience <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> as soon as the curtain went up. They were still laughing as they left the theatre." ...|$|E

50|$|At a local insane asylum, a {{psychologist}} (Viveca Lindfors) {{is trying to}} communicate with Lansdale. She wants him to remember and admit that it was him, not his severed hand, who killed all the victims. He says that the hand wants to kill her because it hates her. Suddenly, the hand (which apparently existed all along) appears from behind the psychiatrist and strangles her. Lansdale, completely {{taken over by the}} essence of the hand, looks at her dead body and <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b> He loosens the restraint on his other hand and gets up, presumably to escape from the asylum.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{begins with}} Dipper and Wendy improvise funny {{dialogue}} over the security tape of Stan and some customers, Mabel suddenly appears (while happily dancing), ecstatically delivering {{the news that}} her favorite band, Sev'ral Timez, will be having a concert in Gravity Falls at the Gravity Falls Civic Center and Buffet. Dipper and Wendy then <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> and tease Mabel about her extreme love for the musicians, {{saying that they are}} [...] "fake" [...] and nothing more than a [...] "product of the bloated corporate music industry," [...] upsetting Mabel until Candy and Grenda arrive to prepare for the concert.|$|R
5000|$|It's {{kind of a}} {{funny little}} title. And again, you {{have to kind of}} know the history of Fullerton music and the Adolescents in particular. There's an {{intentional}} inside joke there. The Naughty Women were a transvestite punk rock band from Fullerton who we all loved dearly, just a great rock band. Very, very punk rock, very, very fun. And they're a very funny bunch of guys. And the Black Sweaters were a group of girls that used to always hang around the scene, they were kind of the resident groupies of the early Fullerton scene. So we have Naughty Women in Black Sweaters. You can kind of put it all together and it has a whole new meaning. But even without that insight, the title's kind of funny on any level. But for us, when we did it we were all chuckling. They said, [...] "Do you have an album title?" [...] I said, [...] "Yeah, how about this one?" [...] And I threw that one out and they all just <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b>|$|E
50|$|During World War I Häberlin was a {{regiment}} {{commander and}} was stationed with his {{troops in the}} Swiss Alps. - In those days it was strongly prohibited for the soldier in charge of guarding horse carriages to ride {{on top of the}} carriage, instead the soldier had the duty to run behind the carriage in case anything of the load fell off during the transportation. Needless to say, the soldier on duty was not too thrilled with this task, especially when the carriage was empty after delivering the goods and still he was not allowed to ride on it. So one day a guard of Häberlin´s regiment sat next up to the coachman on the horse carriage on their way back after dropping off their goods at the designated area. They were going on a mountainous road which had many turns, {{when all of a sudden}} Häberlin appeared out of nowhere and harshly questioned the guard why he was sitting on the coach instead of running alongside it. The flabbergasted soldier answered in all honesty, “Because Colonel, Sir, I have noticed you too late!”, upon hearing this, Häberlin <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> heartily and let the soldier off the hook due to the guard´s honesty.|$|E
5000|$|The case {{generated}} significant {{media attention}} in Brazil {{due to the}} stark contrast between the brutal crime and what was initially {{perceived to be the}} personality of the daughter. While the Cravinhos brothers fitted the stereotype of the uneducated, unemployed, drug-addicted killers, this was not true for Suzane: She was a pretty, blonde girl from an upper-middle-class family of German and Lebanese descent, [...] "well-behaved", always doing well at school, speaking three foreign languages and doing ballet. [...] A discussion emerged in the Brazilian public about the worth of family values and the effects of education: Do a high standard of education and high class status lead to good character?The question as to whether Suzane was the evil mind behind the crime or just Daniel's tool was also widely discussed. Many people who initially were emotionally on Suzane's side, changed their opinion when a TV interview with her was shown. Before the interview, when the cameras were already on, she was instructed for the interview by her lawyer. He told her to cry out loud during the broadcast, to create public sympathy. In the outcome, however, the interview dealt a major blow to her credibility. In court, Suzane still was very cold, while the Cravinhos brothers were crying most of the time. At one occasion, she even <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The play {{starts with}} the musical number, [...] "Springtime for Hitler." [...] Accompanied by dancing stormtroopers, who at one point form a Busby Berkeley-style swastika, the play {{immediately}} horrifies everyone in the audience except the author, and one lone viewer who breaks into applause—only to be pummeled by other disgusted theatergoers. As the audience begins to storm out of the theater, the first scene starts, with L.S.D. dressed up in full Nazi uniform and talking like a beatnik. The remaining audience <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh,</b> thinking {{that it is a}} satire, and those that had left return to the theater.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Peggy <b>starts</b> talking <b>to</b> [...] "Susie" [...] (actually Elaine) about Elaine, making {{derogatory}} {{comments about}} her. Elaine becomes angry, {{partly because of}} the comments, but also, bizarrely, because Peggy addresses her as [...] "Suze" [...] rather than Susie. When Peterman overhears, he wants to resolve the conflict and demands a meeting between Peggy, Elaine, and [...] "Susie". Elaine becomes so tired of pretending to be Susie that, while driving in the car one night, Jerry tells her that she should [...] "eliminate her". Mike (trapped in the trunk) overhears this, and believing Susie to be a real person, becomes even more terrified of Jerry, thinking that he is a killer, especially when Jerry and Elaine both <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> sinisterly (though they are really just laughing at a funny bumper sticker).|$|R
50|$|Watching is Porky Pig, as a Friar Tuck figure, who laughs uproariously at Daffy's inglorious plunge. The annoyed Daffy {{tries to}} prove his skill with a quarterstaff ("Actually, it's a buck-and-a-quarter quarterstaff, but I'm not telling him that!") on a tree-trunk bridge, but manages to hit himself {{in the face with}} it, bending his bill in what becomes a {{recurring}} visual gag throughout the film. Undeterred, Daffy tries again, but while he is spinning his quarterstaff, Porky stops it with a wooden dowel, resulting in Daffy himself spinning around and falling back into the river. He gets {{out of the water and}} confronts Porky, who has once again been reduced to fits of laughter. Daffy is initially annoyed, but then <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> along with him before becoming annoyed again.|$|R
