40|$|IntroductionSurgical endarterectomy is the {{preferred}} method for treating occlusive disease of the common femoral artery (CFA). However, endarterectomy is not always straightforward in cases with heavily calcified plaque. To overcome this limitation, a new method for decalcification, which utilizes a Cavitron ultrasonic <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> (CUSA) has been developed. ReportThe method involves full exposure of the calcified lesion. Following an arteriotomy, protruding calcification is removed using the CUSA, taking care to avoid vessel perforation. Preservation of the medial calcified layer {{can be accomplished by}} the accurate control provided by the device, which enables smooth termination in the distal area of the normal wall and does not require a tacking suture. A total of 12 patients underwent decalcification of 13 common femoral artery (CFA) lesions using CUSA with vein patch angioplasty. Concomitant profundaplasty was performed in five cases. The only intra-operative complication was perforation of the arterial wall in one patient, while another had a wound infection that required reintervention. DiscussionDecalcification of a heavily calcified CFA with CUSA appears to be feasible, although long-term follow-up examinations are warranted...|$|E

We describe the MR imaging findings of spinal cord schistosomiasis in correlation with surgery and pathology. METHODS: We report eight cases of spinal cord schistosomiasis. All patients were men (mean age, 16. 7 years) with neurologic manifestations who had been referred for spinal MR imaging. In all cases, spinal masses were surgically removed. MR imaging findings were correlated with surgery and pathology. RESULTS: MR imaging showed moderate expansion of the distal spinal cord in all cases. Abnormalities were isointense to cord in T 1 and patchy hyperintense in T 2 -weighted spin-echo images (n 8).

However, the English literature contains almost no reports on the use of thulium lasers during neurosurgical procedures. Methods: We report our experience with a thulium laser during the surgical removal of a tentorial meningioma. The intraoperative technique utilized, as well as the clinical and radiological results of the procedure, are described. Results: The thulium laser proved to be a useful tool during coagulation, shrinking, and resection of the basal implant of the tumor. Use of the laser made the surgical procedure faster and easier, and no intraoperative bleeding was noted. No side effects were observed. Conclusions: Our experience indicates that thulium lasers are a valid aid during resection of benign intracranial tumors under microscope magnification.

In the sphenoid wing of a cadaver section, ultrasonic bone aspiration yielded lower thermal rise in precision bone removal than rotary mechanical drills, with maximum temperature of 31 °C versus 69 °C for fluted and 79 °C for diamond drill bits. Mean ultrasonic fragmentation power was about 8 Watts. Statistical studies using tenacious porcine cranium yielded mean power levels of about 4. 5 Watts to 11 Watts and mean temperature of less than 41. 1 °C.

ANIMALS: Fresh Beagle cadavers (n= 5) and 10 chondrodystrophic dogs with thoracolumbar disk extrusion. METHODS: Cadaveric study: Intervertebral disks T 12 -L 2 were fenestrated with the CUSA Excel in 5 Beagle cadavers, and fenestration efficacy assessed by morphologic {{examination of the}} completeness of fenestration and size of annulotomy. Clinical study: the affected intervertebral disk was fenestrated in 10 chondrodystrophic dogs treated by hemilaminectomy for thoracolumbar disk disease. Efficacy of fenestration was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean time necessary to perform CUSA assisted fenestration was 8 minutes (range, 5 - 10 minutes) for each disk in cadavers and patients. In cadaver spines, removal of the nucleus pulposus was complete in 11 / 15 disks. In 4 disks, remnants of nucleus pulposus material were observed on the contralateral side. Nuclear material was normal in 9 / 15 disks and showed evidence of chondroid degeneration on histopathologic examination in the 6 disks. Median annulotomy size was 3 mm.

This review assesses {{the benefits and}} risks associated with the various techniques. MethodsRandomized clinical trials were identified from the Cochrane Library Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded and reference lists. Odds ratio (ORs), mean difference (MDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis or available-case analysis. ResultsWe identified seven trials including a total of 556 patients. Blood transfusion requirements were lower with the clamp–crush technique than with the CUSA or hydrojet. The clamp–crush technique was quicker than the CUSA, hydrojet or RFDS. Infective complications and transection blood loss were greater with the RFDS than with the clamp–crush method. There {{was no significant difference}} between techniques in mortality, morbidity, liver dysfunction or intensive therapy unit and hospital stay. ConclusionsThe clamp–crush technique is more rapid and is associated with lower rates of blood loss and otherwise similar outcomes when compared with other methods of parenchymal transection.

The authors present their initial experience of a heterogenous spectrum of robotic hepatobiliary cases and the first reported case series from India. Methods: Retrospective review of hepatobiliary cases done robotically from February 2015 to January 2016 was done. Results: The series has ten patients; with median age of 45 years (range 15 – 72). Etiologies were choledochal cyst type IVa, benign lower end common bile duct stricture (biliary reconstruction group); incidental gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, polycystic liver disease, hemangioma, liver metastases, hydatid cyst (resection group). Median operative duration was 510  min; one patient needed intra-operative blood transfusion {{and there were no}} conversions to open surgery. One patient developed bile leak which was managed by biliary stenting and another thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura during post-operative period.

40|$|Background. Surgical {{resection}} is {{the most}} effective therapy for liver cancer. Intraoperative blood loss during liver resection remains a major concern due to association with higher postoperative complications. The InLine radiofrequency ablation device (ILRFA) has achieved promising results in liver surgery with minimal blood loss and no increase of postoperative complications. In this multicentre controlled study, 108 patients undergoing liver resection were investigated. Patients and methods. A total of 108 patients underwent liver resections in 4 medical centres; the prospective sequential cohort study consisted of 54 ILRFA and 54 ultrasonic <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> transections as the control group. Results. The type of liver resection performed was very similar in both groups. The median number of RFA deployments was 3 (range 1 – 12) with a median coagulation time of 9 (range 3 – 36) min. Median blood loss was 165 ± 20 ml (range 5 – 675) in the ILRFA and 654 ± 83 ml (range 80 – 3600) in the control group (p< 0. 001). The median transection time was 27 (2 – 219) min in the ILRFA group and 35 (5 – 62) min in controls. Conclusions. Our study indicates that ILRFA device for liver transection is effective in reducing blood loss and is safe. Precoagulation before parenchymal transection appears to be a valid concept in liver surgery. The avoidance of vascular inflow occlusion during parenchymal transection could also be of value...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial {{ovarian cancer}} {{represents}} {{the most aggressive}} neoplasm of women genital apparatus with a total 5 -year survival rate ranging from 17 % to 35 % if the disease is in the metastatic phase. Its aggressiveness derives {{from the fact that}} it is an asymptomatic disease until it spreads in abdominal cavity. Therefore, in 70 % of the cases, the diagnosis is done when tumor is already in advanced phase (Stage FIGO IIB-IV). Data from international literature suggest that standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer is optimal cytoreductive surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy platinum-based. However, in the last decades, many authors have described the enthusiastic results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery. Griffiths, first, underlined the importance of residual mass after cytoreductive surgery as a prognostic factor. Currently, cytoreduction is defined optimal when residual mass is microscopical or absent. Nevertheless, surgery for ovarian cancer turns out to be a particularly aggressive surgery that needs an operator's remarkable technical ability and a cultural Background: Many studies demonstrated that the frequency of feasibility of optimal cytoreductive surgery also varies within the gynecologic oncology specialized centers. During the last few years, new technologies (such as Cavitron Ultrasonic <b>Surgical</b> <b>Aspirator,</b> CUSA, and argon's coagulator) and new surgical techniques have been introduced.

30|$|All {{patients}} underwent {{the procedure}} in the prone position under general anaesthesia. A microscope {{was used to}} examine the tissue. Levelling was done using a fluoroscope. For cervical surgeries, a Mayfield clamp was used to fix the head in a flexed position. A midline posterior approach was used with sub-periosteal dissection to expose laminae bilaterally. Facet joints were carefully preserved. Laminectomy was performed {{at the level of the}} tumour, ensuring that we had adequate exposure of the cranial and caudal limits of the tumour. After extradural haemostasis, a midline durotomy was performed using a hook and knife. The posterior median sulcus was then identified and gently opened to access the tumour. We did not use coagulation and stayed within the limits of the tumour, performing internal debulking with the help of a Cavitron Ultrasonic <b>Surgical</b> <b>Aspirator</b> (CUSA). After limited debulking, we dissected the tumour from the margins and rolled it inward. Once the dissection was completed up to the normal cord, we completed the haemostasis. We used Surgicel (Fibrillar and other) to achieve proper haemostasis. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring was not used. The dura was closed in a watertight fashion using non-absorbable sutures with or without dural graft according to the intraoperative situation to avoid cord strangulation, and the Valsalva manoeuvre was performed to identify any leaks.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundNew {{instruments}} and techniques for hepatectomy {{have been shown}} to reduce blood loss during liver resection. The present study aims to evaluate the feasibility and result of our techniques of liver resection without routine inflow occlusion (the Pringle manoeuver). MethodsThe cavitron ultrasonic <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> (CUSA) and saline-linked radio-frequency dissecting sealer (TissueLink) were used together for open hepatectomy, whereas a bipolar vessel sealing device (Ligasure) and TissueLink were used for laparoscopic hepatectomy. Between June 2003 and May 2007, 248 consecutive cases of liver resection were carried out using the above techniques without the routine Pringle manoeuver. The operative and clinical outcome data were prospectively collected and analysed. ResultsDuring the study period, a total of 220 cases of open hepatectomy and 28 cases of laparoscopic hepatectomy were performed. The Pringle manoeuver was eventually applied in six patients (2. 4 %) : two for portal vein tumour thrombus extraction and four as a result of heavy bleeding. Median blood loss was 300 ml (20 – 2700 ml) and the blood transfusion rate was 7. 7 %. In most of the cases, the liver function tests showed improvement on post-operative day 1 or 2, and the median post-operative hospital stay was 7 days. There were two post-operative deaths (0. 8 %). Complications occurred in 63 patients (25. 4 %) and most complications were minor. ConclusionsRefined techniques and instruments for liver resection allow hepatectomy to be done safely without using the routine Pringle manoeuver. Most patients had a quick recovery of liver function and were discharged early...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundMany {{different}} surgical {{techniques have}} been described for hepatic parenchymal transection. A retrospective analysis of perioperative mortality, length of hospitalization and blood transfused during operation in two patient groups undergoing liver resection was carried out. In group A, we developed a new technique to resect hepatic parenchyma, using an ultrasonic <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> with monopolar floating ball cautery, while in group B the crushing clamp technique was used. MethodsIn all, 42 patients with liver resection were enrolled in group A and 107 resections in group B. All patients had hepatic neoplasms except for seven living transplant donors. In group A 43 % of resections involved ≥ 3 segments and 57 % involved ≤ 2 segments; in group B 36. 4 % involved ≥ 3 segments and 63. 6 % consisted of ≤ 2 segments. Statistical analysis utilised independent T square (Pearson Q square) and Mann–Whitney U test. ResultsIn group A 2. 4 % of patients died perioperatively, while 3. 7 % died in group B; mean length of stay (LOS) was 10. 9 days in group B and 8. 0 days in group A. The length of procedure was 7. 5 h in group B and 6. 7 h in group A. In group A, 79 % did not undergo blood transfusion intraoperatively as opposed to 61 % in group B. A mean of 0. 5 U of blood was utilized in group A and 1. 60 U in group B. DiscussionThe new method of parenchymal transection seems to reduce the LOS, length of procedure and need for intraoperative blood transfusion...|$|E
40|$|When feasible, {{surgical}} resection {{is typically}} the preferred therapeutic option {{in patients with}} both primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. Improved patient selection, preoperative management, and advances in perioperative care have had a considerable effect on short-term and long-term outcomes following hepatic resection. Parenchymal transection of the liver can be performed using many different techniques such as digitoclasia, clamp crushing, vessel sealing system, harmonic scalpel, water-jet, Cavitron Ultrasonic <b>Surgical</b> <b>Aspirator,</b> or radiofrequency dissecting sealer. At the time of surgery, {{one of the main}} factors that influences postoperative morbidity and mortality is blood loss. Different techniques are used to decrease blood loss, such as the Pringle maneuver, selective ligation of the right, left, or smaller branches of the portal system; extrahepatic dissection; isolation; and transection of the hepatic artery and portal vein and the total vascular exclusion. Liver resection is on occasion accompanied by a concomitant procedure. Given that colorectal liver metastasis is a common indication for liver resection, colon resection {{is one of the more}} common concurrent procedures, but also surgical management of other disease in the lung or pancreas may sometimes be indicated. A subset of patients with primary or secondary liver malignancies may also require the addition of an ablative therapy to treat the extent of disease in the liver. Moreover, occasionally, hepatic resection takes place following intra-arterial therapy administration to the liver. Although many of these patients may benefit from surgical therapy, a multidisciplinary team approach remains critical. The liver is one of the most common sites for metastaticdisease and can also harbor primary hepatic malignan-cies. The rich blood supply of the liver makes it a probabl...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective Since the 1960 s, lasers {{have been}} used in {{neurosurgery}} for surgical removal of intracranial tumors. Because of its limited penetration (2 mm) through tissues and its wavelength, which is useful in water medium, the 2 -mu thulium laser has been applied primarily in urology. Its features are attractive for application under microscope magnification during neurosurgical procedures. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of the 2 -mu thulium laser during microsurgical removal of intracranial meningiomas. Materials and Methods Twenty patients with a diagnosis of intracranial meningiomas were treated with surgical intervention using a 2 -mu thulium laser together with bipolar forceps, cavitron ultrasonic <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> (CUSA) and traditional microdissection instruments. Surgical removal was divided in four phases: (1) dissection from the external structures; (2) coagulation and debulking; (3) dissection from the deep structures; and (4) coagulation and removal of the basal implant. During all these steps, we evaluated the percentage of usage of the 2 -mu thulium laser comparing them with bipolar forceps and ultrasonic aspirator and blunt dissection. Results Thulium laser was used mainly during phases 2 and 4 for 43 % and 48. 7 % of the total removal, respectively. Although also useful during phases 1 and 3, it was only used for 2. 2 % and 31. 3 %, respectively: traditional dissection with scissors and forceps was preferred. Conclusions Thulium laser seems to be a useful aid in the surgery of intracranial meningiomas, especially to debulk, shrink, and coagulate the mass and the basal implant. Lasers Surg.

40|$|ObjectiveCardiac {{surgery in}} {{patients}} with severely atherosclerotic or porcelain ascending aorta is technically challenging, with markedly increased risk of atheroembolism. We describe a technique of meticulous crossclamping of a difficult aorta during short-term moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest. MethodsFrom 1997 to 2007, we found 40 patients (mean age, 70 ± 8 years), including 14 patients undergoing hemodialysis, whose preoperative computed tomographic and intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scans revealed eggshell calcification (n = 15) or protruding atheromas (n = 25) of the ascending aorta. They underwent cardiac surgery (aortic, 31 patients; mitral, 3 patients; both, 5 patients; and coronary alone, 1 patient) by means of meticulous crossclamping during hypothermic circulatory arrest for 3. 4 ± 1. 5 minutes at a rectal temperature of 29. 0 °C ± 2. 3 °C. During hypothermic circulatory arrest, we performed only internal inspection to identify the safe location of crossclamping in 21 patients, whereas we required debridement of calcification or atheroma by using the Cavitron Ultrasonic <b>Surgical</b> <b>Aspirator</b> (Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, Mass) for safe crossclamping in 19 patients. ResultsBy using this technique, no patients died during the hospital stay. Stroke occurred in 1 (2. 5 %) patient, and transient agitation occurred in 1 patient. Re-exploration for bleeding was required in 1 patient, and wound infection occurred in 2 patients. During follow-up, with a median time of 5. 2 years, the overall survival rates were 100 %, 90 %, and 76 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Three patients required reoperations during the follow-up period because of pseudoaneurysm in 2 patients and prosthetic valve infection in 1 patient. ConclusionShort-term moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest is quite useful for safe aortic crossclamping after internal inspection or debridement in high-risk patients with a severely atherosclerotic aorta...|$|E
