40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{determine}} the comparative effectiveness {{and costs of}} a CT-strategy and a stress-electrocardiography-based strategy (standard-of-care; SOC-strategy) for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). MethodsA decision analysis was performed based on a well-documented prospective cohort of 471 outpatients with stable chest pain with follow-up combined with best-available evidence from the literature. Outcomes were correct classification of patients as CAD− (no obstructive CAD), CAD+ (obstructive CAD without revascularization) and indication for Revascularization (using a combination reference standard), diagnostic costs, lifetime health care costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Parameter uncertainty was analyzed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. ResultsFor men (and women), diagnostic cost savings were € 245 (€ 252) for the CT-strategy {{as compared to the}} SOC-strategy. The CT-strategy classified 82 % (88 %) of <b>simulated</b> <b>men</b> (women) in the appropriate disease category, whereas 83 % (85 %) were correctly classified by the SOC-strategy. The long-term cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the SOC-strategy was dominated by the CT-strategy, which was less expensive (−€ 229 in men, −€ 444 in women) and more effective (+ 0. 002 QALY in men, + 0. 005 in women). The CT-strategy was cost-saving (−€ 231) but also less effective compared to SOC (− 0. 003 QALY) in men with a pre-test probability of ≥ 70 %. The CT-strategy was cost-effective in 100 % of simulations, except for men with a pre-test probability ≥ 70 % in which case it was 59 %. ConclusionsThe results suggest that a CT-based strategy is less expensive and equally effective compared to SOC in all women and in men with a pre-test probability < 70 %...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reducing salt intake {{has been}} {{proposed}} to prevent cardiovascular disease in India. We sought to determine whether salt reductions would be beneficial or feasible, given the worry that unrealistically large reductions would be required, worsening iodine deficiency and benefiting only urban subpopulations. Methods and Results: Future myocardial infarctions (MI) and strokes in India were predicted with a Markov model <b>simulating</b> <b>men</b> and women aged 40 to 69 in both urban and rural locations, incorporating the risk reduction from lower salt intake. If salt intake does not change, we expect, 8. 3 million MIs (95 % CI: 6. 9 – 9. 6 million), 830, 000 strokes (690, 000 – 960, 000) and 2. 0 million associated deaths (1. 5 – 2. 4 million) per year among Indian adults aged 40 to 69 {{over the next three}} decades. Reducing intake by 3 g/day over 30 years (20. 1 g/year, 25 % reduction) would reduce annual MIs by 350, 000 (a 4. 6 % reduction; 95 % CI: 320, 000 – 380, 000), strokes by 48, 000 (26. 5 %; 13, 000 – 83, 000) and deaths by 81, 000 (24. 9 %; 59, 000 – 100, 000) among this group. The largest decline in MIs would be among younger urban men, but the greatest number of averted strokes would be among rural men, and nearly one-third of averted strokes and one-fifth of averted MIs would be among rural women.

Spasm resulted in mild angina associated with slight elevation of pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure and ST depression when collaterals were present rather than elevation and lower cardiac lactate production, suggesting strongly that collaterals do salvage myocardium when ischemia is produced by spasm.|$|R

Additionally we assessed a treat-all strategy in which all individuals were prescribed either moderate-dose or high-dose statins and all males received low-dose aspirin.

This effect was qualified by a significant interaction with interactivity, F(1, 96) = 9. 62, p =. 003, such that the relationship between higher negative affect and risk-reduction was much stronger in the interactive condition.

40|$|Space mission {{simulator}} {{programs may}} {{be divided into}} two broad categories: (1) training tools (quali-tative devices often simulating a continuous mission), and (2) laboratory tools (quantitative devices treating the mission in phases, each phase being programmed separately to obtain optimum scaling). This paper describes the development of an analog program capable of continuously simulating an entire lunar mission in six degrees of freedom with high resolu-tion throughout. The reported work logically traces the program development through the equations of motion, the guidance and control equations, and the analog mechanization. The translation equations are de-veloped using a modified form of Encke’s method; two reference origins are utilized at the two points of primary interest&mdash;the landing site and the target vehicle&mdash;such that the displacements are approach-ing a minimum in the regions where the highest reso-lution is required. The variables are rescaled as this region is approached to obtain maximum accuracy. Relays, stepping switches and diode gates are used for rescaling and to re-reference origins. A particular Euler angle sequence is selected based on matrix validity criteria applied to the mission. A previously reported guidance technique is shown to be appli-cable to all phases of the mission. It is concluded that the method demonstrated in this paper leads to minimum computer loading for <b>simulating</b> a <b>manned</b> space mission without program discontinuities.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness of growth hormone (GH) treatment (Genotropin(R)) compared with no GH treatment in adults with GH deficiency in a Swedish societal setting. METHODS: A Markov-type cost-utility simulation model was constructed {{and used to}} <b>simulate,</b> for <b>men</b> and women, morbidity and mortality for GH-treated and -untreated individuals over a 20 -year period. The calculations were performed using current available prices concerning morbidity-related healthcare costs and costs for Genotropin(R). All costs and treatment effects were discounted at 3 %. Costs were expressed in Euro (1 [euro sign] = 9. 03 SEK). GH-treated Swedish patients (n = 434) were identified from the KIMS database (Pfizer International Metabolic Database) and untreated patients (n = 2135) from the Swedish Cancer Registry and the Hospital Discharge Registry. RESULTS: The results are reported as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, including both direct and indirect costs for GH-treated versus untreated patients. The weighted sum of all subgroup incremental cost per QALY was [euro sign] 15, 975 and [euro sign] 20, 241 for men and women, respectively. Including indirect cost resulted in lower cost per QALY gained: [euro sign] 11, 173 and [euro sign] 10, 753 for men and women, respectively. Key drivers of the results were improvement in quality of life, increased survival, and intervention cost. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost per QALY gained is moderate when compared with informal thresholds applied in Sweden.

40|$|First order {{predictions}} {{were made}} in determining the effects of various sources of inefficiency in rowing on shell speed. These predictions were then tested using a MATLAB model of the rowing stroke. The model <b>simulates</b> an eight <b>man</b> oared rowing shell and determines average shell speed, stroke rating, power per stroke, and time over a 2000 meter race. Several parameters of the rowing model are manipulated {{to determine the effects}} of each source of inefficiency on shell speed. Of the sources tested, three can be attributed to the shell manufacturer, and the others can be attributed to the rowers themselves. The sources of inefficiency tested are wetted surface area, coefficient of friction, dynamic and static weight, stroke length, slide acceleration, and stroke rating. The effects on shell velocity were normalized to determine which sources resulted in the greatest inefficiencies. The ranking of sources from greatest to smallest effect on shell speed are stroke rating, coefficient of friction, wetted surface area, stroke length, static weight, dynamic weight, and slide acceleration. by Stephen F.
