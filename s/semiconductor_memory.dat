25|$|As {{mentioned}} elsewhere, {{core memory}} {{had long since}} been slower than many CPU designs. The advent of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>memory</b> reduced this difference, {{but it was still}} apparent that more registers (and later caches) would allow higher CPU operating frequencies. Additional registers would require sizeable chip or board areas which, at the time (1975), could be made available if the complexity of the CPU logic was reduced.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{multi-core}} CPUs became commercially available. Content-addressable memory (CAM) {{has become}} inexpensive {{enough to be}} used in networking, and is frequently used for on-chip cache memory in modern microprocessors, although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages. Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>memory</b> cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS logic gates developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a CMOS gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states, except for leakage.|$|E

2500|$|Mixtures of decimal prefixes and binary sector sizes require care to {{properly}} calculate total capacity. Whereas <b>semiconductor</b> <b>memory</b> naturally favors powers of two (size doubles each time an address pin {{is added to}} the integrated circuit), the capacity of a disk drive is the product of sector size, sectors per track, tracks per side and sides (which in hard disk drives with multiple platters can be greater than 2). Although other sector sizes have been known in the past, formatted sector sizes are now almost always set to powers of two (256 bytes, 512 bytes, etc.), and, in some cases, disk capacity is calculated as multiples of the sector size rather than only in bytes, leading to a combination of decimal multiples of sectors and binary sector sizes. For example, 1.44MB 3½-inch HD disks have the [...] "M" [...] prefix peculiar to their context, coming from their capacity of 2,880 512-byte sectors (1,440 KiB), consistent with neither a decimal megabyte nor a binary mebibyte (MiB). Hence, these disks hold 1.47MB or 1.41MiB. Usable data capacity {{is a function of the}} disk format used, which in turn is determined by the FDD controller and its settings. Differences between such formats can result in capacities ranging from approximately 1300 to 1760 KiB (1.80 MB) on a standard 3½-inch high-density floppy (and up to nearly 2 MB with utilities such as 2M/2MGUI). The highest capacity techniques require much tighter matching of drive head geometry between drives, something not always possible and unreliable. For example, the LS-240 drive supports a 32MB capacity on standard 3½-inch HD disks, but it is, however, a write-once technique, and requires its own drive.|$|E
