50|$|Following {{a three-year}} {{planning}} phase on 7 July 1840 the city appointed Karl Emanuel Müller {{as the lead}} engineer on the Nydegg Bridge project. Starting in August 1840, crews worked throughout the winter of 1840/41 to build coffer dams and prepare the foundations for the bridge pillars. Despite severe floods and other delays by May 1841 the pillars were in place and above water level. The cornerstone ceremony took place in early June of the same year. In the fall of 1841 construction began {{on the eastern side}} arch and by the following fall both the western and eastern side arches were finished. With the side arches finished, in the winter of 1842 workers began building the scaffolding for the larger central arch. By the summer of 1843, the central arch was completed and on 14-15 September 1843 the placing of the keystone was celebrated with cannon fire, speeches and a feast. With major construction completed, the <b>scaffolding</b> was <b>dismantled</b> and <b>work</b> began on the decoration and roadway on the bridge. On 23 November 1844 the bridge was dedicated with a celebration attended by the entire city. The entire project cost about 1,650,000 Franks.|$|R

50|$|The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is {{responsible}} for the decommissioning of the UK Magnox power plants, at an estimated cost of £12.6 billion. There is currently debate about whether a 25 or 100 year decommissioning strategy should be adopted. After 80 years short-lifetime radioactive material in the defuelled core would have decayed to the point that human access to the reactor structure would be possible, easing <b>dismantling</b> <b>work.</b> A shorter decommissioning strategy would require a fully robotic core dismantling technique.|$|R

The French aircraft carrier Clemenceau was also contracted to be recycled on the site. Recycling of the ships was completed in 2011.|$|R

It was decided that due to the amount of work needed and the possible revenue that could be generated, it was not worth the effort and the project was dropped. In 2002 the Helston Railway Preservation Society was formed with about 12 members and on 28 April 2005, 40 years after the line was <b>dismantled,</b> <b>work</b> began clearing the overgrown vegetation.|$|R

The incident was classified level 1 by the ASN.|$|R
5|$|The {{earthquake}} produced severe shaking that registered VIII on the Mercalli {{scale in}} and around the city of Christchurch, destroying some buildings and causing additional damage to many structures affected by previous earthquakes. The damaged tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station collapsed before <b>dismantling</b> <b>work</b> could be completed. The earthquake downed phone lines and triggered widespread outages, which left around 54,000 households without power. Rebuilding costs in Christchurch increased by NZ$6 billion (US$4.8 billion) owing to the additional damage from the quake. Forty-six people suffered injuries, and one elderly man died after being knocked unconscious.|$|R
50|$|In 1782, Emperor Joseph II {{ordered the}} {{dismantling}} of most fortifications in the Low Countries, including those of Brussels. The <b>dismantling</b> <b>work</b> of the exterior defences began in {{the east of the}} city. In 1795, when Republican France invaded and annexed the Low Countries, the demolitions were stopped, not resuming until an order from Napoleon in 1804. Laeken Gate was destroyed in 1808. By an ordinance on May 19, 1810, the French Emperor ordered the second walls demolished and replaced by boulevards with a median in the centre. The fall of the First French Empire prevented the project's immediate execution.|$|R

By 2009 the four US ships had been received at the site together with the former French aircraft carrier Clemenceau were sealed inside the dry dock, which was drained, and the ships scrapped.

60|$|The second {{parallel}} was {{now nearly}} ready to open.

It was made a little before daybreak of the 16th, by about three hundred and fifty men, under the direction of Lieutenant-colonel Abercrombie. The redoubts which covered the batteries were forced in gallant style, and several pieces of artillery hastily spiked. By this time the supporting troops from the trenches came up, and the enemy were obliged to retreat. The mischief had been done too hastily. The spikes were easily extracted, and before evening all the batteries and the parallel were nearly complete.|$|R
50|$|On 1 April 1885, the Altenkirchen-Hachenburg {{stretch of}} railway, the {{so-called}} Oberwesterwaldbahn, was {{opened with a}} station at Hattert, whose building time can nevertheless no longer be exactly dated. The first plans for such a railway were put forth as early as 1842, and the last stretch of the line, from Altenkirchen to Au/Sieg began running on 1 May 1887. By 1 August 1901, a narrow-gauge railway (Kleinbahn-AG Selters-Hachenburg) linked Hachenburg and Selters. The alignment led right through the Hatterter Grund, and both Niederhattert and Oberhattert had halts at their disposal. In 1950, <b>dismantling</b> <b>work</b> began on the narrow-gauge railway.
