40|$|The western rock lobster {{fishery is}} one of the most {{valuable}} <b>single‐species</b> <b>fisheries</b> in Australia, valued at AU 300 million per year. The impact of environmental factors such as lunar cycle and swell on the daily catch rate of the western rock lobster (Panulirus cynus) is of particular interest in the stock assessment and management of the fishery. The variation in daily catch rates was examined for two periods (migrating period November‐January, non‐migrating period February‐June), at different depths in three management zones for three categories of lobster (undersize, legal size, and setose). Regression and transfer function models for relationships between catch rates and environmental data were considered and compared.

In contrast to <b>single-species</b> <b>fisheries</b> management, EBM aims {{to identify and}} resolve conflicting objectives for different species. Such a conflict may be emerging in the northeastern Pacific for southern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) and their primary prey, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).

We modeled individual killer whale prey requirements from feeding and growth records of captive killer whales and morphometric data from historic live-capture fishery and whaling records worldwide. The models, combined with caloric value of salmon, and demographic and diet data for wild killer whales, allow us to predict salmon quantities needed to maintain and recover this killer whale population, which numbered 87 individuals in 2009.

40|$|The European Union Common Fisheries Policy has {{established}} a discard ban, which states that fish below a reference size cannot be sold directly for human consumption. In a fishing effort-regulated fishery, the discard ban can result in extra handling, storing and landing costs. In an output-regulated fishery, this policy might also limit the effort levels as all the catches count against the quota. In both cases, this regulation can reduce the economic performance of the companies, even in <b>single-species</b> <b>fisheries.</b> A possible solution {{is to increase the}} mesh size, thus retaining fewer small individuals. To study this option, a bioeconomic simulation of a change in the gear selectivity from 100 - to 120 -mm minimum mesh size (MMS) was performed. The results show that the private perspective (profits) does not change. Furthermore, due to the lower retention of 120 mm MMS, the efficiency of a fishing day was reduced by 5 % and 2. 5 %, {{from the point of view}} of capital and labour productivity, respectively. In contrast, gross revenues increased by 1. 5 % and crew compensation by 2 %. Given a societal benefit of this change in the mesh size, this gain could be re-distributed to provide an incentive for selectivity improvements...|$|E

40|$|Many {{flatfish}} {{species are}} caught in mixed demersal trawl fisheries and managed by Total Allowable Catch (TAC). Despite decades of fisheries management, several major stocks are severely depleted. Using the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) as an example, the failure of mixed-fisheries management is analysed by focussing on: the management system; the role of science; the role of managers and politicians; the response of fisheries to management. Failure of the CFP management could be ascribed to: incorrect management advice owing to bias in stock assessments; the tendency of politicians to set the TAC well above the recommended level; and non-compliance of the fisheries with the management regulations. We conclude that TAC management, although apparently successful in some <b>single-species</b> <b>fisheries,</b> inevitably leads to unsustainable exploitation of stocks caught in mixed demersal fisheries as it promotes discarding of over-quota catch and misreporting of catches, thereby corrupting {{the basis of the}} scientific advice and increasing the risk of stock collapse. This failure in mixed demersal fisheries has resulted in the loss of credibility of both scientists and managers, and has undermined the support of fishermen for management regulations. An approach is developed to convert the TAC system into a system that controls the total allowable effort (TAE). The approach takes account of the differences in catch efficiency between fleets as well as seasonal changes in the distribution of the target species and can also be applied in the recovery plans for rebuilding specific components of the demersal fish community, such as plaice, cod and hake...|$|E

We then quantified food-web changes using these datasets and trophodynamic indicators. We applied time series trends and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) {{to reduce the number}} of multivariate dimensions and to define ecosystem reference directions. To assess the correlation between ecological indicators and abiotic (human or environmental) factors, we used the non-parametric BIO-ENV procedure. Results illustrated a general decrease in the biomass and catch of target species with time, with a first phase of increasing catch and biomass of some organisms from the 1970 s to the 1980 s, a 2 ̆ 7 fishing down the food web 2 ̆ 7 process during the 1980 s, and a clear trend towards biomass and catch reductions during the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. These changes occurred in parallel with an increase in fishing effort and human development in the basin and changes in environmental factors such as an increase in the average annual sea water temperature, a decrease in the inflow of highly saline Mediterranean water into the Adriatic Sea, and changes in the atmospheric pressure at sea level. We found a high and significant correlation between ecological indicators and abiotic factors (in particular with human factors: fishing effort and the human development index). Results from the PCA summarized main ecosystem trends and could be used as a reference framework. These results complement traditional <b>single-species</b> <b>fisheries</b> assessments and inform on past trajectories and present ecological status of the North-Central Adriatic Sea...|$|E

In this paper we assume that the growth function is nonrandom but dependent upon a biomass stock of unknown size.

Both are efforts to predict trajectories of populations and ecosystems to inform fisheries management and conceptual understanding. However, many of these ecosystems exhibit nonlinear dynamics, {{which may not be}} represented in the models. As a result, model outputs may underestimate variability and overestimate stability. Using nonlinear forecasting methods, we compare predictability and nonlinearity of model outputs against model inputs using data and models for the California Current System. Compared with model inputs, time series of model-processed outputs show more predictability but a higher prevalence of linearity, suggesting that the models misrepresent the actual predictability of the modeled systems. Thus, caution is warranted: using such models for management or scenario exploration may produce unforeseen consequences, especially in the context of unknown future impacts...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} impact of non-compliance and market power in a fishery regulated using individual transferable quotas (ITQs). The study analyses individual firm quota demands in the presence of non-compliance and/or market power and the resultant properties of the ITQ market. The analysis is static and set in a <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery.</b> The implications of non-compliance for a fishery composed entirely of competitive firms are examined first. Here the analysis departs from the convention in the literature on analogous pollution permit markets in that firms' expected penalties are modelled as a function of their relative violations of quotas. This has a significant effect upon the results, including the possibility of quota prices which are higher with non-compliance. The research then focuses on market power in the setting of a single dominant firm faced by a fringe of competitive firms. The dominant firm is allowed market power in the quota market alone and then in both quota and output markets simultaneously. In the latter case the results differ from those previously reported in the literature, including the possibility that the firm may be freely compliant, or if cheating, may have a positive quota demand even with a zero initial quota allocation. Finally, the effects of non-compliance by the dominant firm and the competitive fringe are explored...|$|R

Our analyses provide new information on cost of lactation and new parameter estimates for other killer whale populations globally. Prey requirements of southern resident killer whales are difficult to reconcile with fisheries and conservation objectives for Chinook salmon, {{because the number of}} fish required is large relative to annual returns and fishery catches. For instance, a U. S. recovery goal (2. 3 % annual population growth of killer whales over 28 years) implies a 75 % increase in energetic requirements. Reducing salmon fisheries may serve as a temporary mitigation measure to allow time for management actions to improve salmon productivity to take effect. As ecosystem-based fishery management becomes more prevalent, trade-offs between conservation objectives for predators and prey will become increasingly necessary. Our approach offers scenarios to compare relative influence of various sources of uncertainty on the resulting consumption estimates to prioritise future research efforts, and a general approach for assessing the extent of conflict between conservation objectives for threatened or protected wildlife where the interaction between affected species can be quantified.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the landing {{obligation}} under the European Common Fisheries Policy, electronic monitoring (EM) is often presented as one of the solutions to fully document catches. EM includes video monitoring to record the catch handling process on board the vessels. This study evaluated the efficacy of EM for cod (Gadus morhua) catches on vessels in a mixed bottom-trawl fishery and tested the hypothesis that cod catches are difficult to detect with video monitoring, specifically in catches with large volumes of bycatch. In 2011, a catch quota pilot study started for cod in the Dutch bottom-trawl fishery in which EM was used as an audit system to review the consistency of reported cod catches. Eleven vessels joined the pilot study on a voluntary basis. Participants received a 30 % increase in individual quota for cod and were compensated with extra effort in days at sea. In return, all cod catches were counted against their cod quota. This mixed bottom-trawl fishery differs from fisheries where EM was proven to be a successful method, e. g. hook and line or <b>single-species</b> <b>fisheries</b> with low bycatch volumes. We conclude that distinguishing small numbers of cod in catches of mixed bottom-trawl fisheries is difficult because there is a low correlation between logbook and video data (Pearson r = 0. 17). We expect similar difficulty in other mixed demersal trawl fisheries with large bycatch volumes, when similar-looking species are targeted. Meanwhile, implementing a landing obligation will pose large challenges for fisheries with large volumes of bycatch. Limitations in the applicability of EM to control {{one of the most common}} types of fisheries in Europe will be a burden on the implementation of the European landing obligation. Improved protocols and technical adaptations may reduce some of the limitations encountered in this study...|$|E

Species-wise stock abundance studies, in this context, pose problems not normally {{encountered in the}} case of <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery</b> for which evaluation of standard effort is not difficult and models are available to study such fishery in detail, Hence a new approach, considering multispecies fishery as a whole, is taken up for study in this paper where the relative contributions of mechanised crafts, prawn fisheries and pelagic fisheries are considered for detailed statistical analysis. This approach is found to be useful when there are considerable fluctuations in the landings which is the characteristic feature of marine fish landings in India, In this analysis three assumptions are made on the status of stock abundance and fishery independent and dependent factors. These assumptions are not contradicted by the analysis of variance. Three important points emerge out of this study. In majority of the States as well as on all India level, the trend of total landings was similar to that of pelagic fish landings. Increase in the intensity of mechanised effort has not relatively increased prawn landings. Landings from mechanised units showed an increase even when there was no increase in the total landings thus indicating the impact of mechanised crafts on the traditional fishing.

40|$|Yearly {{revisions}} of Total Allowable Catch under EU policies {{for the management}} of North Sea fisheries come at high management costs and capital adjustment costs. It is unclear whether current EU fisheries policy strikes the right balance between the need to regularly adjust fish quota to new information on one hand, and the costs of gathering information and adjusting fisheries capital stock on the other hand. To analyze this question we present a model for a <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery,</b> where a profit maximizing decision-maker jointly determines optimal harvest and capital adjustment levels. Two alternative management systems are compared to the case of sole ownership without policy constraints: annual constrained quota adjustment and multiannual quota adjustment. In the case of unconstrained sole ownership the decision maker optimizes harvest and capital adjustment levels, while under annual constrained quota adjustment change in harvest is constrained by the harvest level of the previous year. Under multiannual quota adjustment capital adjustment is optimized on an annual basis while harvest is fixed for a longer period. We analyse quota adjustment in a stochastic setting, and compare results for the total discounted net benefits that include management costs and fishermen’s capital adjustment costs. For the purpose of illustration we apply the model to North Sea plaice. Results of annual constrained quota adjustment show that as the system becomes more rigid the optimal harvest policy changes less between different levels of previous harvest. Consequently, as harvest in the previous period increases fewer investments are required. Results of multiannual quota adjustment show that both optimal policies change very little as the frequency of harvest change decreases. The change in optimal policies, however, decreases together with decreasing frequency of harvest change...|$|R

In the first years of this period, Llancà's fleet was composed basically of bottom trawl vessels and artisanal fishing boats (inshore longline and gill net).

40|$|Marine {{ecosystem}} health has been severely degraded {{by years of}} overfishing and ineffective management. Fisheries provide a source of food, jobs, and products and are backed by significant commercial, social, and industrial interests. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) was a major legislative benchmark for fisheries management, establishing regional management councils and national fishing standards. Single species, or target-focused management practices have been ineffective at preventing overfishing, bycatch, and habitat degradation. Fisheries continue to be unsustainable. The Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA - 1996 MSFCMA amendments) and the MSFCMA reauthorization in 2006, seek to shift management’s perspective to an ecosystem-based approach. The SFA formed the Ecosystem Principles Advisory Panel (EPAP) to research federal fisheries and management {{and to develop a}} model to advise Congress and managers. The panel identified basic principles of marine ecosystems and developed policies for ecosystem-based management, promoting health and sustainability. The high degree of uncertainty associated with ecosystem-based management has created considerable opposition. Fishermen and industries are unwilling to trade current economic benefits for future marine health, despite the benefits of stable, sustainable harvests. The EPAP seeks to shift the burden of proof to the fishing industry, requiring fishing practices be shown not to harm {{ecosystem health}} before permitting them. Further research should consider the ecosystem effects of fishing, trends and dynamics to align science, policy, and management goals. Panel recommendations extend current fishery management plans (FMPs) to consider fisheries on an ecosystem scale (fishery ecosystem plans, FEPs). FEPs consider interactions between target and non-target species, habitat, and human activities through precautionary management. There is no mandate for the adoption of FEPs, but the framework exists and policy is catching up with science. Many ecosystem principles are marginally applied in current management (i. e. marine protected areas). Progress has recently been made to transition from <b>single-species</b> <b>fisheries</b> management to ecosystem-based, but there is still room for improvement.

40|$|The lesser sandeel, Ammodytes marinus, {{is a key}} {{food for}} many seabirds and seals, and is also {{the target of the}} largest <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery</b> in the North Sea. Despite claims that sandeel fishing has harmed {{dependent}} predator populations, census data show that most seabirds and grey seals increased in numbers as the fishery grew and reached peak harvest. Generally high breeding success of black-legged kittiwakes at North Sea colonies also suggests that sandeel abundance has remained good for breeding seabirds at the broad scale, though local and small-scale effects of sandeel fishing should not be overlooked. VPA and CPUE data suggest that abundance increased as the fishery grew. A negative correlation between sandeel recruitment and total stock size preceding spawning suggests that there is now resource competition (bottom-up control). Bioenergetics modelling indicates that predatory fish take far more sandeel than taken by the industrial fishery or wildlife. Effects of decreases in predatory fish stocks have been greater than increases in the take by seabirds and seals and by the fishery. Thus, overall, there {{appears to have been a}} reduction in mortality during the last 30 years. Changes in predatory fish abundances, especially mackerel and whiting, may influence sandeel stocks more than changes in industrial fishery, at least at the scale of the North Sea as a whole. These interactions imply that seabird and seal food supply in terms of sandeel may be strongly dependent on decisions regarding management of stocks of mackerel and gadoids. The overwhelming influence of predation on "food-fish" by predatory fish may be a feature of many marine food webs worldwide, where "fishing down the food web" has occurred, and this has clear management implications if wildlife and fisheries are to coexist...|$|R

We tested this hypothesis by modeling nitrate input through upwelling to the upper layers of the ocean off Peru between 6 ° and 14 °S using data on wind stress and sea surface temperature. The model predicted the amount of carbon fixed by primary production each year from 1925 to 2000, which was then apportioned to the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass and ultimately to the seabird population and the anchovy <b>fishery,</b> the largest <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery</b> on Earth. The model predicted a marked increase in primary production as a consequence of increasing wind stress. It overestimated the anchovy biomass {{after the collapse of the}} fishery in 1972, but closely predicted the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to the mid- 1960 s, and their decline thereafter, explaining about 94 % of the variation in seabird numbers from 1925 to 2000. The model indicates the seabirds consumed 14. 4 % of the available anchovies and, thus, that seabirds consumed 2. 3 % of the new production, before the development of the anchovy fishery, and only 2. 2 % of the available anchovies and 0. 3 % of the new production after the development of the fishery. The model results clarify the roles that environmental and anthropogenic factors may have had in regulating the guano-producing seabird populations. It indicates that the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to 1955 was likely a response to increased productivity of the Peruvian upwelling system and that the subsequent drastic decline in seabird abundance was likely due to competition for food with the fishery, which caught ∼ 85 % of the anchovies, which otherwise would have been available for the seabirds. This model also shows that an increase in oceanic primary production promotes reproductive success and population growth in higher trophic level organisms...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{ecological}} forecasting of fishery yields in {{the face}} of climate variability has eluded resource managers for decades. However, recent advances in observing systems, computational power and understanding of ecosystem function offer credible evidence that the variability of the ocean ecosystem and its impact on fishery yield can be forecast accurately enough and with enough lead time to be useful to society. The tools are now in place to provide ocean managers the capability to both protect and wisely use living marine resources. Advances in space-based real time sensors, high performance computing, very high-resolution physical models, and robust ecosystem theory make possible operational forecasts of both fish availability and ecosystem health. Accurate and timely forecasts can provide the information needed to maintain the long-term sustainability of fish stocks and protect the ecosystem of which the fish are an integral part, while maximizing social and economic benefits and preventing wasteful overinvestment of economic resources. We propose to enhance the current decision support system for the small pelagic fishery and upwelling ecosystem in the coastal ocean off Peru with remote sensing information and state-of-the-art coupled physical-biogeochemical three dimensional ocean models to provide operational forecasting and improve ecosystem management. This region {{is the best in the}} world for this implementation because it has the world’s largest <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery,</b> the Peruvian anchovy, which is supported by the world’s most variable ocean ecosystem.

No other ocean region has this combination of environmental observations, fish resources, fisheries monitoring and well validated climate forecast models for forcing high-resolution operational ecosystem models. Once implemented for the Peruvian anchovy fishery, these tools will be ported to decision support systems for fisheries along the US West Coast and made available to others working in similar environments of the world ocean. 3 1.

Peruvian boobies Sula variegata and Guanay cormorants Phalacrocorax bougainvillii are the most abundant seabird species in the system and feed mainly on anchovies. By using high precision GPS and time−depth recorders, we compared the horizontal and vertical movements of the 2 species to examine whether segregation occurs between their foraging areas and whether there is any evidence for prey depletion close to large colonies. A simultaneous acoustic cruise in the foraging area of the 2 bird species estimated the vertical and horizontal distributions of anchovy schools. During the study period in austral spring 2008, the 2 bird species foraged in the same area, at relatively short distance from the colony (average, 19 to 20 km). Both species foraged at similar times of the day, although Peruvian boobies tended to leave earlier in the morning and return later in the evening than did the cormorants. Foraging trips were similar in duration, distance covered and range. Peruvian anchovies were abundant and schools occurred at shallow depths (median, 7 m; range, 3 to 34 m), mainly to the north and west of the colony where foraging bouts of the 2 species overlapped extensively. Cormorants are mainly pelagic surface divers, diving at shallow depths (median, 4 m) but reaching up to 32 m depth, and are thus able to track all the depths at which anchovies occurred during the study period. Peruvian boobies are plunge divers able to reach occasionally 10 m (median, 2 m), and are thus able to reach only shallow anchovy schools. No sexspecific differences in horizontal or vertical movements occurred between males and females in the 2 species. We suggest that the absence of significant differences between horizontal movements of boobies and cormorants, the relative short duration of their trips and the high number of chicks fledged were probably explained by the high abundance and accessibility of anchovies. Differences may be exacerbated during years of low anchovy abundance or accessibility, especially El Niño years...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying the {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} sandeels in grey seal foraging areas will provide an improved understanding of habitat use of grey seals on the West Coast of Scotland. The lesser sandeel, Ammodytes marinus, is a key food for many seabirds and seals, and is also {{the target of the}} largest <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery</b> in the North Sea (Furness, 2002). Fisheries acoustic data were collected during 2 cruises in May 2004 and July 2004 around the Inner Hebrides, West Scotland. A fully calibrated EK 500 echosounder was used, operating at two frequencies (38 kHz and 120 kHz). The collected data was processed using SonarData Echoview software. Acoustic identification of sandeels was established by using a dB difference algorithm (?MVBS = MVBS 38 - MVBS 120; where ?MVBS < - 1 indicated sandeels). The resulting Nautical Area Backscattering Coefficient (NASC) was integrated for each 0. 5 nmi interval and converted to a relative estimate of mean sandeel density in seal foraging areas. Information on the spatial distribution and movements of 34 grey seals around the West Coast of Scotland in 2003 and 2004 have been collected by SMRU using Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SDRL) and will be used to compare sandeel densities and distribution in areas of high seal usage. The results indicated that the distribution of sandeels was extremely patchy along transects and the cruise track. A comparison of the relative abundance of sandeels in foraging areas showed that densities vary extremely between these areas. Highest densities of sandeels were recorded East of Tiree on the 14 th of May and in Stanton Banks on the 17 th of July. Future research will involve establishing a correlation between seal usage of foraging areas and sandeel abundance and distribution. In addition, the analysis of other fish species and zooplankton in these areas will contribute to a further understanding of foraging strategies of grey seals. The capabilities of underwater acoustic research and their implementation in ecosystem-based studies are constantly evolving. Interdisciplinary research should be encouraged in order to provide useful insights in ecosystem dynamics but also to benefit fisheries and conservation management strategies...|$|R
40|$|The Humboldt Current System is {{the most}} {{productive}} upwelling system globally in terms of fish and sustains huge populations of guano-producing birds {{as well as the}} world's largest <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery</b> targeting the Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens. Peruvian boobies Sula variegata and Guanay cormorants Phalacrocorax bougainvillii are the most abundant seabird species in the system and feed mainly on anchovies. By using high precision GPS and time-depth recorders, we compared the horizontal and vertical movements of the 2 species to examine whether segregation occurs between their foraging areas and whether there is any evidence for prey depletion close to large colonies. A simultaneous acoustic cruise in the foraging area of the 2 bird species estimated the vertical and horizontal distributions of anchovy schools. During the study period in austral spring 2008, the 2 bird species foraged in the same area, at relatively short distance from the colony (average, 19 to 20 km). Both species foraged at similar times of the day, although Peruvian boobies tended to leave earlier in the morning and return later in the evening than did the cormorants. Foraging trips were similar in duration, distance covered and range. Peruvian anchovies were abundant and schools occurred at shallow depths (median, 7 m; range, 3 to 34 m), mainly to the north and west of the colony where foraging bouts of the 2 species overlapped extensively.

40|$|We examine in detail, for {{the first}} time, the {{biological}} oceanographic mechanisms affecting nutrition, growth and survival of larvae of the Western Rock Lobster while they undergo their planktonic phyllosoma phase in the Eastern Indian Ocean. The Western Rock Lobster is the most valuable <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery</b> in Australia, representing about 20 % of {{the total value of}} Australia’s fisheries. Variability in settlement of puerulus stage and catch of adults {{has been shown to be}} highly correlated with the strength of the Leeuwin Current (in turn impacted by El Nino events) and westerly wind conditions. The below-average puerulus settlement for five years, including the two lowest on record, triggered a profound re-examination of mechanisms driving year class strength of larval settlement, since such fluctuations can pose a serious risk to a sustainable rock lobster industry. Here we present outcomes from the first research voyage (July 2010) of a 3 -year study of the biological oceanography of the Western Rock Lobster larvae. We present a new understanding of the feeding of late-stage phyllosoma in the wild, and describe its oceanographic context. We show evidence that the phyllosoma have a preference for key prey with specific nutritional attributes, and suggest that this is directly related to the need to accumulate substantial nutritional reserves before they can metamorphose into the puerulus stage, cross the continental shelf, and settle to form the next generation of fishable adult lobsters. We propose that the autumn phytoplankton bloom within the Leeuwin Current, as identified by satellite ocean colour, is a key food resource driving production of healthy phyllosoma, and thus a strong year class. We speculate that the “Abrolhos Front” is a seasonally important feature supporting shoreward fluxes of phyllosoma. Our study directly addresses the hypothesis that productivity of the oceanic planktonic ecosystem offshore is a critical variable driving phyllosoma health and therefore recruitment success. These water masses have been shown directly to impact the ecological function of Ningaloo Reef and other iconic coastal habitats downstream. In particular, we investigate the alignment of dissolved oxygen and nitrate profiles with ocean carbonate chemistry in three dimensions on and off the continental shelf. We speculate on the origins and impacts of these signatures including the implications for ocean acidification. These are the first measurements of their kind in this region...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{mechanisms}} behind {{variability in}} early life survival of marine fishes through modeling efforts can improve predictive capabilities for recruitment success under changing climate conditions. Walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) support the largest <b>single-species</b> commercial <b>fishery</b> in the United States and represent an ecologically {{important component of}} the Bering Sea ecosystem. Variability in walleye pollock growth and survival is structured in part by climate-driven bottom-up control of zooplankton composition. We used two modeling approaches, informed by observations, to understand the roles of prey quality, prey composition, and water temperature on juvenile walleye pollock growth: (1) a bioenergetics model that included local predator and prey energy densities, and (2) an individual-based model that included a mechanistic feeding component dependent on larval development and behavior, local prey densities and size, and physical oceanographic conditions. Prey composition in late-summer shifted from predominantly smaller copepod species in the warmer 2005 season to larger species in the cooler 2010 season, reflecting differences in zooplankton composition between years. In 2010, the main prey of juvenile walleye pollock were more abundant, had greater biomass, and higher mean energy density, resulting in better growth conditions. Moreover, spatial patterns in prey composition and water temperature lead to areas of enhanced growth, or growth ‘hot spots’, for juvenile walleye pollock and survival may b...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{fisheries}} management discourse {{is supported by}} two fundamental narratives that have global impacts. One is the fear of open access regimes, {{and the other is}} the condemnation of catching under-sized and immature fish. These narratives have existed {{for more than half a}} century and originate from the common property theory and the maximum yield per recruit theory. Our aim is to critically discuss and evaluate these narratives which have been developed within the context of scientific management of <b>single-species</b> industrial <b>fisheries.</b> We will show that the underlying assumptions can be seriously wrong and particularly absurd in fluctuating multi-species, multi-gear artisanal fisheries. Fishing effort in small scale fisheries is often largely regulated by natural production, like other top predators, and many targeted fish stocks and fish communities display a high degree of resilience. Furthermore, in spite of common belief, small scale unregulated, non-selective, adaptive fishing patterns could be healthier and far more ecosystem conserving than the current imposed single species management strategies. Many of these fisheries are serving as a ‘social security system’ – a common good and thereby function as a ‘last resort’ for economic mishap. Limiting open access will undermine the role of small scale fisheries to provide insurance, particularly for the poorest and least advantaged. The immense pressure to adapt to modern {{fisheries management}} thinking and economic theory is based on flawed assumptions and will not only have negative social effects, but also negative biological effects...|$|R
40|$|The main {{theme of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is a challenge to}} the traditional paradigm of optimal control for the management of renewable resources. That {{is not to say that}} optimization should not be the goal but rather, previous modeling and policy have presumed that managers have greater control and knowledge of marine systems than is the case. All models make simplifying (and false) assumptions but assuming control and knowledge in marine systems is not benign. In a dynamic control problem, one must actually control the variable of interest and know or learn the system's parameters. I discuss reasons why managers may not control harvests and cannot know system parameters and consider possible remedies to the historically sub-optimal management of marine resources. Marine resources are observed imperfectly and are often held as common property. In this dissertation I explore the feasibility of management plans when naturalcapital stock dynamics are unobservable and when political structures constrain the implementation of optimal management. Resource managers are faced with conflicting user groups and limited information. In three chapters I study constrained management In my first chapter, "Jobs or Resources?" I consider the political economy implications of technological under various management scenarios. I show that typical management targets will require the retirement of inputs as technology progresses. This is particularly problematic for fisheries in which labor is involved in management decisions. This can lead to false inference about the health of the stock. For the second chapter, "Natural Resource Collapse: Technological Change and Biased Estimation", I show that unexpected fisheries collapse may be linked to unobserved technological change. Unexpected collapse of natural resources is of great concern to policy makers. The literature and popular press have attributed collapse to the lack of well-defined property rights and policies that pay inadequate attention to random environmental variability. Both the literature and policy makers have overlooked how unobserved technological change can obscure the depletion of natural- capital stocks. The paper shows that even if property rights are well-defined and random fluctuations are small, modest increases in technical efficiency conceal the depletion of stocks. Using the most general model of surplus production in a <b>single-species</b> <b>fishery</b> I show analytically that proportional growth of the fish stock is overestimated when even one period of technological change is ignored. Through simulations, I find that standard statistical tests overestimate the productivity of the fish stock. I show that collapse is inevitable if technology increases without bound and that the path to collapse is not observed until stocks are low and declining rapidly. In the third chapter, "Marine protected areas as a risk management tool" I consider a potential fix to the inference problems highlighted in the second chapter and in other work such as Carson and Murray (2005). When parameter uncertainty is significant, I show that even in an otherwise deterministic world, expected payoffs can be increased by using simple spatial closures. Though optimal fleet size and reserve size combinations exist, a spatial closure can increase expected payoff even if the fleet-size is chosen to be too large or too small. The benefit of closures is not limited to hedge against stock collapse but is of value even when stock size is large and steady-state catches are relatively hig...|$|R
40|$|Ocean acidification, the {{progressive}} change in ocean chemistry caused by uptake of atmospheric CO 2, {{is likely to}} affect some marine resources negatively, including shellfish. The Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports {{one of the most}} economically important <b>single-species</b> commercial <b>fisheries</b> in the United States. Careful management appears to be the most powerful short-term factor affecting scallop populations, but in the coming decades scallops will be increasingly influenced by global environmental changes such as ocean warming and ocean acidification. In this paper, we describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) that numerically simulates oceanographic, population dynamic, and socioeconomic relationships for the U. S. commercial sea scallop fishery. Our primary goal is to enrich resource management deliberations by offering both short- and long-term insight into the system and generating detailed policy-relevant information about the relative effects of ocean acidification, temperature rise, fishing pressure, and socioeconomic factors on the fishery using a simplified model system. Starting with relationships and data used now for sea scallop fishery management, the model adds socioeconomic decision making based on static economic theory and includes ocean biogeochemical change resulting from CO 2 emissions. The model skillfully reproduces scallop population dynamics, market dynamics, and seawater carbonate chemistry since 2000. It indicates sea scallop harvests could decline substantially by 2050 under RCP 8. 5 CO 2 emissions and current harvest rules, assuming that ocean acidification affects P. magellanicus by decreasing recruitment and slowing growth, and that ocean warming increases growth. Future work will explore different economic and management scenarios and test how potential impacts of ocean acidification on other scallop biological parameters may influence the social-ecological system. Future empirical work on the effect of ocean acidification on sea scallops is also needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-level}} {{irrigation water}} supply dams of the Ord River in tropical Western Australia impede {{the movement of}} Barramundi Lates caicarifer and other tropical fish species. A recreational Barramundi fishery enhancement of Lake Kununurra using a fishway has been widely promoted as advancing fishery conservation and the reformation of land and water management practices within the greater Ord River region. Of the fishways considered here, none {{have been found to}} admit Barramundi in the numbers and size classes necessary to establish or maintain the recreational fishery. Reasons for this include an inadequate understanding of fish behaviour and/or fishway deSign faults. The seemingly reluctant use of fishways by Barramundi might also be confounded by some observations being made on rivers where Barramundi populations are either comparatively small or non-existent. The alternative to a fishway is hatchery stocking. This option, like a dedicated Barramundi fishway, represents a <b>single-species</b> approach to <b>fishery</b> enhancement and is the least legitimate attempt to restore the ecological integrity of the fish communities of either Lake Kununurra or the Ord River. We argue that progress toward the restoration of the lake should continue, though a fishery enhancement programme that incorporates the broader fish community and not just a single species, would better rebuild the presently degraded Ord River system. Of the available options, we recommend testing an experimental model that incorporates aspects of the vertical-slot and bypass fishway designs, with the objectives being to learn migratory fish behaviour, abundance, and patterns and cues for fish movement. This approach can incorporate Barramundi as the target species to better understand entrance design constraints, minimum slot widths for larger fish, and operation under low flows during peak irrigation water demands, but still accommodate the movement of tropical fishes during these periods...|$|R
40|$|Passive capture {{techniques}} {{involve the}} capture of fishes or other aquatic animals by entanglement, entrapment, or angling devices that are not actively moved by humans or machines while the organisms are being captured (Lagler 1978). The behavior and movements of the animals themselves result in their capture. The techniques used in passive sampling of fish populations {{are similar to those}} used for food gathering over the centuries. Nets and traps have been widely used among various cultures, and many of the currently applied techniques were used by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans (Alverson 1963). Based on their mode of capture, passive sampling devices can be divided into three groups: (1) entanglement, (2) entrapment, and (3) angling gears. Entanglement devices capture fish by holding them ensnared or tangled in webbing or mesh made of natural or artificial materials. Gill nets and trammel nets are examples of entanglement gears (Figure 6. 1). Entrapment devices capture organisms that enter an enclosed area through one or more funnel- or V-shaped openings that hinder escape after entrance. Hoop nets, trap nets, and pot devices are examples of entrapment gears (Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3). Angling devices capture fish with a baited hook and line. Trotlines and longlines are examples of passive angling gears (Figure 6. 4). Gear selectivity and gear efficiency are important considerations with respect to passive sampling devices. Often these terms are used interchangeably, but they have different, specific definitions. Gear selectivity is the bias of a sample obtained with a given gear (Box 6. 1). Selectivity for species, sizes, and sexes of fishes occurs in samples taken with specific types of gear. Species selectivity refers to overrepresentation of particular species in samples as compared with the assemblage of species present. Similarly, size or sex selectivity refers to overrepresentation of specific sizes (lengths) or one sex within samples from a fish population. Fisheries scientists may use gear selectivity to their benefit when targeting specific species or sizes of fishes, thereby enhancing their sampling efficiency. The efficiency of a gear refers to the amount of effort expended to capture target organisms (Box 6. 2). It is generally desirable to maximize the efficiency of a sampling gear to save time and money in <b>single-species</b> assessments of <b>fisheries.</b> Even with efficient sampling gear, the sampling effort needed to estimate the relative abundance and other descriptive statistics for a given species may be unrealistic (Gerow 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present {{document}} {{reviews the}} population status, fishery and trade of sea cucumbers worldwide through the collation {{and analysis of}} the available information from five regions, covering known sea cucumber fishing grounds: temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere; Latin America and the Caribbean; Africa and Indian Ocean; Asia; and Western Central Pacific. In each region a case study of a "hotspot" country or fishery was conducted to highlight critical problems and opportunities for the sustainable management of sea cucumber fisheries. The hotspots are Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Seychelles, Galapagos Islands and the fishery for Cucumaria frondosa of Newfoundland in Canada. Across the five regions, the scale of catches and the number of exploited species varies widely, the Asian and Pacific regions being those with the highest catches and species diversity. Most fisheries are multispecific, or have evolved from <b>single-species</b> to multispecies <b>fisheries</b> as the more valuable species became overexploited. There are many typologies of sea cucumber fisheries, ranging from artisanal, to semi-industrial and industrial. The bulk of the catches are exported to supply the Asian bêche-de-mer market, with China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) the main export destination for the totality of countries reviewed. With the exception of some stocks in the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere, sea cucumber stocks are under intense fishing throughout the world. In Latin America and the Caribbean it appears that high valued commercial species have been depleted. In the majority of the countries reviewed in the Africa and Indian Ocean region stocks are overfished. Likewise in the Asian Pacific region the most sought-after species are largely depleted. Despite the fact that sea cucumber fishing is not a traditional activity, a large number of coastal communities have developed a strong dependency on it as alternative source of income. Reconciling the need for conservation with the socio-economic importance that these fisheries have acquired will require effective management efforts, which are currently lacking in many places. The hotspot case studies show for instance that, despite the adoption of management plans in some countries, the lack of enforcement capacity poses considerable constraints on the effectiveness of adopted management measures, besides exacerbating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and trade. The papers also discuss some of the factors behind the unsustainable use of sea cucumbers and the role and potential benefits of alternative management measures, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The lack of capacity to gather the basic information needed for management plans, weak enforcement, the high demand from international markets and the pressure exerted from resource-dependent communities figure high as important factors responsible for the critical status of sea cucumber fisheries worldwide. Authors concur on the need for immediate actions to stop the trend of sequential depletion of species if we are to conserve stocks biodiversity and sustain the ecological, social and economic benefits of these resources...|$|R
