40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} changes in blood glucose concentration ([Glu]B), acid-base status and electrolyte concentrations during constant rate infusions (CRI) of two alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists in seven horses treated in a blinded, randomised, crossover design with xylazine or romifidine. An intravenous (IV) bolus of xylazine (1 mg/kg) or romifidine (80 μg/kg) was administered followed by an IV CRI of xylazine (0. 69 mg/kg/h) or romifidine (30 μg/kg/h) for 2 h. Blood samples were collected from the pulmonary artery before and after loading doses, during the CRI, and for 1 h after discontinuing drugs. Blood glucose, base excess (BE), pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pv¯CO 2), strong ion difference (<b>SIDest)</b> and bicarbonate concentration ([Formula: see text]) increased significantly during the CRI with both alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists. Chloride concentration ([Cl-]B) and anion-gap (AG) decreased significantly compared to baseline. The decrease in sodium concentration ([Na+]B) was only significant with xylazine. From 1 h after starting the CRI onwards, [Glu]B was significantly higher with romifidine compared to xylazine. Except [Glu]B, <b>SIDest,</b> and Pv¯CO 2, all variables returned to normal values 1 h after discontinuing xylazine. After stopping romifidine, all variables except pH remained altered for at least 1 h. It was concluded that loading doses of alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists followed by CRIs produce [Glu]B, acid-base and electrolyte changes. The clinical significance of the reported changes remains to be investigated and absolute values should be interpreted with caution, as fluid boli were used for cardiac output measurements, but may become important during prolonged infusion and in critically ill patients...|$|E

40|$|Coordination of mitosis and {{cytokinesis}} {{is crucial}} for ensuring proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the <b>sid</b> genes (cdc 7, cdc 11, cdc 14, spg 1, <b>sid</b> 1, <b>sid</b> 2 and <b>sid</b> 4) define a signaling pathway that regulates septation and cytokinesis. Here we describe the characterization of a novel protein kinase, <b>Sid</b> 1 p. <b>Sid</b> 1 p localizes asymmetrically to one spindle pole body (SPB) in anaphase. <b>Sid</b> 1 p localization is maintained during medial ring constriction and septum synthesis and disappears prior to cell separation. Additionally, we found that Cdc 14 p is in a complex with <b>Sid</b> 1 p. Epistasis analysis places <b>Sid</b> 1 p-Cdc 14 p downstream of Spg 1 p-Cdc 7 p but upstream of <b>Sid</b> 2 p. Finally, we show that cyclin proteolysis during mitosis is unaffected by inactivating the <b>sid</b> pathway; in fact, loss of Cdc 2 -cyclin activity promotes <b>Sid</b> 1 p-Cdc 14 p association with the SPB, possibly providing a mechanism that couples cytokinesis with mitotic exit...|$|R

50|$|The feud between <b>Sid</b> and Shawn Michaels dated back to 1995, when Michaels {{had hired}} <b>Sid</b> as a bodyguard. <b>Sid</b> {{interfered}} during the Michaels vs. Diesel main event at WrestleMania XI by distracting the referee, {{but the plan}} backfired when the referee was unable to count the pinfall after Michaels superkicked Diesel. On the following night's episode of Monday Night Raw, Michaels told <b>Sid</b> {{that he would not}} be needed in the case of a Michaels vs. Diesel rematch. <b>Sid</b> responded by turning on Michaels and powerbombing him three times. This attack led to a feud between <b>Sid</b> and Diesel, but <b>Sid</b> and Michaels were reunited as partners in an elimination match at Survivor Series 1995. During the match, Michaels accidentally kicked <b>Sid</b> in the face, which led to <b>Sid</b> being eliminated. <b>Sid</b> retaliated by powerbombing Michaels again.

The viability of strains carrying an inducible <b>SID</b> 2 allele and a deletion of either rad 9 or rad 52 was assessed.

The results indicate that <b>Sid</b> 2 p enters the nucleus, but at a lower level than a control protein carrying the SV 40 large T-antigen "classical" NLS. 'This may reflect that <b>Sid</b> 2 p's NLS is less efficient at promoting import or that <b>Sid</b> 2 p's localization is regulated, perhaps with respect to the cell cycle.
