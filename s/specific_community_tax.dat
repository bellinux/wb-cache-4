40|$|The {{financial}} perspective of 2000 - 2006 has fundamentally changed {{the relationship between}} the EU’s budget and its policies. Whereas prior to this perspective, the EU maintained a policy-driven budget; in its aftermath, Community policies became budget-driven. Since then, the latter has been the prevailing tendency. The major factor behind the budget-driven policies is the strong juste retour approach, where Member States, as their primary goal in budgetary debates, attempt to optimise their net position against the Union’s budget. The priority of the net position is rooted in the EU’s failing own resources system. Instead of genuine own resources, three-quarters of the budget is financed by GNI-based resources. The autonomy of the common budget and the reintroduction of policy-driven budget planning could only be ensured by (1) a genuine own resources system based on the resources generated by Community policies, or (2) a <b>specific</b> <b>Community</b> <b>tax,</b> or a combination of the two. This raises significant questions concerning further Member State sovereignty sharing and their overall readiness for fiscal and political integration...|$|E

Emphasis will then be placed on the structure and various legal aspects of Article 95, which, although a rather complex provision, often tends to be neglected in favour of the harmonized taxes as well as the recent developments in the field of direct taxation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a genre {{analysis}} which explores the <b>specific</b> discourse <b>community</b> of <b>tax</b> accountants. Tax computation letters from one international accounting firm in Hong Kong were analyzed and compared. To probe deeper into the <b>tax</b> accounting discourse <b>community,</b> a group of tax accountants from the same firm was observed and questioned. The texts analyzed and {{the data from the}} observation and interviews with the accountants highlight, among other things, the prevalence of intertextuality in their discourse. There also seems to be a trend towards faxing instead of posting tax computation letters, while e-mail is not considered appropriate for the conveyance of such letters. The implications of the findings are presented with possible suggestions for future research. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The American University...|$|R
