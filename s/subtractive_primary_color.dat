25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the {{subtractive}} color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary subtractive primary.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1940s, {{this process}} was popularized by Eastman Kodak for {{general-purpose}} graphic arts work, but not for motion picture work, which remained exclusive to Technicolor (and for which Eastman Kodak was manufacturing Technicolor's light-sensitive camera and printing films, including the [...] "blank receiver" [...] film, on an exclusive basis, but not Technicolor's dyes), and is sometimes referred to by such generic names as [...] "wash-off relief printing" [...] and [...] "dye imbibition" [...] printing. The process requires making three printing matrices (one for each <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>color)</b> which absorb dye {{in proportion to the}} density of a gelatin relief image. Successive placement of the dyed film matrices, one at a time, [...] "transfers" [...] each primary dye by physical contact from the matrix to a mordanted, gelatin-coated paper.|$|E

2500|$|For {{a set of}} <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> for humans, as in {{mixing of}} {{pigments}} for printing, cyan (a bright greenish-blue), magenta (a bright reddish purple), and yellow are often used (usually supplemented by black to make CMYK).|$|R

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by combining cyan, magenta, and yellow transparent dyes/inks on a white substrate.

50|$|In the {{traditional}} representation, a complementary color pair {{is made up}} of a <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> (yellow, blue or red) and a secondary color (green, purple or orange). For example, yellow is a <b>primary</b> <b>color,</b> and painters can make purple by mixing of red and blue; so when yellow and purple paint are mixed, all three <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> are present. Since paints work by absorbing light, having all three primaries together results in a black or gray color (see subtractive color). In more recent painting manuals, the more precise <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> are magenta, cyan and yellow.|$|R
50|$|As a {{color of}} low intensity, brown is a {{tertiary}} color: {{a mix of}} the three <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> is brown if the cyan content is low. Brown exists as a color perception only {{in the presence of}} a brighter color contrast. Yellow, orange, red, or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low, despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions.|$|R
40|$|Progress {{in science}} in the 19 th century have shown the {{scientific}} correct <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> {{are different from the}} traditional art <b>primary</b> <b>colors.</b> Today in substance color mixing we know scientific »wrong« art <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (RYB), and scientific correct <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (CMY). Artistic <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> don't give us exact color mixing substances in all other colors and are therefore from physically point of view "wrong" primaries. However, for artists they have strong traditional and symbolic value. In the thesis, therefore, I explore the issue of the relationship between artisctic and scientific <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> on the case of Johannes Ittna color wheel. The reason that artists and scientists have diferent view on issue of <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> is in their use. Depending on the choice of <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> is also different color wheel. The most famous artistic color wheel, which was created by Johannes Itten and is used for educational purposes, is original basing on the art <b>primary</b> <b>colors.</b> This is the reason whay his theory was much criticised by scientists and in educational purposes corrected by <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors.</b> In the analysis of textbooks for art education, I realized that corrected Itten's colored circle with a physical <b>primary</b> <b>color</b> occurs in them. Uncertainties about Itten's color wheel has been transferred in textbooks for art education. Correction of art <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (RYB) for <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> (CMY) from artistic expression point of view is unjustified. On the basis of theoretical knowledge so in the end I make a didactic guidelines for the integration of Itten's color wheel in art education. ...|$|R
50|$|Colors can {{be created}} in {{printing}} with color spaces based on the CMYK color model, using the <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> of pigment (cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K)). To create a three-dimensional representation of a given color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X axis, the amount of cyan to its Y axis, {{and the amount of}} yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that {{can be created}} by combining those three pigments.|$|R
50|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> in an RGB color wheel are red, green, and blue, {{because these}} are the three {{additive}} colors—the <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> of light. The secondary colors in an RGB color wheel are cyan, magenta, and yellow {{because these are}} the three <b>subtractive</b> colors—the <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> of pigment.|$|R
50|$|According to {{traditional}} color theory based on <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> and the RYB color model, which {{is derived from}} paint mixtures, yellow mixed with violet, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's complementary colors. These contrasts {{form the basis of}} Chevreul's law of color contrast: colors that appear together will be altered as if mixed with the complementary color of the other color. Thus, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange, because orange is the complementary color to blue.|$|R
5000|$|Process yellow (also {{known as}} [...] "pigment yellow", [...] "printer's yellow", and [...] "canary yellow") {{is one of}} the three colors {{typically}} used as <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors,</b> along with magenta and cyan. The CMYK system for color printing is based on using four inks, one of which is a yellow color. This is in itself a standard color, and a fairly narrow range of yellow inks or pigments are used. Process yellow is based on a colorant that reflects the preponderance of red and green light, and absorbs most blue light, as in the reflectance spectra shown in the figure on the lower right.|$|R
50|$|Goeritz {{originally}} {{wanted the}} towers {{to be painted}} in different shades of orange, but changed his mind later due to some pressure from constructors and investors. It was finally decided the towers would be painted in red, blue and yellow, the <b>primary</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>colors,</b> {{with the addition of}} white.|$|R
5000|$|The {{underlying}} physiological mechanisms {{involved in}} color opponency include the bipolar and ganglion {{cells in the}} retina, which process the signal originated by the retinal cones before it {{is sent to the}} brain. Models like RGB are based on what happens at the lower, retinal cone level, and thus are fitted for presenting self-illuminated, dynamic images as done by TV sets and computer displays; see additive color. The NCS model, for its part, describes the organization of the color sensations as perceived at the upper, brain level, and thus is much better fitted than RGB to deal with how humans experience and describe their color sensations (hence the [...] "natural" [...] part of its name). More problematic is the relation with the CMYK-model which is generally seen as a correct prediction of the behavior of mixing pigments, as a system of subtractive color. The NCS coincides with the CMYK as regards the green-yellow-red segment of the color circle, but differs from it in seeing the saturated <b>subtractive</b> <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> magenta and cyan as complex sensations of a [...] "redblue" [...] and a [...] "greenblue" [...] respectively and in seeing green, not as a secondary color mix of yellow and cyan, but as a unique hue. The NCS explains this by assuming that the behavior of paint is partly counterintuitive to human phenomenology. Observing that the mix of yellow and cyan paint results in a green color, would thus be at odds with the intuition of pure human perception which would be unable to account for such a [...] "yellowblue".|$|R
5000|$|Aqua (from aqua for water) is a greenish-blue color, a {{variation}} of the color cyan. The web color aqua is identical to the web color cyan, also sometimes called electric cyan, one of the three secondary colors of the RGB color model used on computer and television displays. In the HSV color wheel aqua is precisely halfway between blue and green. However, aqua {{is not the same as}} the <b>primary</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>color</b> process cyan used in printing.|$|R
50|$|In a {{projector}} with {{a single}} DLP chip, colors are produced either by placing a color wheel between a white lamp and the DLP chip or by using individual light sources to produce the <b>primary</b> <b>colors,</b> LEDs or lasers for example. The color wheel is divided into multiple sectors: the primary additive colors: red, green, and blue, {{and in many cases}} white (clear). Newer systems substitute the <b>primary</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>colors</b> cyan, magenta, and yellow for white. The use of the subtractive colors is part of the newer color performance system called BrilliantColor which processes the additive colors along with the subtractive colors to create a broader spectrum of possible color combinations on the screen.|$|R
50|$|The web {{colors are}} more vivid than the cyan {{used in the}} CMYK color system, and the web colors cannot be {{accurately}} reproduced on a printed page. To reproduce the web color cyan in inks, {{it is necessary to}} add some white ink to the printer's cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a <b>primary</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>color.</b> It is called aqua (a name in use since 1598) because it is a color commonly associated with water, such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach.|$|R
50|$|SuperCinecolor {{utilized}} black-and-white matrices made {{primarily by}} monopack color negatives made with Ansco/Agfa, DuPont, Kodachrome, or Eastmancolor film, for principal photography. After the negative was edited, it was copied through color filters into three black-and-white negatives. An oddity {{of the system}} was that rather than use cyan, magenta and yellow <b>primary</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>colors,</b> SuperCinecolor printed their films with red, blue and yellow matrices {{in order to create}} a system that was compatible with the previous printers. The result of the combination of color spectra was an oddly striking look to the final print.|$|R
40|$|Preparation and photo-patterning {{characteristics}} of organic-inorganic hybrid thin film containing latent pigment by using photo-acid-generator (PAG) and microwave irradiation have been inves-tigated. The acrylic thin film modified with methoxysilane containing PAG was formed on a glass substrate and irradiated with ultraviolet rays to promote sol-gel reaction by catalytic action of ac-id which was generated from PAG. And then {{the film was}} hardened with microwave irradiation, yielding organic-inorganic hybrid polymer film having hardness, highly transparency and strong adhesion with a glass substrate. Since this reaction only occurred in the optically (UV) irradiated regions, by exploiting {{the difference between the}} adhesivenesses of these regions photo-irradi-ated through photomask with a glass substrate, it was possible to form a patterned film with pitch of 100 to 50 μm by a simple lift-off method. A pigment-containing film using latent pigments (with <b>subtractive</b> three <b>primary</b> <b>colors</b> of coloring materials) and a patterned film were prepared, and it was possible to make these films multi-colored by varying the mixing ratio of the pigments. This multi-colored film-preparation method is effective for simply and efficiently forming a color-filte...|$|R
2500|$|Red, yellow, {{and blue}} (RYB) are a {{well-known}} traditional set of <b>subtractive</b> <b>primaries</b> {{in the art}} field.
