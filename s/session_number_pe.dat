40|$|We {{study how}} varying the P éclet <b>number</b> (<b>Pe)</b> affects the steady state {{sedimentation}} of colloidal particles that interact through short-ranged attractions. By employing a hybrid {{molecular dynamics simulation}} method we demonstrate that the average sedimentation velocity changes from a non- monotonic dependence on packing fraction ϕ at low <b>Pe</b> <b>numbers,</b> to a monotonic decrease with ϕ at higher <b>Pe</b> <b>numbers.</b> At low <b>Pe</b> <b>number</b> the pair correlation functions are close to their equilibrium values, but as the <b>Pe</b> <b>number</b> increases, important deviations from equilibrium forms are observed. Although the attractive forces we employ are {{not strong enough to}} form permanent clusters, they do induce transient clusters whose behaviour is also affected by <b>Pe</b> <b>number.</b> In particular, clusters are more likely to fragment and less likely to aggregate at larger <b>Pe</b> <b>numbers,</b> and the probability of finding larger clusters decreases with increasing <b>Pe</b> <b>number.</b> Interestingly, the life-time of the clusters is more or less independent of <b>Pe</b> <b>number</b> in the range we study. Instead, the change in cluster distribution occurs because larger clusters are less likely to form with increasing <b>Pe</b> <b>number.</b> These results illustrate some of the subtleties that occur in the crossover from equilibrium like to purely non-equilibrium behaviour as the balance between convective and thermal forces changes.

40|$|We apply {{a hybrid}} {{molecular}} dynamics and mesoscopic simulation technique {{to study the}} steady-state sedimentation of hard sphere particles for Peclet <b>number</b> (<b>Pe)</b> ranging from 0. 08 to 12. Hydrodynamic backflow causes a reduction of the average sedimentation velocity relative to the Stokes velocity. We find that this effect is independent of <b>Pe</b> <b>number.</b> Velocity fluctuations show the expected effects of thermal fluctuations at short correlation times. At longer times, nonequilibrium hydrodynamic fluctuations are visible, and their character appears to be independent of the thermal fluctuations. The hydrodynamic fluctuations dominate the diffusive behavior even for modest <b>Pe</b> <b>number,</b> while conversely the short-time fluctuations are dominated by thermal effects for surprisingly large <b>Pe</b> <b>numbers.</b> Inspired by recent experiments, we also study finite sedimentation in a horizontal planar slit.

Analytical solution for velocity in the presence of a transverse magnetic field is obtained and it is computed for different values of electromagnetic parameterWem.

Concentration distribution is also determined analytically in the presence of advection of concentration of chiral fluid. It is shown that the molecules of chiral fluid dispersed relative to the plane moving with the mean speed of flow with an effective dispersion coefficient, * D, called Taylor dispersion coefficient.
