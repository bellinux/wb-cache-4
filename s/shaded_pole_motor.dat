50|$|A {{capacitor}} {{start motor}} is a split-phase induction motor with a starting capacitor inserted {{in series with}} the startup winding, creating an LC circuit which produces a greater phase shift (and so, a much greater starting torque) than both split-phase and <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Even by the {{standards}} of <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> <b>motors,</b> the power output of these motors is usually very low. Because there is often no explicit starting mechanism, the rotor of a motor operating from a constant frequency mains supply must be very light so that it is capable of reaching running speed within one cycle of the mains frequency. Alternatively, the rotor may be provided with a squirrel cage, so that the motor starts like an induction motor, once the rotor is pulled into synchronism with its magnet, the squirrel cage has no current induced in it and so plays no further part in the operation.|$|R
50|$|Like a <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> {{induction}} <b>motor,</b> {{they use}} field coils with additional copper shading coils (see the illustration) {{to produce a}} weakly rotating magnetic field. But unlike a <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> induction <b>motor</b> (which uses a squirrel cage rotor), the synchronous version of this motor uses a magnetized rotor. This rotor rotates synchronously with the rotating magnetic field: if the rotor begins to lag behind the rotating field, driving torque increases and the rotor speeds up slightly until the rotor's position within the rotating field is a point where torque = drag; similarly, if {{the rotation of the}} field slows down, the rotor will advance relative to the field, torque will decline, or even become negative, slowing the speed of the rotor until it again reaches a position relative to the field where torque = drag.|$|R

5000|$|A {{shaded-pole}} motor {{is the original}} type of AC single-phase induction motor. A {{shaded-pole motor}} is a small squirrel-cage motor in which the auxiliary winding is composed of a copper ring or bar surrounding a portion of each pole. This auxiliary single-turn winding is called a shading coil. Currents induced in this coil by the magnetic field create a second electrical phase by delaying the phase of magnetic flux change for that <b>pole</b> (a <b>shaded</b> <b>pole)</b> enough to provide a 2-phase rotating magnetic field. The direction of rotation is from the unshaded side to the shaded (ring) side of the pole. [...] Since the phase angle between the shaded and unshaded sections is small, <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> <b>motors</b> produce only a small starting torque relative to torque at full speed. Shaded-pole motors of the asymmetrical type shown are only reversible via disassembly and flipping over the stator, though some similar-looking motors have small, switch-shortable auxiliary windings of thin wire instead of thick copper bars and can reverse electrically. Another method of electrical reversing involves four coils (two pairs of identical coils).|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{electric}} {{ceiling fans}} became {{very popular in}} other countries, particularly those with hot climates, such as India and the Middle East, where a lack of infrastructure and/or financial resources made energy-hungry and complex freon-based air conditioning equipment impractical. In 1973, Texas entrepreneur H. W. (Hub) Markwardt began importing highly efficient ceiling fans to the United States that were manufactured in India by Crompton Greaves, Ltd. Crompton Greaves had been manufacturing ceiling fans since 1937 through a joint venture formed by Greaves Cotton of India and Crompton Parkinson of England, and had perfected the world's most energy efficient ceiling fans thanks to its patented 20 <b>pole</b> induction <b>motor</b> with a highly efficient heat-dissipating cast aluminum rotor. These Indian manufactured ceiling fans caught on slowly at first, but Markwardt's Encon Industries branded ceiling fans (which stood for ENergy CONservation) eventually found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, since they consumed far less energy (under 70 watts of electricity) than the antiquated <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> <b>motors</b> used in most other American made fans. The fans became very effective energy saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning with a cooling wind-chill effect. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the heat transfer coefficient, but do not lower temperatures directly.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{methods are}} widely used and well {{understood}} for determining the torque or force in machines which do not contain permanent magnets. Energy methods are employed to calculate torques or forces of magnetic origin after determination of the energy stored in the electromechanical coupling field. In this thesis, the energy stored in a permanent magnet system is defined, and the energy-coenergy relationship is determined. It is shown how residual magnetism {{can be incorporated into}} classical electromechanical coupling theory. It is therefore shown how equations for torques or forces can be derived for permanent magnet systems using energy methods. An analytical method of calculating permanent magnet reluctance torque is developed. The method uses an elementary expression for the magnetic field to obtain the stored energy. This enables an analytical expression for the reluctance torque waveform to be obtained. The method is demonstrated to provide a powerful and fast design tool. The method can be generally applied to reluctance torque problems where the airgap is reasonably smooth. The single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is used in domestic appliances. It is a motor of very simple construction and high reliability, which is directly connected to an AC mains supply, and runs at synchronous speed. It is becoming increasingly used in preference to the <b>shaded</b> <b>pole</b> induction <b>motor.</b> However, its application is limited by the following characteristics. There is no control over the final direction of rotation, unless a mechanical blocking device is used. There are rotor positions at which only a very small starting torque is available. The characteristic twice electrical frequency torque pulsation yields a speed modulation of the same frequency, which can cause acoustic noise problems. A method of improving torque quality by improving the motor design is proposed to alleviate these limiting characteristics. This is achieved by designing a permanent magnet reluctance torque which cancels out the effect of the backward rotating component of the stator field. In this novel design, the permanent magnet reluctance torque effectively acts as a second balancing phase. An unconventional technique for starting a single phase synchronous permanent magnet motor is demonstrated. This technique uses an inductive reluctance torque, provided by placing a suitably shaped iron lamination on the rotor, to rotate the rotor to a position from which starting can occur...|$|R

Their robustness, gearfree-link to the load {{and the fact}} that speed is not a function of the number of poles (as in round machines) are only a few advantages.
