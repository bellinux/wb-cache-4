5000|$|Despite these low tariffs, {{some states}} have further reduced water tariffs. Following an {{election}} promise, beginning in 2008 Selangor state is <b>subsidising</b> its <b>consumers</b> with RM132 million/year (about US$40m) {{as a result of}} giving “free water” (first 20 m3) to about 1.5 million households. The President of Water Watch Penang, Prof. Dr. Chan Ngai Weng has called for the removal of water subsidies to encourage water conservation. In 2009, the Penang State Government <b>subsidised</b> domestic <b>consumers</b> with RM43 million (about US$12m). The Penang State Government is reluctant to review its low water tariffs, despite the fact that market survey studies conducted by the state water utility and the NGO Water Watch Penang indicate that the majority of water consumers {{are willing to pay for}} a [...] "reasonable" [...] tariff increase as long as the service is maintained at a high standard. Although water supply in Penang state is privatised, tariffs are the lowest in Malaysia due to the subsidies. Residential water bills are in the order of RM 2.5 per month. Even with the lowest tariffs in the nation, the Non-Revenue Water (NRW) in Penang was the lowest in the nation at 18.4% in 2010.|$|R

40|$|Advances {{in medical}} {{technology}} have brought large benefits but {{have also been}} a major driver of increased health spending in recent years. Overall, this report concludes that advances in medical technology arguably have provided value for money - particularly as people highly value improvements in the quality and length of life - but the cost effectiveness of individual technologies in practice varies widely and for some is simply unknown. Variations in cost effectiveness, and relatively low use by some demographic groups, suggest scope for expanding use of some technologies and possibly reducing use of others to increase net community benefits. Better coordinated, more systematic health technology assessment (HTA) with transparent objectives, underpinned by the principle of enhancing overall community wellbeing, {{would be a good}} step forward. HTA can help to target use of new technologies and promote overall cost effectiveness of healthcare spending. The next decade or so could see the emergence of revolutionary technological advances based largely on knowledge of the human genome. Many are expected to provide significant benefits to the Australian community, but at significant cost. Such technological advances, interacting with (and encouraged by) increasing demand for health services driven by income growth, accelerating population ageing, community expectations that new technologies will be accessible to all, the commitment of doctors to offer the best-available treatments, and <b>subsidised</b> <b>consumer</b> prices, will make for a potent mix, placing increasing pressures on the private and public health systems. These pressures underscore the need for better information about {{the costs and benefits of}} technology. But technology is only one input in healthcare. Problems related to technology use often reflect broader structural, incentive and resourcing issues in the health system. There is a pressing need to explore what the community considers is an appropriate level of subsidised access to healthcare and the technology it embodies, and the institutional and incentive structures that will deliver it efficiently and equitably.

40|$|Foreign {{firms to}} break into a new market {{commonly}} undercut domestic prices and, hence, <b>subsidise</b> the <b>consumer's</b> costs of switching {{in order to get}} a positive market share. However, this may constitute the act of dumping as drawn in Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Consequently, domestic firms trying to protect themselves against potential competitors often demand an anti-dumping (AD) investigation. In a two-period model of market entry with horizontally differentiated products and exogenous switching costs, it is demonstrated that the mere existence of switching costs and AD-rules may result in an anti-competition effect: the administratively set minimum-price rule protects the domestic firm and yields larger prices. Therefore, there are some consumers who will not buy either product in both periods although they would have done so in absence of AD. Consequently, competition policy should reassess the AD-regulation. Industrial Policy; Anti-Dumping; Hotelling; Switching Costs; Market Entry...|$|R
40|$|Opening {{chapter of}} the book, Markets, rights and power in Australian social policy, edited by Gabrielle Meagher and Susan Goodwin, and {{published}} by Sydney University Press. Australia {{has never had a}} large public social service system like those of the Nordic countries, or even of the United Kingdom. Instead, most social services have been delivered by a range of organisations that has included, but not been dominated by, the public sector. However, the mixed economy of Australian welfare services has not been static. In recent decades, both the organisational mix and the modes of coordination have changed significantly. Successive governments have expanded publicly funded social provision without expanding the public sector, by directly subsidising private provision, by contracting private agencies to deliver services, and by <b>subsidising</b> <b>consumer</b> purchases from approved private providers using tax expenditures and voucher-like instruments. Policies have been rolled out at different rates and with different instruments across the range of areas of Australian social policy. Yet the direction of change overall is clear – market organisations and market logics are playing an increasing role. This chapter, by the editors Gabrielle Meagher and Susan Goodwin, marks out the analytical territory of the book, and the surveys the themes canvassed in Chapters 1 - 11.   Chapters in Markets, rights and power in Australian social policy: Introduction: Capturing marketisation in Australian social policy 1) The politics of market encroachment: policymaker rationales and voter responses 2) The marketisation of human services and the expansion of the not-for-profit sector 3) The devil 2 ̆ 7 s in the detail: the hidden costs of private retirement incomes policy 4) Social benefit bonds: financial markets inside the state 5) 2 ̆ 7 Which bank? 2 ̆ 7 Competition and community service obligations in the retail banking sector 6) Community aged care providers in a competitive environment: past, present and future 7) Home security: marketisation and the changing face of housing assistance in Australia 8) Money and markets in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s healthcare system 9) Marketisation of immigrant skills assessment in Australia 10) Markets in education: 2 ̆ 7 School choice 2 ̆ 7 and family capital 11) Conditional income transfers and choice in social services: just more conditions and more markets...|$|R
40|$|Several {{measures}} in the environment and energy realms are currently being implemented in the EU and its Member States. Three of these instruments, with {{an impact on the}} electricity market, are demand side management activities, promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources and measures aimed at the mitigation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyse the impact of these energy efficiency and environmental goals and instruments on electricity demand and costs to electricity consumers when electricity markets are either national or international and when those policies are implemented by a national or an international institution. The paper shows that the effectiveness and impact of those measures largely depends on the demand response in the electricity market. An additional conclusion is that, when either the electricity markets or the support policies are national, distortions may occur, i. e. the reductions in electricity demand in one country may be <b>subsidised</b> by <b>consumers</b> or taxpayers in another country.

A model is developed which includes the government 2 ̆ 7 s conflict between its poverty reducing attempts through public distribution of food, subsidized issue and support food prices and long term developmental goals.

The long run elasticity estimates clearly show the real <b>consumer</b> <b>subsidised</b> issue price and the real producer support price dominate the quantity effects of the per capita public distribution on rural head count poverty.

40|$|The {{member states}} of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), namely; the Kingdom of Bahrain, the State of Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been moving towards more {{economic}} integration while taking practical steps {{in the direction of}} market opening and liberalisation. Over the past ten years, the GCC has evolved into a more integrated economic zone with agreed common policies that are coordinated through its Secretariat. With respect to service utilities, the GCC Interconnection Grid – nearing completion in 2011 – is considered a milestone in the direction of integrating GCC electricity markets. The objective of this research is to suggest a GCC-wide policy to support reform of GCC electricity markets. The suggested policy would include new market structure(s) as well as institutional changes supported - when required - by sector specific laws and regulations. Further to the study’s academic contributions, the research is primarily intended to advance the further development of the economies of GCC member states. The study presents a model that we believe could contribute to expediting the process of developing the GCC zone as a common market by advising policy makers on the applicable elements of GCC electricity market structure, governance and performance. This study provides a comprehensive review of the theoretical aspects of electricity sector restructuring and examines different options for reform and restructuring based on worldwide experiences. The study adopts a case study research method to analyse the GCC situation in order to arrive at the recommended policy or ‘model’. The research specifically emphasises reforms that have already taken place in the Sultanate of Oman – for which an empirical social cost benefit analysis is carried out - and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (UAE). Oman and Abu Dhabi are believed to be at more advanced stages of electricity market reform compared to other countries within the region. The study concludes that while some GCC member states have already taken the initial steps to restructure their respective electricity markets, other members are expected to follow. The study recommends a set of common steps or ‘rules’ that are presented {{in the form of a}} ‘model’ for restructuring GCC electricity markets. The proposed model for reform takes into consideration the nature of member states’ economies as well as the restrictions imposed by market size limitations and some other considerations that are a feature of prevailing policies in the region - such as commitments to <b>subsidise</b> <b>consumer</b> electricity tariffs. Since not all GCC member states are on an equal footing in terms of economy-size and preparation for structural reform, the suggested model allows for a transition mechanism. The study recommends that the electricity markets are unbundled before embarking on any further privatisation programmes. Further measures of wholesale competition may be then introduced allowing for a mix of both private and state-ownership through the use of a single-buyer model. Subsequently, activities that have natural monopoly characteristics such as transmission and distribution are to be separated and subject to incentive based regulation. The study recommends that the role of the GCC Interconnection Authority be restricted to transmission and system operations only and that each member state should have its own independent regulator. The study suggests that the GCC Secretariat play a co-ordination role between the different regulators while a separate power-exchange instrument be introduced to facilitate cross-border electricity trading between GCC member states.

40|$|Reform {{of the oil}} {{sector is}} long overdue. The {{problems}} in the sector emanate from the structure of central taxes and the system of subsidisation through prices. Solutions to the problems necessarily have to address both tax and subsidy simultaneously. The social losses include, misuse / wasteful use of scarce petroleum resources, diversion, adulteration, other avoidable negative externalities, improper substitution between products, tax arbitrage, distortion of consumer preferences and input choices of industries, and international cross hauling of petroleum. Nearly all these costs, and problems arise not because of subsidisation per se but due {{to the use of}} varying retail prices that are used to subsidise. Prices for the same product vary for different consumers besides. They also vary across products. These tax /subsidy variations are the root cause of nearly all problems in the sector. Autonomous price variations (i. e. those resulting from the actions of firms (under a regime of non-distortionary subsidies) would be small and not subject to ‘arbitrage’ i. e. to the realisation of rents through diversion and adulteration. Tax reform – viz casting all taxes in the form of value added taxes has not taken place in the sector despite the passage of nearly 15 years since such reform was put in place in nearly all other sectors of manufacturing. Complete deregulation of the sector allowing oil producers, oil refiners, marketing companies, and integrated operators to price their products as they deem fit. Recast central indirect taxes (excise whether specific or ad valorem) into a value added tax, as for any other product., i. e., allowing input credit for all registered intermediate users of petroleum products is overdue. Central government revenues can be protected by working out a revenue neutral value added tax rate. This we have estimated approximately to be 110 - 120 % of value added uniformly to all segments in the industry. Such a tax regime would also be neutral to the degree of vertical integration and remove the biases in the use of products. The Public Distribution System (PDS) is not necessary and ought to be dismantled. Kerosene would then be sold in the open market for all consumers. Kerosene could also be sold by retail outlets, kirana shops, other retail outlets, and by current PDS retailers on par with kirana shops/ ROs. Ditto for LPG. Subsidies are administered through endowments defined upfront, which allows the <b>subsidised</b> <b>consumer</b> to access his/her endowments, trade the same, convert the same into cash all without the causing any distortion. Only pipelines are subject to regulation by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulator. The second best proposals involve the changes/recommendations as before but additionally creates a “Crude Price Stabilisation Fund” (CSF) that allows crude prices (both sharp rises and sudden falls) to be moderated, so that pass thru is influenced by the managers of the CSF. It is important that the CSF is set up as in independent body and insulated from the government and is governed by strict and automatic rules that make rapid price adjustment (to the market prices) necessary when the fund position is low, so that the probability of the fund going bankrupt is kept at nearly zero. A fund between $ 25 to 40 billion is envisaged. A fund of $ 40 billion (Rs. 200, 000 crore) envisaged as a credit line would work in most situations. The fund would operate with strict limits on the quantum of the credit line used to pay out stabilization subsidies during the boom phase of the price cycle as also on the accumulated reserves built up from stabilization taxes during the bust phase of the price cycle. To ensure that such crude stabilisation measures do not affect the competitiveness of the industry exports of product (and crude) are taxed when crude is subsidised, and subsidised when crude is taxed. Appropriate conversion factors would apply. The conversion factor should be based on a refinery loss of between 10 and 7 % say 8. 5 %. ...|$|R

Using a general equilibrium framework, we analyse reasons for why Russia should or should not use such a price regulation. First, being a major exporter of energy commodities and having considerable monopolistic market power, the country is able to use its supply in order to influence the international energy prices. A rational way to channel this rent to the domestic non-energy sector and to domestic consumers is through a lower, i. e., competitive, domestic price on energy than that in the world market. Second, we introduce the classic infant-industry argument with positive intertemporal spillovers through learning-by-doing linked to current production. These spill-overs are likely to be relevant for manufacturing in a transition economy, which argument creates a further reason for a deviation in the pricing of energy to domestic industrial producers from the world market prices. However, an empirical consideration of these results and the estimation of the learning-by-doing curve suggest that the first effect can in principle be sizeable, while the second is only marginal and that, overall, Russia is currently subsidising its domestic energy prices clearly too much. Further, we conclude that the country should not <b>subsidise</b> its domestic <b>consumers</b> more than its domestic industry, as it does in reality. We also derive the optimal domestic energy tax and show that it is modest in comparison to its current rate.

40|$|This report {{recommends}} a {{change to the}} way consumers pay for the network that carries electricity from generators to homes, so that it better reflects the cost of running the network. Overview Australians are paying too much for power. In the five years to 2013, the average household power bill rose 70 per cent: from $ 970 to $ 1660 a year. The prices we pay are also unfair: some people are paying more than their fair share. These consumers are paying on average about $ 150 a year more than they should to <b>subsidise</b> other <b>consumers.</b> To get fairer and cheaper prices, network tariffs need urgent reform. Electricity networks transport power from generators to our homes and businesses. Like roads and freeways, they are built at a size to keep electricity moving at times of maximum demand – peak hour. Yet the price we pay to use electricity networks is the same whatever {{the time of day}} or season. The price therefore provides no incentive to use the network efficiently by avoiding peak times. It also provides little incentive for network owners to invest efficiently because it is unrelated to their main cost: building enough infrastructure to meet peak demand and avoid blackouts. Network owners spent $ 17. 6 billion on expanding power networks between 2009 and 2013. If prices had encouraged consumers to use less power in periods of peak demand, $ 7. 8 billion of this investment could have been avoided and the savings passed on as lower power bills. It is widely agreed that reform is needed. Yet {{there is a lack of}} specific proposals to improve the structure and operation of network tariffs. This report, the third in a series of Grattan reports on the excessive cost of electricity, fills that gap. It proposes two major reforms to the way network companies charge customers for the cost of carrying power to homes and small businesses. First, the 43 per cent of the consumer bill that goes to fund the network should no longer be based on total energy use. Instead, consumers should pay for the maximum load they put on the network. This tariff is called a capacity-based charge because it is based on the capacity of the infrastructure that must be built to carry this maximum load. A capacity charge far better reflects the cost of building and running the network. Yet this reform alone may not reduce peak demand in areas where the network is under pressure. Therefore the report also proposes the introduction of a new tariff in areas that - in the absence of prices that better reflect the cost of running the network - will require expensive infrastructure upgrades. Under this tariff, consumers will be charged more for use during times (usually in summer) when the network is under most strain. Because these periods drive total investment in infrastructure, reducing peak demand levels ultimately leads to lower prices. These reforms will give all consumers incentives to use electricity more efficiently. When they do, the pressure on network companies to invest in infrastructure will fall, and power prices with it. But governments must commit to these reforms and carefully explain their benefits. Advanced electricity meters will need to be installed on most Australian homes, at material shortterm cost. Politicians may decide it is too hard. But if they do, they will miss an opportunity to deliver cheaper and fairer power prices.  ...|$|R
