25|$|Varying {{adhesive}} weight: Use of {{the fuel}} and water {{for the purposes of}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> means that the <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of the locomotive decreases as they are used up,which also typically makes the ride much more uncomfortable.|$|R
50|$|Within two years, the CSAR {{would be}} {{transformed}} by P.A. Hyde, its first Chief Locomotive Superintendent, who introduced these 4-6-2 Pacifics with an <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of 39 tons and a tractive effort of 22170 lbf kN, the Class 10 4-6-2 Pacifics with an <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of 46 tons and a tractive effort of 24470 lbf kN and the Class 11 2-8-2 Mikados with an <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of 62 tons and a tractive effort of 30780 lbf kN. These designs by Hyde were cutting edge {{technology at the}} time.|$|R
50|$|Until 1922, {{three more}} batches of Class 14C would follow {{from the same}} manufacturer. All four batches {{differed}} in terms of maximum axle loading, <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> and engine weight.|$|R
50|$|At 104000 lbf kN, the Illinois Central Railroad’s 2800 class rebuilds {{probably}} {{had the highest}} calculated tractive effort of any two-cylinder steam locomotive, although the <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> was only 333000 lb.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> is {{the weight}} on the driving wheels of a locomotive, which determines the {{frictional}} grip between wheels and rail, and hence the drawbar pull which a locomotive can exert.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR C14 class used {{a similar}} layout, but {{reversed}} as a 2-2-0T. Their low <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> {{gave them a}} poor performance and half of them were rebuilt as the 0-4-0T S14.|$|R
5000|$|In 1916, after {{satisfactory}} {{performance of}} the first engines, Russia decided to order a further 475 locomotives, with minor changes. These were sub-classed as Ел. These locomotives were slightly heavier, with an <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of 80.3 tonnes ...|$|R
50|$|This design {{proved so}} {{effective}} on American railroads {{that many of}} the early 0-4-0s were rebuilt as 4-2-0s. The 4-2-0 excelled in its ability to stay on the track, especially those with the single driving axles behind the firebox, whose main virtue was stability. However, with only one driving axle behind the firebox, the locomotive's weight was spread over a small proportion of powered wheels, which substantially reduced its <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight.</b> On 4-2-0 locomotives which had the driving axle in front of the firebox, <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> was increased. While this plan placed more of the locomotive's weight on the driving axle, it reduced the weight on the leading truck which made it more prone to derailments.|$|R
50|$|The wheel {{arrangement}} {{provided a}} powerful layout with all engine <b>weight</b> as <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight,</b> which maximised the tractive effort and factor of adhesion. The layout was generally {{too large for}} smaller and lighter railways, where the more popular 0-6-0 wheel arrangement would often be found performing similar duties.|$|R
50|$|These 12 4-8-0s {{were created}} to tackle the 1:100 {{gradients}} of the Brive to Montauban division of the line from Paris to Toulouse, steeper than those to Bordeaux. The intention was to provide one-third more <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> than the 4500s. On level ground, they could manage 28 coaches at 53 mph.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{proved to}} be suitable for Romanian conditions, being of ample dimensions, moderate axle load, straightforward two-cylinder engines of 650 mm bore with a 720 mm stroke, and 1940 mm diameter coupled wheels. The total weight in working order was 123.5 tons, of which 72.1 tons was <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 4-6-4 {{arrangement}} was {{seen on the}} PRR only on electric locomotives. As a steam locomotive arrangement, it was poorly suited to the PRR's mountainous terrain, wasting much potential <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> on non-driven wheels. That it was so widely used by the rival New York Central would also likely have factored against PRR adoption.|$|R
50|$|Its 105 lt 13 lcwt kg <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> and the SAR's ultra-conservative {{practice}} of reporting a Mallet's tractive effort at only 50% of boiler pressure {{resulted in a}} much lower than actual starting tractive effort of 48370 lbf kN. The Class MH was almost certainly capable of exerting more than 60000 lbf kN tractive effort at starting.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after they}} entered service, the front tanks {{of some of}} the {{locomotives}} were modified. While the tank capacity apparently remained the same, the all-up weight of the modified locomotives and their <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> were 4 lt kg less and their individual axle loads were different, although their maximum axle loads remained at 15 lt kg.|$|R
25|$|Although the J class {{produced}} the same nominal tractive effort as the K or N class, {{they had a}} slightly higher <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> (and as such a better factor of adhesion) and were permitted to haul heavier loads on gradients. They {{could be found in}} goods service on branch lines across the state, but were also found on mainlines running roadside goods services.|$|R
50|$|The Class T 3s of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways were tank {{locomotives}} for {{duties on}} local and branch lines. They were broadly {{similar to the}} Prussian T 3. In terms of performance they were {{no different from the}} Oldenburg T 2; but the T 3 had a lower axle load and a somewhat higher <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of 4.4 tonnes.|$|R
25|$|Running gear {{includes}} the brake gear, wheel sets, axleboxes, springing and the motion that includes connecting rods and valve gear. The {{transmission of the}} power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, is of paramount importance. Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to the rail from 0rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the smooth rail surface. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> is {{the portion of the}} locomotive's weight bearing on the driving wheels. This is made more effective if a pair of driving wheels is able {{to make the most of}} its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight.</b> Locomotives with equalising beams connecting the ends of plate springs have often been deemed a complication, however locomotives fitted with the beams have usually been less prone to loss of traction due to wheel-slip.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} half of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries, the 4-6-0 was {{constructed}} in large numbers for passenger and mixed traffic service. A natural extension of the 4-4-0 American wheel arrangement, the four-wheel leading bogie gave good stability at speed and allowed a longer boiler to be supported, while the lack of trailing wheels gave a high <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the advent}} of modern motors and {{electronics}} more power {{can be brought to}} the rail with only a few axles. Modern electric locomotives can deliver up to 6400 kW on only four axles. For very heavy loads, especially in transportation of bulk goods, a single unit with this wheel arrangement tends to have too little <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> to accelerate the train sufficiently fast without wheelslip.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, a third {{batch of}} twenty Class 14C {{locomotives}} was ordered from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in Canada. It was delivered late {{in that same}} year and numbered in the range from 1991 to 2010. In 1922, one more batch of Class 14C locomotives would follow from the same manufacturer. All four batches differed in terms of maximum axle loading, <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> and engine weight.|$|R
50|$|The taper boilered 9400 Class 0-6-0 pannier tank, {{was built}} in large numbers by outside contractors. These were similar to the 5700 class under the {{footplate}} but had a much larger boiler giving them more power and <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> - and thus braking capacity. Only the first ten, built by the Swindon, appeared under the GWR. The last two designs were only seen in British Railways livery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1919, {{the second}} batch of twenty Class 14C {{locomotives}} was also ordered from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in Canada. It was delivered {{in that same}} year and numbered in the range from 1881 to 1900. Until 1922, two more batches of Class 14C locomotives would follow from the same manufacturer. All four batches differed in terms of maximum axle loading, <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> and engine weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had larger diameter cylinders {{than the}} Class B Hendrie D, but its <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> was 2 lt 15 lcwt kg less. The {{result was that}} its factor of adhesion {{was found to be}} on the low side for the service for which it was required. The locomotive was prone to slipping when the rails were wet, which often happened in Natal when the weather was misty.|$|R
25|$|With an {{axle load}} of , the AA {{had reached the}} design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> (due to axle load constraints and only two powered axles) combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles.|$|R
50|$|One of the Henschel-built locomotives, no. 2916, is {{documented}} as {{having had a}} lighter all-up weight and different axle loads {{than the rest of}} the engines from the same batch, although its <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> was more than a ton heavier. While sources are silent on the reason for the differences, it is known that this engine was oil-fired, although it is not clear whether it was delivered as an oil-burner or modified post-delivery.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were set}} up to run cab (or bunker) first, effectively as a 4-4-0 (or 6-4-0). The 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, with its three-point suspension, was noted for its good tracking ability, while the flangeless middle wheels allowed the locomotive to round tight curves. Placing the fuel and water over the truck rather than the driving wheels meant the locos had a constant <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight,</b> something other forms of tank locomotive did not.|$|R
50|$|With an {{axle load}} of 16.85 LT, the AA {{had reached the}} design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> (due to axle load constraints and only two powered axles) combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{constantly}} rising traffic on the Saxon narrow gauge railways {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, the power of the existing Saxon I K and III K soon proved insufficient. So the Sächsische Maschinenfabrik developed an engine with eight coupled wheels and which had a larger boiler and <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight.</b> Unlike its predecessors, it was given two driven bogies in order to be able to cope with winding routes despite its length.|$|R
50|$|The {{railways}} of South Wales seem to {{have had}} a particular liking for the 0-6-2T type. This was because the nature of the work they undertook demanded high <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight,</b> plenty of power with good braking ability, but no need for outright speed, nor large tanks or bunker as the distances from pit to port were short. These Welsh locomotives were taken over by the GWR at the grouping in 1923 and many were rebuilt with GWR taper boilers.|$|R
5000|$|The Class 1E builders, works numbers, {{years of}} {{construction}} and modifications to Classes ES and 1ES {{are listed in}} the table. The axle load and <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> as shown under [...] "Specifications" [...] in the infobox may be considered as average figures for the Class 1E since these weights varied between the seven series. In respect of the Series 1 to 6 locomotives, the actual load per axle of each bogie and the total locomotive mass are included in the table below.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had weights attached {{between the}} frames to increase adhesion. Over time, {{most of the}} Class 14C family of locomotives were [...] "rebalanced" [...] by having these weights increased or reduced to redistribute, increase or reduce the axle loading and <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> by altering the loads on the individual coupled wheels, leading bogies and trailing pony trucks. Coupled wheel axle loading adjustment was achieved by attaching steel boxes filled with an appropriate amount of lead over each axle between the frames.|$|R
5000|$|... 4501 {{was also}} used as the {{locomotive}} in the 1999 movie October Sky. Its role was a coal-hauling locomotive lettered for the more setting appropriate Norfolk and Western Railway and was shown {{several times in the}} film. A short clip of famed rail photographer O. Winston Link as the engineer is shown in the abandoned spur line scene. Link was particularly fond of Norfolk and Western locomotives. Another interesting fact was that the N&W never owned any 2-8-2s and preferred 4-8-0s because of their <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Engerth design {{articulated}} the tender {{with the main}} locomotive frame, allowing some {{of the weight of}} the fuel and water to be carried on the driving wheels to improve adhesion. Because the tender was articulated, rather than directly attached to the frame, the locomotive could traverse relatively sharp curves, while still enjoying the advantage of the additional <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> gain. The original design also included an indirect drive from the main driving wheels to the wheels under the tender. This arrangement proved too complex to maintain and was dropped from the design.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, chief {{draftsman}} G. A. Pearson designed {{what was to}} become the eventual WF class tank locomotive. The new locomotive proposed was a modestly-sized 2-6-4T tank locomotive with 45-inch driving wheels and an <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of just under 27 tons. The Walschaerts valve gear actuated inside-admission piston valves, which would later become a standard on all subsequent NZR designs. With a maximum 9.3 tons axle loading on the driving wheels, the new locomotive would have a wide radius of action. Tractive effort was calculated at 15,330lbs with a working boiler pressure of 200psi.|$|R

50|$|The boiler {{capacity}} was not {{increased to}} compensate for the additional cylinders and, in service, trouble was experienced under working conditions. Tests showed that the locomotives could not maintain steam and had insufficient <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> to prevent slipping on the steep gradient. The boiler had to generate the supply of steam while the engine passed through the tunnel {{at the head of the}} incline with the blast pipe not functioning, since the exhaust steam was diverted to the side tanks while the counter-pressure air brake system was in operation.|$|R
