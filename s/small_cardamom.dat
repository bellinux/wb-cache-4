40|$|One {{serious issue}} which creates far {{reaching}} repercussions {{in the commercial}} agriculture sector of India is the heightened instability in price both at the inter-year and intra-year level. An exploration of intra-year price instability, which is rarely addressed in the empirical studies, is attempted in this paper by selecting the case of four major commercial crops of India namely, <b>Small</b> <b>Cardamom,</b> Black Pepper, Natural Rubber and Tea. The study concludes {{that even in the}} scenario of integrated market setting price instability at the intra-year level is guided mainly by the seasonal character of supply. Hence, market offers high price to the farmers only when they have less to offer in the market and vice versa, which makes their income unstable in the short run, highlighting the need for stabilizing producers’ returns...|$|E
30|$|Elettaria cardamomum Maton {{known as}} Queen of spices belongs to {{monocotyledonous}} family Zingiberaceae. This perennial rhizomatous plant is mainly confined to mid-elevations (600 – 1300  m a.s.l.) in the Western Ghats of South India (Ravindran and Madhusoodanan 2003). It is a shade loving plant and 40 – 50  % shade promote its vegetative {{growth and development}} (Kumar et al. 2015). Dried fruit of <b>small</b> <b>cardamom</b> (commonly called as cardamom) is widely used for culinary and medicinal purposes. It is mainly used as a flavouring agent in food preparations and {{for the treatment of}} gastrointestinal disorders. D-Limonene, one of the constituent of cardamom oil is reported to have tumour suppressing effect against colon, mammary, liver, lung, skin and stomach cancers in rodents (Samir et al. 2015). It has been stated in a US patent (US 20060147561 A 1) that a poly herbal formulation including cardamom can be efficiently used for diabetic treatment (Nitasha Bhat et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton, or <b>small</b> <b>cardamom</b> {{referred}} as ‘queen of spices’, is a perennial herbaceous rhizomatous monocot {{of the family}} Zingiberaceae. Cardamom seeds and fruits are the economically significant parts and effectively used as a traditional medicine, food additive and flavoring agent. In the present study, using Ion Proton next generation sequencing technology we performed the small RNA sequencing, conserved and novel miRNA predictions of a wild and five cultivar genotypes of cardamom. Small RNA sequencing generated a total of 5, 451, 328 and 2, 756, 250 raw reads for wild and cultivar cardamom respectively. The raw data was submitted to SRA database of NCBI under the accession numbers and SRX 2273863 (wild) and SRX 2273862 (cultivars). The raw reads were quality filtered and predicted conserved and novel miRNAs for wild and cultivar cardamom. The predicted miRNAs, miRNA-targets and functional annotations might provide valuable insights into differences between wild progenitor and cultivated cardamom...|$|E

40|$|The Malabar {{variety of}} <b>small</b> <b>cardamom</b> Mc- 3 was {{evaluated}} with checks: Mudigere- 1 Mudgere- 2 for yield and its attributingcharacters at Zonal Agricultural Research Station, Mudigere, Karnataka and different locations during 2003 to 2007. Mc- 3 showed better performance in both ancillary and capsule characters (number of suckers per clump, number of productivesuckers, number of panicles per clump, panicle length, capsules per panicle,number of flowers per panicle, oval or oblong shapeand bold type, capsule length and breadth, more number of seeds, light green, turning pale yellow on ripening). The mean drycapsule yield data {{for three years}} revealed that clone Mc- 3 recorded maximum dry capsule yield (312. 75 kg/ha) compared to M- 1 (233. 59 kg/ha) and M- 2 (236. 36 kg/ha). As revealed by the yield data from the trials conducted at different locations, Mc- 3 recorded 25 % higher dry capsule yield compared to check M- 2. The genotype Mc- 3 exhibited tolerance to diseases and pests. Therefore, it {{is found to be}} suitable promising variety under high elevation and high rainfall areas...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{analyzed}} climate and crop yields data from Indian cardamom hills for the period 1978 - 2007 to investigate whether there were significant changes in weather elements, and if such changes have had {{significant impact on the}} production of spices and plantation crops. Spatial and temporal variations in air temperatures (maximum and minimum), rainfall and relative humidity are evident across stations. The mean air temperature increased significantly during the last 30 years; the greatest increase and the largest significant upward trend was observed in the daily temperature. The highest increase in minimum temperature was registered for June (0. 37 A degrees C/ 18 years) at the Myladumpara station. December and January showed greater warming across the stations. Rainfall during the main monsoon months (June-September) showed a downward trend. Relative humidity showed increasing and decreasing trends, respectively, at the cardamom and tea growing tracts. The warming trend coupled with frequent wet and dry spells during the summer is likely to have a favorable effect on insect pests and disease causing organisms thereby pesticide consumption can go up both during excess rainfall and drought years. The incidence of many minor pest insects and disease pathogens has increased in the recent years of our study along with warming. Significant and slight increases in the yield of <b>small</b> <b>cardamom</b> (Elettaria cardamomum M.) and coffee (Coffea arabica), respectively, were noticed in the recent years.; however the improvement of yield in tea (Thea sinensis) and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) has not been seen in our analysis...|$|E
40|$|Patch {{tests were}} {{undertaken}} with 16 condiments in 4 groups of patients which included exposed patients, exposed controls, unexposed patients and unexposed controls. As {{the interpretation of}} the positive patch test reaction was similar in both the unexposed patients and unexposed controls, these two were combined into one (unexposed groups). Positive reactions were obtained in a variable number of individuals in each of these groups but the tests were generally more frequently positive and more severe in the exposed patients and exposed controls, compared to the unexposed groups. The number of patients showing positive patch tests out of the total number tested in the 3 groups respectively, with each of the agents were, cinnamon 1 (9), 0 (11), 1 (7) : coriander 3 (8), 4 (12), 1 (5); clove 2 (8), 3 (16), 0 (1); cumin seeds 3 (8), 4 (11), 1 (6); fennel 3 (9), 4 (16), 0 (1); <b>small</b> <b>cardamom</b> 1 (8), 6 (17), 0 (0); large cardamom 3 (8) 3 (11), 0 (7); asafoetida 1 (5), 3 (7), 5 (13); Indian cassia 0 (2), 3 (16), 1 (8); mustard seeds 5 (8), 4 (15) 0 (2); red chillies 2 (7), 6 (21), 0 (0); turmeric 3 (6), 8 (15) 1 (5); tamarind 0 (3), 0 (6), 3 (16); dried mango powder 0 (2), 3 (6), 1 (17); Jaggery 0 (1), 2 (4), 2 (20) and ginger 7 (22), 0 (4), 0 (0). These were considered unikely to be irritant reactions, because in the case of irritant reactions, the frequency of positive reaction is expected to be much more.

40|$|Nepal {{entered into}} a new era after ending 10 years of civil war through signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the {{government}} and the rebel radical Maoist party in November, 2006. Women’s positions were constitutionally secured and space widened for the engagement of women in the broad social, political and economic spheres. Therefore, the post-conflict context provided tremendous opportunities for women to engage in high value commercial agricultural business. The main objectives of the study were a) to examine the effects of armed conflict on agricultural markets, and b) to analyse the state of women’s engagement in high value agricultural exports and its role in market revival. This study involved qualitative research to analyse women’s engagement in commercial agriculture with a specific focus on the marketing of large cardamom (Amomum Subulatum Roxb.), which does not include the <b>small</b> <b>cardamom</b> (Elettaria Cardamomum, Maton). The main finding of this study is the proactive engagement of women in high value, low volume commercial agriculture and its positive contribution to the social, economic and political spheres at individual, households and community levels in Nepal. Women were recognised more in society once they engaged in commercial agriculture especially when they were members of cooperatives and in the position of sanctioning the loans as members of the executive committee to local people (including men). They were also offered political positions in the party structures. They were, comparatively, economically stronger and independent. However, while the government’s efforts were appreciated they were not able to secure better prices for the cash crops and tackle the disease problem. Women were not able to secure a better price in the study area due to lack of up-to-date market price information. Further, in the past 7 - 10 years their cardamom plants suffered heavily from disease (appearance of black spots on leaves, shrinking, and gradually drying of the leaves which people locally called Chhirke-Furke) affecting production...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{concentrations}} of four essential trace metals, i. e., zinc, manganese, copper and iron have been estimated in thirty five different spices and plants having folk medicinal uses. A wet digestion procedure involving {{the use of}} aqua regia (HNO 3 : HCl 1 : 3) {{has been used to}} solubilize metals from the plant samples. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry has been used to quantify metal levels. Results indicate the presence of variable amounts of metals in these plant samples. Order of concentration of metals in different spices and medicinal plants {{has been found to be}} as: Fe>Mn>Zn>Cu. Plant samples of Black Caraway (Cuminum nigrium), Cassia (Cassia fistula),Coriander(Coriandrum sativum),Chicory(Cichorium intybus),Castor(Ricinus communis), Basil(Ocimum basilicum),Small Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum),Bishop`s weed(Trachyspermum ammi),Musli(Aneilema Scapiflorum),Black cumin(Nigella sativa),Sensitive plant(Mimosa pudica),Water chestnut(Trapa bispinosa),Chaksu(Cassia absus) and Nuts-cooling(Wathania coagulans) contained comparatively higher amounts of zinc (i. e. > 50 μg g ha - 1) whereas clove (Syzgium aromaticum), Large cardamom (Amomum subulatum), Black pepper (Pepper nigrium), Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), Basil (Ocimum basilicum), <b>Small</b> <b>Cardamom</b> (Elettarai cardamomum), Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), Syrian rue (Peganum harmala), Ginger (Zingiber officinale), Bishop`s weed (Trachyspermum ammi), Musli (Aneilema scapiflorum), Black cumin (Nigella sativa), Sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica), Rhubarb (Rheum emodi), God Mar (Gymnema sylveseter), Water chestnut (Trapa bispinosa), Chaksu (Cassia absus) and Nuts-cooling (Wathania coagulans) showed manganese levels > 200 μg g ha - 1. Copper levels > 50 μg g ha - 1 were found in Basil (Ocimum basilicum), Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza galbra), Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), Syrian rue (Peganum harmala), Bishop`s weed (Trachyspermum ammi), Chilli (Capcicum freutenscens), Musli (Aneilema scapiflorum), Jujube fruit (Ziziphus vulgaris), Black cumin (Nigella sativa), Sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica), Colecynth (Citrullus colocynthis), God Mar (Gymnema sylveseter), Water chestnut (Trapa bispinosa), Chaksu (Cassia absus) and Nuts-cooling (Wathania coagulans). Iron levels in these plant samples were found to be comparatively higher than all other metals investigated but some of the plants including Mint (Mentha arvensis), Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza galbra), Syrian rue (Peganum harmala), Musli, (Aneilema scapiflorum), sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica), Rhubarb (Rheum emodi), God Mar (Gymnema sylveseter), Chaksu (Cassia absus) and Nuts-cooling (Wathania coagulans) showed very high Iron contents (i. e. > 4000 μg g ha - 1). The present study provides baseline data on essential trace metal levels in spices and medicinal plants commonly used for the treatment of different ailments. This data also suggests that use of various spices and herbs in food recipes and medicinal preparations is a source of essential trace metal supplements in addition to their antimicrobial characteristics...|$|E
