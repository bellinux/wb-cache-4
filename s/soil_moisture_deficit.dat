Severe drought in parts of the U.S., Australia, and Africa in recent years drastically reduced crop yields and disrupted regional economies. Even in average years, however, many agricultural regions, including the U.S. Great Plains, suffer from chronic soil moisture deficits.

50|$|A plant {{responds}} {{to a lack}} of water by halting growth and reducing photosynthesis and other plant processes in order to reduce water use. As water loss progresses, leaves of some species may appear to change colour — usually to blue-green. Foliage begins to wilt and, if the plant is not irrigated, leaves will fall off and the plant will eventually die. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficit</b> lowers the water potential of a plant's root and, upon extended exposure, abscisic acid is accumulated and eventually stomatal closure occurs. This reduces a plant's leaf relative water content. The time required for dehydration stress to occur depends on the water-holding capacity of the soil, environmental conditions, stage of plant growth, and plant species. Plants growing in sandy soils with low water-holding capacity are more susceptible to dehydration stress than plants growing in clay soils. A limited root system will accelerate the rate at which dehydration stress develops. A plant's root system may be limited by the presence of competing root systems from neighbouring plants, by site conditions such as compacted soils or high water tables, or by container size (if growing in a container). A plant with a large mass of leaves in relation to the root system is prone to drought stress because the leaves may lose water faster than the roots can supply it. Newly planted plants and poorly established plants may be especially susceptible to dehydration stress because of the limited root system or the large mass of stems and leaves in comparison to roots.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the risks}} or {{benefits}} to crop yields {{is an important}} factor in implementing a water management practice such as controlled drainage. Soil moisture from monitoring sites in Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana, and Ohio were used to compare deficit and excess moisture conditions in free-draining and controlled drainage sites and understand those inconsistent impacts. Time and magnitude of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficit</b> and excess stress were determined using metrics based on thresholds, depths in the soil profile, and corn growth stages. Seventeen metrics were found to show statistically significant correlation with yields as well as a difference in the quantity of stress between controlled and free-draining fields. Based on one metric of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficit</b> stress, free-draining plots experienced 77 additional cm-days of moisture deficit stress from the R 3 stage until maturity compared to controlled plots and an additional 118 cm-days over the entire season. Meanwhile, controlled drainage plots were found to experience between 0. 5 and 3. 19 additional cm-days of excess stress during the period from seedling emergence to V 6 compared to free-draining plots. In general at the sites studied, moisture deficits occurred during the latter half of the growing season while moisture excesses occurred during the earlier half; both types of stress were shown, when quantified with several different metrics, to correlate negatively with yield. While moisture excess was greater with controlled drainage, the differences were small and often not statistically significant; meanwhile greater differences were found in moisture deficit between free and controlled drainage. Due to a reduction in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficit,</b> controlled drainage has the potential to provide yield benefits in years when deficit stress occurs. ...|$|E

In this thesis, a headwater area in the North York Moors is used to examine the consequences of maintaining a land management regime which has received comparatively little observation in this context: controlled heather burning (muirburn). The effects of coniferous afforestation are also evaluated for selected variables. Particular attention is given to the responses of <b>soil,</b> <b>moisture</b> and evapotranspiration  and the relationship between these two components. Simulated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits</b> derived from empirical models are tested against measured values.   Predictions based on Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration and 'layer' <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits,</b> along with an optimised soil-drying parameter, were found to simulate observed conditions most closely. A land-use change from open heather moorland to burnt ground promoted reductions both in evapotranspiration levels, especially at potential demando and in <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits.</b> In contrast, following afforestation, deficits were maintained or enhanced throughout the year, with higher moisture losses to interception than found under heather, due to the higher aerodynamic resistance of the latter.

Antecedent catchment conditions and storm characteristics were used in analysis of runoff distribution over  time, quantified in terms of 'unit hydrographs' and linear regression models.

Quantifying and explaining yield improvements on-farm in relation to rainfall and <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits</b> provide a transferable basis for interpretation of results at other sites...|$|R

A simple {{explanation for this}} restriction {{could be that the}} riparian trees are unable to survive the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits</b> associated with the summer drought that is a feature of the mediterranean-type climate. A study was made of the water relations and photosynthetic characteristics of selected riparian trees (Brabejum stellatifolium, Brachylaena neriifolia and Cunonia capensis), and shrubs of the relatively xeric hillslopes adjoining such riparian habitats (Protea nitida and P. repens). Field measurements of xylem pressure potential, leaf conductance and net leaf photosynthesis were made in the wet winter of 1986 and during {{the spring and summer of}} 1986 / 7. Characteristics of microclimate and <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> and leaf and canopy morphology were used to explain the observed stomatal behaviour. Despite marked differences in some leaf and canopy characteristics between hillslope and riparian species, stomatal behaviour, net photosynthesis and water-use efficiencies were very similar. Soil water potentials at 900 mm depth at the riparian site remained above − 0. 1 MPa throughout the study and only dropped below − 0. 05 MPa during the dry period. Potentials at the hillslope site frequently dropped below − 0. 1 MPa. The differences in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> potentials at the two sites were reflected in the pre-dawn and midday plant xylem potentials but the magnitude of differences was much less than had been expected. Similarly, diurnal courses of leaf conductance and net leaf photosynthesis were very similar for hillslope and riparian species. We suggest the following reasons for the very similar patterns of physiological response: (a) <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits</b> at 900 mm depth at the hillslope site were rapidly recharged following relatively light rainfall events and the periods between significant rainfall events were too short to induce drought; (b) the deep-rooted hillslope shrubs behave as phreatophytes and utilize water at depth; and (c) the hillslope communities have sparse canopies and evapotranspiration was too low to dry the soils to depth. Hillslope shrubs have low capacities for resource capture and use, and it appears that their sparse canopies have not equilibrated with available <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> as is the case with structurally similar sclerophyllous shrubs in other mediterranean-climate regions...|$|R

In light of the occurrence of channel features in several abandoned home-field areas of the Norse Eastern Settlement of Greenland, and the irrigation requirements of present-day Greenlandic sheep-farmers questions are raised: was irrigation used by the Norse settlers of Greenland on their home- field areas? and, if so, how frequently? Modelling of soil chemical, physical and soil-water hydraulic properties integrated with contemporary high-resolution climatic data demonstrate a frequent requirement for irrigation. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits</b> are related to the duration and intensity of winter temperature. Using the winter Dye 3 ice core δ 18 O record as a climatic proxy, the frequency of <b>moisture</b> <b>deficits,</b> based on comparing mean winter temperatures, indicates that there was a frequent irrigation requirement to maintain home-field productivity, increasing throughout the period of settlement until the 14 th Centu...|$|R
