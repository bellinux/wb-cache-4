Within Belgium, bintje potatoes are generally preferred as a basis to make fries because of their high <b>starch</b> <b>content.</b> They are generally double-fried (fried, left to cool and then fried again) in order to make them both moist in the core and crispy on the outside.

2500|$|Malt extract is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} brewing of beer. Its production begins by germinating barley grain in {{a process known as}} malting, [...] immersing barley in water to encourage the grain to sprout, then drying the barley to halt the progress when the sprouting begins. The drying step stops the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production. In one before-and-after comparison, malting decreased barley's extractable <b>starch</b> <b>content</b> by about 7% on a dry matter basis, and turned that portion into various other carbohydrates.|$|E

50|$|In particular, Maribel Ovando-Martinez led a {{group of}} {{researchers}} from Mexico and Spain did a study {{in order to find}} what effect the addition of banana flour to pasta would have on pasta’s resistant <b>starch</b> <b>content.</b> Their results showed that such an addition to a normal pasta recipe, even with cooking loss, appreciably increased the resistant <b>starch</b> <b>content</b> of the pasta. Other researchers did similar tests adding banana flour to bread and also found banana flour increased the total resistant <b>starch</b> <b>content</b> of the final product. Researchers have also conducted tests on the effects banana flour has on taste and general palatability.

This variation was explained in the first case, by the increase {{of the number of}} starch molecules contacting the <alpha>−amylase, so that the amount of degraded starch was higher.

50|$|Banana flour (green variety) {{has gained}} the {{attention}} of nutritional researchers and dieters as an excellent and useful source of resistant starch (other sources include potato starch). Preliminary {{research has shown that}} increased resistant starch intake may reduce risk of obesity, diabetes, and colon cancer. Resistant starch refers to a type of starch that the human stomach cannot easily digest and thus acts similarly to soluble and insoluble fiber, in that resistant starch eases the passage of food through the digestive system like insoluble fiber while also be slowly digestible like soluble fiber. Banana flour has a high resistant <b>starch</b> <b>content</b> (17.5%) combined with excellent cooking/baking characteristics that allow it to act as a replacement for wheat flour. For this purpose, banana flour is often used raw, for example as an ingredient in smoothies, because cooking reduces the resistant <b>starch</b> <b>content.</b> However, even in cooked products like pasta, the addition of banana flour increased total resistant <b>starch</b> <b>content</b> in appreciable amounts.|$|E
30|$|The {{potential}} of termite (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) and fungal attacks [Fomitopsis palustris (Berkeley et Curtis) Murrill (FFPRI 0507) and Trametes versicolor (L. ex Fr.) Quel (FFPRI 1030)] against moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel) were evaluated {{with regard to}} the seasonal and height-dependent changes of the free glucose and <b>starch</b> <b>contents,</b> which were measured by a newly developed method. The free glucose contents were generally lower in autumn and winter than in spring and summer, whereas the lowest <b>starch</b> <b>contents</b> were obtained in August, and the contents increased almost linearly up to February and March. In terms of the height-dependent fluctuation, the free glucose contents tended to decrease as the sampling heights increased. There was no special correlation between the free glucose or <b>starch</b> <b>contents</b> and the consumption by termites, even though higher mortalities were obtained in the bamboo-fed termites than in the wood-fed termites. However, a positive correlation between the free glucose contents and mass losses of the samples at 4 -m and 8 -m heights from the bottom by the decay fungi was observed. For starch, no influence on fungal attack was found.|$|R
30|$|The {{alkaline}} extraction – glucoamylase hydrolysis (AG) method, which extracts sugars and starch {{by using}} sodium hydroxide and hydrolyzes starch by using glucoamylase and α-amylase, was {{compared with the}} established ethanol extraction – perchloric acid hydrolysis (EPA) method to analyze the sugar and <b>starch</b> <b>contents</b> of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel). The results suggested that the two methods had comparable abilities to extract free sugars from moso bamboo. However, the AG method analyzed starch in moso bamboo more accurately than the EPA method under the proper conditions. When we {{take into account the}} better time performance of the AG method versus the EPA method, we can conclude that the AG method is superior to EPA for analyzing the sugar and <b>starch</b> <b>contents</b> of moso bamboo.|$|R
40|$|Correlations among barley protein, starch {{molecular}} structure and grain size were determined using 30 barley samples with variable protein <b>contents.</b> <b>Starch</b> {{molecular structure}} {{was characterized by}} fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis and by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, also termed GPC). The chain-length distributions of amylopectin were fitted using a mathematical model reflecting the relative activities of starch branching enzymes and starch synthase enzymes. Increased protein content significantly and negatively correlated with higher amounts of amylose with longer chains (degree of polymerization, DP 1600 – 40000) while barley grain sizes positively associated with <b>starch</b> <b>contents.</b> Protein content also positively correlated with the proportion of longer chains of amylopectin (DP 34 – 100). These {{results showed that the}} enzyme activities of starch synthases change with protein content, leading to altered <b>starch</b> <b>contents,</b> structures and grain sizes. From this perspective, selecting for large grain size (or low protein content) does not necessarily relate to starch structure, although may suggest long chains of amylopectin. Measuring starch structure could give a good indication of process performance in human food, animal feed and brewing, as all these structural features contribute to significant functional properties...|$|R
