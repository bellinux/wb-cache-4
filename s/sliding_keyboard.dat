2500|$|In early 2014, BlackBerry's device head Ron Louks {{proposed}} that the company construct an Android device. Company officials, including Chen, showed concerns over the project, as they believed the platform was not secure enough. However, Louks gained support for the project after outlining plans for hardware-based security. At Mobile World Congress 2015, BlackBerry's device head Ron Louks briefly presented a non-functioning prototype of a new, BlackBerry 10 phone that featured a <b>sliding</b> <b>keyboard</b> and a screen curved across both sides, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge that was unveiled during the same convention. In July 2015, new images of the curved device leaked under the codename [...] "Venice"; unlike the version presented at MWC, it was now shown to be running Android 5.0 [...] "Lollipop" [...] rather than BlackBerry 10. Information about the device's software leaked in August 2015, showing a [...] "stock" [...] Android experience augmented with ports of features and apps from BB10, such as BlackBerry Hub.|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the large}} {{character}} set nature of Myanmar character, currently used Myanmar language soft keyboard look like QWERTY layout on Android devices’s performance is degraded when using on small screens. The users are needed to switch keyboard layout frequently to get their desired characters. To reduce the user keyboard layout switching time, this paper proposed the <b>slide</b> <b>keyboard</b> to set the entire Myanmar character on one screen layout. User study was made by comparing <b>slide</b> <b>keyboard</b> with currently used Myanmar language soft keyboard that look like QWERTY layout (iTextMM). The user preferences and empirical evaluation is also analyzed. According to the evaluation, the parpicipants can take minimum learning time with <b>slide</b> <b>keyboard</b> and can type {{at a rate of}} 17 Character per Minutes (CPM) and have got average 0. 65 error rates...|$|R

50|$|Such {{developments}} could literally {{change the}} face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating <b>sliding</b> <b>keyboard</b> rests built under the desk's surface. Television remote controls and keypads on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated.|$|E

Reviewers praised it for offering a simple and [...] "relatively inexpensive" [...] way to access the Internet, but many criticized its size, lack of features, and US $5 per month in addition to the Internet access charge and the purchase price (US $299).
