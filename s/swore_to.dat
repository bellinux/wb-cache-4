5|$|When {{writing for}} Vince the writers blanked {{out all of}} the {{characters}} swearing like it is done on the show, {{but when it came to}} recording the programme the swear words had to be put in for Kaye to read them. During read-throughs of the scripts, a toy horn was honked whenever Kaye <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> give an idea of what it would sound like during the programme.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Charles tried to release {{himself from the}} oath he <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> protect the Muslims. He wrote to Pope Clement VII in 1523 and again in 1524 for this dispensation. Clement {{initially}} resisted the request, but issued in May 1524 a papal brief releasing Charles from the oath and absolving him from all perjuries that might arise from breaking it. The Pope also authorized the Inquisition to suppress oppositions to the upcoming conversions.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E

5|$|If the {{election}} {{had been left}} to the papacy, Ernst {{would have been the}} choice, but the Pope was {{not a member of the}} Cathedral Chapter and Gebhard had the support of several of the Catholic, and all the Protestant, canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a spirited contest with the papacy's candidate, Ernst: Gebhard won {{the election}} by two votes. Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.|$|E
5|$|In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the {{greatest}} of the Noldor, created the Silmarils in which he stored {{a part of the}} light of the Two Trees that were lighting Valinor. After three ages in the Halls of Mandos, Melkor was released, feigning reform. He however spread his evil and started to poison the minds of the Elves against the Valar. Eventually he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him Morgoth (S. The Black Enemy). Fëanor and his seven sons then <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{years after the}} conquest of Granada, Muslims in Granada and {{elsewhere}} continued to enjoy freedom of religion. This right was guaranteed in various legal instruments, including treaties, charters, capitulations, and coronation oaths. For example, the Treaty of Granada (1491) guaranteed religious tolerance to the Muslims of the conquered Granada. Kings of Aragon, including King Ferdinand II and Charles V, <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> protect the Muslims' religious freedom in their oaths of coronation.|$|E

5|$|Some British sources {{claim that}} the Polish cavalrymen refused to accept any {{surrender}} by the British infantry, and deliberately speared the wounded as they lay. Tradition reports that the British 2nd Division <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> give no quarter to Poles following Albuera. According to Beresford, of the 1,258 men lost by Colborne's first three regiments, 319 were killed, 460 were wounded and 479 were taken prisoner. According to Soult's report the Vistula Lancers had 130 casualties out of 591 troopers.|$|E
5|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} was {{a response}} to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt, when the Eretrians and Athenians had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Eretrian and Athenian force had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis (the regional capital of Persia), but was then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, the Persian king Darius I <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> have revenge on Athens and Eretria.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of these}} Arab raids, an {{invasion}} under a certain Maimun al-Gurgunami ("Maimun the Mardaite") took place, which raided Cilicia and was defeated by a Byzantine army under a general named Marianus near Tyana. The dating of this expedition is unclear; although the primary account, by al-Baladhuri, places it under Abd al-Malik (who died in 705), it is commonly dated to 706 by modern scholars. According to Baladhuri, this Maimun had been a slave of Caliph Muawiyah's sister, who had fled to the Mardaites, a group of Christian rebels in northern Syria. After the Mardaites had been subdued, the general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, who had heard of his valour, liberated him and entrusted him with a military command, and later <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> avenge his death.|$|E

Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she could have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E
5|$|John's coup was {{launched}} on 31 July 1201, when the conspirators {{broke into the}} Hagia Sophia, where they <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> restore the Empire to its ancient bounds against the Vlach-Bulgarians, Seljuk Turks and the Latin Crusaders. While John was being proclaimed emperor and crowned by a monk— since Patriarch John X Kamateros hid himself inside a cupboard— the capital's populace rioted outside and set fire {{to a number of}} churches. The conspirators then marched towards the Great Palace. Avoiding the Chalke Gate, which was held by the feared Varangian Guard, they made for the imperial box in the Hippodrome, the kathisma, which was connected to the palace precinct. John's supporters indeed managed to drive off the Macedonian guard placed there and entered the palace through the Kareia Gate.|$|E
5|$|The Ordainers {{once more}} sent Gaveston into exile in 1311, but by 1312 he was back. Now the king's {{favourite}} was officially an outlaw, and Arundel {{was among the}} earls who <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> hunt him down. The leader of the oppositionafter Lincoln's death the year beforewas now Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. In June 1312 Gaveston was captured, tried before Lancaster, Arundel and the earls of Warwick and Hereford, and executed. A reconciliation was achieved between the king and the offending magnates, and Arundel and the others received pardons, but animosity prevailed. In 1314 Arundel was among the magnates who refused to assist Edward in a campaign against the Scots, contributing to the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn.|$|E

5|$|The {{archbishop}} <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> Henry I that {{he would}} support Henry's daughter Matilda's claim to the English throne, but after Henry's death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22December 1135. He was persuaded {{to do so by}} Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Stephen's brother, and Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. The bishops argued that Henry had no right to impose the oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from the oath in any event. The royal steward, Hugh Bigod, swore that he had been present at the king's deathbed and had heard the king say that he released the oath.|$|E
5|$|The new {{parliament}} passed {{a set of}} measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then {{had the power to}} appoint England's justiciar, chancellor and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year, {{in the form of the}} Provisions of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} for reform {{continued to grow}} unabated and a fresh parliament met in June, passing a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then {{had the power to}} appoint England's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. The elected council included representatives of the Savoyard faction but no Poitevins, and the new government immediately took steps to exile the leading Lusignans and to seize key castles across the country.|$|E

5|$|The revolting nobility had thus chosen Uroš {{as their}} {{candidate}} for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a {{war for the}} throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced {{to give up the}} crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš quickly captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav's wife, Beloslava. Beloslava spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The fact that she was the organizer of the resistance against Uroš is known from an edict dated to the summer of 1243, in which the Ragusans <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava's resistance work. Since Vladislav is not mentioned anywhere, it means that he was likely imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|As well as St Augustine's, the abbots of {{a number}} of other monasteries in the diocese of Canterbury are known to have professed {{obedience}} to Theobald, as the documents recording the events survive. Not only abbots and priors from within Canterbury, but some from other dioceses <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> obey Theobald, although normally such oaths would have gone to their diocesan bishop instead. Most of these exceptions occurred because the monastic house claimed exemption from the oversight of their diocesan bishop, and had a tradition of making those oaths to Canterbury instead. Besides these events, Theobald also intervened in the elections of some abbots, although not always successfully. He attempted to secure the right of Gilbert Foliot to remain Abbot of Gloucester after Foliot's election as Bishop of Hereford, but a new abbot was elected by the monks of Gloucester. Theobald was more successful in securing the election of William, who had previously been a monk at Christ Church, to be Abbot of Evesham over the objections of some of the monks of Evesham.|$|E
5|$|Edward's initial {{reaction}} to the news of Gaveston's execution was rage; according to the Vita Edwardi he <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> avenge the act. Circumstances, however, prevented him from taking immediate action against the executioners. During the previous raid on Newcastle, the King and Gaveston had to flee quickly, leaving behind horses and jewels worth {{a great amount of}} money. At the same time, the barons' extralegal action had alienated many of their former associates; the Earl of Pembroke in particular became strongly tied to the King's cause after the affront to his honour. Through the arbitration of the Earl of Gloucester and others, a settlement was finally reached on 14 October 1313, whereby the barons were given a pardon and the horses and jewels were returned to the King. The following years were marked by a constant power struggle between Edward and Lancaster, centred on the maintenance of the Ordinances. The matter was not finally settled until 1322, when Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and executed.|$|E
