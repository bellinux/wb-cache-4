25|$|Holders of Travelcards can add pay {{as you go}} credit {{on their}} Oyster cards. This credit is used as '{{extension}} fare' when the Oyster user travels beyond the zones in which their Travelcard is valid. This extension fare equals the regular Oyster fare for a journey from/to the respective station outside <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> area <b>of</b> the Travelcard to/from the closest zone still covered by the Travelcard. To distinguish between Peak and Off-Peak fares, however, the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the journey is taken into account. That means a traveller might be charged the (more expensive) peak fare as extension fare {{even if they had}} not yet left the area <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> their Travelcard by the end of peak time. Conversely, however, a journey starting in the covered zones shortly before the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the peak time will be charged as off-peak.|$|R

The refugee travel document does not entitle the holder to visit his State of origin or provenance (art. 8 para. 3 ODV).

Consistency conditions lead to constraints upon the possible spectrum of thermal fluctuations. In a special case this uniquely selects the Gibbs canonical distribution and more generally incorporates the Tsallis distributions. No particular model of microscopic dynamics need be assumed...|$|R

Zaproponowane zostaje postpozytywistyczne pojęcie obowiązywania prawa stanowionego, oparte na analizie dotychczasowych podstawowych teorii obowiązywania prawa. Pierwsza część monografii zawiera analizę współczesnej niepozytywistycznej koncepcji prawa, opracowanej przez Ralfa Dreiera i Roberta Alexy'ego, w celu znalezienia odpowiedzi na pytanie o to, czy prawnicze pojęcie obowiązywania prawa winno zawierać kryteria lub standardy moralne.
