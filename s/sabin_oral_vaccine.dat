40|$|A uracil-to-cytosine point {{mutation}} at nucleotide (nt) 472 of <b>Sabin</b> <b>oral</b> poliovirus <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) type 3 {{is found in}} conjunction with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). Direct RNA extraction and mutant analysis by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme cleavage were used to identify this {{point mutation}} in clinical samples. A total of 238 stool samples were obtained from 28 healthy infants for 6 weeks after OPV vaccination. More than 25 % of infants shed OPV 3 in the week after vaccination, with a decrease on day 6. A second wave of OPV 3 shedding occurred beginning the second week after vaccination and was maintained {{through the end of}} the study period. During the first week after vaccination, the proportion of nt 472 mutants in the shed OPV 3 increased from undetectable to almost 100 %. During the second shedding period, the proportion of nt 472 mutants remained close to 100 %.

REACTIONS REPORTED Shortly after the first dose of monovalent type I vaccine had been given, one of us (M. L. P.) as Director of Health of the city, received reports of a few possible "reactions.

Of seven genomic positions tested, only two (positions 472 and 2493) show nucleotide heterogeneity. Propagation of the vaccine virus in cell cultures leads to rapid selection of virus with reversions at these two positions of the genome.

40|$|Background & objectives: Polioviruses are the causative {{agent of}} paralytic poliomyelitis. Attenuated {{poliovirus}}es (<b>Sabin</b> <b>oral</b> poliovirus <b>vaccine</b> strains) do not replicate efficiently in neurons {{as compared to}} the wild type polioviruses and therefore do not cause disease. This study was aimed to investigate the differential host immune response to wild type 1 poliovirus (wild PV) and Sabin attenuated type 1 poliovirus (Sabin PV) in cultured human neuronal cells. Methods: By using flow cytometry and real time PCR methods we examined host innate immune responses and compared the role of toll like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic RNA helicases in cultured human neuronal cells (SK-N-SH) infected with Sabin PV and wild PV. Results: Human neuronal cells expressed very low levels of TLRs constitutively. Sabin PV infection induced significantly higher expression of TLR 3, TLR 7 and melanoma differentiation-associated protein- 5 (MDA- 5) m-RNA in neuronal cells at the beginning of infection (up to 4 h) as compared to wild PV. Further, Sabin PV also induced the expression of interferon α/β at early time point of infection. The induced expression of IFN α/β gene by Sabin PV in neuronal cells could be suppressed by inhibiting TLR 7. Interpretation & conclusions: Neuronal cell innate immune response to Sabin and wild polioviruses differ significantly for TLR 3, TLR 7, MDA 5 and type 1 interferons. Effects of TLR 7 activation and interferon production and Sabin virus replication in neuronal cells need to be actively investigated in future studies...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Sabin</b> <b>oral</b> {{poliovirus}} <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) readily undergoes {{changes in}} antigenic sites upon replication in humans. Here, {{a set of}} antigenically altered descendants of the three OPV serotypes (76 isolates) was characterized to determine the driving forces behind these changes and their biological implications. The amino acid residues of OPV derivatives that lie within or close to the known antigenic sites exhibited a marked tendency {{to be replaced by}} residues characteristic of homotypic wild polioviruses, and these changes may occur very early in OPV evolution. The specific amino acid alterations nicely correlated with serotype-specific changes in the reactivity of certain individual antigenic sites, as revealed by the recently devised monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In comparison to the original vaccine, small changes, if any, in the neutralizing capacity of human or rabbit sera were observed in highly diverged vaccine polioviruses of three serotypes, in spite of strong alterations of certain epitopes. We propose that the common antigenic alterations in evolving OPV strains largely reflect attempts to eliminate fitness-decreasing mutations acquired either during the original selection of the vaccine or already present in the parental strains. Variability of individual epitopes {{does not appear to be}} primarily caused by, or lead to, a significant immune evasion, enhancing only slightly, if at all, the capacity of OPV derivatives to overcome immunity in human populations.

This 1964 poster featured what at that time, was CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s national symbol of public health, the 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 Wellbee 22 ̆ 0 ac?, who here was reminding the public to get a booster vaccination. CDC used the Wellbee in its comprehensive marketing campaign that used newspapers, posters, leaflets, radio and television, as well as personal appearances at public health events. Wellbee 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s first assignment was to sponsor <b>Sabin</b> Type-II <b>oral</b> polio <b>vaccine</b> campaigns across the United States. Later, Wellbee 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s character was incorporated into other health promotion campaigns including diphtheria and tetanus immunizations, hand-washing, physical fitness, and injury prevention.

40|$|The {{immunogenic}} {{efficacy of}} inactivated (Salk) poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was evaluated in infants in India, {{in view of}} the high frequency of vaccine failure after immunization with <b>oral</b> (<b>Sabin)</b> poliovirus <b>vaccine</b> (OPV). A total of 150 infants, aged 6 - 45 weeks, were given 3 doses of IPV, with intervals of 4 or 8 weeks between doses. The effect on the antibody response of child's age, presence of maternal antibody before immunization, and interval between doses was assessed. The overall seroconversion rates to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were 99 %, 89 %, and 91 %, respectively. Seroconversion rates to types 2 and 3, and antibody titres to types 1 and 2, were higher (i) in infants given vaccine doses at 8 -week intervals and (ii) in those without detectable maternal antibody. The seroconversion rates in infants without maternal antibody, who were given IPV at 8 -week intervals, were 100 %, 100 %, and 96. 2 % to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Thus the immunogenic efficacy of IPV was found to be satisfactory...|$|R
25|$|Notable {{developments}} in vaccine delivery technologies have included <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Early attempts to apply <b>oral</b> <b>vaccines</b> showed {{varying degrees of}} promise, beginning early in the 20th century, {{at a time when}} the very possibility of an effective <b>oral</b> antibacterial <b>vaccine</b> was controversial. By the 1930s there was increasing interest in the prophylactic value of an <b>oral</b> typhoid fever <b>vaccine</b> for example.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the present status of {{immunity}} against poliovirus of the general populationarising from mass vaccination with live <b>oral</b> <b>Sabin</b> <b>vaccine</b> carried out since 1961, sera obtained from residents in Sapporo and its outskirts were examined for virus-neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types 1 and 3 with microtransfer technique using LLCMK 2 cells. Examination of the data obtained from those under 15 years of age revealed that the duration ofimmunity conferred by live oral poliovaccine varied according {{to the type of}} virus: at 10 - 14 years of age, the percentages of those having neutralizing titers ?l: 4 were 82 % for type 1 and 60 % for type 3,and the rates of those with titers ?l: 64 were 12 % for type 1 and 9 % for type 3, respectively. An early disappearance of type 3 antibody due to poor immunogenicity of the vaccine was noted. Those of 18 years of age or older who might have been exposed to natural infection of poliomyelitis in their infancy possessed higher antibody titers against both types, as compared to those under 15 years of age. These titers, however, were still significantly lower than the titers in serum obtained from inhabitants living in an endemic country (Timor Island, Indonesia). Based on these results, the importance of a careful follow-up of herd immunity in the futureespecially among those who had acquired immunity by vaccination alone was emphasized...|$|R
