25|$|A {{legacy of}} serious {{environmental}} problems has beset {{the area from}} the time the canal arose from the local tidal wetlands and fresh water streams. In recent years, there has been a call once again for environmental cleanup. In addition, development pressures have brought speculation that the wetlands of the Gowanus should serve waterfront economic development needs which may not be compatible with environmental restoration. Experts have said that it is so polluted that if <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to fall in the canal, they would need to be taken to a hospital for decontamination. Also, if anyone were to drink the water, they would likely contract dysentery and would be at risk of cancer and arsenic poisoning.|$|E
25|$|If <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> {{to behave}} as if they {{understood}} a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E

In a recent discussion of it which draws on Brentano’s, Ross’s and Chisholm’s related views, Noah Lemos concludes that “we may say that the property of being pleased that <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> suffering is not an intrinsically good-making property (…) [but] it hardly follows that the property of being pleased is not (…). These are, after all, distinct properties, since one can have the latter without having the former.

500|$|A lot of Muslim {{critics of}} Wilders {{accuse him of}} using Quranic verses out of context, and of {{manipulating}} verses {{to have a different}} meaning than the verses intended to. Because of Wilders' positions on Islam and calls for discrimination against Dutch citizens of minority ethnic descent, the Dutch–Moroccan rapper Appa, when interviewed about Wilders for a newspaper, said [...] "if <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to put a bullet in his head, I wouldn't mind". Wilders' views on Islam prompted the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, to reprimand him.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, 2008, the Metro Transit Police Department {{announced}} plans to immediately begin random searches of backpacks, purses, and other bags. Transit police would search riders at random before boarding a bus or entering a station. It also explained its intent to stop anyone acting suspiciously. Metro claims that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision in MacWade v. Kelly, which upheld random searches on the New York City Subway, allows Metro Transit Police to take similar action. Metro Transit Police Chief Michael Taborn stated that, if <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> {{to turn around and}} simply enter the system through another escalator or elevator, Metro has [...] "a plan to address suspicious behavior". Security expert Bruce Schneier characterized the plan as [...] "security theater against a movie plot threat" [...] and does not believe random bag searches actually improve security.|$|E
500|$|Lim Choon Wee of the New Straits Times highly {{praised the}} game's humor, {{which he called}} [...] "brilliantly funny". The writer commented that the game's puzzles relied on [...] "trial and error" [...] with [...] "no {{underlying}} logic", but stated that the game [...] "remains fun" [...] despite this issue, and concluded that Day of the Tentacle was [...] "definitely the comedy game of the year". Daniel Baum of The Jerusalem Post called it [...] "one of the funniest, most entertaining and best-programmed computer games I have ever seen", and lauded its animation. He wrote that the game provided [...] "a more polished impression" [...] than either The Secret of Monkey Island or [...] The writer stated that its high system requirements were its only drawback, and believed that a Sound Blaster card was required to fully appreciate the game. In a retrospective review, Adventure Gamers' Chris Remo wrote, [...] "If <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> {{to ask for a}} few examples of games that exemplify the best of the graphic adventure genre, Day of the Tentacle would certainly be near the top".|$|E

500|$|According to Paul Neurath, Ultima Underworld II and its {{predecessor}} together sold {{half a million}} units. Paul Presley of PC Review called the game [...] "huge" [...] and praised its atmosphere, increased variety and higher graphical detail. However, {{he found that the}} game, unlike {{its predecessor}}, does not feature [...] "anything that takes it to a higher plateau to wait for the others to catch up". He summarized Ultima Underworld II as [...] "magnificent", and he wrote, [...] "If <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to hand me £40 and say buy either Underworld I or II, I'd take the sequel any time." [...] PC Zones David McCandless wrote, [...] "Nothing can completely prepare you for the freedom the game gives you ... It's about as close to Virtual Reality as you are ever likely to get from your mouse driver." [...] He praised the game's atmospheric sound and called its graphics [...] "stunning": on a high-end computer, he found that [...] "dungeons can move like a film". Partly because of the game's large size, he felt that Ultima Underworld II was looser and less involving than its predecessor, but he concluded that players would still [...] "sit there, dribble slightly, and say 'blimey' every eight to ten minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|The adult {{interest}} in the show is {{comparable to that of}} The Magic Roundabout, Tiny Toon Adventures, Rocko's Modern Life, Animaniacs, Dexters Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants, Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Phineas and Ferb: older audiences appreciate jokes aimed at adult viewers and a sense of nostalgia for older cartoons and animated films. Many of the aforementioned shows had attracted college-aged fans who, when Friendship Is Magic was airing, would be raising children of their own. The show references works that older viewers would recognize, such as I Love Lucy, The Benny Hill Show, X-Men, , Diamond Dogs, The Big Lebowski, The Avengers, Star Wars, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of these fans are surprised by their fondness for the show. Shaun Scotellaro, operator of Equestria Daily, one of the main fan websites for the show, said, [...] "Honestly, if <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to have told me I'd be writing a pony blog seven months ago, I would have called them insane." [...] He commented that the spread among adults was accelerated by its presence in online gaming. Mike Fahey, an editor for the gaming website Kotaku, noted that the fandom was [...] "building friendships among a diverse group of people that otherwise might have just sat {{on either side of the}} Internet, flinging insults at each other". Dr. Patrick Edwards, who performed several [...] "Brony Studies" [...] to survey and analyze the fandom, observed that the brony fandom is unlike most other fandoms which [...] "aren't welcoming to people who are different", and promote the show's message of love and tolerance. [...] Further interest came from the furry community, which includes a large number of animation fans. One contributor to [...] "The Brony Study" [...] (below), Dr. Marsha Redden said that the adult fans are [...] "a reaction to the US having been engrossed in terrorism for past ten years" [...] in a manner similar to the Cold War, and are [...] "tired of being afraid, tired of angst and animosity"; the show and its fandom are outlets from those strifes. She compared the brony fandom to that of the bohemian and beatniks after World War II and of the hippies after the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Amy Keating Rogers, one of the show's writers, believes that the fans have come to like Friendship Is Magic due to [...] "so much cynicism and negativity out there in so many [...] shows", while the show [...] "has such a positive message" [...] that counters this.|$|E

"I {{should not}} think it an {{outrageous}} paradox", writes Carr, [...] "if <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to say that Grote's History of Greece has quite as much {{to tell us about}} the thought of the English philosophical radicals in the 1840s as about Athenian democracy in the fifth century B.C." [...] Prof. Carr credits the philosopher R. G. Collingwood as being his inspiration for this line of thinking.|$|E
2500|$|This {{goes beyond}} {{reporting}} alternate points of view, {{which is an}} important function of the press. [...] "In short," [...] Kuypers explained, [...] "if <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> relying only on the mainstream media for information, they would {{have no idea what}} the president actually said. It was as if the press were reporting on a different speech." [...] The study is essentially a [...] "comparative framing analysis." [...] Overall, Kuypers examined themes about 9-11 and the War on Terror that President Bush used and compared them to themes that the press used when reporting on what he said.|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{explains}} this unintelligibility with {{a series}} of analogies. For example, in section 265 he observes the pointlessness of a dictionary that exists only in the imagination. Since the idea of a dictionary is to justify the translation of one word by another, and thus constitute the reference of justification for such a translation, all this is lost the moment we talk of a dictionary in the imagination; for “justification consists in appealing to something independent". Hence, to appeal to a private ostensive definition as the standard of correct use of a term would be [...] "as if <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Referred to by Voici {{magazine}} as [...] "a distant descendant of Dorothy Parker", Anna Gavalda {{was born in}} an upper-class suburb of Paris.

The book was translated into numerous languages including in English and sold in twenty-seven countries. It was published to acclaim in North America in 2003 as I Wish <b>Someone</b> <b>Were</b> Waiting for Me Somewhere. The book received much praise and is a library and school selection worldwide in several languages.|$|E
2500|$|Benaderet also gained notoriety for the {{complexity}} of her surname, which has been misspelled as Benadaret or Benederet. She first resisted requests to change it when she began performing at twelve years old: [...] "They told me no one could remember it, no one could pronounce it, no one could spell it." [...] When she was introduced to Orson Welles in 1936, he remarked that her name [...] "sounded like something you ad lib in a mob scene," [...] and it was misspelled in a 1946 press release created specifically about its proper spelling. Radio Life wrote in 1947: [...] "If <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to conduct a survey to decide the radio personality with the most frequently misspelled name, Bea Benaderet would probably win hands down." [...] Early in the first season of The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, her full name appeared as Bee Benadaret in the closing credits.|$|E

The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He claimed to have had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I have to go now", during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, [...] "and then I left my body. I was up on the ceiling...I {{looked down and saw}} my body stretched out on the bed, not moving, while everybody—there were 15 or 20 people, the doctors, the EMTs, the nurses—was working on me.

2500|$|R. G. Frey, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in Interests and Rights (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: [...] "If <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{immunity}} has intrigued mankind {{for thousands of}} years. The prehistoric view of disease {{was that it was}} caused by supernatural forces, and that illness was a form of theurgic punishment for [...] "bad deeds" [...] or [...] "evil thoughts" [...] visited upon the soul by the gods or by one's enemies. Between the time of Hippocrates and the 19th century, when the foundations of the scientific methods were laid, diseases were attributed to an alteration or imbalance in one of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile or black bile). Also popular during this time before learning that communicable diseases came from germs/microbes was the miasma theory, which held that diseases such as cholera or the Black Plague were caused by a miasma, a noxious form of [...] "bad air". If <b>someone</b> <b>were</b> exposed to the miasma in a swamp, in evening air, or breathing air in a sickroom or hospital ward, they could get a disease.|$|E
