40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Exercise {{and inhaled}} <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> {{are thought to}} cause bronchoconstriction in asthma through {{different}} mechanisms. The response to both stimuli becomes refractory with repeat challenge. The mechanism of refractoriness is unclear, although depletion of mast cell derived mediators or neurotransmitters has been suggested. Recent studies suggest a common mechanism involving release of inhibitory prostaglandins. If this is true, exercise and <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> induced bronchoconstriction should show cross refractoriness. METHODS [...] Thirteen subjects with mild asthma and previously established exercise and <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> induced bronchoconstriction performed two <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> challenges (giving a single dose previously shown to cause a 20 % fall in FEV 1) on one study day, and two exercise tests on another. The second challenge proceeded after recovery (FEV 1 > 95 % baseline) from the first. Subjects then attended on two further occasions when an exercise test was performed after <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> and a <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> challenge after exercise. RESULTS [...] When expressed as the percentage reduction in the area under the change in percentage FEV 1 curve over 20 minutes (AUC) the response to exercise was reduced by a mean 62. 3 % (95 % CI 46. 5 % to 78. 1 %) following a first exercise challenge, and by 50. 7 % (95 % CI 27. 8 % to 73. 6 %) following a <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> challenge.

40|$|Postharvest {{diseases}} of lemon fruits represent {{one of the}} most severe sources of loss production. They are controlled by imazalil (IMZ), thiabendazole (TBZ) and sodium ortho-phenil-phenate (SOPP) registered fungicides for postharvest treatments. Nowadays, the chemical use is becoming more restricted for environmental concerns and development of fungicide-tolerance strains of fungal pathogens. In the last few years a renewed interest in alternative methods of postharvest decay control has been increasing and the research for natural products has provided encouraging results. The aim of this research has been the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness evaluation of six essences (garlic, cloves, oregano, mint, geranium and eugenol) and three mineral products (<b>sodium</b> bicarbonate, <b>metabisulphite</b> and kaoline) against Penicillium digitatum Sacc. and Phytophthora citrophthora (R. e E.

In the in vitro assay, the essences and mineral substances were tested, in 2006 - 2008, at different concentrations using the Grover and Moore method. In the in vivo trial the products were tested on mature lemons both on intact (or unwounded) and wounded fruits, the latter previously infected with Penicillium spores and a Phytophthora colony fragments. In both experiments fruits were sprayed with products at different concentrations, air dried and stored at 5 °C for 5 weeks. In vitro results, oregano, geranium and cloves essential oils showed a better inhibition against P. citrophthora at all concentrations in comparison to garlic and mint oils, that were effective only at the highest concentration.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Inhaled frusemide {{inhibits}} airway {{responses to}} <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> and other indirect bronchial challenges in asthma by undetermined mechanisms which {{may relate to}} its ability to stimulate prostaglandin release. Inhalation of <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> provokes indirect bronchoconstriction, possibly by activating sensory nerves. To investigate the role of cyclooxygenase products in the airway actions of frusemide and <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite,</b> {{the effects of a}} potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen, alone and in combination with frusemide were investigated against airway responsiveness to <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite.</b> METHODS [...] In a double blind double placebo controlled study, 12 mild asthmatic subjects attended on four occasions to undergo three inhalation challenges with <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite.</b> A baseline challenge was performed one hour before oral intake of flurbiprofen 200 mg or matched placebo, and two hours before inhalation of frusemide 40 mg or matched placebo. A second challenge was performed immediately after inhalation of frusemide (two hours after flurbiprofen) with a further challenge three hours later. The log concentration provoking a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (log PC 20) was used to assess airway responsiveness to <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite.</b> RESULTS [...] Frusemide caused an immediate 1. 9 doubling dose protection and a lesser 0. 7 doubling dose protection at three hours. This protection was enhanced by flurbiprofen at both time points to 2. 7 (early) and 1. 9 (late) doubling doses. In addition, flurbiprofen alone significantly reduced airway responsiveness to <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> by 1. 1 doubling doses at both two and five hours. CONCLUSIONS [...] The generation of bronchoprotective prostaglandins is unlikely to underlie the inhibitory action of frusemide against airway responsiveness to <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite.</b> Endogenous contractile prostaglandins within the airways may be involved in the bronchoconstrictor response to <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite...</b>|$|E

In Experiment 1 two sorghum varieties (MP, JM) were evaluated and three sorghums (HP, Tiger, HFQ) in Experiment 2; the two experiments were separate but very similar. The five sorghums were extensively characterised and all five diets contained 620 g/kg sorghum and were formulated to be nutritionally equivalent. In both studies, each dietary treatment was offered to six replicate cages (6 birds per cage) for a combined total of 540 male Ross 308 chicks. The effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, apparent digestibility coefficients of starch and protein (N) and starch and protein digestive dynamics were determined. <b>Sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> significantly enhanced energy utilisation.

Actual experimental studies were conducted at the laboratories of the CSIR-Food Research Institute, Accra, Ghana, between August 2012 and November 2013. Methodology. We subjected peeled and unpeeled yam bean tubers (Pachyrhizus erosus) to three pretreatments involving blanching at 100 C for 3 min; soaking in 0. 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> solution for 3 min and no treatment control. Samples were dried at 55 C for 6 hours, cooled to room temperature, milled, sieved and the flour analyzed for ease of drying as indicated by the final moisture content, colour, pH, and ease of milling as indicated by particle size distribution. Results: The pretreatment methods had significant (p> 0. 05) effects on the colour of the flour samples. Peeling, followed by <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> pretreatment produced whitest yam bean flour (L-value of 90. 89).

40|$|Inhaled frusemide {{protects against}} the bronchoconstrictor {{response}} {{to a wide range}} of stimuli that cause bronchoconstriction by indirect mechanisms. One possible explanation for this protection relates to the known ability of frusemide to enhance synthesis of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Studies in vitro suggest that PGE 2 might protect against indirectly acting bronchoconstrictor challenges rather than those that act directly on airway smooth muscle, though little is known about the effects of PGE 2 in vivo. The effect of inhaled PGE 2 on the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> (a stimulus with an indirect action) and methacholine (which acts directly on airway smooth muscle) was studied in nine patients with asthma. Subjects were studied on four days, inhaling PGE 2 (100 micrograms) or placebo in a double blind fashion followed immediately by a cumulative dose challenge with <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> or methacholine. The response to the constrictor stimuli was measured as the provocative dose causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20). There was no significant change in FEV 1 after inhaled PGE 2 compared with placebo, nor any significant change in the response to methacholine; the geometric mean methacholine PD 20 was 0. 9 mumol after PGE 2 and 0. 56 mumol after placebo (mean difference 0. 7 (95 % confidence limits [...] 0. 1, 1. 5) doubling doses). PGE 2, however, protected against <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite,</b> the geometric mean <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> PD 20 being 11. 8 mumol after PGE 2 and 1. 8 mumol after placebo (mean difference 2. 5 (95 % CL 1. 9, 3. 1) doubling doses). PGE 2 conferred significantly greater protection against <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> than methacholine (mean difference 1. 8 (95 % CL 0. 8, 2. 8) doubling doses).

The effects of dietary treatments on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, protein (N) and starch digestibility coefficients and digestive dynamics were determined. A preliminary investigation into the effects of two treatments on concentrations of free amino acids and glucose in the portal circulation was conducted. There was significant feed grain by <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> interactions (P =  0. 03 to 0. 005) for parameters of nutrient utilisation (AME, ME:GE ratios, N retention, AMEn). For example, <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> inclusions in sorghum-based diets enhanced AME by 0. 18  MJ (12. 47 versus 12. 29  MJ/kg) but depressed AME by 0. 43  MJ (11. 88 versus 12. 31  MJ/kg) in wheat-based diets. There was a linear relationship between starch:protein disappearance rate ratios in the distal ileum with weight gain (r = − 0. 484; P =  0. 0012) indicating that condensed ratios (or absorption of more protein relative to starch) advantaged growth performance. Concentrations of free amino acids in the portal circulation or the post-enteral availability of certain amino acids, including the branched-chain amino acids, methionine, phenylalanine and threonine, were significantly correlated to FCR.

The effect of addition of selected chemicals such as acids (sulphuric and hydrochloric acids), bleaching and oxidising agents (<b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> and sodium hypochlorite) and alum during settling on the thermal and pasting properties of the cassava starch was examined. Treatment with sulphuric acid produced a noticeable increase in all DSC gelatinisation parameters, viz. onset gelatinisation temperature (T-o), temperature at peak minimum (T-p) and end temperature (T-e), with increasing concentration of acid, while only a marginal shift could be obtained even at higher concentration of hydrochloric acid.

40|$|Reverse osmosis {{membranes}} at many {{desalination plants}} are disinfected by periodic shock treatments with <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite,</b> which have potentially toxic effects {{to the environment}} for marine life, although no empirical and experimental evidence for this is yet available. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise for the first time, the physico-chemical modification of the marine environment and its biological effects, caused by hypersaline plumes during these membrane cleaning treatments. The case study was the Maspalomas II desalination plant, located in the south of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). Toxicity bioassays were performed on marine species characteristic for the infralittoral soft bottoms influenced by the brine plume (Synodus synodus and Cymodocea nodosa), and revealed a high sensitivity to short-term exposure to low <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> concentrations. The corrective measure of incorporating a diffusion system with Venturi Eductors reduced nearly all the areas of influence, virtually eliminating the impact of the disinfectant.

40|$|The {{effect of}} acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as {{membrane}} stabilizers was investigated on the kidney of experimental rats treated with sodium metabisulphi te. Administration of <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> {{has been shown}} to labilize the plasma membrane of some rat tissues. <b>Sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> (10 mg/kg b. wt) acetylsalicylic while both chemical substances of same dose were both chemicals were concurrently administered to three group o f rats for two weeks (14 days) while the fourth (4 th) group of rats served as control and were given physiological saline alone. Two ‘marker ’ enzymes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities were spectrophotometrically determined to monitor the efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid in membrane stabilization. Following the initial administration of metabisulphite alone, immediate significant decreases (p 0. 05). In acetylsalicylic acid administered rats the activities of ALP were higher than for the control group while the activities of ACP were not appreciably affected. The combined treatment gave values that were not significantly different from the control values (p <...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{dose-response}} model {{was used to}} investigate the susceptibility (NIC) and resistance (MIC) of the lactic acid bacteria and yeast populations with respect to five chemical preservatives (fumaric and pyruvic acids, cinnamaldehyde, <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> and natamycin) with potential application in table olives. Results were compared with respect to potassium sorbate, a well-known preservative habitually used in olive packaging. <b>Sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> was the most efficient preservative to control lactic acid bacteria growth (MIC, 50 ppm), followed by cinnamaldehyde (1060 ppm) while pyruvic acid required higher concentrations (3211 ppm). Natamycin (25 ppm) was highly efficient against yeasts, followed by cinnamaldehyde (125 ppm), potassium sorbate (553 ppm), <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> (772 ppm) and pyruvic acid (3038 ppm). Fumaric acid, in the range assayed (0 – 2000 ppm), did not show any inhibitory effect against these two microbial groups. This survey presents {{for the first time}} a comparative study of the efficiency of potential preservatives to control the growth of table olive related microorganisms. Further studies should be performed to validate their effects and interactions in the food matrix. The research leading to these results has received funding from INTERACEITUNA (Organización Interprofesional de la Aceituna de Mesa, Spain) and the Junta de Andalucía.

30|$|Some {{authors have}} {{attempted}} to investigate the mechanism of this local anaesthetic toxicity. Dragoo et al. (2010) suggested that this adverse effect {{could be due to}} the presence of epinephrine, the preservative <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> and the low pH of such solutions. Hennig et al.

40|$|Abstract Celery is a {{perishable}} {{horticultural product}} {{due to its}} high water content. This condition leads to a short durability of the celery, thus efforts to prolong its shelf life are required. This study aimed at studying the effects of immersion in <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> and drying temperature {{on the quality of}} dried celery leaves, and determining its shelf life using acceleration method based on critical moisture content approach. The results showed that soaking treatment using solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulphite</b> prior to drying process was able to maintain the dried celery leaves qualities, which resulted in higher chlorophyll content, lower apparent density, higher rehydration ratio, and higher VRS (volatile reducing substance) in comparison without soaking treatment. Moreover chlorophyll content, apparent density, volatile reducing substance (VRS), and rehydration behaviours were affected by the drying temperature. Shelf life of dried celery leaves based on critical moisture content approach represented in linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) plastic, polypropylene (PP), and aluminium foil oriented polypropylene (OPP) were 30, 51, and 790 days, respectively...|$|E
