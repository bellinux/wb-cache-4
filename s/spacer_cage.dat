Materials and Methods: All five patients with cervicothoracic caries spine had surgery through anterior cervical approach with manubriotomy in our hospital and underwent excision of the involved vertebrae and intervertebral discs followed by anterior spinal reconstruction with titanium <b>spacer</b> <b>cage</b> filled with cancellous iliac crest bone graft and Orion plate with locking screw. Antitubercular drugs were administered for 12 months. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 36 months. Results: Analysis of result was done on the basis of clinical and radiological criteria. Clinical assessment based on Frankel grade and modified JOA score showed significant improvement from preoperative findings. Radiological assessment showed osteointegration, no spinal instability and no progression of the deformity. The pain control, based on visual analog scale changed from a pre-operative average of 7. 5 to 2 at the last follow-up thereby indicating significant improvement and all patients returned to preoperative functional status.

40|$|Abstract: Background: The {{anterior}} cervical discectomy (ACD) {{is often}} used to treat spinal cord and nerve root compressions and the frequent use of interbody fusion (ACDF) has popularized it as a common practice associated or not with cages or plates for maintaining the intervertebral disc height. Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify the effectiveness of ACD compared with ACDF, with or without the use of anterior cervical <b>spacer</b> (<b>Cage)</b> or instrumentation with plate fixation (ACDFI). Methods: randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized trials were selected for analysis in one segmental level. The comparison criteria were the rates of success and failure with surgery (Odom’s ’ criteria), fusion rates and kyphosis rates. Electronic search was made in the MEDLINE database (Pubmed), in the Central Registry of randomized trials of Cochrane database and EMBASE. Results: Seven studies were selected for analysis. Conclusion: Implications for practice: There is moderate evidence that clinical results of ACD and ACDF are not significant different. There is moderate evidence that addition of intervertebral cage enhance clinical results. There is moderate evidence that anterior cervical plate does not change the clinical results of ACD. There is moderate evidence that ACD produce more segmental kyphosis than ACDF and ACDFI, with use of cage or plate. There is moderate evidence that ACD produce lower rate of fusion than ACDF and than the cages. There is limited evidence of the lower capacity of PMMA to produce fusion. There is limited evidence that fused patients have better outcome than non fused patients...|$|E

40|$|Symmetrical cage-annulated podands were {{synthesized}} via {{highly efficient}} synthetic strategies. Mechanisms {{to account for}} the key reaction steps in the syntheses are proposed; the proposed mechanisms receive support from the intermediates that have been isolated and characterized. An unusual complexation-promoted elimination reaction was studied, and a mechanism is proposed {{to account for the}} course of this reaction. This unusual elimination may generalized to other rigid systems and thus may extend our understanding of the role played by the host molecules in "cation-capture, anion-activation" via complexation with guest molecules. Thus, host-guest interaction serves not only to activate the anion but also may activate the leaving groups that participate in the complexation. Complexation-promoted elimination provides a convenient method to desymmetrize the cage while avoiding protection/deprotection steps. In addition, it offers a convenient method to prepare a chiral <b>cage</b> <b>spacer</b> by introducing 10 chiral centers into the host system in a single synthetic step. Cage-annulated monocyclic hosts that contain a cage-butylenoxy spacer were synthesized. Comparison of their metal ion complexation behavior as revealed by the results of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), alkali metal picrate extraction, and pseudohydroxide extraction with those displayed by the corresponding hosts that contain cage-ethylenoxy or cage-propylenoxy spacers reveals the effect of the length of the <b>cage</b> <b>spacer</b> upon the host-guest behavior. A series of cage-annulated cryptands, cavitands and the corresponding non-cage-annulated model compounds have been synthesized. These host molecules display unusual behavior when examined by using ESI-MS techniques, i. e., they bind selectively to smaller alkali metal ions (i. e., Li+ and Na+), a result that deviates significantly from expectations based solely upon consideration of the size-fit principle. It seems likely that this behavior results from the effect of the host topology on host-guest behavior. A series of non-cage-annulated cryptands also have been synthesized. These compounds can serve as starting materials for cavitand construction...|$|R
40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{recently}} attracts {{many applications}} in orthopaedics such as intervertebral <b>spacer,</b> spinal <b>cage</b> and prosthesis. However, literatures suggest {{this material is}} bio-inert in nature. Its inferior bioactivity may lead to poor bone-implant interaction. Some researchers incorporated hydroxyapatite or tri-calcium phosphate in PEEK to enhance its bioactivity. Mechanical properties such as elasticity and fatigue may, however, alter as material micro-structure has been changed. To avoid it, surface modification is therefore an alternative. This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of bioactivity enhancement of PEEK using an advance surface technique named plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). PEEK discs were polished and undertaken PIII treatment with plasma sources such as water, ammonia and strontium at 15 kV at 50 Hz for 2 hours. Afterwards, surface morphology, roughness, elemental chemical profile, chemical bonding and hydrophilicity were examined by SEM, AFM, XPS, FT-IR, and contact angle measurement respectively. Bioactivity was evaluated by simulated body fluid immersion test at day 21 and cytotoxicity was assessed by MC 3 T 3 E 1 cell culturing at day 2 and 5. The surface roughness slightly decreases after water and ammonium PIII, whereas it increases after strontium PIII. The surface contact angle of the treated samples reduces, but surface energy increases. Literatures suggested these changes favour cell attachment and proliferation. In our cell culture experiment, cells have attached more on the treated surfaces. All these results preliminarily demonstrate the feasibility of PIII treatment to enhance bioactivity of PEEK. Further study will focus on in vivo testing. The 24 th Triennial World Congress (SICOT/SIROT 2008), Hong Kong, China, 24 - 28 August 2008...|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{cervical}} discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is {{a standard}} surgical procedure for dege- nerative disc disease. Various materials for the intercorporal fusion have been developed and reviewed. Current studies report favorable clinical result {{for the use of}} Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants, although fusion seems to be significantly delayed, compared to data from e. g. titanium cages - suggesting a different biological type of ingrowth. In a prospective multicenter trial design, fusion and subsidence rates as well as clinical outcome in ACDF with a) standard PEEK-cages and b) identically designed tiPEEK-spacers with a partial titanium coating were investigated. We hypothesized improved fusion rates in the tiPEEK group while keeping the low subsidence rates of standard PEEK spacers. Material/Methods: Between 07 / 2009 and 07 / 2011 seventy-eight patients with single level degenerative disc disease were enrolled for single-level ACDF. 50 PEEK and 28 tiPEEK <b>spacers</b> (Shell <b>cage,</b> +/- titanium coating (50 - 150 microns) at their upper and lower contact surfaces; AMT/Medtronic) were implanted in stand-alone technique without additional plating. Radiological follow-up after 6, 12 and 18 months included conventional and functional X-ray. Clinical evaluation included VAS, NDI, Denis Pain Scale, JOA and Odom scores. Fusion was assessed using an established multimodal 7 -point grading score, differentiating ``solid fusion'', ``questionable fusion'', ``semirigid pseudarthrosis'' and ``non fusion''. Results: 78 patient records were finally evaluated after 18 months of follow-up (exclusion/lost for follow-up rate: 0 %). After 18 months, definitely solid fusion was seen in 84. 0 % of the PEEK implants and in 78. 5 % of the tiPEEK implants (respectively: 40. 0 % vs. 50. 0 % after 6 mo, and 72. 0 % vs. 75. 0 % after 12 mo). Mean subsidence rates were: PEEK = 1. 10 mm/ 6 mo vs. tiPEEK = 1. 18 mm/ 6 Mo, resp. 1. 38 mm/ 12 mo vs. 1. 39 mm/ 12 mo and 1. 76 mm/ 18 mo vs. 1. 57 mm/ 18 mo. Better fusion rates correlated significantly with lower subsidence rates (r = - 0. 35, p 60 yrs correlated with higher subsidence rates (r = 0. 24, p < 0. 05). All clinical scores improved gradually, showing no statistical significance between both groups (VAS p = 0. 687; Denis p = 0. 837; NDI p = 0. 850; Odom p = 0, 904). Good fusion rates correlated significantly with a good clinical outcome (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: PEEK is a semi-crystalline polyaromatic linear polymer with excellent biological inertness, radiolucency and an elastic modulus that comes close to those of mixed bone (3. 5 kN/mm 2) - resulting in only modest subsidence, what was not affected negatively by the ultra-thin titanium coating. There {{was no significant difference in}} the clinical outcome between both groups. However, rejecting our hypothesis, titanium coating at the bearing surface (PEEK/vertebra contact interface) did not result in any improvement neither in fusion pace nor rate. Our data suggest, that endplate/interface coating alone does not improve fusion. Biological immune response to the remaining uncovered PEEK at the lateral and inner cage surface may be a reason. Therefore, fully coated implants should be tested next...|$|R

The use of anterior plates in ACDF poses an increased risk of complications such as screw or plate dislodgement, soft tissue injury, esophagus perforation, and dysphagia. The ROI-C™ implant system consists of a zero-profile interbody fusion cage with self-locking plates designed for stand-alone fusion without external plates or screws. Objective: The purpose of this report is to describe the ROI-C™ implant system with VerteBRIDGE™ anchor plates, including indications for use, surgical technique, preclinical testing, and clinical study results. The objectives of the clinical study were to assess fusion status, incidence of dysphagia and other device-related complications, and patient reported outcomes. Methods: This was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of 110 patients who underwent ACDF with ROI-C at seven study centers. Patient charts and radiographs were reviewed for any complications or device malfunction. The final follow-up was conducted prospectively and included collection of neck disability index, and visual analog scale (VAS) neck and arm pain scores. Results: The mean operation time was 73 minutes, and mean blood loss was 25 mL (range 0 – 75 mL). Mean follow-up was 20. 7 months (range 9. 5 – 42. 2). Dysphagia was reported in two patients (1. 8 %), and 99. 1 % of patients achieved fusion. One patient had radiographically confirmed pseudarthrosis at 12 months that was asymptomatic and did not require surgery. One patient had subsequent surgery owing to adjacent level degeneration. The mean neck disability index, VAS neck pain, and VAS right and left arm pain scores at final follow-up were 19, 26. 5, 12. 5, and 15. 3, respectively. Conclusion: The ROI-C interbody cage with VerteBRIDGE anchor plates achieved a high rate of fusion, with a low incidence of dysphagia. These patients had similar or better outcomes compared to ACDF with anterior plating reported in peer-reviewed literature.
