It is proved that Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) is desirable in IEEE 802. 15. 4 WSN if SNR {{is to be}} maximized. Also it is proved that if packets marked noises are to be minimized then Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) at the PAN (Personal Area Network) Coordinator & GTS (Guaranteed Time <b>Slot)</b> <b>End</b> Device and MSK at the Non GTS End Device should be preferred. Furthermore it is proved that if PLR is to be reduced to minimum then MSK at the PAN Coordinator and BPSK at the End devices should be preferred. Overall there is trade-off {{for the use of}} modulation schemes in 802. 15. 4 WSNs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Circular cutters with uniform radial cracks are {{extensively}} used in {{the cutting}} processes. Unwanted noise, vibration & accidental failure associated with the cutting process have become an important economic and technological problem in the industry. The knowledge of natural frequencies of components is of great interest {{in the study of}} response of structures to various excitations. Hence, it is important to study a circular tile cutter with central hole, which fixed at inner edge and free at outer edge with its dynamic response. In this study some efforts are taken for analyzing vibration characteristics of tile cutter used in tile cutting industries with free boundary condition but having different (enlargement of stress concentration holes, <b>slot</b> <b>end</b> hole diameter,numbers of cutting teeth’s, aspect ratio, effect of number and length of cracks, variable radial slit, circular concentric slit, thickness). Results From the FEA and FFT it is found that, this study is needful for design data preparation to avoid resonance and vibration in tile cutting industries from which finding out natural frequency and vibration w. r. t. different changes in tile cutter. Thus Theoretical, ANSYS & FFT results obtained are to be compared...|$|E

Four {{different}} types of full-scale <b>slotted</b> <b>end</b> plate (SEP) connection joints are tested to determine their failure modes and damage mechanisms under ultimate load, also analyze their force-displacement behaviors and developing processes of deformation and stress. The results show that ultimate bearing capacity of the I-type SEP joint is only approximate 1 / 2 {{of the other three}} types of SEP joints, which indicate the SEP’s type have great influence on the ultimate strength of joints. The instability of SEP is the main factor to cause the loss of bearing capacity of the connection joints, which is shown through the development of stress, that SEP enters into plastic stage and the other regions still are elastic...|$|R

For this purpose, an experimental study {{was carried out}} using 7 specimens under quasi static symmetric reversed cyclic loading in tension and compression. Loading pattern was determined {{based on the results}} of a nonlinear dynamic time history analysis of a 3 story concentric braced frame under earthquake ground motions. This study observed that HSS specimens having a small w/t ratio experienced early fracture at the <b>slotted</b> <b>end.</b> It is noted that those specimens satisfied the requirement of w/t ratio for special concentric braced frames. To avoid this problem, this study proposed a design equation. The design equation was verified by additional experimental tests of two specimens designed according to the proposed design equation...|$|R

40|$|A compact-sized single-fed circularly {{polarized}} single-layered microstrip patch antenna at X-band is proposed. The antenna is a modified {{form of the}} previously developed E-shaped rectangular patch with two parallel unequal slots. For improving the impedance matching performance,the circular reformations are introduced {{on each of the}} <b>slot’s</b> <b>end.</b> The circles make the fields on the slots uniform without any tangible effect on the axial ratio. The antenna is designed on a thin ROGERS RT/DUROID 5880 (tm) substrate with dielectric constant (εr) of 2. 2 and thickness of 1. 6 mm. At the operating frequency of 10 GHz, the overall size of the antenna is 15. 43 mm x 8. 21 mm x 1. 6 mm.
