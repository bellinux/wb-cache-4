40|$|Palladium-catalyzed {{terminal}} alkyne dimerization, through oxidative homocoupling, is {{a useful}} approach to the synthesis of symmetrical 1, 4 -diynes. Recent investigations have suggested that this reaction might be accomplished {{in the absence of}} intentionally added stoichiometric oxidants (to reoxidize Pd(0) to Pd(II)). In this paper, we have fully addressed the question of whether oxygen (or added oxidant) is required to facilitate this process. The presence of a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> (or added oxidant such as L) is essential for alkyne dimerization. Excess PPh 3 inhibits alkyne dimerization to enyne, which only occurs to a significant extent when the reaction is starved of oxidant. Theoretical studies shed more light on the requirement for an oxidant in the homocoupling reaction in order for the process to be theromodynamically favorable. The employment Of 12 as the stoichiometric oxidant appears to be the method of choice. The dual role of Cu both in transmetalation of alkynyl units to Pd(II) and in assisting reoxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II) is suggested...|$|E
30|$|For example, to {{make use}} of coal or bunker oil in a cleaner and more {{economical}} way, gasification has been developed and used worldwide, which converts the solid fuel or the high viscose bunker oil into syngas and the organic sulfur in it to H 2 S [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The H 2 S gas is highly toxic and often converted into elemental sulfur through the process on an industrial scale, referred as the Claus process [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The acid gas stream, consisting mostly of hydrogen sulfide, together with a controlled <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> is then fed to a furnace so that one-third of the hydrogen sulfide is burned to sulfur dioxide. The hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide are next reacted together at elevated temperature in the gas phase to generate elemental sulfur and a tail gas [12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18]. The elemental sulfur is then recovered for sale or disposal and the tail gas either vented or subject to further treatment.|$|E
40|$|An energy {{flowmeter}} {{has been}} developed and a first prototype successfully tested at a natural gas desulfurization plant. This prototype directly measures the rate of energy delivered to a gas fired furnace without having to separately determine the volumetric flow rate and heating value of the gas. By replacing two measurements with one {{it is expected to}} lower the cost of the equipment required, increase reliability, and more accurately measure energy delivered. The energy flowmeter has two main components. The first component is a flow splitting device which splits the flow into a main stream and a sample stream. The unique requirement of the flow splitter is that the ratio of the two flows must be independent of the Reynolds number in the main stream. This has been achieved for a particular design. The second component burns the sample flow with a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air.</b> This stoichiometric flow is in direct proportion to the energy flow of gas in the main line. The report describes the design and laboratory testing of both of the components as well as their combined operation at a field test site. ...|$|E

40|$|On a {{previous}} contract, GRI 5081 - 271 - 0001, an energy flowmeter {{was developed and}} a first prototype successfully tested at a natural gas desulfurization plant. Under the present contract, the dynamic range of the flowmeter was increased and a commercial prototype was installed on an eight inch natural gas transmission line in series with an orifice meter run. Comparative data was obtained with an alternative method of measuring energy flow. This alternative method uses a flow computer with inputs from the orifice meter, a calorimeter, and a gravitometer. The energy flowmeter and flow computer tracked changes in energy flow within 0. 5 % of each other. The energy flowmeter contains two main components. The first component is a flow separator which splits the flow into a main stream and a sample stream in constant proportion to the main stream. The second component burns the sample flow with a <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air.</b> This stoichiometric flow is {{in direct proportion to}} the energy flow of gas in the main line. A method has been developed for laboratory testing of flow separators so that the ratio of main flow to sample flow can be accurately determined. Also a field prover apparatus has been developed which can calibrate energy flowmeters. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of results obtained above for methyl acetate case study can easily be extended for the class of reactions considered in the present study. While carrying out reactive-separation (single-stage/multi-stage), there are two factors playing opposing roles in achieving high conversion and high product purity. Based on condition (c) reported in “Process intensification schemes in batch mode”, part of the reactant also leaves along with the desired product as the first product cut, and therefore <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> reactants cannot result in 100  % conversion {{with respect to the}} reactants. The product obtained is a combination of the first and second azeotropes [from conditions (c) and (d) reported in “Process intensification schemes in batch mode”], and the product purity is expected to be in between the compositions of the two azeotropes. On the other hand, if the reactant constituting the first azeotrope is taken in excess, 100  % conversion can be achieved with respect to the limiting reactant. However, the product obtained is dominated by the first azeotrope, and therefore the product purity is lower compared to the case where <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> reactants are taken.|$|R

To determine whether platelet and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) functions require specific thresholds of kindlin- 3, we generated mouse strains expressing 50 %, 10 %, or 5 % of normal kindlin- 3 levels. We report that {{in contrast to}} kindlin- 3 -null mice, which die perinatally of severe bleeding and leukocyte adhesion deficiency, mice expressing as little as 5 % of kindlin- 3 were viable and protected from spontaneous bleeding and infections.
