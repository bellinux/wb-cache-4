40|$|This paper {{applies the}} theory of the quasi-likelihood method to model-based {{inference}} for <b>sample</b> <b>surveys.</b> Currently, much of the theory related to <b>sample</b> <b>surveys</b> is based on {{the theory of}} maximum likelihood. The maximum likelihood approach is available only when the full probability structure of the survey data is known. However, this knowledge is rarely available in practice. Based on central limit theory, statisticians are often willing to accept the assumption that data have, say, a normal probability structure. However, such an assumption may not be reasonable in many situations in which <b>sample</b> <b>surveys</b> are used. We establish a framework for <b>sample</b> <b>surveys</b> which is less dependent on the exact underlying probability structure using the quasi-likelihood method...|$|R

Of the countries studied by Maplecroft on sex trafficking and crime against minors, India was ranked 7th worst.|$|E

SOII provides little incident-level detail that can help to guide MVC prevention initiatives. Further, because SOII does not cover certain worker groups such as agricultural workers on farms with fewer than 11 employees and the self-employed, it undoubtedly underestimates the number of work-related MVCs and other events.|$|E
25|$|Though it is {{gradually}} increasing, the female literacy rate in India {{is less than}} the male literacy rate. Far fewer girls than boys are enrolled in school, and many girls drop out. In urban India, girls are nearly on a par with boys in terms of education. However, in rural India, girls continue to be less educated than boys. According to the National <b>Sample</b> <b>Survey</b> Data of 1997, only the states of Kerala and Mizoram have approached universal female literacy. According to scholars, the major factor behind improvements in the social and economic status of women in Kerala is literacy.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to complete roll-back {{of the proposed}} reservation, the striking protesters have demanded that an expert committee comprising members from non-political organisations to review the existing reservation policy and find out whether reservation for OBCs is required at all. This {{is based on the}} current confusion over actual population of OBC as various organisations have indicated various figures for the population of OBCs. This is mostly because the 1931 national census was the last time detailed population and economic data was gathered along with caste information for the OBC population. The Mandal Commission, using extrapolated 1931 Census figures, put it at 52 per cent, the National <b>Sample</b> <b>Survey</b> Organisation (NSSO) at 32 per cent and the National Family and Health Survey at 29.8 per cent. Keeping in view the fact that already 23.5% of all college seats are reserved for OBCs, the rationale of extending reservation is debated. The protesters also demand that no penal action be taken against the protesters and publication of a white paper by the government, making its stand clear on reservation.|$|E

500|$|The {{educational}} system prevailing in the state's schools {{is made up}} of 10 years, which are streamlined into lower primary, upper primary and secondary school stages with a 4+3+3 pattern. After 10 years of schooling, students typically enroll in Higher Secondary Schooling in one of the three major streams—liberal arts, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional under-graduate (UG) programmes. The majority of public schools are affiliated with the Kerala State Education Board. Other educational boards are the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), and the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most self-financing schools, while government and government-aided schools offer English or Malayalam. Though the cost of education is generally considered low in Kerala, according to the 61st round of the National <b>Sample</b> <b>Survey</b> (2004–2005), per capita spending on education by the rural households was reported to be [...] for Kerala, more than twice the national average. The survey also revealed that the rural-urban difference in household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India.|$|E
