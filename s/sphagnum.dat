5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various <b>sphagnum</b> mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed <b>sphagnum.</b> The <b>sphagnum</b> wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the <b>sphagnum</b> or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live <b>sphagnum</b> moss, <b>sphagnum</b> peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E
5|$|Tall {{and slender}} forms of Mycena polygramma {{somewhat}} resemble M.pullata or M.praelonga. The former species is distinguished by its color, {{and the latter}} by its relationship to M.alcalina and its habitat on <b>sphagnum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leccinum holopus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. It fruits on {{the ground}} (often among <b>Sphagnum</b> moss), singly to scattered in wet areas like cedar swamps, bogs, or soggy forests. Like most Leccinum species, the fungus is highly host-specific and associates with birch (Betula). In North America, the range of Leccinum holopus extends from eastern Canada to New York, extending west to the northern Rocky Mountains, roughly coinciding with {{the distribution of the}} paper birch (Betula papyrifera). In this range, it is common and fruits from August to October. L.holopus var. americanum is known only from North America. The fungus is rare in southern Europe, but more common in the <b>Sphagnum</b> swamps in the north. In Asia, it has been recorded from Taiwan and Qinghai (China).|$|E
5|$|Leccinum holopus, {{commonly}} known as the white birch bolete, white bog bolete, or ghost bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae found in northern Asia, Europe, and northeastern North America. It associates with birch trees and is typically found in boggy or swampy areas, often growing among <b>sphagnum</b> moss.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P.nigrella, {{but has a}} {{more deeply}} and {{persistently}} cup-shaped fruit body, a short but distinct stem, and only grows amongst <b>sphagnum</b> moss. Plectania melastoma has elliptical to spindle-shaped spores measuring 20–28 by 8–12µm, while P.milleri has elliptical spores, and the margin of its cups have star-shaped points.|$|E
5|$|The park hosts a {{wide range}} of upland and wetland vegetation. Algae and {{intertidal}} plants {{can be found at the}} shore including salt meadow grass, sedge, and <b>sphagnum</b> moss; the park's swampy areas have red maple and tulip trees; the upland sections include cherry, hickory, and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, <b>sphagnum</b> moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. <b>Sphagnum</b> moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|Other species within Mutabiles include X.campanelloides, {{which can}} be {{differentiated}} by {{the shape of the}} thin-walled caulocystidia and yellow flesh in the stem. X.cornui grows in softwood forests with <b>Sphagnum</b> moss. Both the cap and the top of stem sport yellow grains. X.fraxinophila produces larger mushrooms and has yellow gills. X.parvibulbosa, while potentially featuring similar caulocystidia to X.setulipes, has a bitter or sour taste.|$|E
5|$|Pure long-fibre <b>Sphagnum</b> moss is an {{excellent}} potting medium, though combinations involving {{any of the following}} – peat, perlite, vermiculite, sand, lava rock, pumice, Osmunda fibre, orchid bark and horticultural charcoal – may be used with equal success. The potting medium should be well-drained and not too compacted. Moss is useful for moisture retention near the roots. The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, <b>sphagnum</b> and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus <b>Sphagnum,</b> and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and <b>Sphagnum</b> angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of <b>sphagnum</b> mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|Sundews {{generally}} grow in seasonally moist or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic soils {{and high levels}} of sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species grow in association with <b>sphagnum</b> moss, which absorbs much of the soil's nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} {{is typical of the}} Outer Hebrides with heather, <b>sphagnum</b> moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff {{overlooking}} Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow (Salix). Precise favoured species are unclear; {{at least one of}} the tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) or the dark-leaved willow (S.myrsinifolia) is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the bay willow (S.pentandra), the grey willow (S.cinnerea), the grey alder (Alnus incana) and species of birch (Betula). I.saliceticola is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from detritus or amongst moss, such as the heart-leaved spear-moss (Calliergon cordifolium), the spiky-bog moss (<b>Sphagnum</b> squarrosum) and species of Mnium. They are typically near plants such as the tufted loosestrife (Lysimachia thyrsiflora), the creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), the common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), the purple marshlocks (Comarum palustre) and the purple small-reed (Calamagrostis canescens), and share the habitat with other Inocybe, including I.acuta and I.laceravar.helobia.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, <b>sphagnum,</b> {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E
5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; <b>Sphagnum</b> balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included English oak (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of ground vegetation included creeping soft grass (Holcus mollis), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (Typha latifolia).|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{is fairly}} common, {{and can be}} found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn, often among <b>Sphagnum</b> moss. Though it {{strongly}} favours beech, it has also been found under oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with the trees under which it grows. It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces; specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs. These are typically smaller specimens, and it is possible that they represent a dwarf variety. Despite growing on rotting wood, the species is not saprotrophic; instead, the mycelia of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood. This is a particularly useful adaptation when the soil is either wet or nutrient-poor. Mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers, but they can also be found growing in tight clumps, or solitarily when growing out of season. The species can be found in Europe, with collections in Scandinavia, the British Isles Bulgaria, Germany, and northern Turkey; in North America, it has been recorded as common in Canada and both the northern and southern United States; in northern Asia, it was found in regions near both the Oka River and the central Angara River in Siberia; and in eastern Asia, it has been collected in China.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> sect. <b>Sphagnum</b> {{plants have}} the largest gametophytes among the sections, forming large hummocks, their leaves form cuculate (hood-shaped) apices, and are green, except for <b>Sphagnum</b> magellanicum Example: <b>Sphagnum</b> austinii.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> sect. Acutifolia plants {{generally}} form hummocks {{above the}} water line, usually colored orange or red. Examples: <b>Sphagnum</b> fuscum and <b>Sphagnum</b> warnstorfii.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> sect. Cuspidata {{plants are}} usually found in hollows, lawns, or are aquatic, and are green. Examples: <b>Sphagnum</b> cuspidatum and <b>Sphagnum</b> flexuosum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> sect. Subsecunda plants vary {{in color}} from green to yellow and orange (but never red), and {{are found in}} hollows, lawns, or are aquatic. Species always with {{unisexual}} gametophytes. Examples: <b>Sphagnum</b> lescurii and <b>Sphagnum</b> pylaesii.|$|E
25|$|The {{reciprocal}} monophyly {{of these}} sections {{and two other}} minor ones (Rigida and Squarrosa) has been clarified using molecular phylogenetics. All but two species normally identified as <b>Sphagnum</b> reside in one clade; two other species have recently been separated into new families within the Sphagnales reflecting an ancestral relationship with the Tasmanian endemic Ambuchanania and long phylogenetic distance {{to the rest of}} <b>Sphagnum.</b> Within main clade of <b>Sphagnum,</b> phylogenetic distance is relatively short, and molecular dating methods suggest nearly all current <b>Sphagnum</b> species are descended from a radiation that occurred just 14 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Carnivorous plants require {{appropriate}} nutrient-poor soil. Most {{appreciate a}} 3:1 mixture of <b>Sphagnum</b> peat to sharp horticultural sand (coir is an acceptable, and more ecofriendly substitute for peat). Nepenthes will grow in orchid compost or in pure <b>Sphagnum</b> moss.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} peat moss. Accumulations of <b>Sphagnum</b> can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as <b>sphagnum</b> moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. <b>Sphagnum</b> and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of <b>Sphagnum</b> have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different <b>Sphagnum</b> species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> is {{also used}} in air layering, a method of {{propagation}} used to propagate woody stems like guavas. A ball of <b>Sphagnum</b> is tied against a midway ringed bark of a branch still attached on the parent plant using a translucent plastic material (vitalon).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> moss is also of {{economic}} importance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum,</b> {{like all}} other land plants, has an {{alternation}} of generations; like other bryophytes, the haploid gametophyte generation is dominant and persistent. Unlike other mosses, the long-lived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake. <b>Sphagnum</b> species can be unisexual (male or female, dioecious) or bisexual (male and female gametes produced from the same plant; monoecious); In North America, 80% of <b>Sphagnum</b> species are unisexual. Gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation, producing much of the living material in <b>sphagnum</b> peatlands. Swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female gametophyte. The sporophyte is relatively short-lived, and consists almost entirely of a shiny green, spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores. Sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal, but unlike other mosses, <b>Sphagnum</b> stalks are produced by the maternal gametophyte. Tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the sporophyte by meiosis, which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap, called an operculum, and shoots the spores some distance. The spores germinate to produce minute protonemae, which start as filaments, can become thalloid, and can produce a few rhizoids. Soon afterwards the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic, erect, leafy, branched gametophyte with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells. This stage dominates the environment where <b>Sphagnum</b> grows, obliterating and burying the protonema and eventually building up into layers of dead moss called peat. Carpets of living <b>Sphagnum</b> may be attacked by various fungi, and one fungus that is also a mushroom, Sphagnurus paluster, produces conspicuous dead patches. When this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema, <b>Sphagnum</b> is induced to produce non-photosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes. It is unknown whether the leafy stage can produce such gemmae.|$|E
25|$|Dried <b>sphagnum</b> moss is {{also used}} in {{northern}} Arctic regions as an insulating material.|$|E
25|$|More <b>sphagnum</b> {{appears in}} wet periods. Dry periods feature more tree stumps, of birch and pine.|$|E
25|$|Other {{industries}} are the manufacturing {{and sales of}} greenstone jewellery, <b>sphagnum</b> moss gathering and stone-collection for garden landscaping.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{pitchers}} of {{this species}} are often embedded in thick <b>Sphagnum</b> moss, allowing them to trap small terrestrial animals such as snails.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sphagnum</b> mosses occur {{mainly in}} the Northern Hemisphere in peat bogs, conifer forests and moist tundra areas. Their northernmost populations lie in the {{archipelago}} of Svalbard, Arctic Norway at 81° N.|$|E
