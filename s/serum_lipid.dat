40|$|Approximately {{one half}} of {{patients}} who undergo antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection {{do not respond to}} treatment. African Americans (AAs) are less responsive to treatment than Caucasian Americans (CAs), but the reasons for this disparity are largely unknown. Recent studies suggest that <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> may be associated with treatment response. The aims of this study were to evaluate baseline and changes in <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> during therapy, determine whether <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> are associated with virological response, and assess whether these measures explain the racial difference in efficacy. The study participants were from Virahep-C, a prospective study of treatment-naÏve patients with genotype 1 HCV infection who received peginterferon (PEG-IN) alfa- 2 a plus ribavirin therapy for up to 48 weeks. Fasting <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> were analyzed at baseline and during and after therapy in 160 AAs and 170 CAs. A relative risk (RR) model was employed to evaluate characteristics associated with sustained virological response (SVR). Antiviral therapy was associated with changes in <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> during and after antiviral therapy, with the changes differing by race and the amount of PEG-IFN taken. Baseline lipid measures independently associated with higher rates of SVR were lower triglyceride and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with an interaction between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and gender. Lipid measures did not contribute significantly to an explanation of the racial difference in SVR. Conclusion: <b>Serum</b> <b>lipids</b> are associated with SVR, although these paramaters did not explain the racial difference in treatment response.
