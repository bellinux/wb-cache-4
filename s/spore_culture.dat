During the last 30  years, mushroom productivity has increased substantially {{as a result of}} improved composting techniques and optimized environmental conditions, {{and to a lesser extent}} by breeding efforts. The first hybrid cultivar Horst U 1 (Fritsche 1981), was released in the 1980 s. Subsequent new varieties were identical or very similar to this first hybrid indicating that these were all varieties derived from the first hybrid line (Sonnenberg et al. 2005, 2016). Mushroom breeding has been so far an applied science and new varieties have been generated mainly modifying existing varieties by selecting fertile single <b>spore</b> <b>cultures</b> or by generating multi <b>spore</b> <b>cultures.</b> Generating new varieties with sufficient qualities by outbreeding appears to be a difficult task (personal communications with spawn companies and personal experiences). No elite stocks are available for mushroom breeders, which means that for the introduction of new traits wild germplasm has to be used. Since knowledge on the genetic base of most traits is unknown, the use of wild lines leads to a long breeding program with uncertain outcomes.|$|R

Many species of Termitomyces frequently form fruit bodies, which develop from the fungus comb within the nest. In this study, we determined the mating system of a species of Termitomyces associated with the South African termite Macrotermes natalensis. Termite nests were excavated and a Termitomyces sp. was isolated into pure culture from the asexual fruit bodies (nodules) growing in the fungus gardens. For one strain, single basidiospore cultures were obtained from basidiomes growing from the fungus comb after incubation without termites. Using nuclear staining, we show that both comb <b>cultures</b> and single <b>spore</b> <b>cultures</b> have multinucleate cells and {{that the majority of}} spores has a single nucleus. However, DNA sequencing of the ITS region in the nuclear RNA gene revealed that the comb mycelium had two different ITS types that segregated in the single <b>spore</b> <b>cultures,</b> which consequently had only a single ITS type.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{differentiation}} of the gametophyte and sporophyte of Pteridophyta, conducted through the culture, on nutritive media, of the green, incompletely differentiated sporangia and spores, exhibits {{a variety of}} peculiarities. Whereas {{in the case of}} the <b>spore</b> <b>culture,</b> a single prothallus is usually obtained out of the spore, {{in the case of the}} green sporangia (sori) culture, a group (colony) is obtained out of a single explant, a group which is made up of numerous prothalli. The agarized medium ensures a much better physical support for forming larger colonies. The secondary gametophytes can be formed through: the branching out of the prothallic filaments (each ramification representing the intial stage for the development of a new prothallus); the elongation of the cells in the apical area of the gametophyte, (which represent the initial cells of the new prothalli); out of the cells located in the base area of the prothalli, (cells which also function as prothalian initial); out of ramifications of the prothalli. The formation of the sporophyte may be the result of amphimixis, e. g. in Cystopteris fragilis, or of apomixis (apogamy) in Cyrtomium falcatum and Phegopteris connectilis. In the amphimixic species, the embryo is formed after three months from the culture initiation. What is characteristic of the apogamous species is the presence of the tracheides in the gametophyte, and the absence of the root in the first stages of development. The culture of green sporangia on agarized media is recommended, due to the fact that a very large number of gametophytes, and subsequently little plants, are formed. </p...|$|E

All the Petri-dishes were autoclaved for 15 minutes and allowed to cool before sowing sterilized spores in three replicates and maintained at pH 5. 80 and 23 ± 2 °C with cool fluorescent white light in the incubator. Spores imbibed water from the nutrient, ruptured and germination started six days after sowing with emergence of colourless, uniseriate, elongated filamentous rhizoid. Prothallial cell which was green in colour started growing perpendicularly to the rhizoid. The germination rate was scored at an interval of four days for thirty days. Various stages of growth recorded include filamentous, spatulate, prothallus and two leaved fernlets. The heart-shaped gametophyte developed between 27 - 60 days with 12 - 16 rhizoids, archegonia and antheridia.

40|$|There {{are four}} types of life cycles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its related species. A perfect {{homothallic}} life cycle (the Ho type) is observed in the classic D strain. Two other types show semi-homothallism; one of them shows a 2 -homothallic diploid: 2 α heterothallic haploid segregation (the Hp type) and another, a 2 -homothallic: 2 a segregation (the Hq type). In the segregants from these Ho, Hp, and Hq diploids, each homothallic segregant shows the same segregation pattern as its parental diploid. The fourth type has a heterothallic life cycle showing a 2 a: 2 α segregation and the diploids are produced by the fusion of two haploid cells of opposite mating types. The diploids prepared by the crosses of α Hp (an α haploid segregant from the Hp diploid) to a Hq (an a haploid from the Hq diploid) segregated two types (Type I and II) of the Ho type homothallic clone among their meiotic segregants. Genetic analyses were performed to investigate this phenomenon and the genotypes of the Ho type homothallic clones of Type I and Type II. Results of these genetic analyses have been most adequately explained by postulating three kinds of homothallic genes, each consisting of {{a single pair of}} alleles, HO/ho, HMα/hmα, and HMa/hma, respectively. One of them, the HMα locus, was proved to be loosely linked (64 stranes) to the mating-type locus.

40|$|Biosurfactants enhance {{hydrocarbon}} biodegradation {{by increasing}} apparent aqueous solubility or affecting {{the association of}} the cell with poorly soluble hydrocarbon. Here, we show that a lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by Bacillus mojavensis strain JF- 2 mobilized substantial amounts of residual hydrocarbon from sand-packed columns when a viscosifying agent and a low molecular weight alcohol were present. The amount of residual hydrocarbon mobilized depended on the biosurfactant concentration. One pore volume of cell-free culture fluid with 900 mg/l of the biosurfactant, 10 mM 2, 3 -butanediol and 1000 mg/l of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polymer mobilized 82 % of the residual hydrocarbon. Consistent with the high residual oil recoveries, {{we found that the}} bio-surfactant lowered the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water by nearly 2 orders of magnitude compared to typical IFT values of 28 - 29 mN/m. Increasing the salinity increased the IFT with or without 2, 3 -butanediol present. The lowest interfacial tension observed was 0. 1 mN/m. The lipopeptide biosurfactant system may be effective in removing hydrocarbon contamination sources in soils and aquifers and for the recovery of entrapped oil from low production oil reservoirs. Previously, we reported that Proteose peptone was necessary for anaerobic growth and biosurfactant production by B. mojavensis JF- 2. The data gathered from crude purification of the growth-enhancing factor in Proteose peptone suggested that it consisted of nucleic acids; however, nucleic acid bases, nucleotides or nucleosides did not replace the requirement for Proteose Peptone. Further studies revealed that salmon sperm DNA, herring sperm DNA, Echerichia coli DNA and synthetic DNA replaced the requirement for Proteose peptone. In addition to DNA, amino acids and nitrate were required for anaerobic growth and vitamins further improved growth. We now have a defined medium {{that can be used to}} manipulate growth and biosurfactant production. As an initial step in the search for a better biosurfactant-producing microorganism, 157 bacterial strains were screened for biosurfactant production under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A hundred and forty seven strains produced either equal or higher amounts of biosurfactant compared to B. mojavensis JF- 2 and the 10 best strains were chosen for further study. In an attempt to increase biosurfactant production, a genetic recombination experiment was conducted by mixing germinating spores of four of the best strains with B. mojavensis JF- 2. Biosurfactant production was higher with the mixed <b>spore</b> <b>culture</b> than in the cocultures containing B. mojavensis JF- 2 and each of the other 4 strains or in a mixed culture containing all five strains that had not undergone genetic exchange. Four isolates were obtained from the mixed spores culture that gave higher biosurfactant production than any of the original strains. Repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction analysis showed differences in the band pattern for these strains compared to the parent strains, suggesting the occurrence of genetic recombination.

Deterioration of soil fertility lowers the biological activity and results in lower productivity. In the absence of adequate organic matter, the processes of conversion of nutrients to plant-available forms and their retention are very low. To enhance the activity of soil organisms especially that of beneficial microbial populations, the addition of high quality organic amendments is very important. Even though {{there are plenty of}} organic materials available in tea lands, there is inadequate information on their suitability and influence on the biological properties of soils. The present research has attempted {{to determine the extent to}} which the microbial activity and productivity of tea soils in Australia and Sri Lanka can be manipulated by use of readily available soil amendments. Trials were conducted using grass and leguminous mulching materials with different C/N ratios, in combination with two pH amendments (dolomite and ‘MinplusTM’ – a finely ground volcanic rock dust - both applied at rates of 2500 kg ha- 1 only for the pot trials and 1000 kg ha- 1 for the other trials) and an inoculum of biologically active rain forest soil. The nursery stage of tea (Camellia sinensis) propagation was studied in a shadehouse at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia, and young tea (unpruned, 1 year after planting) and mature tea (pruned bushes, 5 years since planting) were studied in a field in Sri Lanka. In the nursery trial, mulching materials consisting of finely chopped Brachiaria decumbens (a grass), Calliandra calothyrsus (a legume), and tea prunings were applied at a rate of 35 tonnes fresh weight ha- 1 year- 1 to pots with or without tea seedlings. The grass mulch with Minplus improved soil organic carbon, CEC, soil pH, microbial biomass carbon, plant available phosphorus, and total nitrogen contents of the soil and enhanced the growth of plants when compared to the effects of Calliandra legume and tea mulch. All the combinations of mulches with dolomite reduced plant growth even though they enhanced some soil properties. Application of grass and legume mulches increased the beneficial population of gram positive bacteria, fungi, and mycorrhiza. Grass mulch also improved the growth of tea as measured by shoot weight and total biomass. The addition of a rainforest inoculum to the soils of the nursery tea plants increased the soil microbial biomass carbon and growth of tea plants even in the absence of any mulch. The field trials in Sri Lanka demonstrated the extent of the changes induced by mulches and soil pH modifiers in soil microbial properties, including the abundances of functional groups of microbes (bacteria, fungi, mycorrhizae), soil microbial biomass carbon, and microbial respiration. In addition organic carbon, soil pH, nitrogen and mulch decomposition rate were measured. The mulching materials tested were: refuse tea (25 tonnes ha- 1 year- 1), Mana grass (Cymbopogon confertiflora), and branches of Dadap (Erythrina lithosperma), a leguminous tree (35 tonnes fresh weight ha- 1 year- 1). In addition to these treatments, lemon grass (Cymbopogan nardus) 20, 000 plants ha- 1 as live mulch in young tea and a Trichoderma fungal culture in the mature tea were used. For young tea and mature tea, Mana and Dadap were applied four times and Refuse tea three times per study period and the lemon grass was planted at the start of the trial on a 15 x 15 cm spacing in the young tea; Trichoderma was applied once to the mature tea trial at a rate of 500 g of <b>spore</b> <b>culture</b> / plant. The results indicated that Dadap and Refuse tea raised the yield of tea significantly by 16...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpores {{features}} of most fungal species are of prime {{importance in the}} process of their identification. These spores could also be used for numerous other studies including fungal genetics, reproduction and molecular biology. Studies involving single <b>spore</b> <b>cultures</b> are numerous in various domains of mycology and these isolated spores could be obtained at best only from spore-prints. These spore prints are most often produced by sporocarps of most Agaricales on field and also in the laboratory after collection. In contrary, Ganoderma in general including G. resinaceum produce spore-prints only on field and for a limited period of time not covering all their life span. These spore-prints could therefore be collected only on the field during a well defined period. The correlation equation Y = a+bX between size of sporocarps and time of growth now renders possible the forecast of the period of spore-prints production by sporocarps of G. resinaceum on natural substrate, thereby enabling collection of these spores at the best time on field for various mycological investigations...|$|R

Seventy-two DNA clones containing microsatellite repeats were isolated and sequenced {{in order to}} develop a series of new PCR-based molecular markers to be used in genetic studies of the fungus. Twenty-four of these clones were selected to design primer pairs for the PCR amplification of microsatellite alleles. Single <b>spore</b> <b>cultures</b> of M. grisea isolated from rice and wheat in Brazil, Colombia and China were genotyped at three microsatellite loci. Isolates from southern Brazil were predominantly monomorphic at the tested SSR loci, indicating a low level of genetic variability in these samples. However, seven alleles were observed at the MGM- 1 locus in isolates from Central Brazil and at least nine alleles were detected at the same locus in a sample of Colombian isolates. Polymorphism analysis at SSR loci is a simple and direct approach for estimating the genetic diversity of M. grisea isolates and a powerful tool for studying M. grisea genetics...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{information}} about seaweed culture in Colombia,culture essays of the red seaweed Hypnea musciformis were implemented in the natural habitat of the species. The study was carried out between February and June 2006 in the coastal area of Santa Marta,Colombian Caribbean. Culture essays were developed using olypropylene hanging bags suspended on a line at sea surface, taking into consideration: site (Taganga and Puerto Luz), season (long dry and short rainy transition) and culture time (seven and fifteen days). The total mean daily growth rate (DGR) was 2. 66 %. No {{significant differences were found between}} essays; however, the best results were obtained in Taganga during the dry season from seven-day yields. A carrageenan content of 44 - 48 % dry weight was obtained from the cultures. Although these results suggest that H. musciformis can be a viable natural resource for cultivation in the Santa Marta area, this species produced low biomass with the culture method used.

40|$|True {{breeding}} of button mushrooms has hardly {{been done in}} the last decades, despite this species being one of the most cultivated mushrooms worldwide. Research done in the last 20 years has identified and characterised new germplasm and improved our understanding of the genetic base for some traits. A substantial collection of wild-collected strains is now available and partly characterised for a number of important traits such as disease resistance and yield. Most of the variations found in a number of important agronomic traits have a considerable heritability and are thus useful for breeding. Genetic marker technology has also developed considerably for this mushrooms in the last decade and used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for important agronomic traits. This progress has, except for one example, not resulted so far into new commercially varieties. One of the reasons lies in the typical life cycle of the button mushroom Agaricus bisporus var. bisporus which hampers breeding. Joint investment is needed to solve technical problems in breeding. Special attention is needed for the protection of new varieties. Due to its typical life cycle, it is very easy to generate so called “look-a-likes” from protected cultivars by screening fertile single <b>spore</b> <b>cultures.</b> A consensus has been reached within the mushroom (breeding) industry to consider this method as the generation of essentially derived varieties as defined in plant breeding...|$|R
