2500|$|The Exorcist {{was also}} {{at the center of}} {{controversy}} due to its alleged use of subliminal imagery introduced as special effects during the production of the film. Wilson Bryan Key wrote a whole chapter on the film in his book Media Sexploitation alleging repeated use of subliminal and semi-subliminal imagery and sound effects. Key observed the use of the Pazuzu face (in which Key mistakenly assumed it was Jason Miller made up in a death mask makeup, when it was actress Eileen Dietz) and claimed that the <b>safety</b> <b>padding</b> on the bedposts were shaped to cast phallic shadows on the wall and that a skull face is superimposed into one of Father Merrin's breath clouds. Key also wrote much about the sound design, identifying the use of pig squeals, for instance, and elaborating on his opinion of the subliminal intent of it all.

40|$|The {{question}} is whether the urethral sphincter may be reconstructed after longitudinal injury similar to anal sphincter injuries. Analogue to obstetric, anal sphincter repair, an approximation repair of the sphincter may be feasible. An overlap repair is possible in anal sphincter repair, but because of the little tissue available in the urethral sphincter this is not an option. We describe three cases of urethral sphincter injury of different aetiologies. All resulted in a total longitudinal disruption of the muscular components of the urethral sphincter complex. After making the diagnosis of urethral sphincter injury, a primary approximation repair was done.

Methods: This prospective, observational study utilized 15 Olympic style fighters from an “elite ” team kicking a water core heavy bag thorax model with roundhouse kicks. The model was fitted with a tri-axial accelerometer (GCDC, model X 250 - 2) to measure g acceleration from strikes to the bag. The bag was kicked in three, 10 kick phases by all subjects: kicks without padding; kicks with hogu on heavy bag, and kicks with hogu and instep guards on feet. The g acceleration readings were recorded in all phases. Results: Kolmogorov-Smirnov failed for all variables. There were 8 female subjects: median age 14 years, median weight 53. 4 kg and 7 male subjects: median age 17 years, median weight 70. 45 kg. The ANOVA on ranks of the acceleration from kicks against the bag achieved significance, P≤ 0. 001.

40|$|Purpose To report our {{intermediate}} {{experience in}} treating patients with severe incontinence using an adjustable perineal male sling with a tissue expander. Materials and Methods An adjustable male sling procedure {{was performed on}} 21 patients with severe incontinence. The underlying etiology of urinary incontinence was radical prostatectomy in 13 patients, open prostatectomy in 5 patients and transurethral prostate resection in 3 patients. The difference between the classical and the adjustable sling {{is that in the}} latter there is a 25 mL tissue expander between the two layers of polypropylene mesh with an injection port. Adjustment of the sling was performed with saline via an inflation port, in case of recurrence or persistence of incontinence. Results The mean age of the patients was 66. 2 &# 177; 7. 3 (50 - 79) years and mean pad usage was 6. 4 &# 177; 0. 6 per day. The mean follow-up time was 40. 1 &# 177; 23. 2 (6 - 74) months. The balloon was postoperatively inflated on average with 11. 6 &# 177; 5. 7 (5 - 25) mL. After the mean 40. 1 months of follow-up, 16 of the 21 patients (76. 2 %) were dry (11 patients, 0 pads; 5 patients using <b>safety</b> <b>pads),</b> 3 patients (14 %) had mild and 2 (9. 8 %) had moderate degree post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI).

In 2 patients, all parts of the device were removed due to infection and discomfort, and in 3 patients only the inflation component was removed due to local scrotal infection.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{usefulness}} of posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction (PR) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has still been controversial. We investigated {{the association of}} several factors, including the Rocco original double-layered PR, with early recovery of urinary continence after RARP. Patients and Methods: Between August 2006 and April 2011, a single surgeon at Tokyo Medical University Hospital performed 206 RARPs. Of these 206 patients, 199 eligible patients were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively analyzed the correlation of several perioperative factors, including surgical techniques, with early recovery of urinary continence 1 month after catheter removal. Continence was defined as no use {{or the use of}} only one <b>safety</b> <b>pad.</b> Results: Univariate analysis showed that surgeon experience, lateral approach of bladder neck preservation, bladder neck reconstruction, anterior reconstruction, and the Rocco double-layered PR were significantly associated with early recovery of urinary continence 1 month after catheter removal. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, body mass index, and attempted nerve-sparing (NS) procedures, however, were not significantly associated with early recovery of urinary continence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the Rocco PR and attempted NS were the only independent predictive factors of urinary continence recovery 1 month after catheter removal (odds ratio [OR], 15. 01; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 413 - 66. 67; P = 0. 0003 and OR, 2. 248; 95 % CI, 1. 048 - 4. 975; P = 0. 0402, respectively). When we applied NS as well as the Rocco PR, the recovery rates of continence at 1 month after catheter removal was 85. 3 %. Conclusions: The Rocco double-layered PR and attempted NS and not surgeon experience were the significant independent predictive factors of early recovery of urinary continence after RARP. NS procedures positively influenced early recovery of urinary continence only when they were applied with the PR technique...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: To assess patient {{satisfaction}} {{and quality of}} life and factors that may be related to these outcomes. Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2008 a retrospective chart review and telephone survey of all surgeries for male SUI was performed. Average age at times of operation was 69. 4 ± 7. 4 (median 69). As part of the survey 270 of 365 patients were available (response rate: 74 %). The average follow up time (from operation to telephone survey) was 34. 8 ± 22. 8 months (median 32). Results: Pad use per day improved significantly after operation from 6. 23 ± 5. 3 to 1. 61 ± 2. 92 pads/day (p= 0. 001). 74. 7 % (n= 198) declared to be continent with one <b>safety</b> <b>pad</b> and 87. 7 % (n= 236) confirmed the postoperative improvement of incontinence. 189 (70. 5 %) patients were &# 8220;very satisfied&# 8221; and &# 8220;satisfied&# 8221;. In 81 % (n= 218) the expectation in operation could be met, therefore 84. 3 % (n= 226) would undergo it again and 90. 3 % (n= 243) would recommend it to others. Lower age (rs= 0. 211), few postoperative pads per day (rs= 0. 58), high reduction of pads (rs=- 0. 35) and physical activity level (rs= 0. 2) correlate significantly with better satisfaction. Conclusions: Eighty-seven pint seven percent (87. 7 %) of our incontinence operations (n= 236) lead to an improvement, which is independent from the number of prior incontinence operations and preoperative pad count. The postoperative quality of life remains constant over the observed follow up time. Certain subgroups of patients (younger age, high physical activity level, large reduction of pads) demonstrated superior satisfaction rates...|$|R
