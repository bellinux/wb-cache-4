The U.S. <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential {{election}}. While {{the election}} was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet. According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> <b>and</b> tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E

She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley {{reported}} to Congress that efforts at diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress declared war. By this time, McKinley {{had begun to}} rely on Assistant Secretary of State William R. Day for day-to-day management of the <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> <b>and</b> was even inviting him to cabinet meetings, as Sherman had stopped attending them. Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as the real power in the State Department. Sherman, sensing {{that he was being}} made a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} search {{failed to find}} any links to the Soviet Union, the CIA decided to extend the operation, and on 4 August a much larger team was deployed, with members from many {{government}} departments, including the <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> the USIA. The task force was given the cover name Social Research Group. To avoid confrontation with Guatemalan nationalists, the CIA opted to leave the documents in Guatemalan possession, instead funding {{the creation of a}} Guatemalan intelligence agency that would try to dismantle the communist organizations. Thus the National Committee of Defense Against Communism (Comité de Defensa Nacional Contra el Comunismo) was created on 20 July, and granted a great deal of power over military and police functions. The personnel of the new agency were also put to work analyzing the same documents. The document-processing phase of the operation was terminated on 28 September 1954, having examined 500,000 documents. There was tension between the different U.S. government agencies about using the information; the CIA wished to use it to subvert communists, the USIA for propaganda. The CIA's leadership of the operation allowed it to retain control over any documents deemed necessary for clandestine operations. A consequence of PBHISTORY was the opening of a CIA file on Argentine communist Ernesto Che Guevara.|$|E

Matlock was back in Moscow in 1974, serving in the number two position in the embassy for four years. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in early 1980 ended the period of reduced tensions. Matlock was assigned to Moscow again in 1981 as acting ambassador during the first part of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Reagan appointed him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later asked him to return to Washington in 1983 to work at the National Security Council, with the assignment to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, arms negotiations and summit meetings resumed. Matlock was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1987 and saw the last years of the Soviet Union before he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions in the <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree on the foreign policy questions of the day.|$|E
5|$|Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired {{a series}} of {{hearings}} into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's CEO, argued {{that there was little}} point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor. Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX. He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's concluding remarks, the <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.|$|E
40|$|D. Phil. The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to follow a systems approach to improve property management in <b>state</b> <b>departments</b> <b>and</b> state-owned enterprises. The public sector, bureaucracy and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) globally and in South Africa (SA) are examined using a systems approach to provide the context for property management in <b>state</b> <b>departments</b> <b>and</b> SOEs. The effectiveness of property management in SA‟s National Department of Public Works <b>and</b> National <b>Department</b> of Public Enterprises are evaluated. Property management in rail transportation organisations globally and in SA receives focused attention. The SA state-owned company Transnet Limited, primarily a rail transportation enterprise, and Propnet, Transnet‟s property management unit, are examined in depth. Lessons learned, findings and recommendations are presented in a Management Matrix. The Management Matrix is incorporated in a State Property Management Transformation System, the implementation of which will improve property management in <b>state</b> <b>departments</b> <b>and</b> SOEs both globally and in SA...|$|R

5|$|With an Ebola {{epidemic}} devastating West Africa, Burwell began holding daily {{meetings on}} July 28, 2014, {{as part of}} the efforts of the United States government, including the Department of HHS, to prevent further spread of the disease. Starting on September30, other Obama administration officials began giving daily public briefings while Burwell took less of a public role, although she did take part in a number of public meetings. In the fall of 2014, the first known death from Ebola in the United States occurred. The Obama administration proposed devoting $6billion to fight the spread of Ebola, including $2billion for the <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> USAID. The plan included provisions to help U.S. hospitals become better prepared and to support global health initiatives aimed at containing the disease in Africa. Congress allocated $5.4billion to fight Ebola in response to the Obama administration request. Burwell and other Obama administration officials sought to assure the public that the American health system was prepared to deal with Ebola cases and that the chances of a full outbreak in the United States were low.|$|E
