5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called <b>solar</b> <b>activity.</b> Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System. The effects of <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and {{the disruption of}} radio communications and electric power. <b>Solar</b> <b>activity</b> {{is thought to have}} played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|At the {{subsolar point}} the bow shock stands 1900km (0.3 Rv, where Rv is the radius of Venus) {{above the surface}} of Venus. This {{distance}} was measured in 2007 near the <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> minimum. Near the <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> maximum it can be several times further from the planet. The magnetopause {{is located at the}} altitude of 300km. The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100eV and 1000eV respectively.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to <b>solar</b> <b>activity,</b> because increased solar wind during periods of high <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the solar wind's {{influence}} on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown; however, it could be especially strong at times of elevated <b>solar</b> <b>activity.</b> The auroral radio, optical and X-ray emissions, as well as synchrotron emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar wind pressure, indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission was {{launched}} by NASA. This spacecraft {{was designed to}} observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares {{during a time of}} high <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{magnetosphere}} is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region {{begins at}} {{a height of}} 60km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1–2Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with <b>solar</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
30|$|To {{model the}} earthquakes, the {{frequency}} of the earthquakes EQ 4 - 4.9 is taken as the response variable. Then, two types of GARX models are constructed: first one takes only the frequencies of the earthquakes other than EQ 4 - 4.9 as the exogenous variables; second one includes additional variables about the <b>solar</b> <b>activities</b> and the magnetospheres. In such a way, we try to investigate the relation between the earthquakes and the <b>solar</b> <b>activities</b> by comparing these models. In what following, GARX for the earthquakes will be introduced.|$|R

5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on <b>solar</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on <b>solar</b> <b>activity.</b> In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened <b>solar</b> <b>activity,</b> Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
30|$|The {{corresponding}} spread-F maximum occurring on the poleward side of {{the minimum}} (at low and medium <b>solar</b> <b>activities)</b> also shifts equatorward from ~[*] 35 ° N (or beyond) to 20 °– 25 ° N.|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{transient}} {{second or}} third layer on the topside of the Martian ionosphere were investigated with the most recently released Mars advanced radar for subsurface and ionospheric sounding/Mars Express data obtained from January 2010 to September 2011 to study the correlation between these topside additional layers and surface magnetic fields, solar zenith angle and <b>solar</b> <b>activities.</b> When examining the zones where the topside layer appeared, the occurrence rate of the topside layer was low at the areas with a strong Martian crustal magnetic field as observed by the Mars global surveyor. The occurrence rate of additional layers on the Martian topside ionosphere decreases as the solar zenith angle increases. However, these layers appeared significantly near the terminator of which solar zenith angle is 90 °. In comparison between F 10. 7 which is the index of <b>solar</b> <b>activities</b> and the occurrence rate of the topside layer by date, its occurrence rate was higher in 2011 than in 2010 with less <b>solar</b> <b>activities.</b> The result of this study will contribute to {{better understanding of the}} environments in the topside of the ionosphere through the correlation between the various conditions regarding the Martian ionosphere and the transient layer...|$|R
5|$|On {{a mission}} on P4X-639, a planet {{experiencing}} strong <b>solar</b> <b>activity,</b> the SG-1 team encounters an alien archaeologist named Malikai (Robin Mossley). When a geomagnetic disturbance hits its peak, the Stargate activates simultaneously {{on the planet}} and on Earth, and a flash strikes Malikai, Colonel O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) near an Ancient altar. Moments later, O'Neill finds himself in the Stargate Command (SGC) cafeteria {{in the middle of}} a breakfast conversation with Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Major Carter (Amanda Tapping), who claim to have no knowledge of the planet. O'Neill and Teal'c later express familiarity with the events, and they are checked and certified to be in perfect health. Before SG-1 can resume their planned mission to the planet, an unscheduled offworld activation of the Earth Stargate, accompanied by flashes, transports O'Neill back to breakfast.|$|E
25|$|A {{few studies}} {{say that the}} present level of <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> is {{historically}} high as determined by sunspot activity and other factors. <b>Solar</b> <b>activity</b> could affect climate either by variation in the Sun's output or, more speculatively, by an indirect effect {{on the amount of}} cloud formation. Solanki and co-workers suggest that <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> for the last 60 to 70 years may be at its highest level in 8,000 years; Muscheler et al. disagree, suggesting that other comparably high levels of activity have occurred several times in the last few thousand years.|$|E
25|$|This period also {{occurred}} during the Dalton Minimum (a period of relatively low <b>solar</b> <b>activity),</b> specifically Solar Cycle 6, which ran from December 1810 to May 1823. May 1816 in particular had the lowest sunspot number (0.1) to date since record keeping on <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> began. The lack of solar irradiance during this period was exacerbated by atmospheric opacity from volcanic dust.|$|E

30|$|We {{analyzed}} peak electron densities (NmF 2) and peak heights (hmF 2)of F 2 layer, {{measured by}} a digisonde at Anyang (37.4 °N, 127.0 °E, Geomag = 27.7 °N, 196.9 °E) {{during the period of}} April 1998 through April 2008. The Anyang NmF 2 and hmF 2 values averaged over each month show generally good linear relationship with increasing <b>solar</b> <b>activities</b> for all local time and for various geomagnetic activities. The change of the noon NmF 2 with increasing solar flux indices (F 10.7) is much slower in summer than in other seasons, and the NmF 2 difference between noon and midnight is minimized in summer. The hmF 2 varies with F 10.7 from 200 km to 350 km at noon and from 300 to 450 km at midnight, but the hmF 2 variations do not show seasonal difference significantly for all local time. The semi-annual variations of NmF 2 and hmF 2 are apparent and the winter anomaly of NmF 2 is also clearly seen for most cases of geomagnetic and <b>solar</b> <b>activities.</b> The Anyang NmF 2 values are in good agreement with the IRI 2007 model except for high <b>solar</b> and geomagnetic <b>activity</b> cases. However, the Anyang hmF 2 values at midnight are significantly higher than the IRI model, being higher by up to ∼ 100 km for high <b>solar</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|R
