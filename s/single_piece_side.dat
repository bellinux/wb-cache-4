50|$|The {{rest of the}} Spillo {{was more}} {{conventional}} and the fuselage {{was similar to that}} of the CCV 7 Pinocchio, a tapering ply oval section monocoque with wooden frames and stringers and the high wing mounted immediately behind the short, high, <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>side</b> hinged canopy. For take-off the Spillo used a jettisonable wheel, landing on a small, thin, rubber sprung skid, extending from the nose to behind mid-chord and fitted with two vertical braking blades. At the rear, the tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage; it was quite small, with strongly swept leading edges and tapered elevators split around the fin. The rudder was horn balanced and curved down to the keel behind a sloped straight leading edged rudder and fine.|$|E
50|$|The IS-5's pod and boom style {{fuselage}} was a metal monocoque {{with the}} pod ending abruptly at the wing trailing edge and a slender boom aft. The cockpit was enclosed by a <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>side</b> hinged, moulded perspex canopy. Rectangular airbrakes hinged outwards from the fuselage sides under the wing, each with {{an area of}} 0.325 sqm sq ft. The empennage was conventional, with a ply covered fin which was narrow at the top but faired into the boom above and below. It carried a fabric covered, rounded, unbalanced rudder, broad at its heel, {{as well as the}} straight edged tailplane placed just above the boom. There were rounded, spring balanced elevators with gaps at their roots to clear the fin and a small cut out for rudder movement; these control surfaces were ply skinned and fabric covered like the ailerons.|$|E
50|$|Rear {{glass is}} from a 1965, 66 Ford Mustang 2+2 Fastback. The {{windshield}} {{is from a}} 1965-69 Chevy Corvair Monza or Corsa. Side windows are custom made. Some use Plexiglass or Lexan (polycarbonate - impact resistant). Originally there were two other choices. One was a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>side</b> window which Fiberfab supplied, it was custom glass but the original molds are lost. The other way is a window/wind-wing combo, using a wind-wing from a 65 Mustang in combination with a 1966 Ford LTD door glass and a regulator from a VW Karman Ghia. This is the type that the original Fiberfab manuals, gave instructions for. There are long door cars, and short door cars. The long door reaches {{all the way to}} the bottom of the car body and is a bit wider. The short door (early) car, has a rocker panel below the door. Rear taillights are custom; however, some used early Mustang or Maverick taillight units.|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{was about}} 30 feet long, carved {{from a very}} {{straight}} log, with ...curved ends and carved heads... The sides were built up with wide, hand - hewn boards, each board at least 20 inches wide and running {{the length of the}} canoe in a <b>single</b> <b>piece.</b> These <b>sides</b> were painted in interesting designs of red and white, and the whole canoe bound together with plant fiber of some sort and the joints filled with tree gum. The outrigger was bound with the same strong fiber, and there was not a nail or a piece of metal in the whole job. Neither did any of the parts show marks I could recognize as having been made with modern tools." ...|$|R
50|$|The underwing cabin of the Sirius has a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> windscreen, glazed <b>side</b> doors, {{rear side}} windows and an upper rear transparency. A choice of flat four engines offers either the 59.6 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912UL or the 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912 ULS. The Sirius is fitted with a fixed {{tricycle}} undercarriage with mainwheels fuselage mounted on composite cantilever spring legs. The nosewheel is steerable and the mainwheels have brakes; all wheels are almost completely enclosed in spats. The company has also developed a float installation for the TL-3000 to allow water operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Mita 3 is steel framed {{with wooden}} stringers, polygonal in cross-section and fabric covered {{apart from a}} glass reinforced plastic (GRP) nose cone and a short GRP dorsal fairing behind the cockpit. The rear of the <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> starboard <b>side</b> hinged canopy rises upwards above the rear fuselage line, allowing the instructor to be placed above the pupil pilot in the front seat, with an upper and two small side transparencies to assist his view. The fuselage tapers gently rearwards to the straight tapered tail surfaces; the tailplane is mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage and is, like the wing, a ply box structure with fabric covering aft and carrying fabric covered elevators with a cut out for rudder movement. The fin is similarly plywood skinned, with a small GRP fillet; the rudder, which extends to the keel, is fabric covered, mass balanced and has a GRP tip. The Mita 3 lands on a fixed, rubber sprung monowheel undercarriage and a fixed tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was a plywood monocoque, tapering to the tail. A <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>side</b> hinged, moulded perspex canopy enclosed {{the single}} seat cockpit from the {{nose to the}} leading edge, with an additional small roof transparency aft of the leading edge. The empennage was conventional, with a straight tapered tailplane mounted on a small step above the fuselage, carrying straight edged elevators with gaps at their roots between elevator and fin and at the tips between them and rearward extension of the tailplane tips. The elevators were mass balanced by a weight within the fuselage but not aerodynamically balanced. A narrow fin with a small forward fillet rose above the tailplane to the full height of the rudder, which was broad with a rounded heel, flat tipped and also unbalanced. The rudder extended down to the keel, requiring a cut-out in the aft part of the elevators for its movement. Like the ailerons the horizontal tail was covered with fabric over ply but the fin was simply ply skinned and the rudder fabric covered. The IS-4 had a short, rubber sprung skid reaching from the nose to under about mid-canopy and a fixed, unsprung monowheel under the wing, fitted with a brake. There was also a small tail bumper, protecting {{the bottom of the}} rudder.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the IS-11 was an oval section plywood monocoque. [...] The pilot {{sat in a}} semi-reclining {{position in}} a single seat cockpit under a <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>side</b> opening perspex canopy which, with a short, fixed transparency behind it stretched from the nose into {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Its undercarriage comprised a very short, rubber sprung skid under the nose and a fixed, unsprung monowheel semi-recessed into the fuselage under the forward wing and fitted with a brake. From the high wing the fuselage tapered aft to a conventional empennage. A narrow, ply covered fin and a fabric covered rudder which extended down to the keel together formed a straight edged vertical tail with rounded heel and tip. The fin also mounted a straight edged, fabric over ply covered tailplane placed just above the fuselage, carrying straight tapered, similarly skinned elevators. These were balanced by a bob weight within the fuselage and had gaps both at their roots to clear the fin and at their tips to clear rearward tailplane extensions, with a small central cut out for rudder movement. There was a trim tab on the starboard elevator and a tail bumper under the rudder hinge.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Nymph was a plywood covered box {{formed with}} frames and stringers, with inward sloping sides, a central keel from nose to mid fuselage and an upper turtleback or semi-conical decking behind the wing trailing edge. The cockpit {{was ahead of}} the leading edge, with a <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> blown perspex <b>side</b> opening canopy and an upper line that merged into the wing. On each side a secondary, D-shaped window gave some rearward vision. The Nymph's ply covered, straight tapered, horizontal tail was unusually far back {{on top of the}} fuselage, locating the tailplane, also ply skinned, aft of the fin with the elevators largely behind the rudder which ended above them. Its starboard elevator carried a trim tab. The vertical tail was straight edged, tapered and flat topped. There was an unsprung monowheel below the wing at about one third chord, semi-recessed into a rubber sprung skid which reached from the nose to the trailing edge. The Nymph without wing endplates also had its wheel mounted a little further forward and its skid removed. There was a miniature skid tail bumper rather than the usual cantilever tailskid.|$|R

50|$|The {{computer}} opponent slowly adapts {{over time}} to help players defeat it.

More rarely, a side may also win by imprisoning its opponent's last remaining <b>piece.</b> If each <b>side</b> has but a <b>single</b> <b>piece,</b> and the two pieces destroy each other in a double-kill, then the game ends in a tie.|$|R
