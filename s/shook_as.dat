5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As {{he stood in the}} circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over when it rained. His body <b>shook</b> <b>as</b> though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E

This is a reference [...] {{to the notion that}} a sauropod's weight was so great that the ground <b>shook</b> <b>as</b> it walked.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1953, the 581st {{lost one}} of its B-29s and its entire fourteen-man crew while flying a leaflet drop mission over North Korea near the Chinese border. [...] The {{aircraft}} had already dropped leaflets over five North Korean towns and was beginning its last run over the village of Cholson. [...] Some of the leaflets carried war news, but others warned of an impending bombing attack by United Nations forces. [...] Suddenly enemy searchlights lit up the sky, and in a rare night attack, a MiG-15 fighter attacked the B-29, setting afire its right inboard engine. [...] The bomber <b>shook</b> <b>as</b> the tail gunner responded to the attack. [...] Two more MiGs swept by the bomber, this time hitting the number three and four engines with machine gun and cannon fire. [...] With the plane falling from the sky, the crew bailed out. [...] Three of the crew died in the crash, but the remaining crewmen, including the 581st Wing Commander were captured and sent to a camp in China. [...] They were imprisoned as war criminals by the Chinese engaged in [...] "espionage". [...] They were held past the June 1953 Korean Armistice and subjected to an international publicized propaganda trial. [...] Later under growing international pressure, the Chinese released the eleven airmen on 3 August 1955, making them the last Korean War American prisoners to be released by the Chinese communists.|$|E

2500|$|On January 15, 1983, {{during the}} second round of the playoffs against the Minnesota Vikings, John Riggins rushed for a Redskins playoff record 185 yards, leading Washington to a 21–7 win and a place in the NFC Championship Game against Dallas. Jan. 22, 1983, NFC Championship Game at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, prior to the game the stadium {{physically}} <b>shook</b> <b>as</b> a capacity crowd of 54,000 chanted [...] "We Want Dallas!" [...] The game is best remembered for the quarterback hit by Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley that knocked Cowboys' quarterback Danny White out for the rest of the game and sent him into the locker room shortly before halftime, and Redskins defensive tackle Darryl Grant's interception which he returned for a 10-yard touchdown off one of Cowboys' backup quarterback Gary Hogeboom's passes which was tipped by Dexter Manley to score the decisive points. John Riggins rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns on 36 carries and the Redskins went on to defeat the Cowboys' by a score of 31–17. The Redskins' first Super Bowl win, and their first NFL Championship in 40 years, was in Super Bowl XVII, where the Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins 27–17 on January 30, 1983. [...] Riggins provided the game's signature play when, on 4th and inches, with the Redskins down 17–13, the coaches called [...] "70 Chip", a play designed for short yardage. Riggins instead gained [...] by running through would-be tackler Don McNeal and getting the go-ahead touchdown. The Redskins ended up winning by a 27–17 score with John Riggins winning the Super Bowl MVP.|$|E
