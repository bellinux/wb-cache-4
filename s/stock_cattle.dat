40|$|Six hard white {{winter wheat}} {{varieties}} (Burchett, Lakin, NuFrontier, NuHills, Nu- Horizon, and Trego) and six hard red winter wheat varieties (2137, Jagalene, Jagger, OK 101, Stanton, and Thunderbolt) were planted in two southwestern Kansas counties, Clark and Stanton, to compare simulated graze-out forage yield and quality. Four replicated plots were planted in September 2003 for each variety at each location. Forage samples were collect from each plot during December 2003, March 2004, and April or May 2004. Dry matter content, dry matter yield, crude protein, acid detergent fiber (ADF), {{neutral detergent fiber}} (NDF), total digestible nutrients (TDN), net energy (NEm, NEg), relative feed value (RFV), and nitrate nitrogen were determined.

30|$|Pastoral {{families}} have {{two types of}} stock options they can sell to acquire cash in regional markets (Dahl and Hjort 1976; Herren 1989). They can sell small stock (goats or sheep) thereby gaining {{a small amount of}} cash (the equivalent to taking out cash from the bank to do the weekly shopping) or large <b>stock</b> (<b>cattle</b> and camels) thereby gaining a large packet of wealth to use for health care, education, or other needs that usually require large sums of cash. We recognize that some families also have savings accounts ‘off the hoof’ they draw on to use for purchases in the market rather than selling stock. Therefore, we consider wealth in this model to be a composite measure of a family’s overall assets: labour (access to free familial labour via progeny), livestock (total livestock unit (TLU)), wages (monthly value), savings (in a bank, not on the hoof), and social position (person of status or power). Thus, we hypothesize that access to cash from engagement with diversified practices and regional markets generates socio-economic differentiation among pastoral households under current economic conditions.|$|E

40|$|The red-finned blue-eye (Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis) is {{endemic to}} a single complex of springs emanating from the Great Artesian Basin, Australia. The species has been {{recorded}} as naturally occurring in eight separate very shallow (generally < 20 mm) springs, with a combined wetland area of ~ 0. 3 ha. Since its discovery in 1990, five red-finned blue-eye (RFBE) populations have been lost and subsequent colonisation has occurred in two spring wetlands. Current population size is estimated at < 3000 individuals. Artesian bores have reduced aquifer pressure, standing water levels and spring-flows in the district. There is evidence of spatial separation within the spring pools where RFBE and the introduced fish gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) co-occur, although both species are forced together when seasonal extremes affect spring size and water temperature. Gambusia was present {{in four of the}} five springs where RFBE populations have been lost. Four out of the five remaining subpopulations of RFBE are Gambusia free. Circumstantial evidence suggests that gambusia is a major threat to red-finned blue-eyes. The impact of Gambusia is probably exacerbated by domestic <b>stock</b> (<b>cattle</b> and sheep), feral goats and pigs that utilise the springs and can negatively affect water quality and flow patterns. Three attempts to translocate RFBE to apparently suitable springs elsewhere within the complex have failed. Opportunities to mitigate threats are discussed, along with directions for future research to improve management of this extremely threatened fish and habitat...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{a review of the}} {{development}} of economically significant diseases of cattle within the territory of the former German Democratic Republic from 1946 to 1989. The available literature was screened and evaluated according to certain time periods. These time periods were based on the development of GDR-agriculture, which is briefly summarized. The state of animal health in live <b>stock</b> <b>cattle</b> changed significantly {{during the course of the}} study period. In the beginning epidemics and venereal diseases were the most important cattle diseases, whereas towards the end, non-infectious diseases, particularly nutritional disorders, and multifactorial infectious diseases took this place. Bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, trichomoniasis, vibriosis and warble fly infestation were eradicated in the GDR from 1946 to 1989. A significant relationship can be established between the development of agriculture and the main foci of diseases. Freestall housing, the foundation of large-scale live stock enterprises and industrialized cattle production caused specific animal health problems. Control of economically significant cattle diseases in the GDR was performed by an extensive public veterinary service under central government guidance and coordination. The efficiency of this system was high, especially in controlling epidemics, but it was restricted to the limited economic capacities of the GDR. The control of animal epidemics and parasitoses was mainly performed in an administrative manner. Area sanitation programmes were successfully applied for tuberculosis, brucellosis, warble fly infestation, mastitis agalactiae and leucosis. It was shown, that set-backs in controlling animal epidemics were often caused by uncertainties in diagnostic measures. To supervise the herd health situation relative to fertility and metabolic herd health, specific procedures were developed and applied in large live stock farms. The extensive scientific preparatory works on this matter as well as basic veterinary and epidemic hygienic demands, could and should be used in a prophylactically orientated veterinary care of cattle enterprises...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the geology of the 1 : 10 000 sheet SO 65 SW (Trough of Bowland), {{part of the}} 1 : 50 000 sheets 67 (Garstang) and 59 (Lancaster). The original geological survey was carried out {{on a scale of}} 1 : 10 560 by R. c. Tiddemann, and published as part of the Primary Series Sheets 91 NE (1884 : New Series Sheet 59) and 91 SE (1883 : New Series Sheet 67). The present survey was carried out by R. A. Hughes during 1985 - 86, under the direction of Dr A. J. Wadge, Regional Geologist. The ground {{to the north of the}} Miller's House Fault in the extreme northwest of the map was surveyed by Dr A. Brandon in 1984. Most of the area consists of high, open moorland covered by peat bog and heather. Whins Brow [6363 5329] is the highest point at 476 m (see Figure 1). The lowest areas are the Brennand and Langden valleys. The Trough of Bowland leads to the major watershed of the Bowland Fells at the Grey Stone of Trough (295 m) [6225 5305]. To the north of the watershed is the drainage system of the River Wyre, to the south the River Hodder. Apart from some conifer forestation, farming is entirely pastoral. Sheep graze the poor quality moorland and steep valley sides, while the marginally better pasture of the valley floors supports <b>stock</b> <b>cattle.</b> This is an important water catchment area for the North West Water Authority, supplying the industrial towns of north Lancashire. Structurally the area is dominated by the Sykes and Brennand peri clines which are part of the Ribblesdale Fold Belt.

Both have an ENE - WSW axial trace, and both have Dinantian rocks exposed in their cores. All the higher ground of the area is made up largely of Namurian sandstones.

40|$|The Cape Griffon Gyps coprotheres {{is listed}} as a {{globally}} threatened species, because of threats posed by, inter alia, poisoning, loss of habitat, food shortages, electrocutions and drowning in high-walled farm reservoirs. The Cape Griffon has undergone major decline in South Africa, including the Eastern Cape. A detailed investigation into the causes of this decline is vital to ensure {{the survival of the}} species. Since it is known that electrocution on powerlines is a major cause of mortality of the griffons in the Eastern Cape, the study therefore focuses on this factor in this region. More specifically, the overall aim or objective of the study is to investigate, through the application of appropriate GIS techniques, the use of descriptive, empirical, habitat and foraging models to prioritise powerline networks, in the Eastern Cape, for mitigation to prevent electrocution of Cape Griffons Gyps coprotheres. The specific activities associated with the aim of the study are: (1) to identify the broad habitat types used by the griffons, (2) to determine the mean daily foraging range size of the griffons, (3) to map currently active foraging ranges and to categorise them according to their role, and the level of importance, in the foraging and breeding behaviour of the species, (4) to map the locations of networks of griffon-unfriendly powerline networks, and (5) to integrate the outcomes of (1) to (4) above, to produce a spatially explicit product that ranks griffon-unfriendly powerline networks according to their priority level for mitigation. The study uses simple descriptive models to investigate, spatially, the threat posed by griffon-unfriendly powerlines to the Cape Griffon in the Eastern Cape. The modelling approach includes a broad level simple habitat model (Categorical model), a Maxent model, a spatial foraging model and an electrocution model. Several map outputs were produced from the analyses. Cape Griffon habitat was successfully modelled using ecological input variables: biome, vegetation xvii type (suitable/unsuitable for griffon foraging), <b>stock</b> (<b>cattle,</b> sheep and goats), and stock farming types (commercial & communal). All outputs were modelled {{through the use of a}} Geographical Information System (GIS). Opportunistic sightings data were used for the study, which means that the data were collected on a non-systematic basis and are therefore considered incomplete. In ecology and zoogeography, incomplete datasets are common. To address this issue, a maximum entropy (Maxent) model was applied to the available dataset. Maxent produces predictions or conclusions from incomplete information, and was therefore useful for this study. The mean daily foraging area (coverage) of the Cape Griffon in the study area was estimated from published and unpublished marked bird studies conducted elsewhere, but in generally similar habitats. Based on all the data from these studies, it was considered appropriate to use a circular area, with a radius of 40 km, to represent the mean daily foraging range of the Cape Griffon in the Eastern Cape. It was considered appropriate to use a roughly circular area to depict the daily foraging area, given that the Cape Griffon qualifies as a central place forager. This means that the griffons are tied to a permanent site (roosting site or breeding site) and forage within a certain area around that central site. The mean daily foraging area (40 km) was applied to the currently active griffon sites: breeding sites, regular roosting sites, seasonal/occasional sites, and roosting sites (uncertain status). This produced four foraging area types, which formed the basis for the creation of two spatial foraging area models: Hierarchical Foraging Area Model (HFAM) and the Intersecting Foraging Area Model (IFAM). The HFAM produced three outputs: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Foraging Areas. These three areas represent the hierarchical presentation of the relative importance of the four foraging area types. The outcome was areas of different predicted griffon occurrence: ‘high’, ‘medium’, ‘low’. The IFAM is essentially an extension of the HFAM, which represents a single area where foraging ranges based on all four types are intersected. The outcome represents the area of predicted highest griffon occurrence. The identified areas of different predicted griffon occurrence, or density (outputs of the HFAM and IFAM), were individually intersected with the layer that indicates the locations of the ‘unsafe’ powerlines. These intersects are depicted in hierarchical mode and expressed according to a number of four risk categories (very high, high, medium and low). The final spatial output of the study is a map that identifies priority powerlines for mitigation against griffon mortality caused by electrocutions and collisions with powerline infrastructur...|$|E
