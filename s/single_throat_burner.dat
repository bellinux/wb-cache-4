The turbojet engines are integrated into the <b>single</b> <b>throat</b> ramjet to minimize variable geometry and eliminate redundant propulsion components. The result is a simple, lightweight system that is operable from takeoff to high Mach numbers. At this high Mach number (approximately Mach 3. 0), the turbojets are turned off and the high speed ramjet/scramjet take over and drive the vehicle to Mach 6. 0. The turbojet-ejector-ramjet system consists of nonafterburning turbojet engines with ducting canted at 20 degrees to supply supersonic flow (downstream of CD nozzle) to the horizontal ramjet duct at a supply total pressure and temperature. Two conditions were modelled by a 2 -D full Navier Stokes code at Mach 2. 0.

40|$|When bosonic {{matter in}} the form of a complex scalar field is added to Ellis wormholes, the {{phenomenon}} of spontaneous symmetry breaking is observed. Symmetric solutions possess full reflection symmetry with respect to the radial coordinate of the two asymptotically flat spacetime regions connected by the wormhole, whereas asymmetric solutions do not possess this symmetry. Depending on the size of the throat, at bifurcation points pairs of asymmetric solutions arise from or merge with the symmetric solutions. These asymmetric solutions are energetically favoured. When the backreaction of the boson field is taken into account, this phenomenon is retained. Moreover, in a certain region of the solution space both symmetric and asymmetric solutions exhibit a transition from <b>single</b> <b>throat</b> to double throat configurations.

40|$|This study {{describes}} for {{the first}} time heterogeneity of antibiotic resistance profiles among group A Streptococcus (GAS) isolates originating from a <b>single</b> <b>throat</b> swab in patients with acute pharyngitis. For each throat swab, ten GAS colonies were randomly selected from the primary plate and subcultured to a secondary plate. These isolates were characterized by various phenotypic and genotypic methods. Our results demonstrated that differing antibiotic resistance profiles were present in 19 % of pediatric patients with acute pharyngitis before antimicrobial treatment. This heterogeneity likely resulted from horizontal gene transfer amongst streptococcal isolates sharing the same genetic background. As only a minority of colonies displayed antibiotic resistance among these heterogeneous samples, a classical diagnostic antibiogram would have classified them in most instances as 'susceptible' although therapeutic failure could be caused by the proliferation of resistant strains after initiation of antibiotic treatment.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) tonsillitis {{can be confirmed}} by culture of samples obtained by swabbing both tonsillar surfaces and the posterior pharyngeal wall and plating them on sheep blood agar medium. The isolation rate can be increased by incubating the cultures under anaerobic conditions and using selective growth media. A <b>single</b> <b>throat</b> culture has a sensitivity of 90-95% {{for the detection of}} GABHS (which means that GABHS is actually present 5-10% of the time culture suggests that it is absent). This small percentage of false-negative results are part of the characteristics of the tests used but are also possible if the patient has received antibiotics prior to testing. Identification requires 24 to 48 hours by culture but rapid screening tests (10-60 minutes), which have a sensitivity of 85-90%, are available. Older antigen tests detect the surface Lancefield group A carbohydrate. Newer tests identify GABHS serotypes using nucleic acid (DNA) probes or polymerase chain reaction. Bacterial culture may need to be performed in cases of a negative rapid streptococcal test.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} boson star {{solutions in}} the presence of a phantom field, allowing for a nontrivial topology of the solutions. The wormholes residing at the core of the configurations lead to a number of qualitative changes of the boson star solutions. In particular, the typical spiraling dependence of the mass and the particle number on the frequency of the boson stars is lost. Instead, the boson stars with nontrivial topology approach a singular configuration in the limit of vanishing frequency. Depending on the value of the coupling constant, the wormhole geometry changes from a <b>single</b> <b>throat</b> configuration to a double throat configuration, featuring a belly inbetween the two throats. Depending on the mass of the boson field and its self-interaction, the mass and the size of these objects cover many orders of magnitude, making them amenable to various astrophysical observations. A stability analysis reveals, that the unstable mode of the Ellis wormhole is retained {{in the presence}} of the bosonic matter. However, the negative eigenvalue can get very close to zero, by tuning the parameters of the self-interaction potential appropriately. Comment: 21 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Adapting and {{extending}} a suggestion due to Page, we define a wormhole throat to be a marginally anti-trapped surface, that is, a closed two-dimensional spatial hypersurface such {{that one of}} the two future-directed null geodesic congruences orthogonal to it is just beginning to diverge. Typically a dynamic wormhole will possess two such throats, corresponding to the two orthogonal null geodesic congruences, and these two throats will not coincide, (though they do coalesce into a <b>single</b> <b>throat</b> in the static limit). The divergence property of the null geodesics at the marginally anti-trapped surface generalizes the ``flare-out'' condition for an arbitrary wormhole. We derive theorems regarding violations of the null energy condition (NEC) at and near these throats and find that, even for wormholes with arbitrary time-dependence, the violation of the NEC is a generic property of wormhole throats. We also discuss wormhole throats in the presence of fully antisymmetric torsion and find that the energy condition violations cannot be dumped into the torsion degrees of freedom. Finally by means of a concrete example we demonstrate that even temporary suspension of energy-condition violations is incompatible with the flare-out property of dynamic throats.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} a score {{based on}} clinical symptoms and signs for {{the identification of}} group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection in general practice patients with score <b>throat.</b> DESIGN: A <b>single</b> <b>throat</b> swab {{was used as the}} gold standard for diagnosing GAS infection. Clinical information was recorded by experienced family physicians on standardized encounter forms. Score criteria were identified by means of logistic regression modelling of data from patients enrolled {{in the first half of}} the study. The score was then validated among the remaining patients. SETTING: University-affiliated family medicine centre in Toronto. PATIENTS: A total of 521 patients aged 3 to 76 years presenting with a new upper respiratory tract infection from December 1995 to February 1997. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for identification of GAS infection with the score approach compared with throat culture. Proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics, throat culture use, and sensitivity and specificity with usual physician care and with score-based recommendations were compared. RESULTS: A score was developed ranging in value from 0 to 4. The sensitivity of the score for identifying GAS infection was 83. 1 %, compared with 69. 4 % for usual physician care (p = 0. 06); the specificity values of the 2 approaches were similar. Among patients aged 3 to 14 years, the sensitivity of the score approach was higher than that of usual physician care (96. 9 % v. 70. 6 %) (p < 0. 05). The proportion of patients receiving initial antibiotic prescriptions would have been reduced 48 % by following score-based recommendations compared with observed physician prescribing (p < 0. 001), without any increase in throat culture use. CONCLUSIONS: An age-appropriate sore throat score identified GAS infection in children and adults with sore throat better than usual care by family physicians, with significant reductions in unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics. A randomized trial comparing the 2 approaches is recommended to determine the ability of the score approach to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics during routine clinical encounters...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on a prototype 4 th generation DLE (dry low emission) burner under atmospheric pressure conditions to investigate the effects of hydrogen (H 2) enrichment on methane (CH 4) flames. The burner assembly was designed to have three concentrically arranged premixed sections: an outer Main section, an intermediate section (Pilot) and a central pilot body termed the RPL (Rich-Pilot-Lean) section. The Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH radicals together with flame chemiluminescence imaging were employed for studying the local flame characteristics {{so as to be}} able to investigate the turbulence-flame interactions and the location of the reaction zone at the burner exit. Flames were investigated for three different fuel mixtures having hydrogen (H 2) /methane (CH 4) in vol. % concentration of 0 / 100, 25 / 75 and 50 / 50. The results show that the characteristics of the flames are clearly affected by the addition of hydrogen and the effects are expected due to the faster reaction rate, higher diffusivity and higher laminar burning velocity of H 2. Enriching the flame with H 2 at a constant global phi (φ) is found to shorten the total extension of the flame due to the higher laminar flame speed. The OH signal distribution becomes thicker and more pronounced due to the higher production of OH radicals, and the flame stabilization zone that is produced after the <b>burner</b> <b>throat,</b> moves further downstream. At a constant global φ in altering the RPL and the Pilot φ, similar changes for both 0 / 100 and 25 / 75 (in vol. %) of the H 2 /CH 4 fuel mixtures can be observed. At a rich RPL φ, the secondary RPL flame contributes to the main flame and to determining the flame stabilization position. The flame stabilization zone located after the <b>burner</b> <b>throat</b> moves further downstream with an increase in the RPL φ. When the PFR (Pilot fuel ratio) increases, the extension of the flame shortens and the flame stabilization zone moves upstream.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{evaluate}} the production of CO-NO-HC emissions while varying the swirl angle of curve vane radial swirler. Swirling flow generates central recirculation region (CRZ) which is necessary for flame stability and enhances fuel air mixing. Therefore designing an appropriate air swirler is a challenge to produce stable, efficient and low emission combustion inside burner system. Four radial curved vane swirlers with 30 o, 40 o, 50 o and 60 o vane angles corresponding to swirl numbers of 0. 366, 0. 630, 0. 978 and 1. 427 respectively were used in this experiment to measure the vane angles effect on emission production in the combustion chamber. Emission measurements were conducted at 5 axial distances from the <b>burner</b> <b>throat,</b> and at 5 locations along the radius starting the central axis at each section. It was found that at the core near the throat, CO and HC concentrations are low due to high available O 2 and high fuel mixing rate producing efficient combustion.

40|$|AbstractThe Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W), {{through its}} Power Generation Group, and Air Liquide (AL) have been {{actively}} involved in the development of oxy-coal technologies for power generation throughout the past decade. After successful demonstration of oxy-combustion at B&W’s 1. 5  MWth Small Boiler Simulator (SBS) and very promising full-scale (300 – 500  MWe) engineering studies, B&W and Air Liquide initiated a project to scale-up the oxy-combustion technology at B&W’s 100 -million Btu/hr (30  MWth) Clean Environment Development Facility (CEDF). During 2007 and 2008, the technology was successfully demonstrated with eastern bituminous, sub-bituminous and lignite coals. During this demonstration project, two near full-scale burners were developed: 1) the B&W DRB-XCL® burner for oxy-firing of eastern bituminous coal, and 2) the DRB-PAX™ burner for oxy-firing with low-rank coals. An operating procedure for smooth transition from air to oxy-combustion then back to air-fired modes has been developed. Stable flames, attached at the <b>burner</b> <b>throat,</b> have been obtained under the oxy-combustion conditions even for the high-moisture, low-Btu lignite while heat absorption in the boiler and convection pass was maintained similar to air-blown combustion. B&W’s new scrubber equipped with integrated cooling surface (patent in progress) successfully reduced moisture and SO 2 from the flue gas without the need of a large and expensive gas cooler. Following the completion of this work, the ensuing commercialization process will focus on an at-scale demonstration at a host Utility. A demonstration plant design is being developed, and will involve input from the Utilities that are members of our Oxy-Coal Advisory Group. Project economics, technical design and a near-zero emissions profile are highlighted.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of various factors on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions of a low NOx burner is investigated using a central composite design (CCD) approach to an experimental matrix {{in order to show}} the applicability of design of experiments methodology to the combustion field. Four factors have been analyzed in terms of their impact on NOx formation: hydrogen fraction in the fuel (0 %– 15 % mass fraction in hydrogen-enriched methane), amount of excess air (5 %– 30 %), burner head position (20 – 25 mm from the <b>burner</b> <b>throat)</b> and secondary fuel fraction provided to the burner (0 %– 6 %). The measurements were performed at a constant thermal load equal to 25 kW (calculated based on lower heating value). Response surface methodology and CCD were used to develop a second-degree polynomial regression model of the burner NOx emissions. The significance of the tested factors over their respective ranges has been evaluated using the analysis of variance and by the consideration of the coefficients of the model equation. Results show that hydrogen addition to methane leads to increased NOx emissions in comparison to emissions from pure methane combustion. Hydrogen content in a fuel is the strongest factor affecting NOx emissions among all the factors tested. Lower NOx formation because of increased excess air was observed when the burner was fuelled by pure methane, but this effect diminished for hydrogen-rich fuel mixtures. NOx emissions were slightly reduced when the burner head was shifted closer to the burner outer tube, whereas a secondary fuel stream provided to the burner was found to have no impact on NOx emissions over the investigated range of factors.

40|$|Two conﬁned lean non-premixed swirl-stabilized ﬂame typologies were {{investigated}} {{in order to}} achieve detailed information on the thermal and aerodynamic ﬁeld in the close vicinity of the <b>burner</b> <b>throat</b> and provide correlation with the exhaust emissions. Previous ﬁnding indicated the generation of a partially premixed ﬂame with radial fuel injection and a purely diﬀusive ﬂame with co-axial injection in a swirling coﬂow. In the present work, the experimental study is reported which has been conducted on a straight exit laboratory burner with no quarl cone, fuelled by natural gas and air, and ﬁred vertically upwards with the ﬂame stabilized at the end of two concentric pipes with the annulus supplying swirled air and the central pipe delivering the fuel. Two fuel injection typologies, co-axial and radial (i. e., transverse), leading to diﬀerent mixing mechanisms, have been characterized through diﬀerent techniques: particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) for a comprehensive analysis of the velocity ﬁeld, still photography for the detection of ﬂame front and main visible features, and thermocouples for the temperature distribution. Isothermal ﬂow conditions have been included in the experimental investigation to provide a basic picture of the ﬂow ﬁeld and to comprehend the modiﬁcations induced by the combustion process. The results indicated that, although the global mixing process and the main ﬂame structure are governed by the swirl motion imparted to the air stream, the two diﬀerent fuel injection methodologies play an important role on mixture formation and ﬂame stabilization in the primary mixing zone. Particularly, it has been found that, in case of axial injection, the turbulent interaction between the central fuel jet and the backﬂow generated by the swirl can induce an intermittent fuel penetration in the recirculated hot products and the formation of a central sooting luminous plume, a phenomenon totally absent in the case of radial injection...|$|R

The combustion changes that occur for alteration of the operating conditions by changing the equivalence ratios (φ) for CH 4 as fuel at different sections of the burner, were optically investigated. The burner assembly has three concentrically arranged premixed burner sections: an outer Main section, an intermediate section (Pilot) and a central pilot body or pre-chamber combustor, called RPL (Rich-Pilot-Lean) section. All sections are facilitated to vary equivalence ratios to achieve optimal combustion. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH radicals and flame chemiluminescence imaging were applied to study the local flame characteristics in order to investigate turbulence-flame interaction and formation of reaction zone at the burner exit. The {{results show that the}} position and shape of the flame are clearly affected by the variation of equivalence ratios at different sections of the burner. During the experiments, first the RPL, then the Pilot and the Main flame were added in a step wise manner keeping constant the total air flow for the global φ= 0. 5 {{in order to understand the}} flame contributions from the different combustion sections. It is observed that for the RPL fuel lean conditions, the primary combustion starts and reaches completion before exiting the <b>burner</b> <b>throat</b> while for rich conditions, the residual fuel escapes out through the RPL exit with primary combustion products and starts secondary combustion along with the Pilot and Main combustion. At the global φ= 0. 5, for changing the RPL φ from lean to rich conditions, the flame stabilization region moves downstream of the burner exit and the flame front fluctuation along inner shear layer increases.

The concept of translating the nozzle throat provides the SERN with a variable expansion ratio. An experimental and computational {{study was conducted to}} predict and verify the internal performance of this concept. Three nozzles with expansion ratios designed for low, intermediate, and high Mach number operating conditions were tested in the Jet-Exit Test Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center. Each nozzle was tested with a concave and a convex geometric expansion ramp surface design. Internal nozzle performance, paint-oil flow and focusing Schlieren flow visualization were obtained for nozzle pressure ratios (NPR's) up to 13. The Navier-Stokes code, PAB 3 D, with a k-epsilon turbulence model was utilized to verify experimental results at selected NPRs and to predict the performance at conditions unattainable in the test facility. Two-dimensional simulations were computed with near static free-stream conditions and at nozzle pressure ratios of 5, 9, and 13 for the concave ramp, low Mach number configuration and at the design NPR of 102 for the concave ramp, high Mach number configuration. Remarkable similarities between predicted and experimental flow characteristics, as well as performance quantities, were obtained...|$|R
40|$|A simple spacetime wormhole, which evolves classically {{from zero}} throat radius {{to a maximum}} value and recontracts, can be {{regarded}} as one possible mode of fluctuation in the microscopic "spacetime foam" first suggested by Wheeler. The dynamics of a particularly simple version of such a wormhole can be reduced to that of a <b>single</b> quantity, its <b>throat</b> radius; this wormhole thus provides a "minisuperspace model" for a structure in Lorentzian-signature foam. The classical equation of motion for the wormhole throat is obtained from the Einstein field equations and a suitable equation of state for the matter at the throat. Analysis of the quantum behavior of the hole then proceeds from an action corresponding to that equation of motion. The action obtained simply by calculating the scalar curvature of the hole spacetime yields a model with features like those of the relativistic free particle. In particular the Hamiltonian is nonlocal, and for the wormhole cannot even be given as a differential operator in closed form. Nonetheless the general solution of the Schrödinger equation for wormhole wave functions, i. e., the wave-function propagator, can be expressed as a path integral. Too complicated to perform exactly, this can yet be evaluated via a WKB approximation. The result indicates that the wormhole, classically stable, is quantum-mechanically unstable: A Feynman-Kac decomposition of the WKB propagator yields no spectrum of bound states. Though an initially localized wormhole wave function may oscillate for many classical expansion/recontraction periods, it must eventually leak to large radius values. The possibility of such a mode unstable against growth, combined withComment: 37 pages, 93 -...|$|R
40|$|Low-salinity water {{flooding}} is a promising technique {{for the improvement}} of oil recovery. Despite intensive research, there are controversies about the pore-scale mechanisms behind the low-salinity effect (LSE). One of the proposed LSE mechanisms is wettability alteration, which is reflected in a decrease in contact angle. However, it is not known how a variation in contact angle affects the macroscopic transport properties such as capillary pressure and relative permeability. The effect of contact angle variation on the transport properties is investigated by simulating capillary dominated, two-phase flow with a quasi-static pore-scale modeling method. The simulations are performed with real rock samples and, therefore, the effects of heterogeneities in the rock are incorporated. We distinguish three levels of analysis: <b>single</b> pore <b>throat,</b> bundle of tubes and pore network model. The first two levels of analysis comprise microscopic effects of the contact angle, whereas the pore network also includes macroscopic effects due to the connectivity characteristics of the network. For this reason, percolation theory is used to enhance the understanding of the effect of the connectivity on the flow properties. The pore-scale fluid configuration is influenced by the wettability of the pore walls. However, previous research has not related the conventional wettability definition with the definition from an engineering perspective, which is based on the capillary pressure curve. Therefore, to include wettability effects on the transport properties, the definition of "pore wettability" has been revised such that the curvature of the fluid-fluid interface is consistent with the capillary pressure. As a result, the pore wettability is not solely dependent on the contact angle, but also on the pore geometry. The geometry now plays a crucial role, which implies that it is of high importance that the extraction algorithm provides accurate pore geometries. Modeling results reveal that the contact angle has a negative effect on transport properties in perfectly homogeneous media. However, real rock representations always have a certain degree of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity negatively affects the transport properties, because it decreases the connectivity and thus the conductivity of the network. In presence of permeability contrasts, variation in contact angle influences the pore filling sequence, which affects the transport properties. Snap-off displacements suppress the effect of permeability contrasts, which means that regards oil recovery water-wet systems are favoured over oil-wet systems. In contrast, in case of heterogeneity at pore-level, snap-off leads to oil entrapment and has a negative effect on the residual oil saturation. This implies that oil recovery improves at increasing oil-wetness. For this reason, maximum oil recovery is obtained under intermediate-wet conditions. Since heterogeneities {{play an important role in}} snap-off, the optimum wetting state is dependent on the network topology. When aging is taken into account, an opposite flow behaviour is observed. Transport properties are positively - instead of negatively - affected by an increasing contact angle. These conflicting results might be an explanation for the inconsistent experimental results. Since capillary dominated flow neglects differences in displacement rates, further research is required to investigate the effect of contact angle variation in the presence of dynamic forces. Furthermore, a dynamic model would allow mobilization of the trapped oil phase, which enhances the accuracy of the oil recovery predictions. The size of the oil clusters might provide an indication on the obilization of the oil entrapment. Petroleum EngineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Under the U. S. Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Program (Round 3), {{a project}} was {{completed}} to demonstrate control of boiler emissions that comprise acid rain precursors, especially NOX. The project involved operating gas reburning technology combined with low NO, burner technology (GR-LNB) on a coal-fired utility boiler. Low NOX burners {{are designed to}} create less NOX than conventional burners. However, the NO, control achieved is {{in the range of}} 30 - 60 - 40, and typically 50 %. At the higher NO, reduction levels, CO emissions tend to be higher than acceptable standards. Gas Reburning (GR) is designed to reduce the level of NO. in the flue gas by staged fuel combustion. When combined, GR and LNBs work in harmony to both minimize NOX emissions and maintain an acceptable level of CO emissions. The demonstration was performed at Public Service Company of Colorado's (PSCO) Cherokee Unit 3, located in Denver, Colorado. This unit is a 172 MW. wall-fired boiler that uses Colorado bituminous, low-sulfur coal and had a pre GR-LNB baseline NOX emission of 0. 73 lb/ 1 Oe Btu. The target for the project was a reduction of 70 percent in NOX emissions. Project sponsors included the U. S. Department of Energy, the Gas Research Institute, Public Service Company of Colorado, Colorado Interstate Gas, Electric Power Research Institute, and the Energy and Environmental Research Corporation (EER). EER conducted a comprehensive test demonstration program over a wide range of boiler conditions. Over 4, 000 hours of operation were achieved. Intensive measurements were taken to quantify the reductions in NOX emissions, the impact on boiler equipment and operability, and all factors influencing costs. The results showed that GR-LNB technology achieved excellent emission reductions. Although the performance of the low NOX burners (supplied by others) was somewhat less than expected, a NOX reduction of 65 % was achieved at an average gas heat input of 180 A. The performance goal of 70 % reduction was met on many test runs, but at higher gas heat inputs. The impact on boiler equipment was determined to be very minimal. Toward the end of the testing, the flue gas recirculation (used to enhance gas penetration into the furnace) system was removed and new high pressure gas injectors were installed. Further, the low NOX burners were modified and gave better NO. reduction performance. These modifications resulted in a similar NO, reduction performance (64 %) at a reduced level of gas heat input (- 13 Yo). In addition, the OFA injectors were re-designed to provide for better control of CO emissions. Although not a part of this project, the use of natural gas as the primary fuel with gas reburning was also tested. The gas/gas reburning tests demonstrated a reduction in NOX emissions of 43 % (0. 30 lb/ 1 OG Btu reduced to 0. 17 lb/ 1 OG Btu) using 7 % gas heat input. Economics are a key issue affecting technology development. Application of GR-LNB requires modifications to existing power plant equipment and as a result, the capital and operating costs depend largely on site-specific factors such as: gas availability at the site, gas to coal delivered price differential, sulfur dioxide removal requirements, windbox pressure, existing <b>burner</b> <b>throat</b> diameters, and reburn zone residence time available. Based on the results of this CCT project, EER expects that most GR-LNB installations will achieve at least 60 % NOX control when firing 10 - 15 % gas. The capital cost estimate for installing a GR-LNB system on a 300 MW, unit is approximately $ 25 /kW. plus the cost of a gas pipeline (if required). Operating costs are almost entirely related to the differential cost of the natural gas compared to coal...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} global energy scenario, gas turbine can provide {{delicate}} {{balance between the}} booming worlds energy requirement and a pollutant free sustainable society. Cleaner combustion of fuel (particular natural gas), efficient, reliable, low maintenance and cost effective operation of gas turbine attracted scientific community to push the limit further (high efficiency and zero emission gas turbine). Gas turbine combustion process is complex by nature as it interacts with turbulence, chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. The combined effect directly affects the component life and cost. To gain deeper understanding and develop new eco-friendly combustion technology, continuous effort has been made from last couple of decades. In the present doctoral thesis, a downscaled prototype dry low emission technology burner was extensively investigated experimentally. The thesis also aims to compare the experimental results with numerical calculations using commercial simulation tools. The main priority of the research work {{was to understand the}} flame stabilization, flame anchoring physics, the burner operational limits and emission performance. The gas turbine burner hardware was assembled with three distinct fuel and sir supply units. Along the centerline, a primary combustion zone, the RPL (Rich-Pilot-Lean) was placed. A Pilot and Main stage was placed radially outward direction from the centerline. A secondary combustion (the main flame) zone was produced downstream of the <b>burner</b> <b>throat.</b> The primary and secondary flames were stabilized by the swirling motion of the flow. Vortex breakdown and recirculation zones assisted the steady combustion process. Several conventional measurement techniques were employed for temperature and emission (Carbon monoxide, Nitrogen oxides and unburned hydrocarbons) measurement. The experimental work in this thesis also included sophisticated optical measurement. A visually accessible liner (combustor region with diverging Quarl section) allowed optical access of the secondary flame region to analyze and record the flame characteristics. Line of sight Chemiluminescence (of hydroxyl radical), two dimensional hydroxyls radical planar laser induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry diagnostic techniques were applied to investigate the secondary combustion (flame front and flow). All the experiments were conducted at atmospheric condition without any fuel heating. Chemical kinetic calculations were performed using CHEMKIN software for comparing the emission results. Steady and un-steady three dimensional computational fluid dynamic studies were conducted using ANSYS FLUENT. The RPL combustion produced a hot gas stream and provided radicals in to the secondary combustion zone (in the vicinity of forward recirculation zone). Initially, a dedicated experiment was conducted to explore the operability of the RPL combustor (primary zone) by varying the equivalence ratios and co-flow air properties. Results suggested that a slight rich operation could produce maximum radicals (Carbon monoxide, hydroxyls, oxygen and hydrogen radicals) from the RPL without affecting nitrogen oxides emission. The main flame (secondary combustion zone) stabilization process indicated that the secondary flame was stabilized around the inner shear layer (where the incoming reactant stream and recirculated hot gas stream interacted with each other) and near the liner wall (reactant stream impinged the liner wall). The lean and rich operability limits were identified from the full burner experiments. A sharp increase of carbon monoxide concentration was noticed in the proximity of lean blowout equivalence ratio (~ 0. 40). Low frequency high amplitude flame pulsation was also observed at this operating point. Flame instability and flash back tendency was observed at higher stoichiometry (~ 0. 62). The Pilot and RPL stage combustion influenced the full burner flame and emission characteristics. Interaction between Pilot stages were investigated and results suggested that rich Pilot operation was helpful for stabilizing the main flame at very lean stoichiometric combustion with an emission penalty (Nitrogen oxides concentration was increased). Lean RPL operation showed emission benefits but flame instability was increased; therefore, burner operation window was compressed. Two dimensional hydroxyls radical planar laser induced fluorescence diagnostics identified the main reaction zone (captured the super-equilibrium hydroxyl concentration) and post flame region (where relaxed hydroxyl radicals were noticed in less concentration). The maximum heat release zones were identified by the Chemiluminescence imaging. An investigation of combustor geometrical modification (aerodynamic variation) and its effect on flame characteristic was accomplished removing diverging Quarl geometry and replacing square liner with a circular cross section. The Quarl combustor arrangement demonstrated better combustion stability and wider operating window. Without Quarl, a third flame was observed from the outer recirculation zone. Outer recirculation zone flame intermittency and coupling with inner (central recirculation zone) flame structure produced high level of combustion dynamics issues. High hydrogen fuel (up to 50 % hydrogen by volume was mixed with methane) mixtures were introduced in the prototype burner. High hydrogen concentration aided a lean flame (100 K blowout benefit with 50 % hydrogen addition) operation without blowout. In addition, flow field diagnostics were carried out using two dimensional particle image velocimetry. The key flow structures (central and outer recirculation zones, shear layer, high speed swirl annular jet and vortical structures) were identified. The velocity measurement and radical concentration imaging explained the local wrinkling and dynamics of the flame structure. A preliminary effort was demonstrated to model the full burner with numerical three dimensional calculations. Different combustion (laminar flamelet and flamelet generated manifold) and turbulence model (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, Scale adaptive simulation and large eddy simulation) were implemented in ANSYS FLUENT computation. Numerical calculation added value to the experimental results by providing a detail understanding of scalar and vector fields, especially from the locations, where optical diagnostic was not possible. The computed flame structure and flow futures were compared with the experimental results. A simplified reactor based modelling was also formulated based on computational simulation results. The aim was to investigate simulation techniques conceptually that could possibly be applied in coming studies to obtain a better numerical modeling and validation activities of turbulent gas turbine combustion design and development...|$|R
