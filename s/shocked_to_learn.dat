5|$|Hesketh-Prichard was <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> of {{the high}} {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of concealment. He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E
5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) {{travel to}} Travelers Rest, South Carolina to {{investigate}} the deaths of film director Lew Carroll (Paul Stanley) and Marta Danbury, the leading actress in his newest film. As the local sheriff guides Black and Hollis through the murder scene, Black realizes that the film {{is based on a}} real murder case he investigated thirteen years previously; he is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that the true story is being sensationalized for the screen.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E
60|$|Then his {{thoughts}} reverted to Fay Larkin. Could this girl be {{known to the}} Mormons? It was possible. Fay Larkin was an unusual name. Deep into Shefford's heart had sunk the story Venters had told. Shefford found that he had unconsciously created a like romance--he had been loving a wild and strange and lonely girl, like beautiful Bess Venters. It was a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the truth, but, {{as it had been}} only a dream, it could hardly be vital.|$|R
2500|$|Funding {{problems}} surfaced {{after the}} design was completed. Portland mayor Frank Ivancie led some downtown business owners and other influential citizens in opposing {{the concept of}} an open (instead of enclosed) public square, based on concerns that an open design would attract transients to the area. [...] Former Governor Tom McCall, who by then was a television commentator, was indignant: [...] "It would be a <b>shock</b> ... <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that a few power brokers have decreed that the result of the nationwide design rivalry is meaningless..." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Clare had quietly stolen away and {{was sitting on a}} balcony in the dark, {{tingling}} with anger and humiliation. She imagined that she had banished Brandon from her thoughts and was alarmed to find that he had still power to wound her. It had been a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> he believed that she had stolen his papers; but he had now warned his companion against her father and no doubt herself. Jake's manner when questioned had seemed to indicate this.|$|R
5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with {{a gathering of}} wealthy political allies. Angela is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert {{she did not want}} him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert is in love with him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand in a spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E
5|$|Jealous of Sathya Murthy's {{influence}} on Raju, Rathnam (V. K. Ramasamy) {{and his wife}} (Manorama) hide Vimala's diamond necklace in Sathyamurthy's suitcase {{in an effort to}} get rid of him. Vimala, upset at losing her necklace, searches the house for it. When Raju, Sundaram, Gowri, and Sathyamurthy return after attending a conference in Kodaikanal, Vimala, acting on Rathnam's provocation, orders that Sathyamurthy's suitcase is searched. When the necklace is found in it, Raju throws Sathyamurthy out of his house, despite Sathyamurthy proclaiming his innocence. Gowri then shows Parvathi's photograph to Raju, who is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that Sathyamurthy is his own son. Raju reveals the truth about Parvathi to Vimala, who also accepts Sathyamurthy as her son. Before Raju and Vimala rush to bring Sathyamurthy back, Raju learns of a fire breaking out in one of his mills. Sathyamurthy, unhappy of being wrongly accused by Raju, attempts suicide by entering the burning mill. Raju saves Sathyamurthy in time and reveals the truth about his birth to him. The family is united and Sathyamurthy marries Gowri.|$|E
5|$|It is {{explained}} that, {{in the aftermath}} of her being left by Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) at the altar, Yang spent her honeymoon travelling with Meredith. Having just returned, she is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that Burke has resigned from Seattle Grace, and relocated to an unknown location. Stevens has to deal with her romantic feelings for O'Malley, whose marriage to Torres is being threatened by his yet to be exposed affair. O'Malley, who finds himself in the unpleasant situation of repeating his internship, quickly gains support in Lexie, who decides not to tell the fellow interns about his failed exam. Karev is revealed to have visited Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), following her departure. In the absence of Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), who relocated to Los Angeles, California, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) seeks reconciliation with Shepherd, formerly his closest friend and confidant. Initially unwilling to resume his friendship with Sloan, Shepherd ultimately gives him a second chance. Bailey manifests a cold attitude towards Webber, in order to express her disappointment in not being considered for the position of Chief Resident, in spite of her enviable reputation among the hospital staff. Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she becomes aware of her apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives.|$|E
60|$|After {{all that}} {{had been told to}} me about the elder Bawcombe's life and character, it came {{somewhat}} as a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that at one period during his early manhood he had indulged in one form of poaching--a sport which had a marvellous fascination for the people of England in former times, but was pretty well extinguished during {{the first quarter of the}} last century. Deer he had taken; and the whole tale of the deer-stealing, which was a common offence in that part of Wiltshire down to about 1834, sounds strange at the present day.|$|R

In a statement, he says [...] "he joins world leaders in expressing sympathy {{to the families of}} the victims of MH17, and strongly condemns the horrendous act of terrorism against innocent global citizens. He supports the call of world leaders for an international independent investigation into the gunning down of the plane to find out the perpetrators and those that were found to carry out the unspeakable act must face justice". Adding [...] "the Government and people of Solomon Islands were in <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> of the act of terrorism, and join the rest of the world in mourning the loss of the innocent lives on the MH17 flight".|$|R
5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E
5|$|Lindsey later {{reveals that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joe's baby. Joe admits this but tells Mercedes he still {{wants to be with}} her. Mercedes believes him, however Lindsey makes Mercedes feel as though she is interrupting on a perfect family with her and Joe. Mercedes then breaks up with Joe, and leaves the village. She returns two months later, and is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that Lindsey's younger sister, Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis), has been imprisoned for killing seven patients at the local hospital. Kim's ex-girlfriend, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) and herself a victim of the killer when they tried to murder her, attempts to convince Mercedes of Kim's innocence. Mercedes and Esther realise that Lindsey is the serial killer after discovering Lindsey's earring is matching to the earring which was dropped when Esther was attacked. Mercedes confronts Lindsey but she denies this. Lindsey writes a fake letter pretending to be Kim admitting to be the serial killer and telling Esther to leave her alone. Mercedes sees the letter which has doodles on it, and when she is alone with Cindy and Lindsey, she realises that the doodles are the same as those in Lindsey's notebook. Her and Cindy realise that Lindsey is the serial killer and confront her. Lindsey confesses to the murders and attempted murders, and then strikes both Mercedes and Cindy with a large book, knocking them unconscious. She then escapes the village. Mercedes is desperate for Lindsey to be caught and for Joe's baby son, JJ, not be abducted, and moves back in with Joe and Freddie. When Silas hears about what Lindsey's murders, he returns to the village and begins working with Lindsey. Silas plans to finally kill Mercedes, however Mercedes convinces Silas to kill Lindsey instead, informing him of her sinful ways. Her plan works and Silas murders Lindsey instead and Mercedes manages to escape.|$|E

It was because Angel's goons once again started trouble and Frank tells Jacques that {{she ended up}} having a massive heart attack, yelling for Martin. Maria has learned what Jacques had been doing and she realizes that she can trust him and divulges the truth about Pedro's death and why the streets are no longer safe. When Maria and Jacques are shot at by Angel and his gang, Jacques turns to Henry and his wife to help protect Maria and Martin. Henry finds a connection with Mr. Park, a Korean gang boss who knows of all the gangs. He warns Henry and Jacques that Angel can be intimidated, but it is his gunfire that gives him his power.|$|R
40|$|In {{celebration of}} MBoC’s first 20 years, {{members of the}} Editorial Board, members of the ASCB Council, and others comment on their {{favorite}} MBoC papers from the past two decades. Who {{would have thought that}} the motor domain of a motor was dispensable? Nonmuscle myosin II has long been implicated in provid-ing the contractile force to constrict the actomyosin ring during cytokinesis. So it was quite a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that myosin II could promote ring assembly and constriction (albeit a bit more slowly than wild-type) without its motor-domain “head ” in budding yeast! The key finding here was serendipitous and illustrates the importance of good controls: the intent was to investigate structure–function relationships among dif-ferent myosins, and the big surprise came from analysis of the “headless ” control (Lord et al., 2005). Subsequent work from other labs showed the myosin tail helps IQGAP to assemble the actin ring, and the force for ring constriction comes from inward squeezing by extracel...|$|R
50|$|While all of {{this takes}} place Madea enters with her usual flair and quickly cuts through all the lies and secrets and forces {{everyone}} to see their situations {{in a new light}} giving aid and advice to all. They save the Jeffrey's marriage through the timely interruption of a would be affair with Anne by forcing the woman away and reminding the husband that he stilled loved his wife. Madea convinces Stephanie to break free of her husband and in so doing gain her independence, her self-respect, and a measure of revenge for all the years of abuse. In so doing Stephanie also reconciles with her mother healing their bond. Throughout Madea battles Anne and during a visit to the spa with Diana reveals the relationship between Anne and Diana's husband. Diana confronts Anne and is <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>learned</b> she has given the man a child and in response she kicks her husband out of her life and turns her life over to God.|$|R

In his own words:The scattered Jewish components of my ancestry {{would have given}} nightmares to assessors trying to apply the Nuremberg Laws, and although pleased to have these fractions, I had not previously given much thought to them or to Jewish culture. It was at this stage that I became intrigued - in a Romantic way - {{in this part of}} my 'roots'. I started looking into ancient Jewish history and - [...] being on the periphery myself - into the relationship between the Israelites and the surrounding peoples, particularly the Canaanites and the Phoenicians.

[...] It comes with rather a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that in Hawaii the obscure martyrdom-seeking missionary sits {{at the head of}} the table of the moneyed aristocracy. But it is true. The humble New Englanders who came out in the third decade of the nineteenth century, came for the lofty purpose of teaching the kanakas the true religion, the worship of the one only genuine and undeniable God. So well did they succeed in this, and also in civilizing the kanaka, that by the second or third generation he was practically extinct. This being the fruit of the seed of the Gospel, the fruit of the seed of the missionaries (the sons and the grandsons) was the possession of the islands themselves,--of the land, the ports, the town sites, and the sugar plantations: The missionary who came to give the bread of life remained to gobble up the whole heathen feast.|$|R

He was found guilty on all charges (murder and five counts of piracy). He was hanged on 23 May 1701, at Execution Dock, Wapping, in London. During the execution, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd was hanged on the second attempt. His body was gibbeted over the River Thames at Tilbury Point – as a warning to future would-be pirates – for three years.|$|E

Napoleon III had let precious months peel away {{in trying to}} complete the transaction, allowing Bismarck time to rally support to Prussia's objection. To mediate the dispute, the United Kingdom hosted the London Conference (1867) attended by all European great powers. It confirmed Luxembourg's independence from the Netherlands and guaranteed its independence from all other powers. War {{appeared to have been}} averted, at the cost of thwarting French desires.|$|E
60|$|Dick went out, {{and when}} he had sent Jake down, leaned upon the steamer's rail lost in thought. It had been a <b>shock</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> of his cousin's treachery, but this was {{balanced}} by the relief of knowing that Clare was innocent. Indeed, he grew hot with shame as he wondered how he had suspected her. He felt angry with Kenwardine for keeping him in the dark so long, but his indignation was tempered by a touch of grim amusement. Since the fellow was ambitious for Clare, he must have regretted having destroyed the plans when he learned that Dick's father was rich, but after conniving at the theft he could not put matters right. Now, when his career was ended, he was willing, for his daughter's sake, to clear Dick's name and help him to regain the station he had lost. But Dick was not sure he wished to regain it just yet. He had been turned out of the army; his father, who had never shown much love for him, had been quick to believe the worst; and he was bound for a time to a man who had befriended him.|$|R

However, most studies report only simple associations of conditioned stimuli (CS, e. g., odor) with unconditioned stimuli (US, e. g., electric <b>shock)</b> <b>to</b> measure <b>learning</b> or establish memory. Here we describe a straightforward second-order conditioning (SOC) protocol that further demonstrates the flexibility of fly behavior. In SOC, a previously conditioned stimulus (CS 1) is used as reinforcement for a second conditioned stimulus (CS 2) in associative learning.

I quite understood {{when she said that}} she could not face the night upon the impression of that scene. Mrs. Haldin had given way to most awful imaginings, to most fantastic and cruel suspicions.
