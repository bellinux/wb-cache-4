5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.|$|E
5|$|Because I {{always try}} <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in}} the game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E

5|$|The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several {{victories}} at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, but {{in northern}} Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian {{forces to the}} border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of Igloo White/Commando Hunt, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That {{is not to say}} the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force was not about to surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E

5000|$|It {{comprises}} eight extinction [...] "datum points"—the {{first four}} being regularly spaced, every 30,797 years, and {{linked to the}} Milankovic obliquity cycle. The fifth and sixth probably reflect maxima in the precessional cycles, with periods of around 16.5 and 19 ka. The final two data are much further spaced, <b>so</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> link with Milankovic changes.|$|R
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
25|$|Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or {{overlapped}} {{to create}} second-generation subgenres. The blurring {{between the lines}} of the subgenres is what makes the long poem <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> define, but it also marks the growing creativity {{in the use of the}} form.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason it}} is <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> have {{statistics}} for female-assigned cross-dressers {{is that the}} line where cross-dressing stops and cross-dressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is as well defined as ever. This {{is one of the}} many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day masculist movement.|$|E

25|$|The WTUL was, on {{the other}} hand, mistrustful of the National Woman's Party, with its more individualistic, rights-oriented {{approach}} to woman's equality. The WTUL was strongly opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment drafted by the NWP {{after the passage of}} the Nineteenth Amendment on the ground that it would undo the protective legislation that the WTUL had fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> obtain.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to {{some poor}} weather and some {{resolute}} Australian batting {{on the last}} day the Test was a draw, leaving the teams 0–0. Even though the first two Tests had been drawn the press were optimistic about the series. Lindsay Hassett said it wasn't the best team England had sent to Australia, but no other tried <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make cricket interesting.|$|E
25|$|This misfortune, {{which for}} a time seemed so bitter and was <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> bear, {{has proved to be}} a blessing in disguise. The cruel blow which blighted the joys of earth, was the means of turning my eyes to heaven. I might never had known Jesus Christ, had not the sorrow that clouded my early years led me to seek comfort in him.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the roughly}} equal {{participation}} of the sexes in nest building and incubation, analysis has shown clearly that males alone select {{the location of the}} nest. This pattern has the important consequence that male loons, but not females, establish significant site-familiarity with their territories that allows them to produce more chicks there over time. Sex-biased site-familiarity might explain, in part, why resident males fight <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> defend their territories.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} any packing {{arrangement}} that disproved the Kepler conjecture {{would have to}} be an irregular one. But eliminating all possible irregular arrangements is very difficult, and this is what made the Kepler conjecture <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> prove. In fact, there are irregular arrangements that are denser than the cubic close packing arrangement over a small enough volume, but any attempt to extend these arrangements to fill a larger volume always reduces their density.|$|E
25|$|If {{there exists}} a minimal {{sufficient}} statistic, and this is usually the case, then every complete sufficient statistic is necessarily minimal sufficient(note that this statement does not exclude the option of a pathological {{case in which a}} complete sufficient exists while there is no minimal sufficient statistic). While it is hard to find cases in which a minimal sufficient statistic does not exist, it is not <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find cases {{in which there is no}} complete statistic.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate {{need for}} war {{materiel}} {{played a very}} significant role in its decision to move its capital from Montgomery, Alabama to Richmond in May 1861, despite its dangerous northern location 100 {{miles south of the}} United States capital in Washington, DC. It was mainly for this industrial reason that the Confederates fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> defend the city. The capital of the Confederacy could easily be moved again if necessary, but Richmond's industry and factories could not be moved.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E
25|$|Nariakira {{did not see}} eye to {{eye with}} his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father’s chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were wary of the Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho also saw many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had a great interest in Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having worked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with the shogunate.|$|E
