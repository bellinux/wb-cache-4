5|$|<b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard,</b> the {{headquarters}} of London's Metropolitan Police Service, was originally located in Great <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> off the north-eastern end of Whitehall. The buildings had been lodgings for the Kings of Scotland, on {{part of the old}} Palace of Whitehall's grounds; by the 19th century, Little and Middle <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> had been merged into Whitehall Place, leaving only Great <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard.</b> No.4 Whitehall Place had become vacant by the 1820s, which allowed Sir Robert Peel to use it as the main headquarters when forming the police in 1829. It was formally named the Metropolitan Police Office, but became quickly known as Great <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard,</b> and eventually <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard.</b> The buildings were damaged in a series of bombings by Irish Nationalists in 1883, and an explosion from a Fenian terrorist attack on 30 May 1884 blew a hole in Scotland Yard's outer wall and destroyed the neighbouring Rising Sun pub. The headquarters was moved away from Whitehall in 1890.|$|E

In 1992, {{his former}} girlfriend Kathy Etchingham asked British {{authorities}} {{to reopen the}} investigation into his death. A subsequent inquiry by <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> proved inconclusive, and in 1993, they decided against proceeding with the investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{rejection}} of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying a child that night, this one reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland. <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine's kidnap.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{begins a}} few moments after Dracula ends. Count Dracula has just been {{destroyed}} by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is taken by police to <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard,</b> where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because {{he had already been}} dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger), who was once one of his star students.|$|E
5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A {{in the days leading}} up to the disappearance and on the day itself. <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.|$|E

5|$|<b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> {{released}} the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction. After it had aired, The Sunday Times published that the McCanns {{had had the}} e-fits since 2008. In response the couple sued the newspaper for having implied (wrongly) {{that they had not}} only failed to publish them but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> {{suspected}} Martin {{of having}} separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed {{with his wife}} about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while on holiday on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall {{is believed to have}} been murdered as he slept and his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused to be interviewed by <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which he disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk police {{linked the}} killings and {{launched}} a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Sumac. Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter acknowledged that Suffolk Constabulary would be reliant on external assistance owing to {{the magnitude of the}} investigation. A senior investigator with the Metropolitan Police, Commander Dave Johnston, was reported to have been drafted into the murder inquiry team from <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> in London in an advisory capacity. The day-to-day investigation was conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Stewart Gull.|$|E

5|$|There {{was nothing}} to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he {{received}} £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was {{the largest number of}} separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard.</b> In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard,</b> along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.|$|E
5|$|Between late 1962 {{and early}} 1964 the east {{ends of the}} {{platforms}} were extended to allow longer 8-car trains to be operated. This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police's original headquarters at New <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level platforms for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, {{the level of the}} sub-surface platforms was lowered to enable ground level access to Portcullis House. This was achieved in small increments which were carried out when the line was closed at night.|$|E
5|$|Chief Constable Dewar sent a {{telegraph}} {{detailing the}} circumstances of the crime to the London Metropolitan Police, which was investigating the crimes attributed to Jack the Ripper. Detectives from London did not consider Bury a realistic suspect in their investigation into the Ripper murders, but Inspector Frederick Abberline did interview witnesses in Whitechapel connected to Bury, including William's former employer James Martin and landlords Elizabeth Haynes and William Smith. According to the executioner James Berry and crime reporter Norman Hastings, <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> sent two detectives to interview Bury, but there is no surviving record of the visit in the police archive.|$|E

50|$|Whitehall 1212 was {{a weekly}} crime drama radio {{show in the}} United States that ran from November 18, 1951 until September 28, 1952. Its cases {{were taken from the}} files of <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard's</b> Black Museum.|$|R
5|$|In 1608–09, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton built a {{house on}} {{the eastern side of the}} former Chapel and Hospital of St. Mary Rounceval, at Charing Cross, {{including}} gardens running to the River Thames and adjoining <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> to the west. The estate became the property of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland when he married Howard's great-great niece, Lady Elizabeth, in 1642, whereupon it was known as Northumberland House. In turn, the street was named Northumberland Street. The house was damaged in the Wilkes' election riots of 1768, but was saved after its owner, Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland opened the nearby Ship Ale House, driving off rioters.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, having {{arranged}} for a private investigation of Hendrix's death, Etchingham supplied {{the results of the}} effort to UK authorities and requested they reopen the coroner's inquest. After a several-month inquiry by <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard,</b> during which every interested party to the events was interviewed, officials were confident the request would be granted. The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, {{due in part to the}} excessive time that had passed since Hendrix's death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E
50|$|In September 2006, it was {{reported}} that Turner had been interviewed under police caution under <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard's</b> ongoing cash for peerages inquiry, but was found innocent of alleged charges after being questioned four times by police.|$|R

5|$|Madeleine {{was born}} in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At the request of her parents, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court {{statutory}} powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye. In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> commissioned one of her at age nine.|$|E
5|$|Robert Anderson was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent Thomas Arnold, {{who was in charge}} of H (Whitechapel) Division, went on leave on 2 September. Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co-ordinate the investigation from <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard.</b> A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was taken into custody on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most common}} {{radiation}} sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation, but {{large amounts of}} alpha particles which do not penetrate even {{a sheet of paper}} or the epidermis of human skin, and is therefore invisible to normal radiation detectors. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard</b> at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation which can cause radiation damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon. Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{investigation by}} the Kenyan police {{was supported by the}} arrival on 21 February of Detective Superintendent John Troon of <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard's</b> International Organised Crime Branch, accompanied by two other detectives and a Home Office forensic pathologist.|$|R
25|$|<b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard's</b> {{files on}} the case were {{initially}} {{closed to the public}} for 75 years, and would have remained so until 2033. Following a request by historian Pamela Cullen, special permission was granted in 2003 to reopen the files.|$|R
50|$|The Dr. Priestley novels {{were among}} the first after Dr Thorndyke to feature {{scientific}} detection of crime, such as analysing the mud on a suspect's shoes. Desmond Merrion is an amateur detective who works with <b>Scotland</b> <b>Yard's</b> Inspector Arnold.|$|R
