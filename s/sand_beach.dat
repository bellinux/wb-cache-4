5|$|The {{prolonged}} westward {{track of}} Hurricane Fefa produced swells {{of up to}} 15feet (4.5m) in height. The swells hit eastward facing beaches along the island of Hawaii. The swells washed debris and sea water onto coastal roads near Punaluu Black <b>Sand</b> <b>Beach,</b> resulting in the roads being closed following the storm. Southwestern Maui experienced rough surf, as well. Despite being a weak tropical depression and a tropical wave while moving through the Hawaiian Islands, Fefa produced locally strong wind gusts of up to 50mph (80km/h) in the islands of Hawaii and Maui.|$|E
5|$|Wagener County Park {{is located}} off M-25 in the {{community}} of Helena. M-25 begins to curve to the northwest in <b>Sand</b> <b>Beach</b> near the Rock Falls Cemetery. In the city of Harbor Beach, M-25 is called Huron Avenue and meets M-142 for the first of two occasions. Here is the Harbor Beach Golf Course {{on the south side of}} town as M-25 moves inland through town. North of town, the trunkline parallels an old routing of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway as it is once again renamed Lakeshore Road. The highway moves farther inland north of Rubicon and Port Hope as it begins to round the tip of the Thumb. In Grindstone City, M-25 loses the Lakeshore Road name in favor of Grindstone Road all the way to Port Austin.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. Army Group B, under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock, {{attacked}} into Belgium, {{while the}} three Panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung {{around to the}} south and drove for the Channel. The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the River Dyle within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May. They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the Scheldt River on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold. During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves. On 19 May, Gort met with French General Gaston Billotte, commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities. Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest <b>sand</b> <b>beach</b> in Europe, where large groups could assemble. After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at Arras to cut through the German spearhead, the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the island}} is covered in pine forests, which is the source {{of the island}}'s large lumber industry. The {{northern}} region of the island has low ridges from which marble is quarried, while the southern region is an elevated plain. Agriculture and fishing are the island's main industries, with citrus fruit and vegetables being grown. A black <b>sand</b> <b>beach</b> was formed by volcanic activity.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} cracks formed {{along the southern}} part of the embankment, allowing the acidic tailings solution to penetrate and weaken the embankment. A <b>sand</b> <b>beach</b> was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not properly maintained. Prior to the collapse, the level of the tailings solution in the holding pond had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the <b>sand</b> <b>beach</b> no longer provided the dam protection. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential settlement of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure. United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J. David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the bedrock beneath the embankment, which he said acted as a fulcrum and weakened the dam.|$|E

500|$|Ruislip Lido is a {{nineteenth century}} {{reservoir}} with an artificial <b>sand</b> <b>beach,</b> surrounded by woodlands through {{which runs the}} Ruislip Lido Railway, a miniature 12" [...] gauge railway with diesel and steam locomotives. The Lido was established as a reservoir to feed the Grand Union Canal by damming and flooding {{the lower part of}} the valley between Park Wood and Copse Wood, including the hamlet of Park Hearn. Work began in 1811; the consulting engineer John Rennie announced completion of the project to the Grand Junction Waterworks Company on 5 December that year. Unsuccessful as a canal feeder lake, it was reconstructed as a pleasure resort in 1933.|$|E
40|$|A new {{classification}} of microtidal <b>sand</b> and gravel <b>beaches</b> {{with very different}} morphologies is presented below. In 557 studied transects, 14 variables were used. Among the variables to be emphasized is {{the depth of the}} Posidonia oceanica. The classification was performed for 9 types of beaches: Type 1 : <b>Sand</b> and gravel <b>beaches,</b> Type 2 : Sand and gravel separated beaches, Type 3 : Gravel and <b>sand</b> <b>beaches,</b> Type 4 : Gravel and <b>sand</b> separated <b>beaches,</b> Type 5 : Pure gravel beaches, Type 6 : Open <b>sand</b> <b>beaches,</b> Type 7 : Supported <b>sand</b> <b>beaches,</b> Type 8 : Bisupported <b>sand</b> <b>beaches</b> and Type 9 : Enclosed beaches. For the classification, several tools were used: discriminant analysis, neural networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the results were then compared. As there is no theory for deciding which is the most convenient neural network architecture to deal with a particular data set, an experimental study was performed with different numbers of neuron in the hidden layer. Finally, an architecture with 30 neurons was chosen. Different kernels were employed for SVM (Linear, Polynomial, Radial basis function and Sigmoid). The results obtained for the discriminant analysis were not as good as those obtained for the other two methods (ANN and SVM) which showed similar success...|$|R
