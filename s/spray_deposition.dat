Agricultural flat fan nozzles were tested by testing equipment where individual influence from the nozzle with a constant pressure and transverse distribution of the <b>sprayed</b> liquid <b>deposition</b> were characterized.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, other players {{experienced}} mixed results. Golden Photon held {{the record for}} a short period for the best CdTe module measured at NREL at 7.7% using a <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> technique. Matsushita claimed an 11% module efficiency using CSS and then dropped the technology. A similar efficiency and fate eventually occurred at BP Solar. BP used electrodeposition (inherited from Monosolar by a circuitous route when it purchased SOHIO, Monosolar's acquirer). BP Solar dropped CdTe in the early 2000s. Antec was able to make about 7%-efficient modules, but went bankrupt when it started producing commercially during a short, sharp market downturn in 2002. However, as of 2014 Antec still made CdTe PV modules.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{function}} of a solar cell is the conversion of light energy into electrical energy {{by means of the}} photovoltaic effect. In particular, polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells are promising because of their potential in low processing costs and mechanical flexibility in comparison to conventional inorganic solar cells. Solution processing potentially allows reductions in manufacturing costs through screen printing, doctor blading, inkjet printing, and <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> at low temperatures. To overcome the narrow spectral overlap of organic polymer absorption bands, experiments have blended conjugated polymer donors with high electron affinity fullerene derivatives as acceptors to extend the spectral sensitivity. Ternary solar cells are a promising approach to increased efficiency and light harvesting properties of organic photovoltaic cells (OPV).|$|E

5000|$|Spray forming, {{also known}} as spray casting, <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> and in-situ compaction, is a method of casting near net shape metal {{components}} with [...] microstructures via the deposition of semi-solid sprayed droplets onto a shaped substrate. In spray forming an alloy is melted, normally in an induction furnace, then the molten metal is slowly poured through a conical tundish into a small-bore ceramic nozzle. The molten metal exits the furnace as a thin free-falling stream and is broken up into droplets by an annular array of gas jets, and these droplets then proceed downwards, accelerated by the gas jets to impact onto a substrate. The process is arranged such that the droplets strike the substrate whilst in the semi-solid condition, this provides sufficient liquid fraction to 'stick' the solid fraction together. Deposition continues, gradually building up a spray formed billet of metal on the substrate.|$|E
50|$|A {{graphene}} {{spray gun}} is a kinetic spray system that deposits, through supersonic acceleration, a one atom thick sheet of pure carbon named graphene {{by means of}} a de Laval nozzle, a pinched tube with an hourglass type shape. The system deposits graphene flakes and a hexagonal graphene lattice is created upon impact of the desired surface. The graphene spray gun would be utilized onto large-scale applications such as circuits, radio transmitters, and optical electronics due to the grapehene’s transparency and its remarkable conductivity of electricity. The supersonic spray system was first developed in May 2014 by University of Illinois professor Alexander Yarin, and Korea University professor Sam Yoon. Yarin went to Yoon when he learned about his work regarding kinetic <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> systems. Yarin believed that graphene could be applied to the system {{in order to create a}} layer of the material. After conducting experiments with the newly created system, they concluded that the graphene spray system was a success. The spray gun is still in its early stages of development, but is considered by many scientists and researchers to be the solution of various predicaments that occur when applying graphene onto large-scale products. The most common problem that would transpire within the other methods is that the layer would be uneven and coated by aggregations. The energy delivered by the supersonic spraying stretches the graphene evenly upon impact, and is the main reason for the spray system’s lack of defects that are common within other graphene deposition methods.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> time on optical and morphological properties of P 3 HT: PCBM thin films. The effects of <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> time on the optical and morphological properties of thin films were investigated using optical microscopy, UV-Vis spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM spectra show that the thin films prepared at 10 s <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> time are more uniform while the 15 s and 20 s samples presented coffee ring shapes with inhomogeneous surface formation.

The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the samples increased with increasing <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> time. Based on the absorption results, it is concluded that higher spray coating times result in lower crystallinity of the thin film.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Improved <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> can be {{attained}} by electrostatically charging spray droplets, {{which increases the}} attraction of droplets to plants and decreases operator exposure to pesticide and losses to the environment.

RSC Advances, 7 (87), 55350 – 55359. [URL] microneedles are an attractive way of transdermal delivery of various pharmaceutical compounds. Fabrication of drug-encapsulating polymer microneedles, however, often involves processing conditions unfavorable for maintaining the stability of drugs, including highly concentrated formulations, high temperature and long drying time. The stability of labile substances in biodegradable polymer matrices could also be significantly reduced {{by the use of}} organic solvents and emulsification. In this paper, we reported a new fabrication technique called the dual-nozzle <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> process, which utilizes a separate deposition of drug and polymer solutions, as a potential way to address the stability issue associated with current microneedle fabrication processes. A model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), was successfully incorporated into both water-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microneedles by the dual-nozzle <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> process. The conformational change of BSA examined by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy suggests that the developed process helps maintain the structural stability of BSA during encapsulation in both PVA and PLGA matrices. We anticipate that the dual-nozzle <b>spray</b> <b>deposition</b> process would improve the stability of drugs by reducing adverse interaction with solvents and eliminating the emulsification process.
