5000|$|The {{fuselage}} was a tapered box-girder fabricated from {{welded steel}} tubes, the pilot's seat being under the wings leading edge {{with the engine}} behind him. This was a 50 hp Metallurgique which drove the aircraft's most novel feature, a pair of contra-rotating two bladed propellers driven by a patented 3:1 reduction gearbox.

Lateral control was by means of four small ailerons fitted to the trailing edges of both wings, a feature not found on Voisin's aircraft.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a canard configuration monoplane whose structure made {{extensive use of}} a beam design patented by Fabre. This was a Warren truss girder with all members having a <b>streamlined</b> <b>section.</b> Two of these beams, one above the other and connected by three substantial struts, formed the fuselage of the aircraft. The wing, which had pronounced dihedral and whose leading edge was formed by an exposed Fabre beam, was mounted below {{the rear of the}} upper beam, and the Gnome Omega rotary engine driving a two-bladed pusher Chauvière propeller was mounted behind it. Additional bracing for the wings was provided by kingposts extending down from the leading edge at mid-span. There were two small foreplanes, which, like the wing, had exposed Fabre beams forming their leading edges, one mounted above the upper beam and the second on the strut connecting the two beams. A rectangular rear-mounted rudder was situated above the wing: below the wing there was a similar rectangular fixed surface extending down to the lower fuselage beam. The pilot sat astride the upper fuselage beam. The {{aircraft was}} equipped with three broad floats: one {{at the front of the}} aircraft, the other two mounted on struts extending down from the wing.|$|E

40|$|Slender {{structures}} representing civil, {{mechanical and}} aerospace {{systems such as}} long-span bridges, high-rise buildings, stay cables, power-line cables, high light mast poles, crane-booms and aircraft wings could experience vortex-induced and buffeting excitations below their design wind speeds and divergent self-excited oscillations (flutter) beyond a critical wind speed because these are flexible. Traditional linear aerodynamic theories that are routinely applied for their response prediction are not valid in the galloping, or near-flutter regime, where large-amplitude vibrations could occur and during non-stationary and transient wind excitations that occur, for example, during hurricanes, thunderstorms and gust fronts. The linear aerodynamic load formulation for lift, drag and moment are {{expressed in terms of}} aerodynamic functions in frequency domain that are valid for straight-line winds which are stationary or weakly-stationary. Application of the frequency domain formulation is restricted from use in the nonlinear and transient domain because these are valid for linear models and stationary wind. The time-domain aerodynamic force formulations are suitable for finite element modeling, feedback-dependent structural control mechanism, fatigue-life prediction, and above all modeling of transient structural behavior during non-stationary wind phenomena. This has motivated the developing of time-domain models of aerodynamic loads that are in parallel to the existing frequency-dependent models. Parameters defining these time-domain models can be now extracted from wind tunnel tests, for example, the Rational Function Coefficients defining the self-excited wind loads can be extracted using section model tests using the free vibration technique. However, the free vibration method has some limitations because it is difficult to apply at high wind speeds, in turbulent wind environment, or on unstable cross sections with negative aerodynamic damping. In the current research, new algorithms were developed based on forced vibration technique for direct extraction of the Rational Functions. The first of the two algorithms developed uses the two angular phase lag values between the measured vertical or torsional displacement and the measured aerodynamic lift and moment produced on the section model subject to forced vibration to identify the Rational Functions. This algorithm uses two separate one-degree-of-freedom tests (vertical or torsional) to identify all the four Rational Functions or corresponding Rational Function Coefficients for a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vertical-torsional vibration model. It was applied to a <b>streamlined</b> <b>section</b> model and the results compared well with those obtained from earlier free vibration experiment. The second algorithm that was developed is based on direct least squares method. It uses all the data points of displacements and aerodynamic lift and moment instead of phase lag values for more accurate estimates. This algorithm can be used for one-, two- and three-degree-of-freedom motions. A two-degree-of-freedom forced vibration system was developed and the algorithm was shown to work well for both streamlined and bluff section models. The uniqueness of the second algorithms {{lies in the fact that}} it requires testing the model at only two wind speeds for extraction of all four Rational Functions. The Rational Function Coefficients that were extracted for a <b>streamlined</b> <b>section</b> model using the two-DOF Least Squares algorithm were validated in a separate wind tunnel by testing a larger scaled model subject to straight-line, gusty and boundary-layer wind...|$|E

The loudspeaker consists of 15 pairs of electrodes and a diaphragm with <b>streamlined</b> <b>sections.</b> The acoustic responses {{are affected by}} the arrangement of the electrodes.

The loudspeaker is driven by discrete voltage, which weighted maximum voltage is 8 Vp-p, and sampling frequency is 48 kHz. The acoustic responses with above two cases were examined. In case of (a), the sound pressure level driven by 16 bits digital signal is about 80 dB at 10 cm from the center of diaphragm, the linearity characteristic is more than 80 dB.
