40|$|Purpose 2 ̆ 013 The study {{extends the}} debate on finance versus {{institutions}} in the promotion of investment documented by Acemoglu and Johnson (2005), Ali (2013) and Asongu (2014). We assess the effects of various components of governance on private investment, notably: political, economic and institutional governances. Financial indicators of depth, allocation efficiency, activity and size are used. Design/methodology/approach 2 ̆ 013 An endogeneity robust dynamic system GMM estimation technique is employed. Principal component analysis is also employed to reduce the dimensions of governance variables. The empirical evidence is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996 - 2010. Findings 2 ̆ 013 The findings provide support {{for the quality of}} governance as a better determinant of private investment than financial intermediary development. Moreover, the evidence of finance and governance as substitutes in their impact on investment implies that good governance fuels private investment and this positive impact is stronger in nations with less developed financial systems. This finding is consistent with Ali (2013) and contrary to the results of Asongu (2014 c). Practical implication 2 ̆ 013 Policy measures for fighting involuntary and voluntary <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidities</b> are discussed.

40|$|<b>Surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> occurs where cashflows {{into the}} banking system {{persistently}} exceed withdrawals of liquidity from the market by the central bank. This is reflected in holdings of reserves {{in excess of the}} central bank's required reserves. The occurrence of <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> is widespread, covering many countries around the world. Historically, it has been observed most often in Soviet, wartime and transitional countries. Transitional economies, for example, often attract large capital inflows as the economy opens and undergoes privatisation. The effect of these inflows on liquidity is often magnified by central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market when there is upward pressure on the domestic currency. In the wartime economy, consumption is restricted and large amounts of involuntary savings accumulate until goods and services eventually become more widely available. Soviet-style economies have displayed widespread shortages and administered prices. This creates a situation of repressed inflation, whereby prices are too low relative to the money stock, leaving individuals with excess real balances. The importance of <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> for central banks is threefold and lies in its potential to influence: (1) the transmission mechanism of monetary policy; (2) the conduct of central bank intervention in the money market, and (3) the central bank's balance sheet and income. <b>Surplus</b> <b>Liquidity,</b> Implications,Central Banks...|$|R
40|$|Due to buoyant capital inflows East Asian {{central banks}} with {{exchange}} rate targets accumulate foreign reserves and thereby increase <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity.</b> East Asian central banks with more {{flexible exchange rate}} regimes also face <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> that mainly emanates from past accumulation of foreign reserves. We show based on an augmented Barro-Gordon-type central bank loss function that in both cases <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> limits monetary policy autonomy. In case of fixed exchange rates East Asian central banks can escape from the impossible trinity and gain monetary policy autonomy by using non-market–based sterilization which leads to financial sector distortions. In a flexible exchange rate regime monetary policy autonomy can be gained without financial sector distortions by using market-based sterilization. As central banks face substantial sterilization costs as well as revaluation losses on foreign reserves, however, monetary policy autonomy is eroded. debtor central banks, monetary policy autonomy, sterilization, exchange rate regime, East Asia...|$|R

30|$|The above {{concerns}} {{have led to}} issues of <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> or excess cash in African formal financial institutions (see Saxegaard 2006; Fouda 2009; Asongu 2014 a, p. 70). The authors have suggested measures to curb both the voluntary and involuntary holding of excess liquidity by banks. First, voluntary holding of excess cash can be reduced by: (i) helping banks to track their positions at the central bank {{to prevent them from}} keeping reserves above statutory limits; (ii) consolidating institutions that are favorable to interbank lending; and (iii) improving infrastructure to prevent remote bank branches from holding excess reserves essentially due to transportation problems. Second, involuntary keeping of surplus cash can be kept at minimum by: (i) reducing the incapacity of banks to lend in scenarios where interest rates are regulated; (ii) creating conducive conditions for commercial banks to invest <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> in bond markets; (iii) increasing investment avenues for regional banks via promotion of regional stock exchange markets; and (iv) reducing lending contraction of banks through instruments that encourage competition and mitigate information asymmetry. This line of inquiry is closest to the final point (iii) of the first strand, regarding the improvement of infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|The study {{assesses the}} role of globalization-fuelled {{regionalization}} policies on financial allocation efficiency in four economic and monetary regions in Africa for the period 1980 to 2008. Banking system and financial system efficiencies are used as dependent variables whereas seven bundled and unbundled globalization variables are employed as independent indicators. The bundling exercise is achieved by means of principal component analysis while the empirical evidence is based on interactive Fixed Effects regressions. The following findings are established. First, financial allocation efficiency is more sensitive to financial openness compared to trade openness and most sensitive to globalization. The relationship between allocation efficiency and globalization-fuelled regionalization policies is: (i) Kuznets or inverted U-shape in the UEMOA and CEMAC zones (evidence of decreasing returns to allocation efficiency from globalization-fuelled regionalization) and (ii) U-shape overwhelmingly in the COMESA and scantily in the EAC (increasing returns to allocation efficiency from globalization-fuelled regionalization).

The starting point is the analysis of their balance sheets, which reveal their strong connections, on the one hand, with the National Treasuries; on the other hand, with the financial firms. The balance sheets reveal, besides the monetary policy instruments employed by the Central Bank, its structural liquidity position. If the banking system features a structural liquidity deficit, the Central Bank will provide the required reserves, so as to enforce its policy rate. In the opposite case - as in Brazil and many other developing countries - the Central Bank {{will be in the}} job of absorbing <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity.</b> From the stocks, the paper moves on to flows, analyzing Central Banks' financial results, showing that they crucially depend on the institutions (including the accounting standards) ...|$|R

40|$|The paper scrutinizes {{the reasons}} for the European debt crisis, the {{implications}} for TARGET 2 imbalances and options for <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> absorption within an asymmetric EMU. It is argued that starting from the turn of the millennium diverging fiscal policy paths and diverging unit labour costs were the driving force of rising intra-European current account imbalances within the euro area, which were enhanced by post- 2001 low interest rate policies and changing financing conditions for the German banking sector. The paper shows how since the outbreak of the crisis the adjustment of intra-EMU current account imbalances is postponed by a rising divergence of TARGET 2 balances, as the repatriation of private international credit and deposit flight from the crisis economies is substituted by central bank credit. Given that this process has brought Deutsche Bundesbank into a debtor position to the domestic financial system, we discuss options for liquidity absorption by Deutsche Bundesbank to forestall asset price bubbles in Germany...|$|R
30|$|The long- run {{relationship}} between financial development {{and economic growth}} {{in this study is}} in collaboration with the works of Mandiefe (2015) which shows that improvement in the financial sector consistently mitigates investment and therefore boosts growth in an economy. Hence, the structural reforms such as financial liberalization which was engineered by the IMF in the 1980 s and has been adopted by policy makers in Cameroon play most of the part to financial sector development. The objective of these reforms has been to reduce trade barriers and increase foreign investment in the country (Asongu 2014). However, {{it is interesting to note}} that effective economic freedom has consistently been found to improve on financial allocation efficiency (Asongu 2013 d) which diminishes issues of <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity.</b> This eventually recourse both formal and informal financial services and therefore leads to investment in both formal and informal sectors (Piabuo et al. 2015).

40|$|In the rst essay {{we look at}} the Danish {{interbank market}} and how it functioned during the nancial crisis.

However, the recent nancial crisis was a lot more severe than the one in 1998. During the recent crisis we have seen the volatility of money market rates spike and many central banks have conducted unconventional monetary policies. Whether the interbank markets are robust is thus a relevant question again. A key element in our analysis is that the total amount of liquidity in the interbank market is constant when central bank interventions are absent. A negative shock to one bank's liquidity holdings should correspond with a positive shock for another bank's liquidity holding. In a market with no frictions, banks faced with liquidity shocks should be able to absorb these by borrowing from those with <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity...</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{open market}} {{operation}} (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to give (or take) liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank {{or a group of}} banks.

A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of {{open market operation}}s is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> from commercial banks - to manipulate the short-term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply.

40|$|Purpose - This study {{assesses the}} effect of time-dynamic {{financial}} globalisation uncertainty on financial development in 53 African countries for the period 2000 - 2011. Design/methodology/approach - Financial globalisation uncertainty is estimated as time-dynamic to capture business cycle disturbances while all dimensions identified by the Financial Development and Structure Database of the World Bank are employed, namely: financial depth (money supply and liquid liabilities), financial system efficiency (at banking and financial system levels), financial system activity (from banking system and financial system perspectives) and financial size. The empirical evidence {{is based on the}} Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. Findings - The following findings are established. First, financial globalisation uncertainty does not significantly affect money supply, financial system deposits and financial size. Second, the uncertainty increases banking system efficiency, banking system activity and financial system activity. Moreover, the positive effects are consistently driven by above-median uncertainty levels. Practical implications- It follows that uncertainty in foreign capital flows may be a disguised advantage for domestic financial development, especially in dealing with the substantially documented issue of <b>surplus</b> <b>liquidity</b> in African financial institutions. Moreover, the sceptical view in the financial globalisation literature that 'allocation efficiency' is only plausible in the absence of uncertainty/instability is not substantiated by the findings.
