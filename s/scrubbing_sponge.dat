Due to the use as a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>sponge,</b> it is also known by the common names dishrag gourd, rag gourd, sponge gourd, and vegetable-sponge.

50|$|In {{everyday}} non-technical usage, the luffa, also spelled loofah, {{usually means}} {{the fruit of}} the two species L. aegyptiaca and L. acutangula. The fruit of these species is cultivated and eaten as a vegetable. The fruit must be harvested at a young stage of development to be edible. The vegetable is popular in China and Vietnam. When the fruit is fully ripened, it is very fibrous. The fully developed fruit {{is the source of the}} loofah <b>scrubbing</b> <b>sponge</b> which is used in bathrooms and kitchens. Luffa are not frost-hardy, and require 150 to 200 warm days to mature.|$|E
