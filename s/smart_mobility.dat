We argue that exploiting semantic techniques in mobility data management can bring valuable benefits to many domains characterized by the mobility of users and moving objects in general, such as traffic management, urban dynamics analysis, ambient assisted living, emergency management, m-health, etc. We present the state-of-the-art {{in the domain of}} management of semantic locations and trajectories, and outline research challenges that need to be investigated to enable a full-fledged and intelligent semantic management of moving objects and location-based services that support <b>smarter</b> <b>mobility.</b> We propose a distributed framework for the semantic enrichment and management of mobility data and analyze the potential deployment and exploitation of such a framework.

The 3 rd Florence Intermodal Forum brought together decision makers and stakeholders from the European Commission, national authorities, and operators to discuss the state of play of this development by focussing on the Mobility-as-a-Service paradigm. It did so by discussing the concept, and what it could develop into in the context of congestion problems and changing mobility patterns.

Such possibilities are founded upon an increasingly fine-grained electronic connectivity of people, places and objects allied to powerful data gathering and processing capabilities. Urban mobility {{of the future}} could be transformed, with developments such as: new forms of propulsion; new forms of vehicle control; changing business models of ownership and use; mobile technologies that equip and empower individuals; and opportunities to undertake activities without the need to travel. ‘Smart’ is {{the order of the}} day. <b>Smart</b> urban <b>mobility</b> conjures up a sense of new opportunity; of progress. However, what is really meant by smart? This paper examines this question, revealing a lack of consensus in terms of smart cities and a paucity of literature seeking to make sense of <b>smart</b> urban <b>mobility.</b> The paper considers how smart relates to sustainable, raising concerns about potentially dichotomous constituencies of commentators and discourses. Critical commentary associated with smart includes caution that large corporations are exerting significant influence in the era of smart in pursuit of goals that may not strongly align with those of urban planners concerned with social and environmental sustainability as well as economic prosperity. The paper puts forward and explores the following definition of smart urban mobility: “connectivity in towns and cities that is affordable, effective, attractive and sustainable”.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the “smart mobility” has become {{something}} of a buzz phrase in the planning and transport fields in the last decade. After a fervent first phase in which information technology and digital data were considered the answer for making mobility more efficient, more attractive and for increasing the quality of travel, some disappointing has grown around this concept: the distance between the visionarypotentialthatsmartness is providingis too far from the reality of urban mobility in cities. We argue in particular that two main aspects of <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> should be eluded: the first refers to the merely application to technology on mobility system, what we called the techo-centric aspect; the second feature is the consumer-centric aspect of <b>smart</b> <b>mobility,</b> that consider transport users only as potential consumers of a service. Starting from this, the study critics the <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> approach and applications and argues on a“smarter mobility” approach, in which technologies are only oneaspects of a more complex system. With a view on the urgency of looking beyond technology and beyond consumer-oriented solutions, the study arguments the need for a cross-disciplinary and a more collaborative approach that could supports transition towards a“smarter mobility” for enhancing the quality of life and the development ofvibrant cities. The article does not intend to produce a radical critique of the <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> concept,denying a priori its utility. Our perspectiveisthat the <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> is sometimes used as an evocativeslogan lacking some fundamental connection with other central aspect of mobility planning and governance.

To answer this questions the paper provides in Section 2 the rationale behind the paper;Section 3 provides a literature review that explores the evolution on <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> paradigm in the last decades analysing in details the “techno-centric”and the “consumer-centric” aspects.

40|$|In this research, we {{investigate}} {{the acceptability of}} three new and emerging <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> options and quantify the associated willingness-to-pay values {{in the context of}} Lisbon using a comprehensive stated preferences (SP) survey. The <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> options include shared taxi, one-way car rental, and a novel combination of park-and-ride and school bus facilities. While previous surveys on <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> options had investigated limited number of alternatives in isolation, the SP survey used in this research presents the <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> options alongside the existing options and their traditional variants like congestion pricing and improved public transport systems. Further, the choice of mode, departure time and occupancy are investigated in a multidimensional framework. This resulted a large choice set (with 9 modes, 5 departure times, and 2 occupancy levels leading to 135 alternatives in total) and required a novel survey design. The main survey administered over the internet and computer aided personal interviews included 2372 valid SP observations from 1248 respondents. Multi-dimensional mixed logit models were used to capture the complex correlations introduced due to the non-traditional survey design. Results indicate a significant preference of one-way car rental and shared taxi for non-commute trips. For commute trips, improved versions of traditional public transport modes are favoured over <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> options. These findings, as well as the novel data collection and modelling approach, are expected to provide important information to transportation planners and policy makers working to implement <b>smart</b> <b>mobility</b> options in Lisbon as well as in other cities...|$|E
