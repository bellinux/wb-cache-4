In this case the most suitable actions to be taken for bringing the power system back to acceptable operation conditions are identified by means of a power system management software. The proposed software combines a micro-genetic algorithm (mu GA) optimization procedure with a load-flow program based on the fringing Current correction (FCC) method. The foreseen control actions consist in transformer tap setting, insertion and/or regulation (if variable) of shunt reactor and capacitor banks, change of network configuration, power re-dispatching and load shedding. The performance of the proposed procedure is tested with respect to the main parameters both of electrical power systems and of genetic algorithms (GAs).

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} {{aimed at}} misleading a power <b>system</b> <b>control</b> <b>center</b> about {{the source of}} a data attack is proposed. As a man-in-the-middle state attack, a data framing attack is proposed to exploit the bad data detection and identification mechanisms currently in use at most control centers. In particular, the proposed attack frames meters that are providing correct data as sources of bad data such that the control center will remove useful measurements that would otherwise be used by the state estimator. The optimal design of a data framing attack is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). It is shown that the proposed attack is capable of perturbing the power system state estimate by an arbitrary degree controlling only half of a critical set of measurements that are needed to make a system unobservable. Implications of this attack on power system operations are discussed, and the attack performance is evaluated using benchmark systems.

40|$|Load Shedding plays a {{major role}} as the guard which protects the power system from a disturbance-induced collapse. In Sri Lanka, Ceylon Electricity Board being the major power network authorizer {{practice}} „under-frequency load shedding‟ with the support of under-frequency load shedding relays. There are some drawbacks of this under frequency load shedding scheme which promotes power system authorizers to shift into a computerized power management system to form an „automated load shedding scheme‟. An intelligent load shedding system can provide faster and optimal load relief by utilizing actual operating conditions and knowledge of past system disturbances [1] As the first step in this study, a research survey was done about present load shedding system practiced in Ceylon Electricity Board. Past failure analysis was done to identify major drawbacks of the system. During literature survey characteristics of an intelligent load shedding system were observed and the way of forming an intelligent load shedding system in a power network was studied. Through selection of southern part of CEB network including seven grid substations, two major hydro power plants, two thermal power plants and three mini hydro power plants, model was designed using MATLAB software. Initially a data bank was formed including load data, generation data for the selected network. Load data at each grid substation for a week day, Saturday and for Sunday were formed based on the load equations derived depending on the time of the day (off-peak, day-peak, night-peak). Generation data was adjusted according to the total load requirement. Feeders that can be shed were selected considering the category of load connected at each feeder and categorization by <b>System</b> <b>Control</b> <b>center</b> as high priority feeders and low priority feeders. Coding was built up in MATLAB software after importing excel sheets consisting all the data collected and modeled to create a „Graphical User Interface‟(GUI). Further code was extended for the load shedding process which activates once a power imbalance occurs between generation and demand. Simulation was done for tripping of major hydro power plants which contribute to load shedding process. Further comparisons were done between existing load shedding mechanism which is under frequency load shedding(UFLS) and Intelligent Load Shedding (ILS) mechanism in Power System Simulator for Engineering(PSS/E) software which is the software used by <b>System</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> branch in transmission division for analyzing and simulating power system performance.
