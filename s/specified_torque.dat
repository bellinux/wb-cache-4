40|$|Abstract—We report three {{experiments}} on manual detection of torque variations experienced through a rotary switch. The experiments {{were designed to}} investigate whether torque perception {{was determined by the}} spatial or by the temporal characteristics of the rotary switch. In Experiment I, manual detection thresholds of torque variation were measured with raised sinusoidal torque profiles that varied in spatial period from 2. 8 degree to 180 degree per cycle. In Experiment II, the same was measured for torque profiles that varied in temporal frequency from 2 to 300 Hz. Experiment III was similar to Experiment 1 except that the participants were required to turn the rotary switch at two different speeds for each of seven spatially <b>specified</b> <b>torque</b> profiles (spatial period: 2. 8 degree to 90 degree per cycle).

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{rotating}} machinery it is often necessary to bolt components together with a known preload since the same controls the system dynamics considerably. Since a major percentage bolt tightening torque is resisted by frictional forces especially {{towards the end of}} tightening, and since the coefficient of friction in threads and under the bolt head to a large degree is indeterminate, the best method of ensuring desired clamping load is by measurement of bolt elongation, or by a load cell. However in large number of cases the incorporation of load cell is not practical and bolt elongation is insufficient to allow accurate measurement. ln such cases it becomes necessary to produce the desired end load by applying a <b>specified</b> <b>torque</b> to the bolt leading to the determination of nut factor. for each of the cases Here an attempt has been made to obtain the quantitative values of nut factors for bolted joints as a function of bolt diameter and tightening torque applied on bolted joints. A simple test rig 1 was designed and fabricated for the purpose in which the experiments were conducted. The instrumentation basically includes the monitoring of the bolt tightening torque through the torque wrench, and a load cell measures the clamping force developed in the joint. These experiments were conducted with thrust ball bearing and also without thrust ball bearing; resulting in possible analysis of the friction generated between nut and bolt threads and also between nut-washer surfaces. The results include generation of nut factors and coefficient of friction values developed for different torques and different bolt diameters, by using a mathematical relation which relates the bolt geometry, clamping force and the tightening torque applied.

40|$|Joint contractures {{which do}} not respond to {{conventional}} physiotherapy can be difficult to treat. Serial plastering has been used effectively but is expensive, inconvenient to the patient and does not permit daily hygiene or clinical inspection. A mechanical device has been developed consisting a hinged orthosis which spans the affected joint to which is attached a gas strut to provide a corrective moment about the anatomical joint. Such an arrangement enables prescribed corrective moments to be applied accurately following clinical assessment using routine physiotherapy techniques. The inherently low spring rate of a gas strut ensures that the <b>specified</b> corrective <b>torque</b> is maintained as correction occurs.

In an effort to improve the strength and longevity of the device, a new design has been proposed. This study investigates the mechanical behavior of the new taper-based assembly in comparison to the current hex-based connection for osseointegrated transfemoral implant systems. This was done to better understand the behavior of components under loading, in order to optimize the assembly specifications and improve the useful life of the system. Digital image correlation was used to measure surface strains on two assemblies during static loading in bending. This provided a means to measure deformation over the entire sample and identify critical locations as the assembly was subjected to a series of loading conditions. It provided a means {{to determine the effects of}} tightening specifications and connection geometry on the material response and mechanical behavior of the assemblies. Both osseoinegrated assemblies exhibited improved strength and mechanical performance when tightened to a level beyond the current <b>specified</b> tightening <b>torque</b> of 12 N m.

40|$|Compliant, joint torque {{controlled}} robots {{measure the}} forces and torques at the {{tool center point}} indirectly using their built-in joint torque sensors. This allows robust impedance control but has drawbacks regarding the force sensitivity, which denotes the measurable force changes {{in relation to the}} external applied force variation. Depending on the robot conﬁguration, torque inaccuracies and joint hysteresis have varying impact {{on the quality of the}} measured forces and torques. Joint torque offsets are inﬂuencing the measurement statically, whereas friction related joint hysteresis is changing the detected torques dynamically. Therefore, a bandwidth is introduced, which <b>speciﬁes</b> the measured <b>torque</b> deviation based on joint hysteresis. Since the hysteresis gives a statement about the possible torque variation, it can be used to deﬁne the sensitivity. A method is described, to detect these inﬂuences and transform the insights into Cartesian space. This leads to an improvement of the force measurement accuracy due to offset compensation and the force sensitivity for the manipulator can be estimated according to the hysteresis. An accurate analysis of the Cartesian force sensitivity for impedance controlled robots is inalienable when it comes to applications like automated assembly tasks, where tactile force feedback is used to compensate position inaccuracies of objects. The Cartesian force sensitivity of redundant manipulators is determined using force ellipsoids, which are capable of showing the sensitivity of the force measurement according to the spatial directions at the tool center point.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis aims to enable robots to imitate humans. Learning by imitation is a fundamental part of human behaviour, since it allows humans to acquire motor skills simply by demonstration; seen from a robotic viewpoint you can easily “program” your fellow humans by showing them what to do. Would it not be great if the same mechanism {{could be used to}} program robots? A robot is programmed by <b>specifying</b> the <b>torque</b> of its motors. The torque can be regarded as the force or strength that is the result of muscles contracting or relaxing. Typical approaches to determine motor torques that will lead to a desired behaviour include setting them manually, i. e. on a trial-and-error basis, or specifying them by mathematical equations. Neither of these are intuitive to most humans, so most robot behaviours are programmed by engineers. However, if an engineer was to design a preprogrammed housekeeping robot, it would be very hard to program all the possible behaviours the robot could be expected to perform, even in such a limited domain. It is much more cost-efficient to make the robot learn what to do. This would allow the robot to adapt to its human owner, and not the other way around. Since humans easily learn new behaviours by imitating others, it would be ideal if humans could use the same technique to transfer motor knowledge to robots. I believe {{research in}} this area could be of great help to bridge the human-robot interaction gap that currently exists, so that you could have truly intelligent robots that could assist people in everyday life. To understand imitation learning, knowledge of psychology and neuroscience is required. The {{research in this}} thesis has taken an interdisciplinary approach, studying the desired mechanism on both a behavioural and neuroscientific level. I have focused on imitation in a musical setting. The system can both see and hear, and seeks to imitate the perceived behaviour. The application has been to create an intelligent virtual drummer, that imitates both the physical playing style (i. e. the movement of the arms) as well as the musical playing style (i. e. the groove) of the teacher. The virtual drummer will then both look and sound like a human drummer. The research in this thesis presents a multi-modal architecture for imitation of human movements. I have been working on simulated robots due to limits of time and money, however the principles of my research have been developed in a platformindependent way, so it should be applicable to real robots as well.

5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the <b>specified</b> amount of <b>torque</b> in some <b>specified</b> time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an impact wrench. Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|R
40|$|With {{the notion}} of {{evolving}} current Extended Reach Drilling, this master thesis examines if drilling 20 – 40 km is feasible. Several reservoirs offshore in the area outside of Lofoten {{in the northern part}} of Norway are reachable by 20 – 40 km in horizontal displacement. The term for these excessive lengths is Ultra Extended Reach Drilling (UL–ERD) and is the foundation for this master thesis. To solve this task a "‘Well Path and Drilling Software"’ (WP&D software) is developed to simulate the drilling operation with regard to well path, drilling, running of casing/liner and well service using wire line. Three–dimensional well path design, analysis of loads and stresses experienced, torque and drag calculation and hydraulic calculation used in the software are presented in this master thesis. Attaining UL-ERD demands innovation in all areas of drilling technology. This thesis addresses this by simulating different scenarios in the software, presenting and discussing the results. The well path designed needs least possible dog–legs and azimuthal change to avoid increased frictional forces and contribution from the capstan effect. Drilling with different drill pipe materials like steel, titanium and composite shows the advantage of using lighter materials to reduce torque and drag. The hydraulic requirements to pump down the string is overcome by having 700 bars of working pressure available on mud pumps and the use of large inner diameter of drill pipe. High Equivalent Circulating Densities (ECD) are handled by Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and its Applied Back Pressure (ABP). The flow rate used to maintain a constant annular velocity is valid if hole cleaning is fulfilled throughout the well. Larger inner diameter requires larger outer diameter which leads to excessive ECDs in small holes.

Expandable casing is used to have two lengths of 13 3 / 8 " liner intervals giving the ability of using large inner and outer diameter drill pipe. Setting of casing/liner is performed conventionally using casing/liner filled with mud and unconventionally with fully evacuated casing/liner with nitrogen or casing/liner with mud over nitrogen. The snubbing unit is assumed dimensioned to handle 100 tonnes to get casing/liner down. Rotation of the liner is possible when the absolute density is close to the mud weight in the hole, giving a reduced buoyant weight. Different simulation of inner and outer diameter dimension of drill pipe concludes that an 8 "outer diameter and 7 " inner diameter is the best option for UL-ERD in this thesis. This, incombination of a lighter material such as composite, leads to 40882 meters Measured Depth(MD) at 2506 meters True Vertical Depth (TVD), Horizontal Displacement (HD) of 39501 meters and a Step–Out–ratio of 15, 7. It also has a slight azimuthal change in the well path. The mud pumps deliver 700 bars and the proper flow rate to clean the wellbore using MPD. The casing/liner reaches setting depth and it is possible to run composite wire line with welltractor to perform well service, through the production tubing. Torque and drag calculationsare valid for the <b>specified</b> Make-Up <b>Torque</b> (MUT) of approximately 85 kN. The max limit of 100 kN MUT can be handled by using a tapered drill string. 5 7 / 8 " drill pipe with either steel, titanium or composite can be used to drill multiple wells and join them together to achieve one UL–ERD well. Steel drill pipe is be most preferable with regard to availability and cost. Larger tubular with light drill string material is beneficial when it comes to reducing torque and drag and hydraulic issues in these shorter wells. Obtaining UL–ERD wells in this way requires less modification with regard to the drilling process, since lengths drilled are shorter. The disadvantage is that in a somewhat pristine area as Lofoten, the Health Safety Environment (HSE) issues with drilling offshore is a valid obstacle for not choosing this solution here. This thesis recommends that when having solved the issues with torque and drag, hydraulicrequirement and available equipment, reaching UL–ERD can be performed by drilling fromone location on land, or with multiple wells from several locations on and off land joined into one well. An 8 " composite drill pipe with 7 " inner diameter could be used, lightening the casing/liner to get to setting depth and use composite wire line to perform well service. Recommendations are made on the basis of mud pumps delivering sufficient pump pressure,stronger snubbing units, use of expandable casing, torque and drag is being handled, large hole diameters, larger inner and outer diameters of tubular, the use of a tapered drill string,development and innovation of equipment found vital for the task. </p...|$|R
