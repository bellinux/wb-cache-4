40|$|In the {{conventional}} single-echo three dimension (3 D) time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), it always takes long scan time {{to obtain the}} good images. In addition, high-resolution MRA <b>with</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> requires long echo time (TE). Here, a reverse elliptical centric dual-echo 3 D TOF MRA pulse sequence was developed to reduce the scan time and minimize the effective TE. Dual-echo and reverse elliptical centric acquisition in the phase encoding and slice phase encoding direction were used to reduce the scan time by 61 %. Furthermore, the effective echo time (TE) was also minimized from 4. 8 ms to 4. 1 ms. The developed pulse sequence was tested on clinical MRI systems and the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was measured to evaluate the results. The {{results show that the}} CNR only decrease by 2. 5 % with the scan time reduced to 39 % when compared with {{the conventional}} single-echo 3 D TOF. Compared with the conventional dual-echo 3 D TOF acquisition, the developed pulse sequence brings advantages in three aspects: (1) reduce scan time by 22 %; (2) increase CNR by 10 %; (3) reduce the artifacts induced by dual-echo effects. In addition, while keeping the similar scan time as the conventional single-echo 3 D TOF acquisition, the results show that reverse elliptical centric dual-echo 3 D TOF acquisition increase CNR by 54. 3 %...|$|R

A large cooling water distribution <b>system</b> <b>with</b> <b>flow</b> rate of nearly 10, 000 gpm in the primary circuit and small closed-loop water <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>flow</b> rates of less than 100 gpm are installed at the APS. The central plant houses primary water distribution pumps, heat rejection equipment, and polishing and make-up systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{filtration}} <b>system</b> <b>with</b> high-frequency <b>flow</b> reversal and minimum requirement of water for cleaning routines. The system was developed in the period from 2011 to 2013 and consists of three screen filters and eleven solenoid valves electronically controlled by a controller that operates based on head loss measurements. The following evaluations were carried out: head loss curve as a function of flow rate; filtrating efficiency as a function of solids concentration, frequency of flow reversal and increment in head loss. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial scheme with three replicates and two treatment levels for each factor. The filtration efficiency was equal to 98. 6 % for particles larger than 50 µm. The minimum volume of water for each cleaning of the filters was 5. 39 L. The head loss increment in the filtration <b>system</b> <b>with</b> <b>flow</b> reversal at frequencies of 11. 11 and 22. 22 mHz was smaller compared <b>with</b> the filtration <b>system</b> without flow reversal.

40|$|BACKGROUND Standard MRI {{has been}} used for {{high-grade}} gliomas detection, albeit with limited success as it does not provide sufficient specificity and sensitivity to detect complex tumor structure. Therefore targeted contrast agents based on iron oxide, that shorten mostly T 2 relaxation time, have been recently applied. However pulse sequences for molecular imaging in animal models of gliomas have not been yet fully studied. The aim of this study was therefore to compare contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and explain its origin using spin-echo (SE), gradient echo (GE), GE <b>with</b> <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> (GEFC) as well as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) in T 2 and T 2 * contrast-enhanced molecular MRI of glioma. METHODS A mouse model was used. U 87 MGdEGFRvIII cells (U 87 MG), derived from a human tumor, were injected intracerebrally. A 9. 4 T MRI system was used and MR imaging was performed on the 10 day after the inoculation of the tumor. The CNR was measured prior, 20 min, 2 hrs and 24 hrs post intravenous tail administration of glioma targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) using SE, SWI, GE and GEFC pulse sequences. RESULTS The results showed significant differences in CNR among all pulse sequences prior injection. GEFC provided higher CNR post contrast agent injection when compared to GE and SE. Post injection CNR was the highest with SWI and significantly different from any other pulse sequence. CONCLUSIONS Molecular MR imaging using targeted contrast agents can enhance the detection of glioma cells at 9. 4 T if the optimal pulse sequence is used. Hence, the use of flow compensated pulse sequences, beside SWI, should to be considered in the molecular imaging studies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
