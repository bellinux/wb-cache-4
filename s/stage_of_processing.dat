40|$|The <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> infant faces may be {{somewhat}} distinct from that of adult faces. Indeed, recent neuroimaging studies have provided evidence of an early, “baby-specific” neural response whereby infant faces are perceived more rapidly than adult faces. Using event-related potentials, the present study aimed {{to determine whether the}} preferential response to infant faces is present at both early and late <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> face <b>processing,</b> and to investigate the effects of aesthetic appearance on the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> adult and infant faces by directly manipulating the perceived attractiveness or cuteness within a given face identity. Here, we find evidence for enhanced <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> infant faces, relative to adult faces, at both early (N 170, P 2) and late (LPC) <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> face <b>processing.</b> We also find that the aesthetic appearance of both infant and adult faces modulates early neural responses, with enhanced responses to less attractive/cute faces as compared to more attractive/cute faces. Overall, our results provide additional evidence for a preferential response to infant faces at early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> and provide new evidence that this preferential response occurs at later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> face <b>processing</b> as well, independent of the aesthetic quality of the face or observer sex...|$|R
40|$|This {{theoretical}} paper {{explores the}} idea of acropetal memory; arguing that representations emanating from all <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> an individual stimulus can be registered in memory and potentially available for recall.

An exemplar model, HELM- 2, is presented and examined against available data. This model provides a satisfactory account of the data and an elegant solution to some interesting puzzles. It also suggests that some retrieval failure {{can be attributed to}} interference from representations of a stimulus derived from early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> and that this has much broader implications for modelling encoding, forgetting, and false memory. 7470...|$|R

Once these features have been extracted, they can be indexed, which allows them to function as anchor points for additional visual routines; visual routines are sequences of elemental operations, such as visual search or texture segregation, which define the spatial relationships among objects {{as well as their}} properties.|$|E
