50|$|Education {{levels in}} the area are very low, with 22% of the {{population}} having no formal education. 60.15% of the population has some form of primary or secondary education, but only 2.54% have had any further education.

Using time series data from nonequivalent groups, productivity, quality, labor cost and injury outcomes are examined over a 37 month period. The results support greater potential workforce flexibility, greater productivity (48 $), and lower labor cost per part (16 $). Compared to a control group, experimental group data also demonstrate more favorable quality outcomes. Injury frequency outcomes are not supported by the data, and in fact suggest that injuries may increase with the introduction of <b>skill</b> <b>based</b> pay. These results support both the behavioral and operations theories underlying <b>skill</b> <b>based</b> pay and add significantly to the knowledge regarding compensation interventions in general...|$|R

Like most cutlery trade buildings, Eye Witness Works is of low build quality, having for example no proper foundations.

Outline plans for the redevelopment of the site were produced by local architects Bond Bryan allowing {{for the preservation of}} key features of the site including the Milton Street frontage, but were rejected by Sheffield City Council Planning Dept who wanted {{the vast majority of the}} building to be preserved. However, the cost of the restoration of the building would be greater than the value of the restored building, so that restoration is not a viable option and cannot be used to fund a move to a more modern site.
