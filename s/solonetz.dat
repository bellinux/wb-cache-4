The Ae (grey, leached) horizon is very thin or absent. Solodized <b>Solonetz</b> have a distinct Ae horizon between the dark A and the Solonetzic B. Solods have a transitional AB or BA horizon formed by degradation of {{the upper part of the}} Solonetzic B horizon. Vertisolic Solonetzic soils have features intergrading the Vertisolic order in addition to any of the above Solonetzic features. The developmental sequence of Solonetzic soils is commonly from saline parent material to <b>Solonetz,</b> Solodized <b>Solonetz</b> and Solod. As leaching progresses, the salts and sodium ions are translocated downward. If leaching progresses for long enough and salts are removed completely, the Solonetzic B may disintegrate completely. The soil would then be classified in another order. Resalinization may occur and reverse the process associated with leaching.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the chemical speciation of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cr in four selected soil types {{representative of the}} more abundant agricultural soils in the central Ebro river valley in Aragón. Gypsisols, Calcisols, Solonchaks and <b>Solonetzs</b> represent around 20 % of the total soil surface in the region. A total of 12 selected sites have been sampled and five subsamples were taken in each site to create a composite sample. The four elements have been analysed by the sequential extraction procedure of Tessier et al. [Anal. Chem. 51 (1979) 844. ] by emission atomic spectrometry of solid state (ICP OES). Very little amounts of Fe and Mn were retrieved from the exchangeable phase, the ready available for biogeochemistry cycles in the ecosystems. Therefore, low quantities of Fe and Mn can be taken up by plants in these alkaline soils. Cr was not detected in the bioavailable forms as well as Zn that was only present in negligible amounts in very few samples. The absence of mobile forms of Cr in all soils eliminates the toxic risk both in the trophic chain and from its migration downwards the soil profile. The largest contents of Fe, Zn and Cr were retrieved from the residual phase where metals are strongly bound to minerals, whereas Mn from the carbonate and oxide phases amounts 80 % of its total content. Gypsisols and Calcisols have the lowest metal contents while the highest are found in <b>Solonetzs</b> and Solonchaks. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{oilfield}} waste {{water on the}} ground, the soil and the underground water has been studied. The reservoir is shown {{to be the source}} of environmental pollution due to the seepage of highly mineralized waste water through the reservoir bed and walls.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of irrigated agriculture during the Soviet Union (SU) era made Central Asia a leading cotton production {{region in the}} world. However, the successor states of the SU in Central Asia face on-going environmental damages and soil degradation that are endangering the sustainability of agricultural production. With Landsat MSS and TM data from 1972 / 73, 1977, 1987, 1998, and 2000 the expansion and densification of the irrigated cropland could be reconstructed in the Kashkadarya Province of Uzbekistan, Central Asia. Classification trees were generated by interpreting multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index data and crop phenological knowledge. Assessments based on image-derived validation samples showed good accuracy. Official statistics {{were found to be}} of limited use for analyzing the plausibility of the results, because they hardly represent the area that is cropped in the very dry study region. The cropping area increased from 134, 800 ha in 1972 / 73 to 470, 000 ha in 2009. Overlaying a historical soil map illustrated that initially sierozems were preferred for irrigated agriculture, but later the less favorable solonchaks and <b>solonetzs</b> were also explored, illustrating the strategy of agricultural expansion in the Aral Sea Basin. Winter wheat cultivation doubled between 1987 and 1998 to approximately 211, 000 ha demonstrating its growing relevance for modern Uzbekistan.

40|$|Soils of the Argentine Pampas {{have been}} {{developed}} over same parent material (loess), but evolved under different topography and land use. This led to different soil structural behaviour. In the flooding Pampa of Argentina soils (<b>Solonetzes)</b> are flooded each winter-spring and dried each summer, and are grazed by livestock all year round. Little is known about cattle trampling effects under these environmental conditions. In the nearby rolling Pampa, there are silty loams affected by physical deterioration and water erosion losses after long term conventional tillage (CT). After continuous zero tillage (ZT) these soils often develop shallow compaction. Little is known about abiotic and biotic mechanisms of structural recovery. The general objective of this thesis was to analyze comparatively natural and made-man factors affecting soil structural behaviour in soils with similar parent material (loess) and vegetation (grassland), but later affected by different relief and soil use factors. In the flooding Pampa results showed the occurrence of significant soil volume changes by swelling and shrinking. Soils swell during flooding because of a process of air entrapment. Livestock trampling causes the mechanical destruction of surface macropores in summer when soil dries. The regeneration of damaged pores takes place during flooding, when soils swell at maximum. Droughts -and not floods- cause negative environmental effects in this area. In the rolling Pampa similar soil macropore volumes were determined in pasture, CT and ZT situations, showing none effect from soil management. Topsoil hardening was often found after short term ZT. Results from a greenhouse experiment showed that aggregate stabilization requires a previous fragmentation by short wetting-drying cycles. Clod shrinkage curves and soil cracking studies showed that silty loams {{do not have the}} expected poor response to W/D cycles. However, their air filled porosity increases little during drying. Results showed topsoil aggregation to be mainly abiotic in the flooding Pampa, and abiotic and biotic in the rolling Pampa, showing different structural behaviour in soils evolved from same parent material but different relief and land use...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{governing}} {{the evolution of}} solonetzic soils in Saskatchewan are largely unknown. Existing literature indicated that sodium may accumulate in solonetzic soils from either present groundwater conditions (hydromorphic), past groundwater conditions (paleohydromorphic), or saline parent materials (lithogenic). Part one of the objectives was to investigate and determine the hydrogeology {{in relation to the}} genesis of solonetzic soils at one site in southern Saskatchewan. An intensive hydrogeological investigation was conducted near Assiniboia, Saskatchewan. Groundwater chemistry, groundwater flow, depth to watertable, and chemistry of geologic strata were studied. Six pedological sites were identified; Orthic Brown soils (site 1 and 4) were found on upper slopes, Alkaline <b>Solonetz</b> soils (sites 3 and 6) on lower slopes, and Brown Solodized <b>Solonetz</b> (site 2) and Brown <b>Solonetz</b> soils (site 5) on mid to lower slopes. Two geologic cross sections were completed and a nest of piezometers and an observation well was installed at each site. The Orthic Brown soil, at site 1, occurred in a groundwater recharge area while the Alkaline <b>Solonetz</b> soil, at site 3, occurred in a groundwater discharge area. Brown Solodized <b>Solonetz</b> (site 2), Orthic Brown (site 4), Brown <b>Solonetz</b> (site 5), and Alkaline <b>Solonetz</b> (site 6) soils occurred in areas of seasonal groundwater recharge and discharge. Part two of the objectives was to document the hydrogeology, from existing data, for selected solonetzic areas south of Township 40. The Hanley, Central Butte, Radville, Consul, and Kindersley solonetzic areas were chosen and topographical, pedological, geological and hydrological data were examined. A "most probable" theory of sodium accumulation in the solonetzic areas was discussed. The origin of sodium from discharging saline groundwater (hydromorphic) probably occurred in the Saskatchewan Rivers Plain (between the Allan and Hawarden Hills Uplands), along eastern portions of the Central Butte Plain, along {{the eastern edge of the}} Missouri Coteau (near Radville) and along both sides of the Souris River in the Souris River Plain (near Radville). The origin of sodium from past groundwater discharge (paleohydromorphic) probably occurred in portions of the Hawarden and Allan Hills Upland, along the northern edge of the Missouri Coteau and the Eyebrow Hills Uplands (near Central Butte) and in portions of the Souris River Plain. The origin of sodium from saline parent materials (lithogenic) probably occurred in the Frenchman River Plain, the Snipe Lake Plain, portions of the Central Butte and the Souris River Plains and portions of the Neutral Hills Upland.

It is especially valid for inland alkali vegetation, where high landscape-scale patchiness is typical and rapid shifts between vegetation types occur frequently. <b>Solonetz</b> meadows (Beckmannion eruciformis) {{are among the}} best-preserved open habitats in Europe harbouring a unique flora including several endemics. Besides their importance, studies on the vegetation of <b>solonetz</b> meadows are scarce even though this knowledge would be vital for their effective conservation and management. Using own records and literature data, we provide a synthesis of the alliance Beckmannion eruciformis to charac-terise its associations floristically and ecologically in five regions along the river Tisza, East Hungary. We studied three associations of the alliance: (i) Agrostio stoloniferae-Alopecuretum pratensis, (ii) Agrostio stoloniferae-Beckmannietum eruciformis and (iii) Agrostio stoloniferae-Glycerietum pedi-cellatae. We found that <b>solonetz</b> meadow associations were separated along a moisture gradient with Agrostio stoloniferae-Alopecuretum pratensis at the drier end and Agrostio stoloniferae-Glycerietum pedicellateae at the wet end. This gradient was also justified by {{the distribution of the}} phytosociological groups. The proportion of species of Festuco-Brometea division was the highest in Agrostio stolonifer-ae-Alopecuretum pratensis, while the proportion of Cypero-Phragmitetea species was the highest in Agrostio stoloniferae-Glycerietum pedicellateae. Species of Puccinellio-Salicornetea had the highest proportion in Agrostio stoloniferae-Beckmannietum eruciformis, indicating the high soil salinity of this association. Our results suggest that Agrostio stoloniferae-Alopecuretum pratensis association {{plays an important role in}} preserving the continental flora elements of the surrounding dry grasslands. The ecological indicator values for soil moisture and salinity suggest that in case of the studied <b>solonetz</b> meadow associations, humidity increases with decreasing elevation, while salinity is highest at medium elevations. Our results suggest that Agrostio stoloniferae-Beckmannietum eruciformis is a transition towards salt marsh associations, while Agrostio stoloniferae-Glycerietum pedicellatae is a transition towards freshwater marshes. Our results show that preserving <b>solonetz</b> meadows is an important task for nature conservation as they have a crucial role in maintaining landscape-scale species and habitat diversity and act as buffer zones around wetlands...|$|E

Weakly stratified, iron-stained silty clay loam sediments which contained the fossils unconformably overlie and butt against the sloping surface of buried loessial hill, marked by an oxidized, strongly columnar B 2 Horizon three feet thick developed in the old loess. Both the loess and ponded deposit are truncated by the strongly developed, clayey, columnar B 2 horizon of a Solodized <b>Solonetz</b> soil profile; development of the <b>Solonetz</b> A 2 -B 2 boundary is controlled by the stratigraphic break between these deposits and a later, less compact and more friable silt loam loess. Present drainage is incised into both older deposits, and the downstream end of the local drainage system has been destroyed by Wisconsin catastrophic flooding of the Channeled scablands. Loess exposures in the Pullman-Moscow area show the older deposits of this site to be overlain by at least three later loess sheets, the lower two of which also are cut by Scabland channels. Thus the age of the mammoth is regarded as not only pre-Wisconsin, but mid-Pleistocene.

40|$|In the {{following}} note {{we have been}} trying to study the central part of Iran. The major part of this country is arid or semiarid and the average annual rainfall decreases to less than 100 mm. Vegetation varies according to climate. The soils of this aera are Solontchaks, <b>Solonetz,</b> Sierozem, saline allucial and colluvial soils, and lithosol soils. Problems to be solved if the soils of central Iran are to be used productively, are salinity and alkalinity of soils, water and wind erosion, indequacy or lack of organic matter [...] Alimardani M., Aryavand A.
