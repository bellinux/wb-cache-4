40|$|<b>Shellfish</b> <b>farms</b> {{are closed}} for harvest when {{microbial}} pollutants are present. Such pollutants are typically present in rainfall runoff from various land uses in catchments. Experts currently use {{a number of}} observable parameters (river flow, rainfall, salinity) as proxies to determine when to close farms. We have proposed using the short term historical rainfall data as a time-series prediction problem where we aim to predict the closure of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farms</b> based only on rainfall. Time-series event prediction consists of two steps: (i) feature extraction, and (ii) prediction. A number of data mining challenges exist for these scenarios: (i) which feature extraction method best captures the rainfall pattern over successive days that leads to opening or closure of the farms?, (ii) The farm closure events occur infrequently and {{this leads to a}} class imbalance problem; the question is {{what is the best way}} to deal with this problem? In this paper we have analysed and compared different combinations of balancing methods (under-sampling and over-sampling), feature extraction methods (cluster profile, curve fitting, Fourier Transform, Piecewise Aggregate Approximation, and Wavelet Transform) and learning algorithms (neural network, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, and Bayesian Network) to predict closure events accurately considering the above data mining challenges.

50|$|The NOAA {{fisheries}} service has started using aquaculture to produce sustainable seafood. Aquaculture is fish or <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming.</b> The aquaculture fisheries hatch {{and raise the}} fish until market size. By using aquaculture the wild fish {{will be able to}} repopulate without the threat of overfishing. The aquaculture fish have a variety of uses including: food, nutritional, and pharmaceutical. Two types of aquaculture exist. Marine aquaculture farms the fish species that live in the ocean and fresh water aquaculture is the fish species that live in freshwater. NOAA is focusing on an alternative seafood source to help with repopulate and save the ocean's ecosystems.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the production and ecological carrying capacity of shellfish cultured species (mussels, oysters, clams, etc.) and the spatial distribution of shellfish density within a licensed area. In order to achieve this goal, we used an analytical model for simulating the impact of a <b>shellfish</b> <b>farm</b> on the concentration of suspended particles or dissolved substances, namely dissolved oxygen in steady-state conditions. The results show that the impact depends on the spatial distribution of the rearing density within the licensed area. In particular, we found a family of non-homogeneous distribution of rearing density which allow one to increase the biomass yield in respect to the homogeneous one, while complying with constraints on suspended particles or dissolved substances. These results may be relevant for enhancing both the production and ecological carrying capacity of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farm...</b>|$|R

30|$|The recent {{increase}} of the local population of gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, in three areas along the southeastern Adriatic Sea: Malostonski Bay (Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina), Neretva Estuary (Croatia) and Boka Kotorska Bay (Montenegro) and its adverse effects on shellfish culture by preying on Mediterranean mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and the European flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, are studied. The results from {{the analysis of the}} existing information show that the main reason for the recent increase is the escapes from local fish farm which enrich the local population constantly with new gilthead sea bream. The existence of practically endless food {{in the area of the}} <b>shellfish</b> <b>farms</b> allows the concentration of the population in the region instead of its dispersion along the Adriatic coast. Moreover, ecological analysis indicates that the gilthead seabream is facing a very low competition from other local species which enhances its capacity to further populate the region. While the impact on the ecosystem is not yet known, the socio-economic impact of the {{increase of}} the gilthead seabream population is evident today. Many <b>shellfish</b> <b>farms</b> are closing today in the region since the damages may reach over 90  % of the production.|$|R

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{patterns of}} nitrification, denitrification and dissimilatory ammonium production (DAP) rates were {{studied in the}} sediment of 2 stations in the Thau lagoon (south of France). The station ZA was located within the <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> zone and thestation B was the reference site. A marked effect of <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> on bacterial activities was observed. Spatial differences were associated with discrepancies in the organic content and the reduction state of sediments, i. e. highest reductive processes (denitrification and DAP) were noted in <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> area, whereas the oxidative process (nitrification) was predominant outside the farming zone. At both stations, the DAP activity increased in September (autumn) concomitant with an increase of the C/N ratio in the sediment due to the sedimentation of the summer phytoplanktonic production. Nitrification and denitrification rates exhibited maxima in November (winter) corresponding to dissolved inorganic nitrogen inputs from the surrounding land. In the <b>shellfish</b> <b>farming</b> site, 98 % of nitrate was reduced to NH 4 + and 2 % to N 2 O, showing that {{the most of the}} NO 3 - was reduced to ammonium and remained available for the ecosystem...|$|E
