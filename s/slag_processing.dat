However, it represents a significant obstacle to maneuvering vessels with such massive bulk (mobile spacecraft being particularly likely to use less massive active shielding).

Therefore, a new method of steel <b>slag</b> aggregate <b>processing</b> was proposed in this study {{in order to obtain}} the high quality steel slag aggregate with different specifications Experimental results indicated that the specifications stability of the steel slag was improved significantly when the steel slag was crushed by the combination equipments of jaw crusher and cone crusher. The screening efficiency and stability of the aggregate can be improved as the multi-level screening equipments were used into the production line. The wet rolling screen was also developed to remove the dust on the surface of aggregates. The specifications stability and pavement performance indexes of the steel slag aggregate produced by the new production line have been improved significantly compared to the steel slag aggregate produced by the traditional production line...|$|R
40|$|Slags are an {{indispensable}} {{tool for the}} pyrometallurgical industry to extract and purify metals at competitive prices. Large volumes are produced annually, leading to important economical and ecological issues regarding their afterlife. To maximise the recycling potential, <b>slag</b> <b>processing</b> has {{become an integral part}} of the valorisation chain. However, processing is often directed solely towards the cooled slag. In this article, the authors present an overview of the scientific studies dedicated to the hot stage of <b>slag</b> <b>processing,</b> i. e. from the moment of slag/metal separation to complete cooling at the slag yard. Using in-depth case studies on C 2 S driven slag disintegration and chromium leaching, it is shown that the functional properties of the cooled slag can be significantly enhanced by small or large scale additions to the high temperature slag and/or variations in the cooling path, even without interfering with the metallurgical process. The technology to implement such hot stage processing steps in an industrial environment is currently available. No innovative technological solutions are required. Rather, advances in hot stage <b>slag</b> <b>processing</b> seem to rely primarily on further unravelling the relationships between process, structure and properties. This knowledge is required to identify the critical process parameters for quality control. Moreover. it could even allow to consciously alter slag compositions and cooling paths to tailor the slag to a certain application. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to obtain the {{characteristic}} inorganic chemical profile of important particle sources identified in the integrated iron and steel process: sintering, blast furnace, steelmaking and desulfurization <b>slag</b> <b>processing.</b> A complete chemical and physical characterization program was developed: particle size distribution, chemical analysis, XRD, SEM-EDX and TGA/DTA. The sample collected from the sinter stack showed high levels of K and Cl(-), followed by Fe, NH 4 (+), Ca, Na and Pb. The profile of the dust samples taken from the sinter cake discharge zone was quite different, showing higher amounts of Fe, Ca and Al, and lower amounts of K, Cl(-), Na and Pb. Dust samples collected from the blast furnace (BF) and steelmaking cast house may be distinguished from each other based on the higher levels of Fe (hematite and magnetite) and lower levels of Ca, Zn and C (graphite) found in BF dust. High levels of Ca and Fe were found in samples taken from the desulfurization <b>slag</b> <b>processing</b> area.

In this study, collaboration between university and industry was established facilitated by regional development actors to develop and pilot test a sustainability assessment approach taking into account previous work in this field. The industry partners in this study were a biorefinery investment in the first case and a <b>slag</b> <b>processing</b> service in the second case. As a result of the joint efforts, novel sets of environmental and economic sustainability assessment indicators and associated sub-indicators were developed and the existing set of social indicators was updated. Moreover, environmental and social sustainability assessments were implemented in the biorefinery case accompanied by a separate evaluation of regional economic impacts. In the <b>slag</b> <b>processing</b> case, environmental, economic and social sustainability were assessed. The results of the sustainability assessments indicated very good level of overall performance in both cases. However, specific elements that contributed to lower level of performance included lack of specific sustainability management and reporting approaches and need for better performance in supply chain sustainability, monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, life cycle thinking and circular economy training.

40|$|Highly {{alkaline}} industrial residues (e. g., steel <b>slag,</b> bauxite <b>processing</b> residue (red mud) and ash {{from coal}} combustion) {{have been identified}} as stocks of potentially valuable metals. Technological change has created demand for metals, such as vanadium and certain rare earth elements, in electronics associated with renewable energy generation and storage. Current raw material and circular economy policy initiatives in the EU and industrial ecology research all promote resource recovery from residues, with research so far primarily from an environmental science perspective. This paper begins to address the deficit of research into the governance of resource recovery from a novel situation where re-use involves extraction of a component from a bulk residue that itself represents a risk to the environment. Taking a political industrial ecology approach, we briefly present emerging techniques for recovery and consider their regulatory implications in the light of potential environmental impacts. The paper draws on EU and UK regulatory framework for these residues along with semi-structured interviews with industry and regulatory bodies. A complex picture emerges of entwined ownerships and responsibilities for residues, with past practice and policy having a lasting impact on current possibilities for resource recovery...|$|R

Relevant cost data for physical and pyroprocessing of slag to produce expanded slag aggregates will be gathered for comparison with (1) the management and disposal costs for slag or similar wastes and (2) production costs for conventional materials which the slag aggregates would replace. This will form the basis for an overall economic evaluation of expanded slag utilization technologies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Steel slag, {{taking up}} about 20 % of crude steel output in China, has caused many serious {{problems}} to environment, such as soil damage, water pollution. Research {{on the application}} of steel slag is always a hot topic. The utilization of steel slag in road construction as coarse aggregate is a promising way. Many researches on the mechanical characteristics of steel slag based hot mixture asphalt (HMA) have been conducted in laboratory, and the indexes of steel slag such as angularity coefficient, dust content can be controlled by artificial way due to small demand for research destination. The lack of effective way to control the quality indexes of steel <b>slag</b> aggregate during <b>processing</b> {{is one of the}} main factors that limits its wide use in entity projects.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of concrete production using different kinds of industrial wastes as “recycled aggregate”. The wastes studied in this work were: fly ashes and slags from Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel plant; foundry sands produced from foundry dies; slags from lead processing; Waelz slags; solid residues from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) plant (with mass-burning kiln and fluidized bed reactor); sludge from industrial wastewater treatment plants. Good compressive strength (similar to natural concrete) was achieved after 28 days of curing by concrete mixtures obtained with the partial replacement (from 7 % to 40 % by weight) of natural aggregates with <b>slags</b> from lead <b>processing,</b> foundry sands, Waelz slags and bottom ashes from MSW incineration. The worst mechanical and leaching behaviours were shown by concrete samples containing EAF fly ashes and sludge from industrial wastewater treatment.

40|$|International audienceThree {{types of}} {{smelting}} slags originating from historically different smelting technologies in the Tsumeb area (Namibia) were studied: (i) <b>slags</b> from <b>processing</b> of carbonate/oxide ore in a Cu–Pb smelter (1907 – 1948), (ii) slags from Cu and Pb smelting of sulphide ores (1963 – 1970) and (iii) granulated Cu smelting slags (1980 – 2000). Bulk chemical analyses of slags were combined with detailed mineralogical investigation using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM/EDS) and electron microprobe (EPMA). The slags are significantly enriched in metals and metalloids: Pb (0. 97 – 18. 4 wt. %), Cu (0. 49 – 12. 2 wt. %), Zn (2. 82 – 12. 09 wt. %), Cd (12 – 6940 mg/kg), As (930 – 75, 870 mg/kg) and Sb (67 – 2175 mg/kg). Slags from the oldest technology are composed of primary Ca- and Pb-bearing feldspars, spinels, complex Cu–Fe and Cu–Cr oxides, delafossite–mcconnellite phases and Ca–Pb arsenates. The presence of arsenates indicates that these slags underwent long-term alteration. More recent slags are composed of high-temperature phases: Ca–Fe alumosilicates (olivine, melilite), Pb- and Zn-rich glass, spinel oxides and small sulphide/metallic inclusions embedded in glass. XRD and SEM/EDS were used to study secondary alteration products developed {{on the surface of}} slags exposed for decades to weathering on the dumps. Highly soluble complex Cu–Pb–(Ca) arsenates (bayldonite, lammerite, olivenite, lavendulan) associated with litharge and hydrocerussite were detected. To determine the mineralogical and geochemical parameters governing the release of inorganic contaminants from slags, two standardized short-term batch leaching tests (European norm EN 12457 and USEPA TCLP), coupled with speciation-solubility modelling using PHREEQC- 2 were performed. Arsenic in the leachate exceeded the EU regulatory limit for hazardous waste materials (2. 5 mg/L). The toxicity limits defined by USEPA for the TCLP test were exceeded for Cd, Pb and As. The PHREEQC- 2 calculation predicted that complex arsenates are the most important solubility controls for metals and metalloids. Furthermore, these phases can readily dissolve during the rainy season (October to March) and flush significant amounts of As, Pb and Cu into the environment in the vicinity of slag dumps...|$|R
40|$|Slag wool is {{the most}} {{expensive}} and valuable product of blast furnace <b>slag</b> <b>processing.</b> Slag wool is in great demand nowadays. The article highlights the factors influencing the mineral wool quality: chemical composition that determines the acidity of the module, the temperature of the molten slag and the required slag jet thickness consistency. Mineral wool is produced by blowing air or steam into a jet of molten slag. As a result of it the slag crushes into droplets stretching. The resulting wool contains 5 % slag and 95 % air. The quality of the obtained slag wool depends on the module acidity of the slag. The blast furnace slags of «Ilyich iron and steel works of Mariupol» and «Azovstal iron & steel works» are the main (short) slags – they give short fibers. To obtain high-quality long fiber wool it is necessary to add admixtures into basic blast furnace slag to reduce its basicity. As a result of the fuel and energy rising prices and the necessity to reduce the slag wool cost it is necessary to develop a new technology with fiery-liquid slag, with the removal of iron compounds and sulphur from the melts and the introduction of corrective additives {{to improve the quality of}} slag wool. Good thermal conductivity (about 0, 03 kcal/m∙h∙°C) and other indicators (resistance, volume weight) make it possible to use the materials from slag wool (pads, rigid and semi-rigid plates) as heat and sound insulating material...|$|E

40|$|Metal waste {{generated}} from domestic nuclear operations for defense and commercial applications {{has led to}} a growing stockpile of radioactively contaminated scrap metal, much of which is stainless steel. This steel contains large quantities of strategic elements such as nickel and chromium and constitutes a valuable domestic resource [1]. A significant fraction of this material cannot be efficiently surface decontaminated, and burial of this material would be wasteful and expensive, since long term monitoring would be necessary in order to minimize environmental risk. Melt decontamination of this material would maintain the chemical pedigree of the stainless steel, allowing its controlled reuse within the nuclear community. This research addresses the melt decontamination of radioactively contaminated stainless steel by electroslag remelting (ESR). ESR is industrially used for the production of specialty steels and superalloys to remove a variety of contaminates and to improve metal chemistry. Correctly applied, it could maintain the specified chemistry and mechanical properties of the original material while capturing the radioactive transuranic elements in a stable slag phase. The ESR process also produces a high quality metal ingot free of porosity that can be directly forged or rolled into final shapes. The goal of this project was to optimize a melt decontamination process through a basic understanding of the factors which govern the partitioning of various radionuclides between the metal, slag, and gas phases. Radionuclides which are captured by a slag phase may be stabilized by promoting the formation of synthetic minerals within a leach resistant matrix. This research program included three segments. At Boston University, Prof. Uday Pal and his group conducted research to develop a fundamental understanding of thermochemical and electrochemical behaviors of slag/metal/radionuclide surrogate systems. This work combined experimental characterization and thermochemical modeling of these high temperature systems. The second segment utilized Sandia expertise and ongoing work in fundamental separation science and liquid metal processing technology to investigate and optimize ESR decontamination using representative surrogate compounds to represent contaminate radionuclides. This work evaluated partitioning of the surrogates between the slag and metal ingot in ESR experiments. Furnace operating parameters were systematically varied to determine the optimum <b>slag</b> <b>processing</b> conditions. The third effort in Russia conducted ESR melting experiments using contaminated stainless steel pipe electrodes doped with plutonium.

40|$|Gold {{solubility}} in the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgOsat slag {{system was}} measured at 1773 K (1500 C) under a CO 2 -CO atmosphere {{over a wide}} range of compositions, i. e., 8 to 40 mass pct CaO, 26 to 50 mass pct SiO 2, and 0 to 36 mass pct Al 2 O 3, to determine the dissolution mechanism of gold in the CaO-based metallurgical slags. Gold solubility in the present slag system increased with increasing oxygen partial pressure and increasing activity of CaO. From the thermodynamic analysis, the dissolution mechanism of gold into the (alumino-) silicate melts is proposed as follows according to the activity of basic oxide, which indicates that the predominant species of gold is dependent on slag basicity. AuðsÞ þ 1 4 O 2 ðgÞ þ 1 2 O 2 ¼ AuO ð Þ; ð Þ aBO 0 : 1 The enthalpy change for the dissolution of gold into the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgOsat slag system was measured to be about 80 kJ/mol, indicating that the gold dissolution is exothermic. From the iso-Au solubility contours, the dominant factor affecting the gold dissolution behavior is the (CaO + MgO) /SiO 2 ratio, whereas the influence of Al 2 O 3 was negligible. Consequently, less basic <b>slags</b> and higher <b>processing</b> temperatures, in conjunction with a strongly reducing atmosphere, are recommended to increase gold recovery during pyro-processing of Au-containing e-wastes...|$|R
