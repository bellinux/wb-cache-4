5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the <b>standard</b> <b>shape</b> for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E

25|$|Screening the fibre {{involves}} using a mesh {{made from}} non-corroding and inert material, such as aluminium, which is stretched {{in a wooden}} frame {{similar to that of}} a window. The size of the paper is governed {{by the size of the}} frame. This tool is then completely submerged in the solution vertically and drawn out horizontally to ensure a uniform coating of the wire mesh. Excess water is then removed and the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a damp cloth. The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press very gently to ensure the fibre does not squeeze out. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as vacuum drying or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the <b>standard</b> <b>shape</b> (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.|$|E

[...] "Brick equivalents" [...] are used in estimating how many firebrick {{it takes to make}} an installation into an industrial furnace. Special shapes are specifically made for particular kilns or furnaces.Precast refractory shape technology has become a specialized field within the refractory industry in recent years. As demands increase for greater refractory lining performance and lower maintenance costs, refractory users are finding that one effective way to achieve those goals is to incorporate a broader use of precast refractory shapes into their lining systems. Across virtually all industries - petrochemical, steel, power generation, metal casting and treatment, wood products, minerals processing and others - the applications for precast shapes are limited only by the imagination, and almost invariably their use results in better performance and lower cost. This article discusses the design and manufacture of precast refractory shapes, and the benefits to material properties and installation logistics.|$|R

50|$|Most of the Wilkanowski guitars {{adhere to}} a <b>standard</b> <b>shape.</b> A few guitars do not adhere to the cello shape, but rather a more {{conventional}} archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock {{is thought to have}} been the main influence in the headstock for the current Ovation Guitar. The flattened oval was the <b>standard</b> <b>shape</b> on most guitars, although some featured a violin like scroll. The backs of most were one piece of flamed maple (actually, the wood is often Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple.) with no center joint. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, <b>standard</b> <b>shape,</b> segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared. Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One bearing this label was sold at the Johnny Cash estate auction by Sotheby's in 2004.|$|E
