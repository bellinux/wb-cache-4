25|$|Hoffa began union {{organizational}} work at {{the grassroots}} level through his employment as a teenager with a grocery chain, a job which paid substandard wages and offered poor working conditions with minimal job security. The workers were displeased with this situation and tried to organize a union to better their lot. Although Hoffa was young, his bravery and approachability in this role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after defiantly refusing to work for an abusive <b>shift</b> <b>foreman,</b> who inspired Hoffa's long career of organizing workers, he left the grocery chain, in part because of his union activities, and Hoffa was then invited to become an organizer with the Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.|$|E

He directed the underground aspects of the rescue operation and coordinated closely with engineers on the surface over the teleconference links.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{he became}} a {{graveyard}} shift labourer. After his marriage to Angie {{and the birth of}} the children, he started working in a factory and soon was promoted to a <b>shift</b> <b>foreman.</b> In this position, it was his task to hire cheap Mexican labourers and in that way give them the American citizenship. Therefore, he is a so-called coyote.|$|E

50|$|Depending on diligence, {{skill and}} suitability, a hewer could be {{promoted}} to Hutmann or Steiger. Even an appointment as <b>shift</b> <b>foreman</b> (Schichtmeister), {{to the council}} of aldermen or jurates (Berggeschworenen) or as mine manager (Bergmeister) was possible. At {{the end of the}} 18th century, pit and operational officials were legally required to undertake engineering training at a mining academy or mining school. For this reason, the training of a Steiger could no longer be carried out simply through on the job training.|$|E

5000|$|... “The {{hierarchy}} {{and power of}} a supervisor {{in the world of}} the miner is extremely powerful; it is a military discipline,” Chilean Minister of Health Jaime Manalich explained as he discussed Urzúa’s role in organizing the men and their ability to adjust to their increasingly complicated situation. “Natural selection is extremely strong in this world,” and results in a <b>shift</b> <b>foreman</b> becoming the virtual “owner of the mine” during his normal 12-hour shift. “This is an extremely dangerous job, if you look at the statistics, this region of Chile has the highest worker mortality rate in the nation and that is led by mining.” Commander Andreas Llarena, Chilean Navy, who has been assigned to the scene of the accident to assist in the coordination of the health aspects of the recovery operations also explains that “Urzua is a leader in his field and has been for ages. He is recognized by his peers as a leader. For a miner, their shift leader is sacred and holy. They would never think about replacing him. That is carved in stone; it is one of the commandments in the life of a miner” [...]|$|E
