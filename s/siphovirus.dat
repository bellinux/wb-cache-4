However, the obstacles involved in linking vi-ruses to their hosts in a high-throughput manner bottlenecks our ability to understand virus-host interactions in complex com-munities. We have developed a method called viral tagging (VT), which combines mixtures of host cells and fluorescent viruses with flow cytometry. We investigated multiple viruses which infect each of twomodel marine bacteria that represent the slow-growing, photoautotrophic genus Synechococcus (Cyanobacteria) and the fast-growing, heterotrophic genus Pseudoalteromonas (Gammaproteobacteria).

40|$|Bacterial viruses {{shape the}} diversity, {{metabolic}} function, and community dynamics of their microbial hosts. As microbes drive many major biogeochemical cycles, viral infection {{is therefore a}} phenomenon of global significance. A significant fraction of primary production in the oceans is performed by the picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The viruses ('cyanophages') that infect these cyanobacteria are unusual in that their genomes contain a large suite of orthologs to host metabolic genes. These orthologs, known as 'auxiliary metabolic genes' ('AMGs'), encode proteins involved in diverse cellular processes, including photosynthesis, carbon and phosphate metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis. They are thought to benefit phage during infection by redirecting host metabolism towards pathways that promote viral replication. While AMGs are widespread in two Prochlorococcus cyanophage families, the podoviruses and myoviruses, they are rare or completely absent in the third family, the siphoviruses. The overarching goal of this thesis is to understand differences in the infection processes of different cyanophages - in particular, between cyanophages that encode AMGs {{and those that do}} not. We hypothesize that the latter group utilizes a fundamentally different infection strategy than AMG-encoding cyanophages, and offer several lines of evidence to support this hypothesis. First, we show that siphoviruses that lack AMGs have highly productive infections, and that host photosynthesis is not impaired during infection. This result is somewhat surprising, as evidence suggests that photosynthesis is supported by AMG-encoded proteins during infection by other cyanophages; however, it is consistent with our observations that unlike the podo- and myoviruses, the siphoviruses do not degrade the host genome during infection, and that the host response to <b>siphovirus</b> infection parallels the metabolic changes effected by AMGs in other cyanophages. These results, along with patterns of <b>siphovirus</b> infection kinetics over the diel light cycle, suggest that siphoviruses utilize a mode of infection that is based on modulating, rather than suppressing, host transcription. Finally, we argue that the suite of metabolic changes that occur during <b>siphovirus</b> infection - and that are effected by AMGs in other cyanophages - are induced by a nitrogen-stress-like response in the host during infection, offering new insights into cyanophage/host coevolution. by Katya Frois-Moniz.

Genome sequencing of marine cyanophages has greatly advanced our understanding about their ecology and evolution. Among 24 reported genomes of cyanophages that infect marine picocyanobacteria, 17 are from cyanomyoviruses and six from cyanopodoviruses, and only one from cyanosiphovirus (Prochlorococcus phage P-SS 2). Here we present four complete genome sequences of <b>siphoviruses</b> (S-CBS 1, S-CBS 2, S-CBS 3 and S-CBS 4) that infect four different marine Synechococcus strains. Three distinct subtypes were recognized among the five known marine <b>siphoviruses</b> (including P-SS 2) in terms of morphology, genome architecture, gene content and sequence similarity. Our study revealed that cyanosiphoviruses are genetically diverse with polyphyletic origin. No core genes were found across these five cyanosiphovirus genomes, and this {{is in contrast to}} the fact that many core genes have been found in cyanomyovirus or cyanopodovirus genomes. Interestingly, genes encoding three structural proteins and a lysozyme of S-CBS 1 and S-CBS 3 showed homology to a prophage-like genetic element in two freshwater Synechococcus elongatus genomes. Re-annotation of the prophage-like genomic region suggests that S. elongatus may contain an intact prophage. Cyanosiphovirus genes involved in DNA metabolism and replication share high sequence homology with those in cyanobacteria, and further phylogenetic analysis based on these genes suggests that ancient and selective genetic exchanges occurred, possibly due to past prophage integration. Metagenomic analysis based on the Global Ocean Sampling database showed that cyanosiphoviruses are present in relatively low abundance in the ocean surface water compared to cyanomyoviruses and cyanopodoviruses...|$|R

The complete genome sequence of ΦJL 001 comprised 63, 469 bp with an overall G+C content of 62 %. The genome has 91 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), and 17 ORFs have been assigned putative functions. ΦJL 001 appears to be a temperate phage, and the integrase gene was identified in the genome. DNA hybridization analysis showed that the ΦJL 001 genome does not integrate into the host chromosome under the conditions tested.

40|$|Abstract Background Propionibacterium acnes is a {{commensal}} {{of human}} skin {{but is also}} known {{to be involved in}} certain diseases, such as acne vulgaris and infections of orthopaedic implants. Treatment of these conditions is complicated by increased resistance to antibiotics and/or biofilm formation of P. acnes bacteria. P. acnes can be infected by bacteriophages, but until recently little has been known about these viruses. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and characterize inducible phages from P. acnes on a genetic and morphological basis. Results More than 70 % (65 / 92) of P. acnes isolates investigated have inducible phages, classified morphologically as <b>Siphoviruses.</b> The phages have a head of 55 nm in diameter and a tail of 145 – 155 nm in length and 9 – 10 nm in width. There was no difference in carriage rate of phages between P. acnes isolates from deep infections and isolates from skin. However, there was a significant lower carriage rate of phages in P. acnes biotype IB, mostly attributed to the low carriage rate of inducible phages in biotype IB isolated from deep tissue. Most phages have a strong lytic activity against all P. acnes isolates with inducible phages, but have less lytic activity against isolates that have no prophages. Phages only infected and lysed P. acnes and not other closely related propionibacteria. All phages could infect and lyse their non-induced parental host, indicating that these prophages do not confer superinfection immunity. The phages have identical protein pattern as observed on SDS-PAGE. Finally, sequencing of two phage genes encoding a putative major head protein and an amidase and showed that the phages could be divided into different groups on a genetic basis. Conclusion Our findings indicate that temperate phages are common in P. acnes, and that they are a genetically and functionally homogeneous group of <b>Siphoviruses.</b> The phages are specific for P. acnes and do not seem to confer superinfection immunity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{biology and}} ecology of Synechococcus and their viruses in open oceans {{have been studied}} {{extensively}} in the past decade. However, {{little is known about}} these virus-host systems in the estuarine environment. In this study, Synechococcus spp. isolated from the Chesapeake Bay were characterized in terms of their RuBisCO gene and ITS sequences. Chesapeake Bay harbors unique and diverse Synechococcus spp., which belong to a poorly defined cluster, named marine cluster B (MC-B) Synechococcus. This finding revived the phylogenetic position of MC-B cluster of marine Synechococcus. The estuarine Synechococcus strains can tolerate a much broader range of salinity compared to oceanic Synechococcus spp., suggesting the adaptation of Synechococcus to the dynamic estuarine ecosystem. Seven cyanophages isolated from four MC-B Synechococcus strains were characterized in terms of their phenotypic and genetic traits. Among the seven MC-B Synechococcus phages, three are podoviruses, three are <b>siphoviruses</b> and one is a myovirus. Six of seven phage isolates did not cross infect any other closely related MC-B Synechococcus strains, indicating the prevalence of highly specific cyanophages for MC-B strains. The podoviruses have significantly shorter latent periods compared to the myo- and <b>siphoviruses.</b> For the first time, photosynthetic gene (psbA) was found in the podoviruses infecting marine Synechococcus. DNA polymerase gene (pol) sequences were obtained from three MC-B Synechococcus podoviruses, and they cluster with all the known podoviruses of marine picocyanobacteria. Viral capsid assembly gene (g 20) was found to be conserved among cyanomyoviruses for marine picocyanobacteria. Synechococcus abundance often exceeded 10 sup 6 cells ml sup- 1 in summer, and sometimes contributed more than 50 % of total phytoplankton biomass and primary production in the Chesapeake Bay. Cyanophage titer ranged from undetectable to over 10 sup 5 MPN ml sup - 1 in the Bay. Both Synechococcus abundance and their phage titers varied dramatically in different seasons, and the two co-varied on temporal and spatial scales. No synchronized seasonal succession was seen for population compositions of Synechococcus and cyanomyovirus, suggesting that "kill the winner" module may not apply to polyvalent cyanomyoviruses.

However, the proteins encoded by genes orf 53 to orf 64, corresponding to putative tail proteins of the virion, were {{very similar to those}} of the defective Bacillus subtilis myovirus PBSX with the notable exception of the gene product of orf 56 (the tape measure tail protein) that was similar to proteins from phages infecting Gram-negative bacteria. The first description of the genome of a myovirus infecting a low G + C content Gram-positive bacterium, a member of a group embracing important human pathogens and industrial relevant species, will contribute to expand our current knowledge on phage biology and evolution...|$|R
40|$|Prochlorococcus, an {{abundant}} phototroph in the oceans, are infected {{by members of}} three families of viruses: myo-, podo- and siphoviruses. Genomes of myo- and podoviruses isolated on Prochlorococcus contain DNA replication machinery and virion structural genes homologous to those from coliphages T 4 and T 7 respectively. They also contain a suite of genes of cyanobacterial origin, most notably photosynthesis genes, which are expressed during infection and appear integral to the evolutionary trajectory of both host and phage. Here we present the first genome of a cyanobacterial <b>siphovirus,</b> P-SS 2, which was isolated from Atlantic slope waters using a Prochlorococcus host (MIT 9313). The P-SS 2 genome is larger than, and considerably divergent from, previously sequenced siphoviruses. It appears most closely related to lambdoid siphoviruses, with which it shares 13 functional homologues. The ∼ 108 kb P-SS 2 genome encodes 131 predicted proteins and notably lacks photosynthesis genes which have consistently been found in other marine cyanophage, but does contain 14 other cyanobacterial homologues. While only six structural proteins were identified from the genome sequence, 35 proteins were detected experimentally; these mapped onto capsid and tail structural modules in the genome. P-SS 2 is potentially capable of integration into its host as inferred from bioinformatically identified genetic machinery int, bet, exo and a 53 bp attachment site. The host attachment site {{appears to be a}} genomic island that is tied to insertion sequence (IS) activity that could facilitate mobility of a gene involved in the nitrogen-stress response. The homologous region and a secondary IS-element hot-spot in Synechococcus RS 9917 are further evidence of IS-mediated genome evolution coincident with a probable relic prophage integration event. This <b>siphovirus</b> genome provides a glimpse into the biology of a deep-photic zone phage as well as the ocean cyanobacterial prophage and IS element ‘mobilome’.

40|$|Adsorption of a {{bacteriophage}} to {{the host}} requires recognition of a cell wall-associated receptor by a receptor binding protein (RBP). This recognition is specific, and high affinity binding is essential for efficient virus attachment. The molecular details of phage adsorption to the Gram-positive cell are poorly understood. We present the first description of receptor binding proteins and a tail tip structure for the <b>siphovirus</b> group infecting Listeria monocytogenes. The host-range determining factors in two phages, A 118 and P 35 specific for L. monocytogenes serovar 1 / 2 have been determined. Two proteins were identified as RBPs in phage A 118. Rhamnose residues in wall teichoic acids represent the binding ligands for both proteins. In phage P 35, protein gp 16 could be identified as RBP {{and the role of}} both rhamnose and N-acetylglucosamine in phage adsorption was confirmed. Immunogold-labeling and transmission electron microscopy allowed the creation of a topological model of the A 118 phage tail...|$|E
40|$|D ow nloaded from ABSTRACT 19 This report {{includes}} {{the study of}} three novel bacteriophages, JL, Shanette and Basilisk, 20 which infect the pathogen B. cereus and carry genes that may contribute to its 21 pathogenesis. We analyzed host range and superinfection ability, mapped their 22 genomes, and characterized phage structure by mass spectrometry and transmission 23 electron microscopy (TEM). The JL and Shanette genomes were 96 % similar and 24 contained 217 ORFs and 220 ORFs respectively, while Basilisk has an unrelated genome 25 containing 138 ORFs. Mass spectrometry revealed 23 phage particle proteins for JL and 26 15 for Basilisk, while only 11 and four, respectively, were predicted to be present by 27 sequence analysis. Structural protein homology to well-characterized phages predicted 28 JL and Shanette as Myoviridiae, which was confirmed by TEM. The third phage, 29 Basilisk, was similar to only uncharacterized phages and is an unrelated <b>siphovirus.</b> 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of bacteriophages establish them as viable candidates for downstream development of pathogen detection assays and biocontrol measures. To utilize phages for such purposes, a detailed {{knowledge of their}} host interaction mechanisms is a prerequisite. There is currently a wealth of knowledge available concerning Gram-negative phage-host interaction, but little by comparison for Gram-positive phages and Listeria phages in particular. In this research, the lytic spectrum of two recently isolated Listeria monocytogenes phages (vB_LmoS_ 188 and vB_LmoS_ 293) was determined, and the genomic basis for their observed serotype 4 b/ 4 e host-specificity was investigated using comparative genomics. The late tail genes of these phages were identified to be highly conserved {{when compared to other}} serovar 4 -specific Listeria phages. Spontaneous mutants of each of these phages with broadened host specificities were generated. Their late tail gene sequences were compared with their wild-type counterparts resulting in the putative identification of the products of ORF 19 of vB_LmoS_ 188 and ORF 20 of vB_LmoS_ 293 as the receptor binding proteins of these phages. The research findings also indicate that conserved baseplate architectures and host interaction mechanisms exist for Listeria <b>siphoviruses</b> with differing host-specificities, and further contribute to the current knowledge of phage-host interactions with regard to Listeria phages...|$|R
40|$|The Roseobacter clade is {{abundant}} and widespread in marine environments and {{plays an important}} role in oceanic biogeochemical cycling. In this present study, a lytic siphophage (labeled vB_DshS-R 5 C) infecting the strain type of Dinoroseobacter shibae named DFL 12 T, which is part of the Roseobacter clade, was isolated from the oligotrophic South China Sea. Phage R 5 C showed a narrow host range, short latent period and low burst size. The genome length of phage R 5 C was 77, 874 bp with a G+C content of 61. 5 %. Genomic comparisons detected no genome matches in the GenBank database and phylogenetic analysis based on DNA polymerase I revealed phylogenetic features that were distinct to other phages, suggesting the novelty of R 5 C. Several auxiliary metabolic genes (e. g., phoH gene, heat shock protein and queuosine biosynthesis genes) were identified in the R 5 C genome that may be beneficial to the host and/or offer a competitive advantage for the phage. Among siphophages infecting the Roseobacter clade (roseosiphophages), four gene transfer agent-like genes were commonly located with close proximity to structural genes, suggesting that their function may be related to the tail of <b>siphoviruses.</b> The isolation and characterization of R 5 C demonstrated the high genomic and physiological diversity of roseophages as well as improved our understanding of host–phage interactions and the ecology of the marine Roseobacter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{analysis}} of bacteriophages infecting the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) {{is an important}} preliminary step {{in the development of}} a phage therapy protocol for these opportunistic pathogens. The objective of this study was to characterize KL 1 (vB_BceS_KL 1) and AH 2 (vB_BceS_AH 2), two novel Burkholderia cenocepacia -specific <b>siphoviruses</b> isolated from environmental samples. Results KL 1 and AH 2 exhibit several unique phenotypic similarities: they infect the same B. cenocepacia strains, they require prolonged incubation at 30 °C for the formation of plaques at low titres, and they do not form plaques at similar titres following incubation at 37 °C. However, despite these similarities, we have determined using whole-genome pyrosequencing that these phages show minimal relatedness to one another. The KL 1 genome is 42, 832 base pairs (bp) in length and is most closely related to Pseudomonas phage 73 (PA 73). In contrast, the AH 2 genome is 58, 065 bp in length and is most closely related to Burkholderia phage BcepNazgul. Using both BLASTP and HHpred analysis, we have identified and analyzed the putative virion morphogenesis, lysis, DNA binding, and MazG proteins of these two phages. Notably, MazG homologs identified in cyanophages have been predicted to facilitate infection of stationary phase cells and may contribute to the unique plaque phenotype of KL 1 and AH 2. Conclusions The nearly indistinguishable phenotypes but distinct genomes of KL 1 and AH 2 provide further evidence of both vast diversity and convergent evolution in the BCC-specific phage population. </p...|$|R
