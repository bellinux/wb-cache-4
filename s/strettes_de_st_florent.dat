Je les ai bien vus, bien examinés, j'ai [...] reconnu même de mes figures de Chollet et de Laval, et à leur [...] contenance et à leur mine, je l'assure qu'il ne leur manquait du [...] soldat que l'habit. Des troupes qui ont battu de tels Français [...] peuvent se flatter ainsi de vainere des peuples assez lâaches pour [...] se réunir centre un seul et encore pour la cause des rois! Enfin, je [...] ne sais si je me trompe, mais cette guerre de brigands, de paysans, [...] sur laquelle on a jeté tant de ridicule, que l'on dédaignait, que [...] l'on affectait de regarder comme méprisable, m'a toujours paru, pour [...] la république, la grande partie, et il me semble {{a present}} qu'avec [...] nos autres ennemis, nous ne ferrons plus que peloter.|$|R

50|$|However, {{his most}} {{important}} grants in Norfolk were to Sporle Priory, another Benedictine house subject to <b>St</b> <b>Florent</b> <b>de</b> Saumur, which he founded. He gave to the monks of <b>St</b> <b>Florent</b> the church at Sporle, its tithes, a man's landholding, a ploughland in Sporle and another in Mileham, firewood and building timber, and pasture for sheep. The Liber Albus of <b>St</b> <b>Florent</b> mentions {{that one of the}} monks present when Alan made the gift was Wihenoc, who initiated the action at Andover. Sporle was later endowed with property in Norfolk villages, including Great and Little Palgrave, where the priory had the church, Great Dunham, Hunstanton and Holme-next-the-Sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "How!" [...] said Henri, [...] "with your {{sticks and}} your hands, my friends--as your {{neighbours}} in <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> took her, at first, from the blues; {{we all think}} much of the men of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> because it was they first took 'Marie Jeanne;' let us be the men who rescue her from these traitors, and these people will think much of us." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{revolt of}} <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> {{took place on}} the day after that on which the priest had breakfasted at Durbellière, and the rumours of it went quickly through the country. As Cathelineau had said, the news was soon known in Nantes and Angers, and the {{commander}} of the republican troops determined most thoroughly to avenge the insolence and rebellion of the vain people of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent.</b> He was not, however, able to accomplish his threat on the instant, for he also was collecting conscripts in the neighbourhood of Nantes, and the peasantry had heard of the doings of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> as well as the soldiers, and the men of Brittany seemed inclined to follow the example of the men of Anjou.|$|R
60|$|He had, therefore, for a {{time enough}} to occupy his own troops, without {{destroying}} the rebels of St. Florent--and it was well for <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> that it was so. Had he at once marched five hundred men, with four pieces of cannon against the town, he might have reduced the place to ashes, and taken a bloody revenge for their victory The men of <b>St</b> <b>Florent</b> {{would have had no}} means of opposing such a force, and the peasantry generally were not armed, the tactics of the royalists were not settled, and the revolt through the province was not general. The destruction of <b>St</b> <b>Florent</b> was postponed for a month, and at the expiration of that time, the troops of the republic had too much to do, to return to the little town where the war had commenced.|$|R
60|$|It was Agatha Larochejaquelin. She and {{her father}} had, by slow stages, reached <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> in safety; and, after having seen him at rest, and spoken a word to her brother, her first care had been to inquire after the mother of Cathelineau. She had been told of her solitary state, and of her {{stubborn}} resolution to remain at <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> and she determined to offer her any aid in her power, as a duty due {{to the memory of}} him, with whom she had been, for a short time, so strangely connected.|$|R

50|$|It was a Benedictine Order priory founded before 1126 and was {{dedicated}} to St Peter. It was a dependent priory of the abbey of <b>St</b> <b>Florent</b> in Saumur, France, and was thus considered an alien priory.|$|R
60|$|The château of Durbellière, {{the family}} {{seat of the}} Larochejacquelins, was {{situated}} in the very centre of the Bocage, between the small towns of Chatillon and Vihiers--in the province of Poitou, and about twelve leagues from <b>St.</b> <b>Florent.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not Cathelineau the postillion; but Cathelineau the Saint of Anjou, and {{the hero}} of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> and of Saumur. He at any rate has linked my name {{with that of a}} man worthy of a woman's love." ...|$|R

60|$|He ceased speaking, and his {{audience}} crowded around him {{to shake hands}} with him, and to bless him; and before the sun {{was in the middle of}} the sky he had left <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> on his mission, in company with Forte and Peter Berrier.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not say so, M. Larochejaquelin," [...] {{said the}} priest, [...] "do not say so; {{we will do}} greater things than that with the {{assistance}} of God and the blessed Virgin; but we will not envy the men of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> the honour they have won." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{more than}} that your reverence," [...] said Chapeau, [...] "you are not {{counting}} M. de Lescure's men, who have gone on with the flags--or the men from Beauprieu who will follow M. d'Elbée, or the men from <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> who will come down with Cathelineau." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sturdy}} farmer there {{of the better}} sort--a man who not only held a farm near the town, but had a small shop within it, {{for the sale of}} seeds and tools for planting--his name was Foret--and it was said that no man in <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> was more anxious for the {{restoration}} of the King. There was the keeper of the auberge himself, who seemed but little inclined to find fault with his servant, for the contumacious manner in which he treated the commands of the Convention; and there was the well-known postillion of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> the crack of whose whip was so welcome from Angers to Nantes, the sound of whose cheery voice was so warmly greeted at every hostelrie between those towns. The name of Cathelineau was not then so well known as it was some six months afterwards, but even then Cathelineau, the postillion, was the most popular man in <b>St.</b> <b>Florent.</b> He was the merriest among the mirthful, the friend of every child, the playmate of every lass in the town; but he was the comforter of those poorer than himself, and the solace of the aged and afflicted. He was the friend of the banished priest, and the trusted messenger of the royalist seigneur; all classes adored him, save those who sided with the Republic, and by them he had long been looked on as an open and declared enemy. <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> was justly proud of its postillion; and now that evil days were come upon the little town, that their priests were banished, and these young men called for to swell the armies of the hated Convention, many flocked to Cathelineau to ask from whence he expected deliverance from all their troubles.|$|R
60|$|On {{the second}} day the equestrians crossed the Sevre, at Mortaigne, and reached Torfou in safety. On the third day they passed Montfaucon, and were {{struggling}} to get on to a village called Chaudron, not far from <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> when we overtook them {{at the beginning of}} the chapter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Peter Berrier to himself, as he {{ran across}} the fields, [...] "I wonder whether they'll make nothing of this job, too, as they did of that day at <b>St.</b> <b>Florent.</b> I suppose they will; some men haven't the luck ever to be thought much of." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{infection}} in his tears, for Agatha and Marie, {{when they saw}} them, cried too, and {{the eyes of some}} of the men also were not dry; they all knew what the feelings of the man were, and they fully sympathised with him. It was strange how little they said about <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> at first; the moment the men had been seen, they were most anxious for the tidings of what had been done; but now they all seemed satisfied as to the truth of what they had heard--there was no longer any doubt. The heroes of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> were there, and, though neither of them had yet spoken a word about the battle which had been fought, the presence of the victors was sufficient evidence of the victory.|$|R
50|$|The priory {{was granted}} to the Abbey of <b>St</b> <b>Florent</b> at Saumur, and was consecrated in the {{presence}} of William fitzBaderon in 1101. It was extended and became the parish church later in the twelfth century. Few traces of the early building remain, other than a short section of Norman wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is Foret, from <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> himself!" [...] {{shouted the}} priest, rushing out towards the door, {{as soon as}} he saw the first {{horseman}} turn in at the gate; [...] "a good man, and true as any living, and one who hates a skulking republican as he does the devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me show a clean pair of heels! I didn't {{run away}} at Saumur, nor yet at Fontenay, nor yet at many another pitched battle I saw. I didn't run away here at <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> I believe, {{when a few}} of us took the barracks against a full {{regiment}} of soldiers." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{all left}} off {{what they were}} doing, and listened anxiously for M. de Lescure's tidings. [...] "Good news, I trust," [...] said the Curé, whose face showed a fearful degree of anxiety. [...] "Good news, I trust in God; the men of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> I am sure, have not disgraced themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|De Lescure, in a litter, {{accompanied}} them to <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> and Chapeau {{was sent}} back to Chatillon to bid the ladies and the old Marquis join the army at that place. Chapeau was sent direct from the field of battle before it was known whether or no M. de Lescure's wound was mortal, and at a moment when Henri could give him nothing but a general direction as to the route which the army was about to take. Chapeau reached Chatillon without accident; but having reached it, he found that his difficulties were only about to commence. What was he to tell Madame de Lescure of her husband? How was he to convey the three ladies and the Marquis from Chatillon to <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> through a country, the greater portion of which would then {{be in the hands of}} the blues? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'What ails them, Peter?" [...] said Cathelineau, {{catching}} {{hold of the}} arm of a man who {{had followed}} him from <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> [...] "if they advance they will be destroyed at Varin;" [...] and as he spoke, he leapt upon the top of one of the waggons laden with provisions, which had come from Durbellière.|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} {{decided that they}} should all remain there that night, that de Lescure and Adolphe should return with Marie to Clisson on the {{following}} morning, and that Henri and the priest should accompany Foret and the postillion to <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> there {{to make the best}} arrangement within their power for the immediate protection of the place.|$|R
5|$|The first {{reliable}} mentions of Warelwast occur {{early in}} the reign of King William II, when Warelwast appears as authorizing writs for the king.

Of humble origins, he was educated by the collegial chapter of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> in Niederhaslach and {{eventually}} became secretary to the vicar general of the Bishop of Strasbourg. Suspected of theft, he left his position with the vicar and went to Rome about 1467. Burchard was ordained a priest in 1476.|$|R

6000|$|... "Get up, Annot; get up, thou little fool, and don't trouble the man {{to carry}} thee," [...] said Michael. [...] "If there be still a boat to take us, in God's name let us cross the river; for the blues are truly in <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> and after flying from them so far, it would be sore ill luck to be taken now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must see," [...] {{continued}} he, [...] "who will be {{our friends}} and our allies. <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> cannot fight single-handed against the Republic.

60|$|Cathelineau {{succeeded in}} taking {{back with him}} to <b>St.</b> <b>Florent,</b> nearly all {{the men who had}} {{accompanied}} him; his next object was the attack of Nantes, and as <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> is between Saumur and that town, his men were able to return to their homes, without going much out of their direct way. He marched through the town of Angers on his return, and took possession of the stores which he found there, the republican garrison having fled as soon as they heard of his approach; many of Bonchamps' men accompanied him, and some of those who had come to Saumur with de Lescure and Henri Larochejaquelin, young men who had no wives or families, and who literally preferred the excitement of the campaign, to their ordinary home employments; all such men joined Cathelineau's army, but by far the greater number of the peasants of the Bocage returned with de Lescure and Larochejaquelin.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the work}} of the {{conscription}} was commenced in silence. The lists were filled, and the names were drawn. No opposition was shown to the employés in this portion of their unpopular work. Indeed, it appears that no organized system of opposition had been planned; but the first attempt that was made to collect the unfortunate recruits upon whom the lots had fallen, was the signal for a general revolt. The first name on the list was that of Peter Berrier; and had Peter Berrier intended to prove himself a good citizen and a willing soldier, he should, without further call, have attended that day at the temporary barracks which had been established in <b>St.</b> <b>Florent.</b> But he had not done so, and there was nothing wonderful or unusual in this; for on all occasions of the kind many of the conscripts had to be sought out, and brought forth from the bosoms of their families, to which they retired, with a bashful diffidence as to their own peculiar fitness for martial glory. But in this instance not one of the chosen warriors obeyed the summons of the Convention, by attending at the barracks of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent.</b> Not one of the three hundred thousand men was there; and it was soon apparent to the colonel in command of the detachment, that he had before him the unpleasant duty of collecting one by one, from their different hiding-places, the whole contingent which the town of <b>St.</b> <b>Florent</b> was bound to supply.|$|R
