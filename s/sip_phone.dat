50|$|A <b>SIP</b> <b>phone</b> is an IP {{phone that}} {{implements}} client and server functions of a SIP user agent {{and provides the}} traditional call functions of a telephone, such as dial, answer, reject, call hold, and call transfer. SIP phones may be implemented as a hardware device or as a softphone. As vendors increasingly implement SIP as a standard telephony platform, the distinction between hardware-based and software-based SIP phones is blurred and SIP elements are implemented in the basic firmware functions of many IP-capable devices.|$|E
50|$|To {{enable the}} VoIP communications, the SIP/RTP packets should be {{utilised}} and STUN client {{would be the}} key component for VoIP communications with management of the SIP/RTP packets. A Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) client is used on some SIP-based VoIP phones as firewalls on network interface sometimes block SIP/RTP packets. Some special mechanism is required in this case to enable routing of SIP packets from one network to other. STUN is used {{in some of the}} <b>sip</b> <b>phones</b> to enable the SIP/RTP packets to cross boundaries of two different IP networks. A packet becomes unroutable between two sip elements if one of the networks uses private IP address range and other is in public IP address range. Stun is a mechanism to enable this border traversal. There are alternate mechanisms for traversal of NAT, STUN is just one of them. STUN or any other NAT traversal mechanism is not required when the two <b>SIP</b> <b>phones</b> connecting are routable from each other and no firewall exists in between.|$|R
50|$|To attach {{traditional}} analogue telephones to a pbxnsip installation, or {{to connect}} to PSTN trunk lines, {{requires the use of}} a SIP adapter.

5000|$|A {{telephony}} portal is {{a platform}} that aggregates many SIP IP telephony account providers through a unified service. It allows {{the user to}} choose one or many SIP VoIP operators or IP telephony operators to use into an <b>SIP</b> <b>phone.</b> Whoever the SIP telephony operator is the user can access to the portal services transparently from VoIP software, whether the service is IPTV, dating services, Wi-Fi location-based content etc. Paid services, such as Wi-Fi access or paid TV, can be billed through the operator when the portal and the operator have interconnected their billing systems.|$|E
50|$|As a SIP {{address is}} text, {{much like an}} e-mail address, it may contain non-numeric characters. As the client may be a <b>SIP</b> <b>phone</b> or other device with just a numeric, telephone-like keypad, various schemes exist to {{associate}} an entirely numeric identifier to a publicly reachable SIP address. These include the iNum Initiative (which issues E.164-formatted numbers, where the corresponding SIP address is the number '@sip.inum.net'), SIP Broker-style services (which associate a numeric *prefix to the SIP domain name) and the e164.org and e164.arpa domain name servers (which convert numbers to addresses one-by-one as DNS reverse-lookups).|$|E
5000|$|Some VoIP {{providers}} {{allow the}} user to configure their displayed number {{as part of the}} configuration page on the provider's web interface. No additional software is required. If the caller name is sent with the call (instead of being generated from the number by a database lookup at destination) it may be configured as part of the settings on a client-owned analog telephone adapter or <b>SIP</b> <b>phone.</b> The level of flexibility is provider-dependent. A provider which allows users to bring their own device and unbundles service so that direct inward dial numbers may be purchased separately from outbound calling minutes will be more flexible. A carrier which doesn't follow established hardware standards (such as Skype) or locks subscribers out of configuration settings on hardware which the subscriber owns outright (such as Vonage) is more restrictive. Providers which market [...] "wholesale VoIP" [...] are typically intended to allow any displayed number to be sent, as resellers will want their end user's numbers to appear.|$|E

The growing use of voice over IP (VOIP) phone technology makes these phone applications potential targets. We present a tool to perform security testing of VOIP applications to identify security vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an attacker. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the widespread standard for establishing and ending VOIP communication sessions. Our tool generates an input sequence for a <b>SIP</b> <b>phone</b> which is designed to reveal security vulnerabilities in the <b>SIP</b> <b>phone</b> application. The input sequence includes SIP messages and external graphical user interface (GUI) events which might contribute to triggering a vulnerability. The input sequence is generated to perform a random walk through the state space of the protocol. The generation of external GUI events is critical to testing a stateful protocol such as SIP because GUI interaction is required to explore {{a significant portion of the}} state space.

5000|$|NATs {{can also}} cause {{problems}} where IPsec encryption is applied and in cases where multiple devices such as <b>SIP</b> <b>phones</b> are located behind a NAT. Phones which encrypt their signaling with IPsec encapsulate the port information within an encrypted packet, meaning that NA(P)T devices cannot access and translate the port. In these cases the NA(P)T devices revert to simple NAT operation. This means that all traffic returning to the NAT is mapped onto one client causing service {{to more than one}} client [...] "behind" [...] the NAT to fail. There are a couple of solutions to this problem: one is to use TLS, which operates at level 4 in the OSI Reference Model and therefore does not mask the port number; another is to encapsulate the IPsec within UDP - the latter being the solution chosen by TISPAN to achieve secure NAT traversal, or a NAT with [...] "IPsec Passthru" [...] support.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} INTERSTATE fuzzer to detect {{security}} vulnerabilities in VOIP phones which implement Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). INTERSTATE generates an input sequence for a <b>SIP</b> <b>phone</b> which is constructed to reveal common security vulnerabilities. SIP is a stateful protocol so a state machine {{description of the}} SIP protocol is used by INTERSTATE {{to ensure that the}} entire state space is explored. The input sequence consists of SIP request messages as well as GUI input sequences which are remotely applied to the phone under test. The input sequence is generated to perform a random walk through the state space of the protocol. The application of GUI inputs is essential to ensure that all parts of the state machine can be tested. Faults are injected into SIP messages to trigger common vulnerabilities. INTERSTATE also checks the SIP response messages received from the phone under test against the expected responses described in the state machine. Checking response messages allows for the detection of security bugs whose impact is more subtle than a simple crash. We have used INTERSTATE to identify a previously unknown DoS vulnerability in an existing open source <b>SIP</b> <b>phone.</b> The vulnerability could not have been discovered without exploring multiple paths through the state machine, and applying GUI inputs during the fuzzing process. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} urgent {{challenges}} of the 21 st century is to investigate new technologies that can enable a transition towards a society with a reduced CO 2 footprint. Information Technology generates about 2 % of the global CO 2, which {{is comparable to the}} aviation industry. Being connected to the Internet requires active participation in responding to protocol messages. Billions of dollars worth of electricity every year are used to keep network hosts fully powered-on at all times only for the purpose of maintaining network presence. Most network hosts are idle most of the time, thus presenting a huge opportunity for energy savings and reduced CO 2 emissions. Proxying has been previously explored as a means for allowing idle hosts to sleep yet still maintain network presence. This dissertation develops general requirements for proxying and is the first exploration of application-level proxying. Proxying for TCP connections, SIP, and Gnutella P 2 P was investigated. The TCP proxy keeps TCP connections open (when a host is sleeping) and buffers and/or discards packets as appropriate. The SIP proxy handles all communication with the SIP server and wakes up a sleeping <b>SIP</b> <b>phone</b> on an incoming call. The P 2 P proxy enables a Gnutella leaf node to sleep when not actively uploading or downloading files by handling all query messages and keyword lookups in a list of shared files. All proxies were prototyped and experimentally evaluated. Proxying for P 2 P lead to the exploration of space and time efficient data structures to reduce the computational requirements of keyword search in the proxy. The use of pre-computation and hierarchical structures for reducing the false positive rate of a Bloom filter was explored. A Best-of-N Bloom filter was developed, which was shown to have a lower false positive rate than a standard Bloom filter and the Power-of- 2 Bloom filter. An analysis of the Best-of-N Bloom Filter was completed using Order Statistics to predict the false positive rate. Potential energy savings are shown to be in {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars per year assuming a modest adoption rate of the methods investigated in this dissertation.

30|$|Thus, even {{if there}} exist more than 130 permissions in Android, a user {{will be asked to}} grant or refuse permissions to a {{specific}} application only nine times at most (one per group). Although this approach seems more user-friendly, it has significant drawbacks in terms of security. All permissions to access any network services (3 G/ 4 G, NFC, Bluetooth) are associated to protection level normal. As consequences, users cannot control network access and any application can communicate anywhere. In addition, this loss of control is increased by the use of groups of permission. Indeed, users’ control regresses even with dangerous permissions. For instance, group PHONE includes seven permissions (use <b>SIP,</b> call <b>phone,</b> read phone state, process outgoing calls, read call log, write call log and add voicemail). Thus, when a Voice over IP application requests permission use SIP which seems relevant, the user can only grant the group of seven permissions. These permissions are not all relevant to a VoIP application. Thus, {{to limit the number of}} interactions with the users and cope with scalability, Android 6.0 has decreased the privacy protection capability of the system. These IBAC coarse-grained permissions only give the user an illusion of control.|$|R
