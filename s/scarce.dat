5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was <b>scarce.</b> In waters where food is <b>scarce,</b> the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E

5|$|Habitats {{within the}} SSSI include reed beds, salt marshes, {{freshwater}} lagoons and sand or shingle beaches. The wetlands {{are important for}} wildlife, including some <b>scarce</b> breeding birds such as pied avocets, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities. Ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles, natterjack toads and several <b>scarce</b> plants and invertebrates.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of {{different species of}} plants in ecological communities including forests and grasslands may be determined {{in part by the}} level of defensive compounds in the different species. Since the cost of replacement of damaged leaves is higher in conditions where resources are <b>scarce,</b> it may also be that plants growing in areas where water and nutrients are <b>scarce</b> may invest more resources into anti-herbivore defenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some <b>scarce</b> breeding species, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds, and is also a major migration stopoff and wintering site. There are also several nationally or locally <b>scarce</b> invertebrates and plants specialised for this coastal habitat. It has five bird hides and an environmentally friendly visitor centre and further expansion is planned through the acquisition of neighbouring land and improvements to visitor facilities.|$|E

Also in 2010, Graning, Raskin, Propatier along with Matt White provided original music for a children's carol CD. In 2011, recorded versions of the songs in The Fall and Rise of Circus Boy Blue where made available on Bandcamp, forming <b>Scarce's</b> second album.|$|R

5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar in size and occupying a strong position.

5|$|All of {{the ships}} saw service in World War I, {{although}} the diversion of coal, which was <b>scarce,</b> to the newer Tegetthoff and Radetzky classes limited {{the service of the}} remaining battleships.

5|$|Along these lines, some {{academics}} {{link the}} Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol {{was called a}} Drudenfuß and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is <b>scarce.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally <b>scarce</b> Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally <b>scarce</b> vascular plant species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
