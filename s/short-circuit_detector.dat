40|$|The paper {{presents}} an extended structure {{for a minimum}} variance adaptive control system of an induction generator, which aims to improve its operating behavior under electrical short-circuit conditions. The basic design idea is to limit the control to physically achievable values, and thus increasing the robustness of the control system and avoiding an instability regime. A control limiting block is proposed and used for this purpose. Moreover, a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>detector</b> enables an on-line setting of the control penalty factor, {{improving the quality of}} the controlled output. All these additional customizations of the control system, implemented to keep the plant operational under and after a short-time short-circuit fault (acting as an abnormal perturbation), must also provide good performance in the normal operating mode...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} automatic detection of burn-through in weld joints. Gas metal arc (GMA) welding with pulsed current is used, and welding voltage and current are recorded. As short-circuitings are common between the welding electrode and the work piece during burn-through, a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>detector</b> is developed to detect these events. To detect another specific characteristic of burn-through - this detector is combined with a square-law detector. This second detector {{is based on a}} non-linear modification of an autoregressive model with extra input (ARX-model) of the welding process. The results obtained from this compound detector indicate {{that it is possible to}} detect burn-through in the welds automatically. The work also indicates that it is possible to design an on-line monitoring system for robotic GMA welding. Godk√§nd; 1996; 20080219 (ysko...|$|E
