40|$|The ExB <b>shear</b> <b>stabilisation</b> of {{anomalous}} transport in JET hybrid discharges is studied via selfconsistent predictive modelling of electron and ion temperature, {{ion density}} and toroidal rotation velocity {{performed with the}} GLF 23 model. The ExB <b>shear</b> <b>stabilisation</b> factor (parameter aE in the GLF 23 model) is adjusted to predict accurately the four simulated quantities under different experimental conditions, and the uncertainty in aE determined by 15 % deviation between simulated and measured quantities is estimated. A correlation of aE with toroidal rotation velocity and ExB shearing rate {{is found in the}} low density plasmas, suggesting that the turbulence quench rule may be more complicated than assumed in the GLF 23 model with constant aE. For the selected discharges the best predictive accuracy is obtained by using weak/no ExB <b>shear</b> <b>stabilisation</b> (i. e. aE 0) at low toroidal angular frequency (W 100 krad/s). Interestingly, a weak ExB <b>shear</b> <b>stabilisation</b> of anomalous transport is found in the medium density strongly rotating discharge. An importance of linear be stabilisation in this discharge is estimated and compared to the low density discharge with equally high be. The toroidal rotation velocity is well predicted here by assuming that the momentum diffusion coefficient is a fraction of thermal ion diffusivity. Taking into account the aE and Prandtl number with their uncertainties determined in the modelling of JET hybrid discharges, the performance of ITER hybrid scenario with optimised heat mix (33 MW of NBI and 20 MW of ECCD) is estimated showing the importance of toroidal rotation for achieving Q > 5...|$|E
40|$|Equations {{describing}} nonlinear {{drift waves}} in a strongly inhomogeneous plasma, with a sheared flow profile {{perpendicular to the}} sheared magnetic field, are derived. In such configurations, the diamagnetic drift velocity is a spatially dependent function, and in the linear domain, the magnetic <b>shear</b> <b>stabilisation</b> criteria are substantially changed. In the nonlinear regime, possible analytical and numerical vortex chain solutions, periodic along the plasma flow and localised in the perpendicular direction, are found. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Local {{and global}} {{electrostatic}} gyrokinetic simulations of MAST spherical tokamak for ITG modes with adiabatic electron response find good agreement in linear stability with growth rates below the experimental E × B shearing rate. The kinetic treatment of electrons {{is shown to}} increase the growth rates above the shearing rate. The collisionless simulations with kinetic electrons and experimental flow shear find unstable modes in the outer part of the plasma. In global simulations the flow <b>shear</b> <b>stabilisation</b> {{is found to be}} asymmetric with respect the direction of flow with a small destabilising effect with a modest flow in the co-direction. The global non-linear simulations show turbulence spreading from the outer part of the plasma into the linearly stable core region. With adiabatic electrons and experimental profiles the turbulent heat transport is at or below the neoclassical level even without the flow shear. Treating electrons kinetically and including the flow shear effects increases the turbulent transport well above the neoclassical level. PACS numbers: 52. 55. F...|$|E
40|$|Simulations of JET and AUG HS {{with the}} GLF 23 model {{show that the}} {{observed}} core confinement improvement can be partly explained by the beneficial s/q effect on the ITG driven transport while {{the effect of the}} ExB <b>shear</b> <b>stabilisation</b> is weaker than in H-mode plasmas. Strong stabilising effect of βe on the ITG turbulence has been found, but the transport reduction due to this effect can be limited by the onset of the KBM mode at high βe. The simulations of toroidal rotation in HS with the GLF 23 model give an indication of the toroidal momentum pinch (Pr< 1). Use of H-mode parameters in the GLF 23 and BgB models results in the over-peaking of the density profile while the temperatures are sufficiently accurately predicted. Based on the performed analysis a retuning of the BgB [7] and GLF 23 models which enables a more accurate prediction for the main heating phase of HS is suggested. An impact of the models modifications on the predictions for ITER HS is to be assessed. The current ramp up and ramp down [2] phases are satisfactorily predicted with the original Lmode version of the BgB model. During the main heating phase the pedestal height and width are in a good agreement with the EPED model [9]. The modelling of ITER HS based on the results presented here, as well as the scenario optimisation will be discussed in Ref. 14...|$|E
