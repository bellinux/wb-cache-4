The relationship between the flow <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time</b> and the many hydraulic properties, and the estimating method of the stabilizing timc were investigated. From this study, the following were obtained. 1. The effect for the water stage <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time</b> by the gate groupe that were set downstream from the operating gate were tested. The stabilizing timne becomes slow with increaseing the numbers of gate, and it approches to a limited value. And then, the nondimensional curves related to the water stage <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time</b> were obtained for the eaeh cases of partial closing and opening of gate. 2, The effect for the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time</b> by the gate groupe that were set upstream from the operating gate were tested. For the case of partial closing of gate, the nondimensional <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time</b> curver, independently with the gate numbers, are shown by the curve, G-O, for the case that was equiped an operating gate only in channel. However, for the case of opening, the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time</b> becomes slower as gate numbers increase. The nondimensional curves were obtained for this case. 3. The stabilizing charaeteristics for an open channal system that were equiped many gates, where an optional operation of a gate was done, were studied.

For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the pressure gauge which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a <b>stabilized</b> <b>time</b> formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a pressure gauge will be stabilized can be calculated, and the <b>stabilized</b> <b>time</b> for a given pressure gauge is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the pressure gauge. Applied the <b>stabilized</b> <b>time</b> formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the pressure gauge can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the pressure gauge measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R

To optimize these communications, one solution consists in structuring networks into clusters. In this paper, {{we present a}} new self-stabilizing asynchronous distributed algorithm based on message-passing model. We compare the proposed algorithm {{with one of the}} best existing solutions based on message-passing model. Our approach does not require any initialization and builds non-overlapping k-hops clusters. It is based only on information from neighboring nodes with periodic messages exchange. Starting from an arbitrary configuration, the network converges to a stable state after a finite number of steps. A legal configuration is reached after at most n+ 2 transitions and uses at most n ∗ log(2 n+ k + 3) memory space, where n is the number of network nodes.

The period of the resulting discrete time crystal is quantized to an integer multiple of the drive period, arising {{from a combination of}} collective synchronization and many body localization. Here, we consider a simple model for a one dimensional discrete time crystal which explicitly reveals the rigidity of the emergent oscillations as the drive is varied. We numerically map out its phase diagram and compute the properties of the dynamical phase transition where the time crystal melts into a trivial Floquet insulator. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can be realized with current experimental technologies and propose a blueprint based upon a one dimensional chain of trapped ions. Using experimental parameters (featuring long-range interactions), we identify the phase boundaries of the ion-time-crystal and propose a measurable signature of the symmetry breaking phase transition.

30|$|Figure  6 b plots the raw {{output voltage}} data of sensor 1 versus time, for two fixed heating current of 6 and 20  mA. The {{resistance}} of the heater is measured to be around 1450  Ω under a small excitation current. The output signals increase first and stabilize after around 20 and 40  s for the current of 6  mA and 20  mA, respectively, where {{we can see the}} <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time</b> increase with the current. After stabilization, the voltage has a fluctuation of about ± 0.1  μV, corresponding to a temperature fluctuation of ± 0.13  K. This is consistent with the physical process of heat transport along the SiO 2 /Si substrate surface. With further measurement in time, the output does not increase because an equilibrium has been established when the heating power and dissipation are balanced. Therefore, although signal fluctuation is observed in the steady state region, we take the average stabilized output voltage data for each fixed heating powers. In Figure  6 c, the experimental data of four sensors, namely sensors 1, 4, 5, and 9 in Fig.  6 a, are plotted. With an increasing heating power, sensors 1 and 4 detect the higher temperatures than those by sensors 5 and 9, as sensors 1 and 4 are closer to the heater. Clearly, for sensors 1 and 4, a small ΔT of 0.2 – 0.4  K is detectable, and the output signal responses linearly to the heating power, showing a good sensing performance. But for sensors 5 and 9, as they are too far away from the heating zone, they show a low signal to noise ratio.|$|E

40|$|Modeling and {{evaluation}} of communication and computing systems is an important undertaking. In many cases, large-scale systems are designed in an ad-hoc manner, with validation (or disappointment regarding) system performance coming only after an implementation is made. This {{does not need to}} be the case. Modern modeling tools and techniques can yield accurate performance predictions that can be used in the design process. Stochastic activity networks (SANs), stochastic Petri nets (SPNs) and analytic solution methods permit specification and fast solution of many complex system models. To enhance the modeling power of SANs (SPNs), new steady-state analysis methods have been proposed for SAN (SPN) models that include non-exponential activities (transitions). The underlying stochastic process is a Markov regenerative process (MRP) when at most one non-exponential activity (transition) is enabled in each marking. Time-efficient algorithms for constructing the Markov regenerative process have been developed. However, the space required to solve such models is often extremely large. This largeness is due to the large number of transitions in the MRP. Traditional analysis methods require all these transitions be stored in memory for efficient computation. If the size of available memory is smaller than that needed to store these transitions, a time-efficient computation is impossible using these methods. To use this class of SANs to model real systems, the space complexity of MRP analysis algorithms must be reduced. In this thesis, we propose a new steady-state analysis method that is time and space efficient. The new method takes advantage of the structure of the underlying process to reduce both computation time and required memory. The performance of the proposed method is compared to existing methods using several SAN examples. In addition, the ability to model real systems using SANs that include exponential and deterministic activities is demonstrated by modeling and evaluating the performability of a group communication protocol, called Psync. In particular, we study message stabilization time (the time required for messages to arrive at all hosts) under a wide variety of workload and message loss probabilities. We then use this information to suggest a modification to Psync to reduce message <b>stabilizing</b> <b>time.</b> Another important issue we consider is the dependability modeling {{and evaluation}} of fault-tolerant parallel and distributed systems. Because of the inherent component redundancy in such systems, the state space size of the underlying stochastic process is often very large. Reduced base model construction techniques that take advantage of symmetries in the structure of such systems have the potential to avoid this state space growth. We investigate this claim, by considering the application of SANs together with reduced base model construction for the dependability modeling {{and evaluation of}} three different systems: a fault-tolerant parallel computing system, a distributed database architecture, and a multiprocessor shared-memory system...|$|E

40|$|We present here a fast {{parallel}} solver {{designed for}} a system of reaction convection diffusion equations. Typical applications are large scale computing of air quality models or numerical simulation of population models where several colonies compete. Reaction-Diffusion systems can be integrated in time by pointwise Newton iteration when all space dependent terms are explicit in the time integration. Such methods are easy to code and have scalable parallelism, but are numerically inefficient. An alternative method is to use operator splitting, decoupling the time integration of reaction from convection-diffusion. However, such methods may not be time accurate thanks to the stiffness of the reaction term and are complex to parallelize with good scalability. A second alternative is to use matrix free Newton-Krylov methods. These techniques are particularly efficient provided that a good parallel preconditioner is customized to the application. The method is then not trivial to implement.
