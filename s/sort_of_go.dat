With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>go</b> to the next place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where {{as many as a}} thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people."

[...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, Mark Frost {{worked for}} three years as {{a writer for the}} {{television}} police drama Hill Street Blues, which featured a large cast and extended story lines. Following his success with The Elephant Man (1980) and Blue Velvet in 1986, David Lynch was hired by a Warner Bros. executive to direct a film about the life of Marilyn Monroe, based on the best-selling book Goddess. Lynch recalls being [...] "sort of interested. I loved the idea of this woman in trouble, but I didn't know if I liked it being a real story." [...] Lynch and Frost first worked together on the Goddess screenplay and although the project was dropped by Warner Bros., they became good friends. They went on to work as writer and director for One Saliva Bubble, a film with Steve Martin attached to star, but it was never made either. Lynch's agent, Tony Krantz, encouraged him to do a television show. He took Lynch to Nibblers restaurant in Los Angeles and said, [...] "You should do a show about real life in America—your vision of America the same way you demonstrated it in Blue Velvet." [...] Lynch got an [...] "idea of a small-town thing," [...] and though he and Frost were not keen on it, they decided to humor Krantz. Frost wanted to tell [...] "a sort of Dickensian story about multiple lives in a contained area that could <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>go</b> perpetually." [...] Originally, the show was to be titled North Dakota and set in the Plains region of North Dakota.|$|E

We weren't really all that happy with the polished and clean-sounding Metal Heart.

Tom always hung back. You didn’t find out much about his writing from him, {{but he was always}} complaining that he wasn’t getting enough writing done, and that is the tip-off that somebody is absolutely haunted as a writer.

The fourth season episode [...] "Still," [...] which focuses only on Beth and Daryl, garnered praise in particular from television commentators, with viewers of the series having shipped Beth and Daryl as a couple. [...] Writing for IGN, Roth Cornet commended the [...] "Still" [...] episode, stating that [...] "Daryl and Beth revealed themselves to be more perfect a fit {{than any of the}} other combinations" [...] and that [...] "they brought out a raw honesty in one another that yielded what were some of the most grounded and engaging character moments of the season. They are two sides of a coin, and that's not something that had been entirely clear prior to this entry." [...] She additionally commented positively on Kinney's acting, saying it was: [...] "...the strongest acting we've seen from Emily Kinney, particularly in that final exchange on the porch." [...] Kinney said that the show was never clear on whether Beth and Daryl had a romantic or brother-sisterly connection, but that [...] "it was a situation where they were getting to know each other. First, they were just trying to get along" [...] because they did not see [...] "each other's point of view very well" [...] and, later, [...] "as the story went along they maybe became friends" [...] and [...] "it started to <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>go,</b> 'Oh, what more could this be?
