40|$|The microleakage {{patterns}} of four dentin-bonding systems (<b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose, All-Bond 2, One-step and Perma Quick) of class V composite resin was evaluated. Forty cavities {{were treated with}} each dentin bonding system according to the manufacturers’ instructions and restored with Z- 100 resin composite. All cavities were prepared with 90 -degree cavosurface margins and were located at the cement-enamel junction. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water at 37 oC, the teeth were immersed in 2 % basic fuchsin dye. All the teeth were sectioned in a mesio-distal direction using a diamond saw and each section was then inspected under a stereomicroscope. The result showed {{that none of the}} system tested in this study completely eliminated microleakage. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and Tukey (HSD) NP test found that at the incisal margin, <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose had the least leakage (p < 0. 01) then One-Step, however, All-Bond 2 and Perma Quick had the highest leakage. At the gingival margin, the <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose had the lowest leakage and no differences between One-Step. All-Bond 2 and Perma Quick, Wilcoxan test found that leakage {{patterns of}} <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose had no significant differences between incisal and gingival margins; however, One-Step had less leakage at the incisal than at the gingival margins; when All-Bond 2 and Perma Quick groups were evaluated, microleakage at the incisal and gingival margins was similar for each group.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare the microleakage of composite resin (Z- 100) and shear bond strength to bovine dentin using different types of adhesive systems (<b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose, All Bond 2, One-Step, and Perma Quick) to compare and correlate microleakage to shear bond strength. For the microleakage aspect of the study, 20 class V were prepared (bovine incisors) with 90 -degree cavosurface margins and were located at the cement-enamel junction using a template. Each dentin bonding system was applied to five cavities following the manufacturers’ instructions and restored with Z- 100 composite resin. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water at 37 oC, the teeth were immersed in 2 % basic fuchsin dye. All teeth were sectioned in a mesiodistal direction using a diamond saw, and each section was inspected under a stereomicroscope. For the shear bond strength aspect of the study, 20 bovine incisors were centrally horizontally mounted in Teflon mold with cold cure acrylic resin. Flat labial dentin surfaces were prepared using different grit silicon carbide abrasive wheels. Five specimens were used for each of the bonding agent systems. Each specimen was bonded with restorative composite resin (Z- 100) and applied to the treated dentinal surface through a split Teflon mold. All specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 oC for 24 hours. The bonds were stressed using shear forces at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min using an Instron Universal testing machine. Findings indicate none of the systems tested in this study were free from microleakage. <b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> multi-purpose achieved the best seal, with One-Step being second best, while All-Bond 2 and Perma Quick had the poorest seal. However, there were significant differences among the shear bond strengths of the four bonding systems tested. <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose has a higher bond strength to composite resin when compared to the other dentin adhesives.

40|$|Background: Bleaching the {{discoloured}} teeth {{may affect}} the tooth/composite interface. The aim of this in vitro experimental study was to evaluate the effect of vital tooth bleaching on microleakage of existent class V composite resin restorations bonded with three dental bonding agents. Methods : Class V cavities were prepared on buccal surfaces of 72 intact, extracted human anterior teeth with gingival margins in dentin and occlusal margins in enamel, and randomly divided into 3 groups. Cavities in the three groups were treated with <b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> Multi-Purpose, a total etch system and Prompt L-Pop and iBond, two self-etch adhesives. All teeth were restored with Z 250 resin composite material and thermo-cycled. Each group was equally divided into the control and the bleached subgroups (n = 12). The bleached subgroups were bleached with 15 % carbamide peroxide gel for 8 {{hours a day for}} 15 days. Microleakage scores were evaluated on the incisal and cervical walls. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Bonferroni post-hoc tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Bleaching with carbamide peroxide gel significantly increased the microleakage of composite restorations in Prompt L-Pop group at dentinal walls (P = 0. 001). Bleaching had no effect on microleakage of restorations in the <b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> Multi-Purpose and iBond groups.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} is to compare and {{evaluate}} the role of new dental adhesives to bond composite to the resinmodified glass inomer cement (RMGIC). Materials and Methods: Thirty specimens were prepared on acrylic blocks, with wells prepared in it by drilling holes, to retain the RMGIC. The specimens were randomly divided into three groups of ten specimens each. In Group a thin layer of selfetch adhesive (3 M ESPE) was applied between the RMGIC and the composite resin FILTEK P 60 (3 M SPE). In Group II, total etch adhesive (Adeper <b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> 2, 3 M ESPE) was applied, and in Group III, there was no application of any adhesive between RMGIC and the composite resin. After curing all the specimens, the shear bond strength was measured using an Instron universal testing machine. Results: The results were drawn and tabulated using ANOVA-fishers and Dunnet D statistical tests. The maximum shear bond strength values were recorded in Group I specimens with self-etch adhesive showing a mean value of 2. 74 when compared to the Group II adhesive (Total etch) showing a mean shear strength of value 1. 89, where no adhesive was used, showed a minimum mean shear bond strength of 1. 42. There was a great and significant difference between Group I and Group II (P value 0. 05) whereas, both Group I and Group II showed a vast and significant difference from Group III (P value = 0 - 001). Conclusion: Hence, this present study concludes that application of self-etch adhesive (3 M ESPE, U. S. A) in between RMGIC and composite resin increases the shear bond strength between RMGIC and the resin composites, as compared to the total-etch type adhesive (Adeper <b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> 2, 3 M ESPE, U.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Recently, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that different adhesive materials {{can be used for}} direct pulp capping. Previous studies have demonstrated that multi steps dentin adhesives could form reparative dentin similar to calcium hydroxide (CH). Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the histological pulp response of ninety mechanically exposed cat pulps to two adhesive resins (<b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> MP and Single Bond 3 M) were compared with a calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal, Dentsply). Materials and Methods : Class V facial cavities with similar pulpal exposures were prepared in canines. In the experimental groups phosphoric acid was used to etch the enamel and dentin and pulp exposure, and after it dentin adhesives was applied. The exposure point of the control group was capped with Dycal then the remainder of the cavities was etched and a dentin adhesive (single bond) was applied. All of the cavities were restored with a composite resin (Z 100) in usual manner. The animals were scarified after 7, 30 and 60 days (n= 30), and the pulp evaluated histologically, statistical analysis was carried out with Kruskal- Wallis test (a= 0. 05). Results: The data showed that most of the cases had mild inflammation of pulp tissue. There was no significant difference in inflammatory reaction of pulp by Dycal and two adhesive systems, severe inflammatory reaction of pulp was observed only in most of the 30 - day Single Bond group. Soft tissue organization of dentin bridge was less than ScotchBond and Dycal groups, the differentiation of dentin bridge was less than <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> group after 7 days. Conclusion: Slight inflammatory cell infiltration was the main reaction of exposed pulp when two commercially available adhesive resins were placed directly on the exposed pulp. There was no significant difference in inflammatory reaction of pulp between Dycal and two adhesive systems after 7 days and 60 days. After 7 days most of the specimens showed an amount of predentin deposition...|$|E

Study Design: Ceramic (IPS Empress) blocks were treated as follows: 1) no treatment, 2) 37 % phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4), 15 s, 3) 9 % hydrofluoric acid (HF), 5 min. Micro- and nano-roughness were assessed with a profilometer and {{by means of an}} atomic force microscopy (AFM). Water contact angle (CA) measurements were determined to assess wettability of the ceramic surfaces with the asixymetric drop shape analysis contact diameter technique. Shear bond strength (SBS) was tested to a resin composite (Z 100) with three different adhesive systems (<b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> Multipurpose Plus, Clearfil New Bond, ProBOND). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were performed. Results: Nanoroughness values assessed in 50 x 50 ?m areas were higher for the HF group, these differences were not detected by profilometric analysis. HF treatment created the nano- roughest surfaces and the smallest CA (p< 0. 05), producing the highest SBS to the composite resin with all tested adhesive systems (p< 0. 05). No diffe- rences existed between the SBS produced by the adhesive systems evaluated with any of the surface treatments tested.

Materials and Methods: Forty two glazed ceramic disks were assigned to three groups. In the first and second groups the specimens were etched with 9. 5 % hydrofluoric acid (HFA). Subsequently in first group, ceramic primer and adhesive were applied, but in second group a bonding agent alone was used. In third group, specimens were treated with 35 % phosphoric acid followed by ceramic primerand adhesive application. Brackets were bonded with light cure composites. The specimens were stored in distilled water in the room temperature for 24 hours and thermocycled 500 times between 5 °C and 55 °C. The universal testing machine was used to test the tensile bond strength and the adhesive remenant index scores between three groups was evaluated.

40|$|Objective. The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{undertake}} a literature search collecting all dentin bond strength data obtained for six adhesives with four tests (shear, microshear, tensile and microtensile) and to critically analyze the results with respect to average bond strength, coefficient of variation, mode of failure and product ranking. Method. A PubMed search was carried out for the years between 1998 and 2009 identifying publications on bond strength measurements of resin composite to dentin using four tests: shear, tensile, microshear and microtensile. The six adhesive resins were selected covering three step systems (OptiBond FL, <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose Plus), two-step (Prime & Bond NT, Single Bond, Clear. l SE Bond) and one step (Adper Prompt L Pop). Results. Pooling results from 147 references showed an ongoing high scatter in the bond strength data regardless which adhesive and which bond test was used. Coefficients of variation remained high (20 - 50 %) even with the microbond test. The reported modes of failure for all tests still included high number of cohesive failures. The ranking seemed to be dependant on the test used. Significance. The scatter in dentin bond strength data remains regardless which test is used confirming Finite Element Analysis predicting non-uniform stress distributions due to a number of geometrical, loading, material properties and specimens preparation variables. This reopens the question whether, an interfacial fracture mechanics approach to analyze the dentin - adhesive bond is not more appropriate for obtaining better agreement among dentin bond related papers.

Materials and Methods: Flat superficial dentin surfaces of seventy-two extracted human molars were randomly divided into three groups (A: <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> MP Plus (SBMP), B: Single Bond (SB), C: Prompt L-Pop) according to the applied adhesives and twelve subgroups (n= 6) according to the following saliva contamination applied in different bonding steps. The specimens were contaminated with saliva after etching (A 1 and B 1), after primer application (A 2), after adhesive application before polymerization (A 3, B 2 and C 1), and after adhesivepolymerization (A 4, B 3 and C 2). Three subgroups were not contaminated as controls (A 5, B 4 and C 3). Resin composite was placed on dentin subsequently followed by thermocycling. Shear test was performed by Universal testing machine at 0. 5 mm/min crosshead speed. The collected data were statically analyzed using one and two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD. Results: In contrast to SBMP and SB, the mean shear bond strength of Promote L-Pop was not significantly different between contaminated and uncontaminated subgroups. Mean shear bond strengths of SBMP subgroups contaminated after adhesive polymerization or uncontaminated were significantly higher {{compared to the other}} two groups (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Unlike Promote L-Pop, saliva contamination could reduce shear bond strength of the total-etch adhesives.

The use of lower radiation, to make structural and chemical changes in dentinal surfaces has been investigated. This research was conducted to evaluate the shear strength of the composite bonded to primary teeth dentin after Nd: YAG laser radiation and acid etching for conditioning. Peripheral dentin of the buccal and lingua! surfaces of 60 extracted posterior primary teeth were exposed and polished with 600 grit with Sic paper. The teeth were divided randomly in 3 groups of 20 teeth. In group 1 etching gel, primer and adhesive of <b>scotch</b> <b>bond</b> multipurpose system (SMP), in group 2 laser at 1. 6 w and 80 mj/pulse, and in group 3 laser at 2 s and 700 mj/pulse were used. Moreover, in groups 2 and 3, after laser radiation, acid etching, primer and adhesive of SMP system were applied. After necessary laboratory tests, the mean shear bond strength in MPa were 20. 99 &plusmn; 5. 3 (group 1), 23. 82 &plusmn; 6. 31 (group 2) and 26. 58 &plusmn; 5. 59 (group 3).

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the bond strength of resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) to composite resin considering the use of conventional and self-etching adhesive systems. Material and Methods: 60 RMGIC blocks (Riva, SDI) measuring 4 x 4 x 4 mm. were constructed. On the blocks, the application of different protocols of adhesive systems (n = 10) was carried out: Group 1 (Control) - without application of adhesive agent; Group 2 - 37 % phosphoric acid + conventional adhesive agent Single Bond 2; Group 3 - conventional adhesive agent Single Bond 2; Group 4 – conventional adhesive agent <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi-Purpose; Group 5 - self-etching adhesive Clearfil SE Bond; Group 6 : self-etching adhesive Optibond Allin-One. Next, resin composite blocks measuring 4 x 4 x 4 mm were constructed (Venus, Heraeus Kulzer). The specimens were cut to obtain sticks which were submitted to microtensile bond strength test in a universal testing machine. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (5 %). Results: ANOVA showed a value of p < 0. 05, which indicated significant differences between the groups (in Mpa) : Group 2 - 32. 83; Group 5 - 31. 2; Group 3 - 25, 15 b; Group 6 - 22. 92; Group 4 - 22. 15; Group 1 - 13. 84. The analysis of fracture mode demonstrated that there was a predominance of adhesive and mixed fractures for all groups. Conclusion: The protocols of acid etching + conventional adhesive system Single Bond 2 (Group 2) or self-etching adhesive system Clearfil SE Bond (Group 5) increased the bond strength of RMGIC to the composite resin. The presence of an adhesive layer between the two materials tended to improve the bonding of RMGIC to composite resin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} mechanical cycling and cementation strategies on the push-out bond strength between fiber posts and root dentin and the polymerization stresses produced using three resin cements. Materials and Methods: Eighty bovine mandibular teeth were sectioned to a length of 16 mm, prepared to 12 mm, and embedded in self-curing acrylic resin. The specimens were then distributed into 8 groups (n = 10) : Gr 1 - Scotchbond Multi Purpose + RelyX ARC; Gr 2 - Scotchbond Multi Purpose + RelyX ARC + mechanical cycling; Gr 3 - AdheSE + Multilink Automix; Gr 4 - AdheSE + Multilink Automix + mechanical cycling; Gr 5 - phosphoric acid + RelyX U 100 (self-adhesive cement); Gr 6 - phosphoric acid+ RelyX U 100 + mechanical cycling; Gr 7 - RelyX U 100; Gr 8 - RelyX U 100 + mechanical cycling. The values obtained from the push-out bond strength test were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p = 0. 05), while the values obtained from the polymerization stress test were subjected to one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: Mechanical cycling {{did not affect the}} bond strength values (p = 0. 236), while cementation strategies affected the push-out bond strength (p < 0. 001). Luting with RelyX U 100 and <b>Scotch</b> <b>Bond</b> Multi Purpose + RelyX ARC yielded higher push-out bond strength values. The polymerization stress results were affected by the factor "cement" (p = 0. 0104) : the self-adhesive cement RelyX U 100 exhibited the lowest values, RelyX ARC resulted in the highest values, while Multi link Automix presented values statistically similar to the other two cements. Conclusion: The self-adhesive cement appears to be a good alternative for luting fiber posts due to the high push-out bond strengths and lower polymerization stress values.

40|$|Background: Class ll {{sandwich}} restorations {{are routinely}} performed where conventional Glass ionomer cement (GIC) or Resin-modified GIC (RMGIC) {{is used as}} a base or dentin substitute and a light curing composite resin restorative material {{is used as a}}n enamel substitute. Various authors have evaluated the microleakage of composite resin restorations where glass ionomer cement {{has been used as a}} base in class II sandwich restorations, but a literature survey reveals limited studies on the microleakage analysis of similar restorations with biodentine as a dentin substitute, as an alternative to glass ionomer cement. The aim of this study is: To evaluate the marginal sealing efficacy of a new calcium-silicate-based material (Biodentine) as a dentin substitute, at the cervical margins, in posterior class II sandwich restorations. To compare and evaluate the microleakage at the biodentine/composite interface with the microleakage at the resin-modified GIC/composite interface, in posterior class II open sandwich restorations. To compare the efficacy between a water-based etch and rinse adhesive (<b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> multipurpose) and an acetone-based etch and rinse adhesive (Prime and bond NT), when bonding biodentine to the composite. To evaluate the enamel, dentin, and interfacial microleakage at the composite and biodentine/RMGIC interfaces. Materials and Methods: Fifty class II cavities were prepared on the mesial and distal surfaces of 25 extracted human maxillary third molars, which were randomly divided into five groups of ten cavities each: (G 1) Biodentine group, (G 2) Fuji II LC GIC group, (G 3) Biodentine as a base + prime and bond NT + Tetric N-Ceram composite, (G 4) Biodentine + scotchbond multi-purpose + Tetric N-Ceram composite, (G 5) Fuji II LC as a base + prime and bond NT+ Tetric-N Ceram composite. The samples were then subjected to thermocycling, 2500 × (5 °C to 55 °C), followed by the dye penetration test. Scores are given from 0 to 3 based on the depth of penetration of the dye at the cervical, dentin, and interfacial surfaces. The data was analyzed with the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U test. Results: No statistically significant differences were found between the five groups in the enamel, dentin, and interfacial regions. Conclusion: Within the limits of this in vitro study, biodentine is a new calcium-silicate-based material, which can be used as a dentin substitute in class II open-sandwich restorations, where its scores better than resin-modified GIC...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Restoring endodontically treated teeth {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{treatments}} provided by the dental practitioner. Selection and proper use of restorative materials continues to be a source of frustration for many clinicians. There is controversy surrounding the most suitable choice of restorative material and the placement method that will result in the highest probability of successful treatment. This clinical study compares two different varieties of fiber posts and one cast post and core in terms of mobility of crown margin under finger pressure, recurrent caries detected at the crown margin, fracture of the restoration, fracture of the root and periapical and periodontal pathology requiring crown removal over the period of 12 months as evaluated by clinical and radiographical examination. Materials and Methods: 30 root canal treated, single rooted maxillary anterior teeth of 25 patients in the age range of 18 - 60 years where a post retained crown was indicated were selected for the study between January 2007 and August 2007; and prepared in a standard clinical manner. It was divided into 3 groups of 10 teeth in each group. After post space preparation, the Carbon fiber and Glass fiber reinforced posts were cemented with <b>Scotch</b> <b>bond</b> multipurpose plus bonding agent and RelyX adhesive resin cement in the first and second groups respectively. The Cast post and cores were cemented with Zinc Phosphate cement in the third group. Following post- cementation, the preparation was further refined and a rubber base impression was taken for metal-ceramic crowns which was cemented with Zinc Phosphate cement. A baseline periapical radiograph was taken once each crown was cemented. All patients were evaluated after one week (baseline), 3 months, 6 months and one year for following characteristics mobility of crown margin under finger pressure, recurrent caries detected at the crown margin, fracture of the restoration, fracture of the root and periapical and periodontal pathology. Results: Results after 12 months showed that none of the restorations among groups of cast post and core, carbon fiber reinforced post and glass fiber reinforced post with composite core restorations failed in terms of recurrent caries detected at the crown margin, fracture of the restoration, fracture of the root and periapical and periodontal pathology. One case of cast post and core and one case of carbon fiber reinforced post with composite core restorations showed slight mobility of crown margin under finger pressure at 12 th month recall but all the cases of glass fiber post with composite core restorations did not show any signs of mobility of crown margin under finger pressure at all the recall periods on clinical and radiographical examination. Conclusion: From this 12 months clinical evaluation of all the cases in the 3 groups comprising of cast post and core; carbon fiber reinforced post with composite core and glass fiber reinforced post with composite core restored with porcelain fused to metal crowns, it is concluded that glass fiber reinforced post with composite core when used in single rooted upper anterior teeth are associated with a higher success rate in restoration of endodontically treated teeth...|$|E
