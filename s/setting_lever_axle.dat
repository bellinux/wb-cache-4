2500|$|In 1975, [...] "Expert Series" [...] {{sets were}} introduced, geared towards older, more {{experienced}} Lego builders {{followed by the}} [...] "Expert Builder" [...] sets in 1977. The technical sets featured moving parts such as gears, differentials, cogs, <b>levers,</b> <b>axles</b> and universal joints, and permitted the construction of realistic models such as automobiles, with functional {{rack and pinion steering}} and lifelike engine movements. In 1978 the Lego [...] "minifigure" [...] was added. These small Lego people have posable arms and legs, and a smile. The figure was used in many varieties of Lego sets, allowing construction of towns populated with the smiling minifigure Lego citizens. Lego also expanded into space with the creation of Lego Space sets with astronaut minifigures, rockets, lunar rovers and spaceships and in medieval territory with the Castle theme.|$|R

This kind of machine included the Original Odhner, Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although {{most of these}} were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the <b>setting</b> <b>lever</b> positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind {{from the rear}} and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were <b>lever</b> <b>setting,</b> with a unique design of <b>set</b> <b>lever</b> which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00.|$|R

The player controls robots (which are designed, built and named in-game) around {{the interior of the}} Omega and must shut down its four reactors. These robots have a limited amount of artificial intelligence and can be programmed to take set routes or allowed to explore of their own accord. The player can also directly control the robots. Occasionally, simple puzzles (often involving <b>setting</b> <b>levers</b> correctly) must be solved or hostile robots aboard the Omega must be combatted.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the researched changeover from Operational Excellence (OE) {{to the new}} path of Operations Excellence (OsE). Operational Excellence (OE) predominantly deals with the efficiency (productivity), effectiveness (customer/market orientation) and optimization of production processes. In comparison, Operations Excellence (OsE) enlarges that perspective to see operations as <b>setting</b> <b>lever</b> by providing enablers as a central role for operational long-term success. The assessment of required against existing setting of enabler criteria in an organization (e. g., high performance culture, methods and instruments, employee empowerment, etc.) supports to become a plant's future health foreseeable and to identify its capability to achieve sustainability and excellence in terms of operations. To support a methodical integration of Operations Excellence in organizations, an OsE assessment framework has been developed within the applied research project “IMFT”. The model design containing the identification of relevant criteria and their cause-effect relationships {{is a key element}} of the present paper...|$|R
5000|$|Ed Leedskalnin and his megalithic creation, Rock Gate, {{better known}} as Coral Castle, {{became a part of}} the American popular culture due to the {{magnitude}} of a single man's effort, perseverance, and determination. With the advent of the Internet, Leedskalnin's fame spread far beyond Florida. Along with the recognition came speculations about his seemingly superhuman powers: either it was his purported access to alien technology or esoteric ancient knowledge, or his assumed ability to levitate blocks of stone and move them with the aid of the Earth's magnetic energy. Other currently available explanations center on Leedskalnin's stonemason and logging experiences that presumably allowed him to apply his work skills creatively to a tedious process of moving large blocks of stone using <b>levers,</b> wheels, <b>axles,</b> pulleys, ramps, and wedges without any power equipment.|$|R
2500|$|There {{were two}} visibly {{different}} styles of mechanical design for the elements. The original models had a metal spring clip with two wire wings that were squeezed together to release the element from the typewriter. [...] Later models had a plastic lever molded around a metal axle which pried apart the now-internal spring clip. This {{had a tendency to}} break where the <b>lever</b> joined the <b>axle.</b> The Selectric element was later redesigned to have an all-plastic lever.|$|R

50|$|The lever tumbler lock, {{which uses}} a <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting lever lock {{required}} the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|R
50|$|The DRG Class 99.17, {{formerly}} the Württemberg Ts 4 of the Royal Württemberg State Railways were German narrow gauge steam locomotives bought for working the 15.11 kilometre long route between {{the towns of}} Altensteig and Nagold. The three tank locomotives had an outer frame and a Klose drive. The first and third axles were steered by the third, radially-sliding axle {{by means of a}} system of <b>levers.</b> The second <b>axle</b> was driven by the inside cylinder and had no wheel flanges. Overall the system was very reliable, but nevertheless also very maintenance-intensive.|$|R

50|$|Mandatory for all {{railroad}} watches after roughly 1908, {{this kind}} of pocket watch was set by opening the crystal and bezel and pulling out the setting-lever (most hunter-cases have levers accessible without removing the crystal or bezel), which was generally found at either the 10 or 2 o'clock positions on open-faced watches, and at 5:00 on hunting cased watches. Once the lever was pulled out, the crown could be turned to set the time. The lever was then pushed back in and the crystal and bezel were closed over the dial again. This method of time setting on pocket watches was preferred by American and Canadian railroads, as <b>lever</b> <b>setting</b> watches make accidental time changes impossible. After 1908, <b>lever</b> <b>setting</b> was generally required for new watches entering service on American railroads.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{filling the}} vacuum in the mobile content 1 {{literature}} addressing {{the following two}} macro-topics: the identification, classification and assessment of problems and inhibitor factors thwarting players involved in the mobile content market in the U. S.; second, the analysis of drivers that companies along the mobile content value chain may harness for breaking such challenges down. In the end, the research study provides a <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> which companies {{can take advantage of}} for increasing their performances as well as meeting critical success factors. To accomplish our objectives, we have employed the multiple case studies methodology and performed a multi-criteria analysis along the value chain position (e. g., content provisioning, content aggregation) and types of content offered (e. g., video, music). Specifically, the sample of analysis comprises 67 companies throughout the value chain and offerings. We have identified, at an industry level, six problems hampering the mobile content market in the U. S. : customer awareness and education as well as user habits and acceptance; pricing strategies; regulations; platform’s standards and solutions; OffDeck underdevelopment; economics and monetization opportunities. For each of them, we have delineated a <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> which players have started taking into account for overcoming such inhibitor factors (e. g., social network mediums, smartphones and new distribution channels, pricing plans) ...|$|R
