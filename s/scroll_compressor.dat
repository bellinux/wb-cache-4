Therefore, Toyota specifies a POE oil (designated ND11) is required for repairs. The system cannot be serviced with equipment normally employed for regular cars, which typically use PAG oils, as the equipment would contaminate the ND11 oil with PAG oil. According to SAE J2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1% PAG when filling. One percent PAG oil may result in an electrical resistance drop by a factor of about 10.|$|E

40|$|Convective heat {{transfer}} in the compression chambers of <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> affects important quantities {{associated with the}} compression cycle, such as the volumetric efficiency and the discharge gas temperature. In spite of its relevance, {{heat transfer}} in <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> has not been sufficiently studied mainly due to difficulties associated with its geometry. This paper presents a numerical model developed to predict the convective heat transfer in the compression chambers of <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors,</b> by applying the finite volume method to solve the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy. An equation of state for real gas was also considered to complete the system of equations and relate pressure, temperature and density along the compression cycle.

50|$|A <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> (also called spiral compressor, {{scroll pump}} and scroll vacuum pump) is a device for {{compressing}} air or refrigerant. It {{is used in}} air conditioning equipment, as an automobile supercharger (where it {{is known as a}} scroll-type supercharger) and as a vacuum pump. Many residential central heat pump and air conditioning systems and a few automotive air conditioning systems employ a <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> instead of the more traditional rotary, reciprocating, and wobble-plate compressors.|$|E
50|$|Léon Creux first {{patented}} a <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> in 1905 in France and the US (Patent number 801182).Creux {{invented the}} compressor as a rotary steam engine concept, but the metal casting {{technology of the}} period was not sufficiently advanced to construct a working prototype, since a <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> demands very tight tolerances to function effectively. The first practical scroll compressors did not appear on the market until after World War II, when higher-precision machine tools enabled their construction. They were not commercially produced for air conditioning until the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Recently, <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> {{have been}} {{manufactured}} that provide part-load capacity {{within a single}} compressor. These compressors change capacity while running.|$|R
50|$|The {{compression}} process occurs over approximately 2 to 2½ rotations of the crankshaft, {{compared to}} one rotation for rotary compressors, and one-half rotation for reciprocating <b>compressors.</b> The <b>scroll</b> discharge and suction processes occur {{for a full}} rotation, compared to less than a half-rotation for the reciprocating suction process, and less than a quarter-rotation for the reciprocating discharge process. Reciprocating compressor have multiple cylinders (typically, anywhere from two to six), while <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> only have one compression element. The presence of multiple cylinders in reciprocating compressors reduces suction and discharge pulsations. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} state whether <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> have lower pulsation levels than reciprocating compressors as has often been claimed by some suppliers of <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors.</b> The more steady flow yields lower gas pulsations, lower sound and lower vibration of attached piping, while having no influence on the compressor operating efficiency.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are also}} {{positive}} displacement compressors. The refrigerant is compressed when one spiral orbits around a second stationary spiral, creating {{smaller and smaller}} pockets and higher pressures. By the time the refrigerant is discharged, it is fully pressurized.|$|R

50|$|A <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> {{operating}} in reverse {{is known as}} a scroll expander, and can be used to generate mechanical work from the expansion of a fluid, compressed air or gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{involute}} of {{a circle}} {{is also an important}} shape in gas compressing, as a <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> can be built based on this shape. Scroll compressors make less sound than conventional compressors, and have proven to be quite efficient.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary {{vane pumps}} - similar to <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors,</b> these have a {{cylindrical}} rotor {{encased in a}} similarly shaped housing. As the rotor orbits, the vanes trap fluid between the rotor and the casing, drawing the fluid through the pump.|$|R

Reversible air-to-water heat pump systems have to operate at high efficiency levels on a wide operating range to be an economical alternative to the traditional heating and cooling systems. This paper presents the advantages, the control and the implementation of multi vapor injected <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> systems in commercial heat pump water heater application. Enhanced Vapor Injection (EVI) technology allows both performance and reliability improvement across the compressors operating area, especially at low ambient temperatures. Wet Vapor Injection allows extending compressors operating range at very low ambient and high condensing temperatures.

50|$|Rheem was {{the first}} {{residential}} HVAC company to begin using <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> throughout their lineup in 1994, and all air conditioners and heat pumps continue to use Copeland <b>Scroll</b> <b>Compressors.</b> The company was also first to introduce a 14 SEER remote condensing unit in 1997. In 1998, the company began supplying the Home Depot with a line of GE branded water heaters. In 2009, Rheem and Ruud {{were the first to}} sell a Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater, which was more than twice as efficient as similar electric water heaters. Also in the same year, Rheem and Ruud central air conditioners were reported to have the fewest percentage of units requiring repair among all major HVAC brands according to Consumer Reports.|$|R
50|$|Some {{compressor}} types {{such as the}} <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> use a continuously shrinking compression volume. Once liquid completely fills {{this volume}} the pump may either stall and overload, or the pump chamber may be warped or otherwise damaged by the fluid that can not fit into a smaller space.|$|E
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{never have}} a suction valve, but depending on the application {{may or may not}} have a discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve is more prominent in high pressure ratio applications, typical of refrigeration. Typically, an air-conditioning scroll does not have a dynamic discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve improves <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions, when the operating pressure ratio is well above the built-in pressure ratio of the compressors. If the compressor is designed to operate near a single operating point, then the <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> can actually gain efficiency around this point if there is no dynamic discharge valve present (since there are additional discharge flow losses associated with the presence of the discharge valve as well as discharge ports tend to be smaller when the discharge is present).|$|E

50|$|Emerson {{manufactures}} a <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> that {{is capable}} of varying the refrigerant flow as per requirement. Instead of fixing the scrolls together permanently, the scrolls are allowed to move apart periodically. As the scrolls move apart, the motor continues to turn but the scrolls lose the ability to compress refrigerant, thus motor power is reduced when the <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> is not pumping. By alternating the two different working states: the loaded state and the unloaded state. A solenoid contracts and expands the rotating scroll and/or the fixed scroll, using axial compliance. The controller modifies the load time, and the unload time, matching the capacity of the compressor to the load requested. This type of scroll compressors while offering variable capacity control, normally down to 20% of the full flow, can suffer from a significant loss of efficiency especially toward the lower range of the capacity control.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{research}} about the oil-gas separator {{was conducted in}} order to improve the performance of electric driven <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> used in eco-friendly HEV/EVs. The compressor used in the tests was â€œback pressureâ€ method electric driven <b>scroll</b> <b>compressors</b> using oil. To maintain adequate back pressure, an oil separator in the discharge chamber is required. It is inevitable that the refrigerant passing an oil separator inside a discharge chamber experiences a pressure drop. This pressure drop increases input power, resulting in some decrease of the COP of the compressor. Various parameters of the oil separatorâ€” the length of vortex finders; installation angle; and the inlet, outlet diametersâ€” related to the pressure drop were considered. The installation angle and the outlet diameters had no significant effect on the pressure drop; however, a pressure drop decrease in relation to the length of the vortex finder and the inlet diameter was confirmed. As the vortex finder length decreased and the inlet diameter increased, the input power of the compressor is decreased about 4. 12 % and the COP is increased about 2. 66 % by the reduction of the pressure drop...|$|R
50|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} scroll compressors is {{slightly higher than}} that of a typical reciprocating compressor when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point. The scroll compressors are more efficient in this case because {{they do not have a}} dynamic discharge valve that introduces additional throttling losses. However, the efficiency of a <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> that does not have a discharge valve begins to decrease as compared to the reciprocating compressor at higher pressure ratio operation. This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high pressure ratio operation of the positive displacement compressors that do not have a dynamic discharge valve.|$|E
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{tend to be}} {{very compact}} and smooth running and so do not require spring suspension. This allows them to have very small shell enclosures which reduces overall cost but also results in smaller free volume. This is a weakness in terms of liquid handling. Their corresponding strength is in the lack of suction valves which moves the most probable point of failure to the drive system which may be made somewhat stronger. Thus the scroll mechanism is itself more tolerant of liquid ingestion {{but at the same time}} is more prone to experience it in operation. The small size and quiet operation of a <b>scroll</b> <b>compressor</b> allow for the unit to be built into high power density computers, like IBM mainframes. Scroll compressors also simplify the piping design, since they require no external connection for the primary coolant.|$|E
