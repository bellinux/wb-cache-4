His real name is Elliot Franklin, and is described as a criminal who has somehow been enhanced, described by <b>SHIELD.</b> <b>Cap,</b> under orders from Fury sends the Panther to stop him as a trial for his inductance into The Ultimates. He is visually still the same, as in still muscular African American, who has a giant 5-ton ball.|$|R
5000|$|The belts {{used were}} common M1839 [...] "baby" [...] US" [...] belts that were 1.5 inches. Also used were Springfield bayonets and {{scabbards}} {{with the various}} models of [...]69 weapons, <b>shield</b> pattern <b>cap</b> pouches, and the M1857 cartridge box.|$|R
50|$|The Kookooligit Mountains are a {{volcanic}} mountain range on north-central St. Lawrence Island in the U.S. state of Alaska. They {{consist of a}} 30 km long and 40 km wide <b>shield</b> volcano <b>capped</b> with over 100 smaller volcanic cones. The volcanic cones are composed primarily of alkali olivine basalts, olivine tholeiite, and basanite.|$|R
50|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{remained}} unchanged until 1922, after World War I, when Transylvania was united with the Kingdom of Romania. Then the coat of arms of Transylvania {{was placed in the}} fourth quarter, with the Turul replaced by a black aquila, the third quarter depicted the joined coats of arms of Banat and Oltenia (the bridge of Apollodorus of Damascus and a golden lion respectively), and the coat of arms of Dobruja was placed in an insertion. The shield was placed on the chest of a golden crossed and crowned aquila, {{as a symbol of the}} Latinity of the Romanians. The aquila was placed on a blue <b>shield,</b> <b>capped</b> with the Steel Crown. The coat of arms had three versions: lesser, middle (with supporters and motto), and greater (the middle arms on a mantle red lined with ermine).|$|R
50|$|Mount Harper is {{a deeply}} eroded Late Proterozoic {{volcanic}} complex located 71 km north of Dawson City and 33 km west of Mount Gibben. Mount Harper is in the Ogilvie Mountains and is the 1200 m thick remnant of a subaqueous-to-emergent basaltic <b>shield</b> volcano <b>capped</b> by small rhyodacitic and andesitic lava flows. It oversteps the Harper Fault.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the same}} day he avenged his brother. Marhab {{came out of the}} fortress, {{challenging}} the Muslims to single combat. Ibn Maslamah volunteered because, [...] "I am a wronged and angry person. Permit me to fight Marhab, for he is the killer of my brother." [...] A tree stood between them, and each slashed at the branches until they were all cut away and the two warriors were face to face. Marhab struck Ibn Maslamah, who caught the blow on his shield. Then Ibn Maslamah slashed at Marhab's thighs and felled him. He shouted, [...] "Taste death, just as my brother Mahmud tasted it!" [...] but before he could strike the death-blow, Ali passed by and cut off Marhab's head. This entitled Ali to take the booty; but Ibn Maslamah challenged him, and after they referred their dispute to Muhammad, he granted Marhab's sword, <b>shield,</b> <b>cap</b> and helmet to Ibn Maslamah.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Bachelor {{volcanic}} chain, {{southeast of}} South Sister, consists of Mount Bachelor itself {{and a series}} of cinder cones, lava flows and three shield volcanoes.The northernmost <b>shield</b> is <b>capped</b> by a steep-sided summit cone of Mount Bachelor. Minor explosive activity built the many cinder cones which fed the many lava flows that account for the bulk of the erupted material.|$|R
60|$|They now {{went down}} to the next floor. Here there were two staircases, and the space was divided into two parts by a wall along the centre. There were no {{openings}} whatever for light. One half had evidently been devoted to arms. Here still lay hundreds of spear-shafts, tens of thousands of arrows, piles of hide <b>shields,</b> and <b>caps</b> of the same material.|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{plasma arc}} cutting is widely {{employed}} in various industrial fields. In {{the case of}} cutting magnetized plates, the magnetic field is concentrated around the cutting front as cutting progresses, and the electromagnetic force induced by the leakage of magnetic field deflects the plasma jet. The deflected plasma jet leads to poor cutting quality and sometime causes damage to the electrode and nozzle because of double arc abnormal discharge. This phenomenon is called magnetic arc blow, {{and it is a}} critical issue when applying plasma cutting on magnetized plates. In this study, magnetic arc blow behavior is investigated, and a method to prevent it is devised. We examined the relationship between operating conditions and the double arc using external magnetic fields on a plasma jet. We found criteria regarding operation conditions that induce arc blow. In addition, we succeeded in suppressing the double arc caused by the leakage external magnetic field by using a magnetic <b>shield</b> <b>cap</b> composed of ferromagnetic material around the nozzle...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{states have}} {{formally}} adopted {{a set of}} colours as their official [...] "state colours" [...] while others have de facto state colours that have become well-known through popular use. State colours often appear {{on a variety of}} different media, from the state's flag to the colours used in sports. In particular the Sheffield <b>Shield</b> team <b>caps</b> popularised the usage of single colours to represent each state.|$|R
50|$|The uniform was {{composed}} of black boots, black trousers with white shirt and black vest with {{the shape of a}} lion on its back and a coat of arms on the front, a <b>shielded</b> black <b>cap</b> and a red-white striped scarf. The Guard's coat of arms is based on that of Emeric of Hungary which features the Árpád stripes with 9 golden lions in 4 red stripes (3-3-2-1 lions per stripe).|$|R
5000|$|Sacabaya (also {{known as}} Tambo Quemado) is a {{pyroclastic}} shield in Bolivia. It {{is located on}} the Altiplano near to the Rio Lauca. The volcano is composed of ignimbrite, which has formed a shield. The <b>shield</b> is <b>capped</b> by an area of vents which has many overlapping craters, and is elongated in shape. At the southern end lies the youngest of the craters which has a lava dome within it.|$|R

40|$|A trade {{study for}} an active {{shielding}} concept based on magnetic fields in a solenoid configuration versus mass based shielding was developed. Monte Carlo simulations {{were used to}} estimate the radiation exposure for two values of the magnetic field strength and {{the mass of the}} magnetic shield configuration. For each field strength, results were reported for the magnetic region <b>shielding</b> (end <b>caps</b> ignored) and total region <b>shielding</b> (end <b>caps</b> included but no magnetic field protection) configurations. A value of 15 cSv was chosen to be the maximum exposure for an astronaut. The radiation dose estimate over the total shield region configuration cannot be used at this time without {{a better understanding of the}} material and mass present in the end cap regions through a detailed vehicle design. The magnetic shield region configuration, assuming the end cap regions contribute zero exposure, can be launched on a single Space Launch System rocket and up to a two year mission can be supported. The magnetic shield region configuration results in two versus nine launches for a comparable mass based shielding configuration. The active shielding approach is clearly more mass efficient because of the reduced number of launches than the mass based shielding for long duration missions...|$|R
50|$|Protocide is also {{proficient}} {{with use}} of a shield. Unlike Captain America current shield, Protocide utilitizes a <b>shield</b> similar to <b>Cap's</b> original. He makes full use of the sharp point in his attacks, and is also seen throwing his shield primarily to impale with the pointed end.|$|R
5000|$|Following the Ultimates' {{separation}} with S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers secretly {{adopted the}} identity of the Black Panther. [...] Eventually his secret was blown when Juggernaut literally beat Rogers' costume off of him. Iron Man and Wasp arrived with <b>Cap's</b> <b>shield</b> and uniform. He then led the Ultimates against their robotic doppelgangers.|$|R
50|$|Escaping the French <b>S.H.I.E.L.D.</b> guards, <b>Cap</b> {{jumped into}} a tele-plane (a jet which teleports), {{to where the}} Avengers were {{fighting}} the Red Skull, in Alaska. When he arrived, Red Skull, who was wielding the Cosmic Cube, subdued Rogers' jet. However, Cap ordered Hawkeye the coordinates for the Red Skull's position {{in which he had}} the jet teleport to the Red Skull and fatally impale his son on the tele-plane's nose. After the Red Skull was in custody, Rogers emotionally bear witness to Gail Richards to be briefly reunited with her dying son.|$|R
50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} {{represented in}} the gate displays in its lower half the bull typical of the Testaferrata family, which originally consisted of a red bull against a silver background. This seal was later modified by descendants of Giacomo Testaferrata II to incorporate a black open-chested eagle against a golden background on the top part of the shield. The <b>shield</b> was <b>capped</b> by an helm from which sprung two eagle wings, black and golden in colour from the right side and black and red from the left one. This helm symbolized the Testaferrata's imperial status of nobility.|$|R

50|$|The Paygan were lightly {{armed with}} short light wood or {{wickerwork}} <b>shields,</b> boiled leather <b>cap</b> and short spears. Some of the Paygan would have, however, had to equip themselves {{with their own}} weapons. These tended to be agricultural equipment such as pitchforks, axes and sickles. The Paygan would have lacked decent armor, making them very vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat. They would have stood little chance against Roman troops. This {{is the reason why}} Sassanians developed their own heavy infantry to counter that of Rome's.|$|R
40|$|For the {{proposed}} Moscow-TRIUMF-Spectrometer it is desired to inject axially, with the minimum possible creation of azimuthal momentum, {{a beam of}} 4. 1 MeV p+ into a 3 T field produced by coaxial coils. It is shown that an external coil, acting as a converging lens, with axial field antiparallel to the axial field of the spectometer, imparts to a low diver-gence input beam azimuthal momentum of opposite Sense to that produced by the spectrometer field. A coil located in-side the iron shield of the spectrometer, adjacent to the <b>shield</b> end <b>cap,</b> shifts part of the spectrometer adial field into a region of low axial field where the converging rays from the exterior lens {{are close to the}} symmetry axis and, so, experience a weak radial field.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that pulsars are neutron stars or strange stars with crusts. However we suggest here that pulsars may be bare strange stars (i. e., strange stars without crust). Due to rapid rotation and strong emission, young strange stars produced in supernova explosions should be bare when they act as radio pulsars. Because of strong magnetic field, two polar-crusts would <b>shield</b> the polar <b>caps</b> of an accreting strange star. Such a suggestion can be checked by further observations.

40|$|Glycans on HIV- 1 Envelope serve {{multiple}} functions including blocking epitopes from antibodies. We {{show that}} removal of glycan 301, a major target of anti-V 3 /glycan antibodies, has substantially different effects in two viruses. While glycan 301 on Du 156. 12 blocks epitopes commonly recognized by sera from chronically HIV- 1 -infected individuals, {{it does not}} do so on CAP 45. G 3, suggesting that removing the 301 glycan has a smaller effect on {{the integrity of the}} glycan <b>shield</b> in <b>CAP</b> 45. G 3. Changes in sensitivity to broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies suggest that the interaction between glycan 301 and the CD 4 binding site differ substantially between these 2 viruses. Molecular modeling suggests that removal of glycan 301 likely exposes a greater surface area of the V 3 and C 4 regions in Du 156. 12. Our data indicate that the contribution of the 301 glycan to resistance to common neutralizing antibodies varies between viruses, allowing for easier selection for its loss in some viruses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCell {{motility}} requires lamellipodial protrusion, {{a process}} driven by actin polymerization. Ena/VASP proteins accumulate in protruding lamellipodia {{and promote the}} rapid actin-driven motility of the pathogen Listeria. In contrast, Ena/VASP negatively regulate cell translocation. To resolve this paradox, we analyzed the function of Ena/VASP during lamellipodial protrusion. Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia protruded slower but more persistently, consistent with their increased cell translocation rates. Actin networks in Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia contained shorter, more highly branched filaments compared to controls. Lamellipodia with excess Ena/VASP contained longer, less branched filaments. In vitro, Ena/VASP promoted actin filament elongation by interacting with barbed ends, <b>shielding</b> them from <b>capping</b> protein. We conclude that Ena/VASP regulates cell motility by controlling the geometry of actin filament networks within lamellipodia...|$|R
