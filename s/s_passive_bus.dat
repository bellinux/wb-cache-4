This study utilized an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the metabolic perturbations that occur following two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE trials. In a randomized order, 7 untrained males completed two exercise protocols separated by 1 week; (1) HIE 150 % : 30 × 20 s cycling at 150 % VO 2 peak, 40 <b>s</b> <b>passive</b> rest; (2) HIE 300 % : 30 × 10 s cycling at 300 % VO 2 peak, 50 <b>s</b> <b>passive</b> rest. Total exercise duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated significant fold changes (HIE 300 % compared to the HIE 150 % value) during exercise, 14 post exercise and 23 {{at the end of}} the recovery period.

40|$|Classes of {{performance}} measures {{expressed in terms}} of H_ 2 -norms have been recently introduced to quantify the response of coupled dynamical systems to external perturbations. For the specific case of electric power networks, these measures quantify for instance the primary effort control to restore synchrony, the amount of additional power that is ohmically dissipated during the transient following the perturbation or, more conceptually, the coherence of the synchronous state. So far, investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to nodal perturbations. Here, we go beyond earlier works and consider the equally important, but so far neglected case of line perturbations. We consider a network-reduced power system, where a Kron reduction has eliminated passive buses. Identifying the effect that a line fault in the physical network has on the Kron-reduced network, we find that performance metrics depend on whether the faulted line connects two passive, two active buses or one active to one <b>passive</b> <b>bus.</b> In all cases, performance metrics depend quadratically on the original load on the faulted line times a topology dependent factor.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the level of environmental impact and primary energy resulting from demands placed on residential ventilation and heating systems; a conventional residential house built to the 2007 Norwegian building code with a standard heating system was compared against three technology scenarios used in a passive house of the equivalent size. Both houses have wooden framework and cladding and are projected by the Norwegian building company Norbohus. An economical evaluation of the heating systems was also done. The alternative heating option for the conventional house, Stord TEK 07, was based on current Norwegian energy consumption patterns; a combination of electricity and firewood is used to meet heating demand. This heating mix was also modeled as an option for the heating requirements of the passive house, named Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 1. Additionally, a solar collector system (Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 2) and an air-to-water heat pump (Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 3) were modeled for the passive house. Finally, a balanced mechanical ventilation system was evaluated for both buildings. The life-cycle assessment method used was the ReCiPe method and the electricity used in the operation phase was based on the Nordic electricity mix. The results of this study indicate that Stord TEK 07 has the largest emission output in relation to output of CO 2 -eq, presented in the impact category &# 147;Climate change&# 148;. From a life-cycle perspective, the heating system requirements of a Stord TEK 07 house are 47. 5 and 45 percent higher than the renewable energy solutions of <b>passive</b> house scenarios <b>S</b> 2 and S 3, respectively. Total life-cycle primary energy requirements in the Stord TEK 07 house were almost twice that of the renewable solutions in the passive house. Using the Norwegian standard heating system of Stord TEK 07 in a passive house as was done in Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 1, also results in a large improvement; output of CO 2 -eq and use of primary energy was reduced by 34 - 35 percent. Stord TEK 07 has also the highest emission output in most of the other impact categories and the largest present value costs, when building constructing costs are excluded. The heat pump solution, Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 3, has the lowest impact in most categories; however, the solar collector system Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 2, had lower output of CO 2 -eq. Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 2 has also lower present value costs then the air-water heat pump Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 3.

The energy consumption and potential harmful emissions resulting from the electrical energy used by fans during the life cycle far exceed the environmental impacts that result from manufacture and transportation of the ventilation unit. The study revealed that the heat-recovery system must have efficiency greater than 15 percent to achieve reduction concerning output of CO 2 -eq and use of primary energy for Stord TEK 07; this requirement increases to 42 percent in houses built to the passive house standard house, Stord Passive. </p...|$|R

Methods: Thirteen active males completed 60 × 3 s maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors with each contraction separated by a 2 <b>s</b> <b>passive</b> recovery period. This protocol was completed 60 min after ingesting 1 g of maltodextrin (placebo) or 1 g of acetaminophen on two separate visits. Peripheral nerve stimulation was administered every 6 th contraction for assessment of neuromuscular fatigue development, with the critical torque (CT), which reflects the maximal sustainable rate of oxidative metabolism, taken as the mean torque over the last 12 contractions. Surface electromyography was recorded continuously {{as a measure of}} muscle activation. Results: Mean torque (61 ± 11 vs. 58 ± 14 % pre-exercise MVC) and CT (44 ± 13 vs. 40 ± 15 % pre-exercise MVC) were greater in the acetaminophen trial compared to placebo (both P 0. 05). However, the decline in electromyography amplitude was attenuated in the acetaminophen trial, with electromyography amplitude being greater compared to placebo from 210 s onwards (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: These findings indicate that acute acetaminophen ingestion might be ergogenic by increasing CT and preserving muscle activation during high- 19 intensity exercise...|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} the main risk factors that determine children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> exposure to <b>passive</b> smoke, {{and we use}} econometric techniques to provide a new economic quantification {{of the effect of}} this exposure on child health. One of our main contributions is the use of a large nationally representative sample of children drawn from the Health Survey for England, for whom we match parental and household smoking and demographic characteristics. We use an objective measure of children 2 ̆ 7 s exposure, namely the level of cotinine in their saliva. We find that both parental and child carer smoking behaviour are major risk factors in determining children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> exposure to <b>passive</b> smoke. For a child who is exposed to a high number of passive smoking risk factors, the income equivalence of such exposure is £ 16000 per year. Finally, comprehensively controlling for child passive smoking does not explain the observed gradient between household income and parental-reported child health in England...|$|R
