Understanding the influence of <b>sliding</b> <b>speeds,</b> contact pressures and material properties on wear rates is important in developing predictive models for designing more efficient and effective engineering system components. Typical engineering applications subjected to these extreme conditions include ultrahigh speed machining, rocket sleds, large caliber cannon, and electromagnetic launchers. <b>Sliding</b> <b>speeds</b> on the order of 1, 000 m/s and contact pressures in excess of 100 MPa are common in these applications and difficult to replicate in a laboratory environment.

This paper aims to study the stick-slip phenomenon which occurs {{in the range of}} low and very low speeds. Typically, for the stick-slip phenomenon to occur, the static friction coefficient between the two contact surfaces of the friction materials must be larger than the kinetic friction coefficient. For disc brakes, the stick-slip phenomenon is mentioned in many specialized scientific papers. The phenomenon is manifested through self-induced vibrations.

50|$|A {{not often}} used {{definition}} of glaze is the highly sintered compacted oxide layer formed {{due to the}} sliding of either two metallic surfaces (or sometimes a metal surface and ceramic surface) at high temperatures (normally several hundred degrees Celsius) in oxidizing conditions.

50|$|The {{generation}} of oxides during high temperature sliding wear {{does not automatically}} lead {{to the production of}} a compacted oxide layer 'glaze'. Under certain conditions (potentially due to non-ideal conditions of <b>sliding</b> <b>speed,</b> load, temperature or oxide chemistry / composition), the oxide may not sinter together and instead the loose oxide debris may assist or enhance the removal of material by abrasive wear.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} size and volume {{fraction}} of ceramic particles with <b>sliding</b> <b>speed</b> on the wear properties were investigated for metal matrix composites fabricated by a pressureless metal infiltration process. The particulate metal matrix composites exhibited about 5. 5 - 6 times greater wear resistance compared with AC 8 A alloys at high <b>sliding</b> <b>speed,</b> and {{by increasing the}} particle size and decreasing the volume fraction the wear resistance improved. The wear resistance of the metal matrix composites and AC 8 A alloy represented different aspects: the wear loss of the AC 8 A alloy increased with <b>sliding</b> <b>speed</b> linearly, whereas, the metal matrix composites displayed more wear loss than the AC 8 A alloy in the slow-speed region.

40|$|A wear {{resistant}} {{metal matrix composite}} with a hard tool steel matrix and titanium carbides (TiCs) as reinforcing particles was produced {{on the surface of}} a plain carbon steel, using the technique of plasma transferred arc alloying. An almost uniform alloyed layer free of cracks and porosities having a thickness of 0. 8 - 1. 0 mm and a hardness of 850 - 900 HV was achieved. The microstructure consists of a matrix of martensite and residual austenite and primary TiC (MC) carbides as reinforcing particles. Pin-on-disk tests using an alumina counterbody with applied loads in the range of 9. 8 - 39. 2 N and <b>sliding</b> <b>speeds</b> between 15 and 75 cm/s were conducted and the wear rate was found of the order of 10 -s mm(3) /m. For the lowest <b>sliding</b> <b>speeds</b> of 15 and 30 cm/s the wear rate is proportional to the applied load over the whole range of loads and the dominating wear mechanism is plastic deformation. At <b>sliding</b> <b>speeds</b> of 55 and 75 cm/s the dominating wear mechanism is oxidation and a transition from mild to severe oxidational wear occurs when the applied load exceeds a value lying between 29. 4 and 39. 2 N.

40|$|Carbon-fiber-reinforced {{thermoplastic}} (CFRTP) {{is viewed}} as a prospective material for high-cycle production of CFRP parts. This paper deals with a process whereby a preheated thermoplastic plain-woven carbon fiber fabric sheet is formed into a circular cup by a mechanical servo-press. The effects of press parameters, specifically the bottom dead center and <b>slide</b> <b>speed</b> in the forming of CFRTP cup, on the press load, pressure, internal temperature, shape accuracy, and internal structure have been investigated. A plain-woven carbon-fiber-reinforced PA 6 thermoplastic sheet was used. The sheet consisted of four layers of woven 3 K carbon and had a thickness of 1 mm. The sheet was heated to 320 °C under a halogen heater so that it would be around the recommended temperature for forming 260 °C after transfer to the mold. The sheet was pressed into a circular cup shape by a cold mold while the periphery was cramped by a heated holder so as not to cool the sheet before it was pulled into the mold cave. Die clearance was designed considering the thickness increase due to the fiber concentration during the forming. By increasing the slide stroke to the bottom dead center, the applied press load was increased and the internal structure was improved, showing no voids. By increasing the <b>slide</b> <b>speed,</b> the final press load was reduced and shape accuracy was improved through a good pressure distribution on the mold. Measurement of the surface temperature of the sheet during the forming revealed that it remained in the melting region of the resin in the case of fast <b>slide</b> <b>speed,</b> but dropped below the melting temperature in the case of low <b>slide</b> <b>speed.</b> This difference apparently led to spring-in or spring-back after the forming. The experimental results indicate that appropriate balance among press speed, bottom dead center, and sheet temperature is important in the high-cycle forming of CFRTP. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.

Regulated actin filaments were reconstituted from rabbit F-actin, native bovine cardiac tropomyosin (nTm), and either native bovine cardiac troponin (nTn), troponin containing a TnC mutant, CBMII, in which the sole regulatory site in cardiac TnC (site II) is inactivated (CBMII-Tn), or troponin containing a point mutation in TnT (I 79 N, where isoleucine at position 79 is replaced with asparagine) associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Addition of regulatory proteins to the thin filament increases both the unloaded <b>sliding</b> <b>speed</b> and the isometric force exerted by myosin heads on the thin filaments. Variation of thin filament activation by varying [Ca 2 +] or the fraction of CBMII/TnC bound to the thin filament at pCa 5, {{had little effect on}} the unloaded filament <b>sliding</b> <b>speed</b> until the fraction of the thin filament containing calcium bound to TnC was less than 0. 15.
