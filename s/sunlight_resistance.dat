40|$|Polyamide is {{extensively}} used {{in engineering}} application {{because of its}} unique characteristics such as low price, low viscosity, high toughness, shelf lubricating behaviour better <b>sunlight</b> <b>resistance,</b> abrasion resistance and high chemical resistance. This study focuses on achieving high stiffness/strength characteristic of nylon 66 /NC nanocomposites, prepared via melt compounding by twin screw extruder. Mechanical test results indicated that all composites exhibited higher stiffness than pristine nylon 66. Thermal characteristics were performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). TGA thermograms indicate {{a significant increase in}} thermal stability after incorporation of crysnanoclay additives to nylon 66 matrixes. A slight increase in HDT and marked increase in izod impact strength after incorporation of crysnanoclay into nylon 66 composite was observed. The activation energy of degradation was determined using three mathematical models namely; Horowitz–Metzger, Coats–Redfern and Broido’s methods and the results are compared.

40|$|Sunlight {{inactivation}} {{in fresh}} (river) water of fecal coliforms, enterococci, Escherichia coli, somatic coliphages, and F-RNA phages from waste stabilization pond (WSP) effluent was compared. Ten experiments were conducted outdoors in 300 -liter chambers, held at 14 °C (mean river water temperature). Sunlight inactivation (kS) rates, {{as a function}} of cumulative global solar radiation (insolation), were all more than 10 times higher than the corresponding dark inactivation (kD) rates in enclosed (control) chambers. The overall kS ranking (from greatest to least inactivation) was as follows: enterococci > fecal coliforms ≥ E. coli > somatic coliphages > F-RNA phages. In winter, fecal coliform and enterococci inactivation rates were similar but, in summer, enterococci were inactivated far more rapidly. In four experiments that included freshwater-raw sewage mixtures, enterococci survived longer than fecal coliforms (a pattern opposite to that observed with the WSP effluent), but there was little difference in phage inactivation between effluents. In two experiments which included simulated estuarine water and seawater, sunlight inactivation of all of the indicators increased with increasing salinity. Inactivation rates in freshwater, as seen under different optical filters, decreased with the increase in the spectral cutoff (50 % light transmission) wavelength. The enterococci and F-RNA phages were inactivated by a wide range of wavelengths, suggesting photooxidative damage. Inactivation of fecal coliforms and somatic coliphages was mainly by shorter (UV-B) wavelengths, a result consistent with photobiological damage. Fecal coliform repair mechanisms appear to be activated in WSPs, and the surviving cells exhibit greater <b>sunlight</b> <b>resistance</b> in natural waters than those from raw sewage. In contrast, enterococci appear to suffer photooxidative damage in WSPs, rendering them susceptible to further photooxidative damage after discharge. This suggests that they are unsuitable as indicators of WSP effluent discharges to natural waters. Although somatic coliphages are more sunlight resistant than the other indicators in seawater, F-RNA phages are the most resistant in freshwater, where they may thus better represent enteric virus survival...|$|E
40|$|Acid-catalysed {{esterification}} of {{acrylic acid}} with 2 -ethylhexanol {{is the principal}} method for the manufacture of 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate. 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate is a clear, water-white liquid with a sweet odor and is readily miscible with most organic solvents, but has negligible solubility in water. In chemical industry, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate is primarily used as a reactive building block to produce polymer coating, adhesives and sealants {{and it can be}} polymerized itself. In addition, improving the water resistance, weather ability and <b>sunlight</b> <b>resistance</b> of final product can be made in presence of acrylic acid. Industrial waste water generally can be described as the water or liquid carries waste from industrial or commercial processes. The spent water (wastewater) may contain a large variety of organic compound such as acrylic acid, formaldehyde, acetic acid and more but acrylic acid dominate the amount in polymer industrial wastewater that could harm the aquatic organisms. Currently, incineration treatment method is neither environmental friendly and nor economical. So, reactive distillation in esterification process has potential to recover the acrylic acid in the industrial waste water. In this study, the esterification of dilute acrylic acid with 2 -ethyl hexanol that catalyzed by ion exchange resin have been carried out. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the deactivation of Amberlyst 15 in the esterification of dilute acrylic acid. Homogeneous catalyst have some limitations such as catalyst recovery problem, disposal of toxic wastes formed during reactions, separation of the products, and loss of catalysts that can cause the solid acid catalyst will be choosen in this study. The esterification process have been conducted in presence of Amberlyst 15 as a catalyst and Phenothiazine as polymerization inhibitor under certain conditions. The range of water content in the dilute acrylic acid have been varied and as well as the presence of inhibitor. The catalyst activiy have been characterized to examine the morphology for fresh and used catalyst after the reaction. Another testing was to determine the catalyst compositions, to check the functional group of catalyst and to determine the measurement for its surface area. From the result, catalyst deactivation happened as increase in water content for diluted AA in the reaction mixture. The present study show that more water content needed to dilute AA solution and more polymerization inhibitor to prevent the polyacrylic acid formation in the reactions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis works mention on {{improvement}} of {{power conversion efficiency}} of dye-sensitized solar cell by addition of SnO 2 into ZnO photoanode. Power conversion efficiency is achieved by reduction of transfer resistance to induce pathway direction for electron transfer in photoanode which observed in term of steady photocurrent density. Dye-sensitized solar cell was fabricated from additive SnO 2 weight ratio of 3 - 9 % in ZnO nanoparticles and dissolved into polyethylene glycol solution. SnO 2 -ZnO composites were prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide glass substrate by doctor blade technique and annealed at 450 ̊C for 1 h. It {{was found that the}} SnO 2 weight ratio of 7 % showed the maximum power conversion efficiency and fill factor of 1. 75 % and 0. 46, respectively. In addition, electrochemical parameters were calculated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data under standard simulated <b>sunlight.</b> Transfer <b>resistance</b> at the interfaces and electron life time were decreased as increasing of SnO 2 weight ratio, indicated that electron transferring rate was improved...|$|R
