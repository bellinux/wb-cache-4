5000|$|It {{was noted}} that his {{personality}} {{seemed to have}} changed for the worse, and historians have suggested {{that he might have}} suffered a minor stroke at some time before 1907. In 1907 and 1908, there were two incidents involving Admiral Percy Scott, commander of the First Cruiser Division of the Channel Fleet. In November 1907, Beresford ordered all ships of the Channel Fleet then at sea to return to harbour to be repainted for a review by the Kaiser. The armoured cruiser [...] was engaged in gunnery practice at Portland, and its captain requested permission to finish the exercise before returning to harbour. <b>Scott</b> refused, <b>signalling</b> [...] "Paintwork appears to be more in demand than gunnery, so you had better come in in time to make yourself look pretty by the 8th". Nothing happened for four days, until a staff officer visiting Scott's flagship heard of the signal and reported it to Beresford, who summoned and severely reprimanded Scott without giving Scott an opportunity to explain his remarks and actions, and refused to listen when Scott tried to offer an explanation. Beresford then asked the Admiralty to relieve Scott of his command, writing that <b>Scott's</b> <b>signal</b> was [...] "totally opposed to loyalty and discipline...contemptuous in tone, insubordinate in character and wanting in dignity" [...] The Admiralty did not comply, although they expressed their disapproval of <b>Scott's</b> <b>signal.</b> In 1908, <b>Scott</b> disobeyed an order from Beresford which would have resulted in a collision.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 11 April 1945, eight {{operatives}} were dropped off near Muschu Island with four Hoehn military folboats (collapsible canoes) by [...] patrol boat. The eight commandos were Special Lieutenant Alan Robert Gubbay, Lieutenant Thomas Joseph Barnes, Sergeant Malcolm Francis Max Weber, Lance Corporal Spencer Henry Walklate, <b>Signaller</b> Michael <b>Scott</b> Hagger, <b>Signaller</b> John Richard Chandler, Private Ronald Edward Eagleton, Sapper Edgar Thomas 'Mick' Dennis.|$|R
5000|$|The show's {{theme song}} [...] "So Far, So Great", was written and {{produced}} by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis [...] "Aris" [...] Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned Hollywood Records. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and <b>Scott</b> Clausen, <b>signaling</b> scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).|$|R
5000|$|Don Mattingly {{finally made}} it to the postseason in what would be his final games. Chris Bosio faced David Cone in Game 1. The game {{remained}} scoreless {{into the bottom of the}} third. Wade Boggs stepped to the plate with Randy Velarde on first and sent a two-run homer into the night to make it 2-0 Yankees. But Ken Griffey, Jr. led the top of the fourth off with a homer of his own to cut the lead in half. Then in the sixth, the Mariners managed to load the bases against Cone. Facing Dan Wilson with the count 1-2, Wilson appeared to commit to Cone's next offering. However, on appeal, first base umpire Dale <b>Scott</b> <b>signaled</b> [...] "no swing", continuing the inning and drawing the ire of Yankee fans, in particular Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, who went on to say MLB should not allow rookies to umpire in the postseason, despite the fact that Scott had umpired in the postseason since 1986. Still alive, Wilson forced Cone to walk him, tying the game at two, but two RBI singles made it 4-2 Yankees in the bottom half. Griffey's second home run tied the game when he sent one into the bleachers with one man on in the seventh. However, the Yankees put together a four-run seventh inning, which was capped off by a two-run homer by Rub√©n Sierra. The Yankees added another run but the Mariners refused to concede in the ninth. They put the tying run to the plate after scoring two runs but failed to tie the game with a homer as John Wetteland narrowly recorded the save.|$|R
50|$|Only one {{fight in}} the next two years on 31 October 2008, {{resulted}} in Foster scoring a win over the journeyman Jason Nesbitt before returning to the ring on 15 January 2010 to defeat the Georgian boxer Kakhaber Avetisian at the Altrincham Leisure Centre. Two more wins in 2010 followed against Youssef Al Hamidi at the Fenton Manor Sports Complex in Stoke-on-Trent and Aleksander Vakhtangashvili at the Ponds Forge Arena in Sheffield, before on 2 October 2010 travelling to Bolton to fight at the De Vere Whites Hotel in a contest for the European super featherweight title. Foster's opponent, the Russian Levan Kirakosyan, had a reputation for winning in the UK and had already beaten the Carl Johanneson twice and on his last visit won the title against <b>Scott</b> Lawton. <b>Signalling</b> his return to the top of British boxing Foster defeated Kirakosyan with a third round stoppage to lift the title.|$|R
5000|$|The Lakers {{were coming}} off a four-game sweep by the Philadelphia 76ers in the {{previous}} year's finals. Before the season began, the Lakers traded long-time guard Norm Nixon to the San Diego Clippers {{in exchange for the}} draft rights to Byron <b>Scott.</b> The trade <b>signaled</b> a transition period, as some of the key players from the first two championships gave way to younger talent. Despite the changes, it did not stop the Lakers from finishing with the best record (54-28) in the Western Conference, powered by their one-two punch of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson.|$|R
5000|$|On January 8, a local {{cattleman}} {{and owner}} of the Ruby Mercantile, Philip C. Clarke, rode into camp and told Captain Ryder that his neighbor found the body of a cow in the mountains to the north and that a piece of its hide had been removed for making sandals. It was assumed that Yaquis killed the cow so Ryder strengthened the observation post on top of the ridge by sending up First Lieutenant William Scott and a detail of men equipped with field glasses to watch the trails from a distance. According to Colonel Wharfield's book; [...] "About {{the middle of the afternoon}} Lieutenant <b>Scott</b> <b>signaled</b> attention. Upon acknowledgement from the camp sentry he gave the message enemy in sight, and pointed toward a low ridge west of camp a quarter of a mile or more distant. The sentry hollered to First Sgt. Samuel H. Alexander, who was sitting under a nearby mesquite with several other noncommissioned officers. The shout brought everyone to their feet. On the skyline of the ridge could be seen a long column of Indians Yaquis crossing to the other side. The horses had been under saddle with loose cinches all day tied up in the corral; so within a few minutes the troop was mounted." [...] By the time the soldiers left camp the Yaquis were no longer in sight but Lieutenant Scott kept pointing so the troop kept moving due south, towards the border fence. When the Americans were finally in position, they dismounted in a [...] "shallow brushy draw," [...] left a guard to watch the horses, and then continued advancing on foot in a skirmish line. Moving forward, the soldiers were nearing the top of a canyon side when Captain Ryder decided to return to the horses, using a different path. On the way down, the soldiers came across [...] "hastily abandoned packs" [...] which suggested that the Yaquis were very close and knew they were being pursued. Ryder then continued up the canyon, in a southeastern direction, when suddenly the Yaquis opened fire from concealed positions.|$|R
25|$|In {{the night}} Doterel missed Bermuda. However, {{the next day}} they {{encountered}} , which pointed them in the correct direction and Doterel reached Bermuda the day after that. Scott tried to get a naval vessel to go out and retrieve Countess of Harcourt, but none was available. Some did send out boats, as did some private individuals. Thinking that she might drift towards Bermuda, <b>Scott</b> advised the <b>signal</b> post to {{keep an eye out for}} her and to let him know if they spotted her. Next morning a man from the signal post notified him that they had sighted a vessel answering the description of Countess of Harcourt.|$|R
50|$|The Tenth Anniversary of the 'Charlottesville Men's Four Miler {{race was}} held on Saturday May 24, 2014. The {{starting}} line was at the west parking lot of <b>Scott</b> Stadium. The <b>signal</b> to start was flagged by former UVa Women's Basketball coach Debbie Ryan, inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame (add a link ?) in 2008. Runners quickly moved along Alderman Rd. towards McCormick Rd., Rugby Road and onto Grady Ave. The course continued to Cabell Ave., Burnley Ave., and Tunlaw Place. At Tunlaw Place participants turned left onto Rosser Ave. {{and then back to}} Rugby Rd., and McCormick Rd. In the intersection of McCormick and Alderman runners turned left, and then left again onto Whitehead Rd.. Finally, onto Stadium Rd., and the Scott Stadium tunnel, which leads into the field where the Finish Line was set up.|$|R

[...] Awarding the album {{three and a}} half stars at CCM Magazine, Kevin Sparkman writes, [...] "Costly rises to offer easy access points for those needing a message of Christ hope through song...There's a simplistic beauty at work here, leaving much room for spiritual communication." [...] Mary Nikkel, giving the album four stars from New Release Today, states, [...] "Especially for those looking for words of worship that they can sing honestly in the midst of hardship, Costly is a timely release well worth your time." [...] Rating the album four and a half stars for Jesus Freak Hideout, Ryan Barbee describes, [...] "The instrumentation is rich, the lyrics doctrinally and introspectively deep, and the production is fantastic." [...] <b>Scott</b> Fryberger, <b>signaling</b> in {{three and a half}} review by Jesus Freak Hideout, says, [...] "A solid mixture of country gospel, contemporary pop, and alternative, it's a little more radio-friendly than I'm used to enjoying, but it's not a bad album, and it'd fit well next to your Rend Collective or Third Day albums." [...] Indicating in a four and a half star review at Jesus Freak Hideout, Mark Rice states, [...] "Costly is without a doubt in the upper echelon of worship albums that have been released in 2015, and is destined for many repeat listens." [...] Calvin Moore, rating the album three stars for The Christian Manifesto, writes, [...] "Costly is a simple album." [...] Giving the album a 3.6 out of five at Christian Music Review, Daniel Edgeman states, [...] "The album is simple and smooth...recommend this album {{if you are looking for}} a smooth sound to your worship experience." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his own quarters, Spock, already {{suspicious}} of the landing party, queries the computer about the [...] "classified research" [...] being conducted in Engineering, and decides to confront Kirk again. On the bridge, Uhura distracts Sulu, the security chief, from his security board when it <b>signals</b> <b>Scott's</b> final connection. Spock intercepts Kirk in the transporter room and leads him at phaser-point to Sickbay, where Scott, McCoy, and Uhura had been waiting to rendezvous with Kirk. A fight ensues, until Spock is knocked out by Kirk. McCoy insists Spock could die if untreated, and before they can leave, Sulu arrives with three security guards. Sulu tells them he intends to assassinate Kirk and {{make it look like}} Kirk and Spock killed each other, but Marlena intervenes from Kirk's quarters, using the Tantalus Field to vaporize Sulu's henchmen. Kirk renders Sulu unconscious, and Uhura, Kirk, and Scotty head for the transporter room. They leave McCoy to follow after tending to Spock, but Spock suddenly awakens and forces McCoy into a Vulcan mind meld to find out why the captain spared his life. When he learns of the switch, he decides to help them return and disables the transporter until he can reach them.|$|R
5000|$|As the Enterprise {{survivors}} pursue Krall in the Franklin, they deduce {{that such}} a massive swarm must coordinate its attacks via radio <b>signals.</b> <b>Scott</b> transports Spock and McCoy {{into one of the}} swarm ships. Matching the swarm's frequency, they jam and disorient the swarm by broadcasting [...] "Sabotage" [...] by the Beastie Boys over the channels, destroying almost the entire fleet. Krall and his three surviving ships crash in Yorktown. As Krall flees into the starbase, Uhura and Kirk discover from the Franklins logs that he is actually Balthazar Edison, former captain of the Franklin. A pre-Federation human soldier, Edison rejected the Federation's principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies like the Xindi. When he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the three survivors used the technology of the planet's extinct natives to prolong their lives at the cost of the others, and re-purposed their dormant drone workers into the swarm. Thinking that the Federation had abandoned them, Edison now plans to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into Yorktowns ventilation system, where Edison activates the bioweapon. Before it can be unleashed, Kirk ejects Edison and the bioweapon out of Yorktown and into space where the weapon consumes Edison. Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into space.|$|R
25|$|For {{their home}} opener, the Dodgers beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 2‚Äì1. Ethier celebrated his 30th {{birthday}} by hitting an eighth-inning home {{run for the}} deciding run. Kershaw recovered from the flu by allowing only one earned run in seven innings of work, while striking out seven. The Dodgers improved to 5‚Äì1 on the season by beating the Pirates 4-1 the next day behind another strong start by Billingsley. The Dodgers beat the Pirates again the next night, 3‚Äì2, to complete the sweep of the series. The Dodgers 6-1 record to start the season was their best start since 1981. On April 13, Aaron Harang struck out 9 consecutive batters after giving up a single to set the all time Dodgers record against the Padres. The record was previously held by Johnny Podres with 8 in 1962. The streak was stopped by Will Venable when he hit an opposite field home run. Harang finished one strikeout short of tying Tom Seaver's Major League record of 10 in a row set in 1970 and tied his career high with 13 total strikeouts in the game. The Dodgers won the game 9‚Äì8 after the bullpen allowed the Padres to tie the score. The Dodgers continued their hot start by beating the Padres 6‚Äì1 behind two home runs by Kemp and one by Ethier. Ted Lilly made his first {{start of the season}} and pitched seven dominant innings for the win. The Dodgers swept the Padres with a wild 5-4 win on April 15. After taking a 4‚Äì1 lead, partially thanks to Matt Kemp's league leading 6th home run, the Dodgers allowed the Padres to tie the game at 4 heading to the ninth. With two on and no outs {{in the top of the}} ninth, Javy Guerra threw the ball inside on Jes√∫s Guzm√°n, somehow the ball hit his bat and dribbled into fair Territory where A.J. Ellis threw it to third for the start of a triple play, the Dodgers first since 1998. The Padres protested that umpire Dale <b>Scott</b> had <b>signaled</b> that the ball was dead originally before changing his call. In the bottom of the inning, the Dodgers won the game on a walk-off single by Dee Gordon.|$|R

40|$|Chronic liver injury causes {{excessive}} {{accumulation of}} extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in fibrosis, which if not treated in early phase, {{can lead to}} liver failure. Progression of liver fibrosis involves the activation of various cell types, including hepatocytes, bile ductular cells (cholangiocytes) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which overproduce hedgehog (Hh) signaling ligands in response to liver injury (Chen et al., 2002). Regardless of the cell type involved in producing these ligands, HSCs are the major population responsible for liver repair and collagen production. Upon injury-mediated activation, HSCs acquire a myofibroblastic phenotype and produce excessive amounts of ECM, including type I collagen (Friedman, 2008; Sicklick et al., 2005). Several lines of evidence implicate the Hh signaling pathway in this process (Choi et al., 2010 a, Choi et al., 2010 b, Omenetti et al., 2008; Omenetti et al., 2007). Hh ligands are soluble factors that interact with the plasma membrane-spanning receptor, Patched (Ptch), to de-repress the downstream intracellular signaling intermediate, Smoothened (Smo). Smo-initiated signals, in turn, activate Glioblastoma (Gli) -family transcription factors to induce expression of Hh-responsive genes that regulate target cell proliferation, viability and differentiation (Hooper and <b>Scott,</b> 2005). Hh <b>signaling</b> regulates remodeling of various adult tissues, including the nervous system, skin, heart, lung, and gastrointestinal tract. During embryogenesis and carcinogenesis, Hh ligands function as morphogens by modulating both mesendodermal fate and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) (Varnat et al., 2009; Park ReseaRch aRtIcle Attenuation of early liver fibrosis by pharmacological inhibition of smoothened receptor signalin...|$|R

[URL] festucae is a filamentous fungus that forms a mutually beneficial symbiotic association with Lolium perenne. The NADPH oxidase complex components noxA, noxR and racA, the transcription factor proA, and the cell wall integrity (CWI) MAP kinases, mkkA and mpkA, are required for mutualistic E. festucae-L. perenne associations and cell-cell fusion. Homologues of these genes in Neurospora crassa, Sordaria macrospora and Podospora anserina are required for cell-cell fusion and sexual fruiting body maturation, thereby establishing a link between self signalling and hyphal network formation in the E. festucae-L. perenne symbiosis. In Podospora anserina, IDC 2 and IDC 3 are required for cell-cell fusion, crippled growth and fruiting body formation. In S. macrospora and N. crassa, components of the STRIPAK complex regulate cell-cell fusion and fruiting body formation. The aim of this project was to test if E. festucae homologues of IDC 2 and IDC 3, and the STRIPAK complex protein MOB 3, named SymB, SymC and MobC, respectively, are also required for cell-cell fusion and plant symbiosis. Gel shift assays showed the promoters of symB and symC are targets for the transcription factor ProA. In culture, the frequency of cell-cell fusion of ŒîmobC was reduced, but in ŒîsymB and ŒîsymC mutants, totally abolished. All three mutants hyperconidiated and formed intra-hyphal hyphae. Plants infected with these mutants were severely stunted and hyphae exhibited proliferative growth and increased colonisation of the intercellular spaces and vascular bundles. Expressoria formation, structures allowing colonisation of the leaf surface, was reduced in ŒîmobC, and abolished in ŒîsymB and ŒîsymC mutants. Microscopy analyses showed SymB-GFP and SymC-mRFP 1 co-localise to the plasma membrane and septa. SymC also localised to highly dynamic punctate structures. Although ŒîsymB and ŒîsymC phenotypes are identical to ŒîmpkA, and the E. festucae pheromone response pathway scaffold ŒîidcA mutants, MpkA and MpkB phosphorylation and cellular localisation was unchanged compared to wild-type. Using yeast-two-hybrid assays, an interaction between SymC and the STRIPAK complex associated protein GPI 1 was demonstrated. Collectively these results show that MobC, SymB and SymC are required for E. festucae cell-cell fusion and host symbiosis. It is proposed that SymB and SymC interact to form a sensor complex at the cell wall which regulates cell-cell fusion in culture and hyphal network development in planta...|$|R
