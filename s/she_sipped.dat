60|$|And he dosed {{the family}} all round, {{leading the way}} himself with a double quantity. The wretched Anastasie, {{who had never been}} ill in the whole course of her existence, and whose soul recoiled from remedies, wept floods of tears as <b>she</b> <b>sipped,</b> and shuddered, and protested, and then was bullied and shouted at until <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> again.

6000|$|Miss Spence {{gave her}} the cup; <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> at it. [...] "You've made it like syrup. But it's very nice, after that atrocious medicine." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Thain {{preserves}} the instincts of the savage," [...] the Duchess observed, as <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> her wine. [...] "Perhaps {{he may be}} right. Civilisation certainly tends to emasculate sport." ...|$|E
6000|$|She stopped, appalled. His {{face had}} gone {{red and white}} with such abruptness as to startle her. He was patently very angry. <b>She</b> <b>sipped</b> {{the last of her}} coffee, and arose, saying,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the life}} of me," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, as <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> a cup of tea, [...] "I can't imagine, {{if there was a}} shed so near us, why we didn't know it." ...|$|E
60|$|We were {{standing}} {{apart from the}} others, and <b>she</b> was <b>sipping</b> a cup of spiced wine that the host had mulled for her. She {{looked at me with}} a tolerant smile.|$|R
6000|$|CHRIS--[Shaking in his boots.] Py golly. [He {{takes her}} drink in to MARTHY {{and sits down}} at the table. <b>She</b> <b>sips</b> it in silence. LARRY moves quietly close to the {{partition}} to listen, grinning with expectation. CHRIS seems {{on the verge of}} speaking, hesitates, gulps down his whiskey desperately as if seeking for courage. He attempts to whistle a few bars of [...] "Yosephine" [...] with careless bravado, but the whistle peters out futilely. MARTHY stares at him keenly, taking in his embarrassment with a malicious twinkle of amusement in her eye. CHRIS clears his throat.] Marthy-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This," [...] Anna declared, as <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> {{her wine}} {{and looked around}} her, [...] "reminds me more of Paris than any place I have yet seen. I suppose it is the mirrors and decorations." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} obeyed almost mechanically. There {{was a general}} exodus of {{servants}} from the room. Some one had brought Mrs. Rheinholdt a glass of champagne. <b>She</b> <b>sipped</b> it and gradually recovered her voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Hope {{and keep}} busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see who will {{remember}} it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she lecture though!" [...] said Jo, as <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> with returning spirit.|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sebastian Ringler and was shot in GÃ¤llivare and Vaxholm. It is inspired by the story of Bonnie and Clyde and set in the 1930s. The video begins by showing a woman working in a bar as a waitress (played by Swedish actress Madeleine Minou Martin). At the same time, a blond woman enters (played by Swedish actress Hedda Stiernstedt) and asks for a drink. <b>She</b> <b>sips</b> it and then throws the glass against {{the wall behind the}} bar. This is the signal for them to draw their guns and rob the place. After, they tour the snowy roads in a car. Arriving at night at home, they lie down on a bed while caressing passionately.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> took a <b>sip</b> {{from her}} glass, {{and the feeling}} that he had been going to laugh passed away.|$|R
60|$|It wasn't what I {{had meant}} to say. My idea had been {{to be a good}} deal more formal, and so on. Still, it covered the situation. I poured her out a cup. <b>She</b> <b>sipped</b> it and put the cup down with a shudder.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sipped</b> the hot coffee, whose {{fragrance}} flew {{around them}} like bees murmuring around flowers, in the snowy air, she drank tiny sips of the Heidelbeerwasser, she ate the cold, sweet, creamy wafers. How good everything was! How perfect everything tasted and smelled and sounded, {{here in this}} utter stillness of snow and falling twilight.|$|E
60|$|Handsome Portia {{looked out}} from her blonde locks with a disgusted expression, as <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> the {{chocolate}} thoughtful mamma had left inside the fender.

60|$|Obediently the Colonel {{took from}} her the glass, {{and as he}} <b>sipped,</b> <b>she</b> put her hand up and stroked his head.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would {{that there}} were ever such,' said the widow meaningly, with a languishing look at our companion. 'Here is to you, sir--and to ye, too, young sirs,' <b>she</b> added, <b>sipping</b> at her wine.

6000|$|They {{were both}} in a tumult of {{confused}} emotion. Their ears were full of the roaring passion of life, and their eyes were blinded by a spray of tears and that strange quivering laughter which burns with real pain. They hurried along the pavement to the [...] "Spread Eagle," [...] Meg clinging to him, running, clasping her lace scarf over her white frock, like a scared white butterfly shaken through the night. We hardly spoke as the horse was being harnessed and the lamps lighted. In the little smoke room he drank several whiskies, <b>she</b> <b>sipping</b> out of his glass, standing all the time ready to go. He pushed into his pocket great pieces of bread and cheese, to eat on the way home. He seemed now to be thinking with much acuteness. His few orders were given sharp and terse. He hired an extra light rug in which to wrap Meg, {{and then we were}} ready.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I think not!" [...] he answered. [...] "Come, I {{am going}} to make you drink a glass of my wine. You are looking {{positively}} woebegone.

60|$|What {{a bright}} {{afternoon}} that little gift made {{in that little}} room! How much faster Mary's fingers flew the livelong day as she sat sewing by her mother! and Mrs. Stephens, in the happiness of her child, almost forgot {{that she had a}} headache, and thought, as <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> her evening cup of tea, that she felt stronger than she had done for some time.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me in silence for some moments, with her face {{gradually}} softening into a smile. Seeming to fear {{that she had been}} too gloomy, and seeming also to lose the connexion in her mind, she said politely as <b>she</b> <b>sipped</b> her glass of wine, [...] "Yes, my dear, as I was saying, I expect a judgment shortly. Then I shall release my birds, you know, and confer estates." ...|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 Ì 7 s first paragraph. 2 Ì 2 Sophia: She is beautiful; dark hair draping around her {{delicate}} shoulders. Used to be a dancer, before college. She is tall, thin with sad, brown eyes. Twenty. Just turned in July. Sophia {{is surrounded by}} a crowd at the lunch table. She stabs a forkful and eats in silence, listening to the senseless chatter. Everyone talks around her, in front of her, behind her. Never to her. <b>She</b> <b>sips</b> her water. Every day a glass of water. She pulls out her phone, no missed calls. She returns to her dorm; her roommates lower their voices to a whisper. Sophia hopefully checks her computer. No messages. She wraps herself in a blanket and sinks into bed. 243 - 5467. No answer. She has a picture hanging next to her bed. A golden dog, a puppy. Passed away a few weeks back. 245 - 8759. Answering machine. Her eyes are wet as she opens her favorite book, settling in with Holden Caulfield. 2 Ì...|$|R
6000|$|Again I {{looked at}} Jane, {{and saw that}} {{although}} <b>she</b> was <b>sipping</b> her tea and had some bacon upon her plate she had eaten nothing at all. Like the catch of a song echoed through my brain that fearsome sentence: [...] "It {{is a terrible thing}} to have one's child die of the smallpox." [...] Terrible, indeed, for now I had little doubt but that Jane was infected, and if she should chance to die, then what should I be? I should be her murderer! ...|$|R
60|$|She {{began to}} {{struggle}} with herself. Her open eyes watched him, although she could not move. Gradually she was coming to herself. He laid {{her down on the}} sofa, and ran upstairs for a little whisky, which at last <b>she</b> could <b>sip.</b> The tears were hopping down his face. As he kneeled in front of her he did not cry, but the tears ran down his face quickly. Morel, {{on the opposite side of}} the room, sat with his elbows on his knees glaring across.|$|R
