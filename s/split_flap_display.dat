A low speed investigation {{was made in}} the Cal Tech-Merrill Wind Tunnel at Pasadena City College of a 3. 44 aspect ratio wing, having a 65 ° swept-back leading edge and a symretrical double-wedge airfoil section, to determine the characteristics and effectiveness of various high-lift devices. The investigation included tests of trailing edge <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> and extended <b>split</b> <b>flaps,</b> leading edge flaps and slats, and combined configurations. The tests were carried out using the wing with and without the fuselage and tail surfaces. The results showed that the <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> increased the lift over the lower regions of the angle of attack only. The extended <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> were more effective and increased the lift over the whole range. The nose flaps tested did not increase the lift when used by themselves, but the combination of a nose flap with the fuselage and extended <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> produced the greatest lift. The addition of the fuselage added to the lift by increasing the slope of the lift curve. The addition of the tail surface gave additional increments in lift in the upper regions of angle of attack.

The {{primary purpose of the}} {{investigation was}} to determine the effect of the <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> on the aerodynamic characteristics of the tapered wing. Complete lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients were determined for the plain wing and for each flap arrangement through a Reynold number range of 2, 600, 000 to 4, 600, 000.

The increment of maximum lift due to the <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> was found to vary somewhat with Reynold number over the range investigated.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the aerodynamic properties of rectangular and tapered NACA 23012 wings with plain ailerons and a full-span <b>split</b> <b>flap,</b> the flap retracting ahead of the ailerons. Measurements were made of lift and drag and of pitching, rolling, yawing, and hinge moments for all conditions of full-span flaps neutral and deflected at different chord locations. The results of the tests showed that a 0. 20 c(sub w) full span <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> located at approximately the 0. 75 c(sub w) point gave higher lift coefficients than had previously been obtained with a conventional 0. 20 c(sub w) partial-span <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> of a length to permit satisfactory control with plain ailerons. Still higher lifts were obtained if the full-span flap, when deflected, was {{moved back to the}} aileron axis.

Aerodynamic force tests were made in the N. A. C.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the NACA 19 -foot pressure wind tunnel of a rectangular wing having NACA 66, 2 - 216 low-drag airfoil sections and various sizes of simple <b>split</b> <b>flaps.</b> The purpose of the {{investigation was}}, primarily, to {{determine the influence of}} these flap installations on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing. Complete lift, drag, and pitching-moment characteristics were determined for a range of test Reynolds numbers from about 2, 600, 000 to 4, 600, 000 for each of the installations and for the plain wing. The results of this investigation indicate that values of maximum lift coefficient similar to those of wings with conventional airfoil sections and <b>split</b> <b>flaps</b> can be expected of wings having the NACA 66, 2 - 216 low-drag sections. The increment of maximum lift due to the <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> was found to be practically independent of the Reynolds number over the range investigated. The optimum <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> on the basis of maximum lift appears to have a chord about 20 % of the wing chord and a deflection of 60 degrees. The C(sub L) max of the wing with the 0. 20 c partial-span flap deflected 60 degrees is 2. 07 at a Reynolds number of 4, 600, 000 while with the full-span flap it is approximately 2. 53; the increment of the maximum lift coefficient due to the flap is approximately proportional to the flap span.

40|$|Since {{the recent}} {{more or less}} {{extensive}} adoption of high-lift flaps on airplane wings, the problem of providing satisfactory lateral control without sacrificing {{a part of the}} span of the flaps has become one of some importance. The difficulties have been largely a matter of obtaining satisfactory rolling moments with a smoothly graduated action, together with sufficiently small control forces throughout the entire speed range. As part of an investigation including several different lateral-control arrangements to be used with <b>split</b> <b>flaps,</b> the tests reported in this paper were made on one arrangement in which conventional ailerons of narrow chord are used, and a <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> is retracted into the under surface of th wing forward of th ailerons. When the flap is retracted, the arrangement is as sketched in figure 1 (a). If a simple form of <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> were used, hinged at its forward edge, the appearance when deflected would be as shown in figure 1 (b). The flap if deflected with its leading edge remaining in this forward position would give somewhat less than three fourths of the lift increase of the same flap in the usual rear position. (See reference 1.). If, as shown in figure 1 (c), the <b>split</b> <b>flap</b> ahead of th aileron is moved to the rear as the trailing=edge portion is deflected downward, a double advantage is obtained. The deflected flap can be located in the most effective region for high lift (reference 1), and the force required to deflect the flap is reduced. This is the arrangement used in the present tests...|$|R
