40|$|R 290 is a {{potential}} refrigerant replacing R 22 because of its zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and virtually zero Global Warming Potential (GWP). However, R 290 is flammable and requires excellent containment to avoid leakage and {{reduce the risk of}} fire. The use of small diameter copper tube (5 mm or even smaller) is an effective way to reduce refrigerant charge and thus reduce the risk of fire {{in the event of a}} refrigerant leak. However, employing small diameter copper tube will increase pressure drop and consequently reduce system performance. A <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger which employs the low temperature refrigerant in <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> to cool down the refrigerant before expansion value is {{a potential}} solution to improve system performance because R 290 has low discharge temperature compared with HFC refrigerants (e. g. R 22, R 410 A). This paper presents an investigation of application of a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger in an R 290 air conditioner with small diameter copper tube. A theoretical analysis is proposed at first to investigate the effect of the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger on capacity and system energy efficiency under variable evaporating and cooling temperatures. A prototype R 290 air conditioner with and without a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger is tested in order to explore the effect of a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger on system performance and refrigerant charge in real working conditions. Finally, a refrigerant circuit solution for heat pump air conditioners is proposed. The results of theoretical analysis indicate that the capacity and system energy efficiency increase linearly with the heat exchange of the suctionline heat exchanger, and the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger can improves capacity by up to 12 % and system energy efficiency by up to 4 % under both cooling and heating modes. This is because the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger increases the sub-cooling but has less impact on compressor power due to good thermal properties of R 290. Further, the evaporating and condensation temperature have insignificant impact on the performance of <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger. The experimental results show that the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger improves the cooling capacity and system efficiency by 5. 3 % and 4. 5 %, respectively. These results agree well with that of the system analysis. The sub-cooling temperature increases 10. 2 o C and the discharge temperature increases 25. 4 o C. Further, the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger reduces the refrigerant charge by as much as 6 %. This is because <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger increases the discharge temperature, and thus the superheat region of the condenser increases resulting in less refrigerant in the condenser. Overall, the use of a <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> heat exchanger in a system with small diameter copper tube improves the performance of R 290 and more importantly reduces the refrigerant charge...|$|R

R 1234 yf is a new alternative refrigerant of low global warming potential (GWP) which has been developed for automobile air conditioners as a drop-in replacement for R 134 a in order to meet European Union???s low GWP requirement.

The effect of pipe inclination on oil retention was also investigated. High speed videos of the flow were taken to relate flow regimes to the oil retention data.

40|$|Many ways is {{possible}} to improve the compressor efficiency, like to reduce the mechanical losses through valve or bearing which represents from 20 % to 30 % of total electric consumption power on the compressor. Another ways is to decrease the pressure drop through the compression circuit of the compressor, which can reduce the temperature variation through the compressorâ¦etc. In our case of study, we will {{be interested in the}} heat transfer and pressure drop through the suction circuit. In this paper, we present the challenge done on the heat transfer reduction through the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> of the CAJ 4519 Z compressor, in reducing from 10 Â°C to 20 Â°C the flow temperature through the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> and, thus improve the cooling capacity in increasing density of the flow. Indeed, according to the mechanical conception of the compressor, the <b>suction</b> <b>line,</b> the fresh part of the flow, is in contact with the discharge line, the hot part of the flow, at the cylinder head part. Thus, thermal conduction phenomena at this level heat up the fresh flow of the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> therefore decrease the density of the flow which impacts on the global cooling capacity of the compressor. In this case of study, the cylinder head is on cast iron material, and separates the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> (fresh flow at 64 Â°C) with the discharge line (hot flow at 115 Â°C) by a thickness wall of 0. 8 cm. Consequently, the fresh flow of <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> reheats by the conductivity and loses between 10 Â°C and 20 Â°C according to the operating condition. To reduce the conductivity phenomenon on the cylinder head, a judicious choice of material is done according to the Ashby methodology based on the conductivity coefficient, and a new concept of cylinder head is done. Before, testing the new concept of the cylinder head, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation allows understanding the improvement through the standard and new cylinder head concept, and allows defining the position of the sensor.

40|$|Capillary {{tubes are}} used as {{refrigerant}} controlling devices, expansion devices and also as heart of a small vapor compression refrigeration cycle. It connects outlet condenser to the inlet evaporator and balances the refrigeration cycle pressure and controls the refrigerant mass flux. Capillary tubes are relatively cheap, resulting in extensive implementations in small household refrigerators and freezers with nearly constant refrigeration load. In general, the inner diameter and length of a capillary tube ranges are from 0. 5 - 2. 0 mm, and 2 - 6 m, respectively. In some vapor compression refrigeration cycle applications (VCRC), capillary tubes are coiled to minimize the space. The fluid flow in coiled capillary tubes is subjected to the centrifugal force which causes secondary flow effect. Some researchers have referred to Dean effect to describe this secondary flow. Dean Number is defined as De = Re (d/D) 0. 5 that affects the amount of heat transfer, momentum, and mass flux in both kinds of coiled tubes. Generally, in domestic refrigerators, the capillary tube and <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> is soldered {{to each other in}} order to increase the heat transfer between them, which results in increasing cooling capacity, and avoid the entering of liquid into the compressor. The refrigerant flow through capillary tube flow is notably affected by the heat transfer to the <b>suction</b> <b>line.</b> The adiabatic flow follows a path that is close to an isenthalpic line, whilst the non-adiabatic flow is projected toward the line of saturated liquid, increasing the amount of liquid in the two-phase mixture and decreasing the vapor quality at the evaporator inlet. As a consequence, the refrigerating effect in the evaporator is increased. This paper presents experimental study of refrigerant flow through helical non-adiabatic (diabatic) capillary tubes. This model is validated by previously published experimental data and also by test results performed and presented in this work for R- 134 a. The effect of capillary tube inner diameter, length, relative roughness and coil diameter, and also various test conditions such as inlet pressure, inlet temperature, and sub-cooling degree of refrigerants is investigated. Pressure distribution and temperature variation are obtained experimentally. Furthermore, main subject of this study is experimental investigation of diabatic helical capillary tubes. Therefore this experimental set up is used for investigation of metastable flow, re-condensation, choked and hysteresis phenomenon. The experimental results illustrated that critical ratio (Gc/Gs) is main parameters that affect metastable flow through coiled diabatic capillary tube. If mass flux in the coiled capillary tube (Gc) is constant, the rate of heat transfer from the capillary tube to the suction decreases with a decrease of the mass flux in the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> (Gs). Therefore, an increase of the mass flux ratio represents a decrease of the heat transfer rate between the capillary tube and <b>suction</b> <b>line.</b> The results show that metastable flow in the diabatic coiled capillary tube with 1. 397 mm inner diameter, 30 mm coil diameter, 4360 mm length, 4 mm inner diameter of <b>suction</b> <b>line,</b> exists when the heat transfer rate between the coiled capillary tube and the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> is weak with Gc/Gs 3 Ìe 343...|$|R
40|$|A digital {{distributed}} parameter {{model was}} used to {{study the effects of}} propellant-feed- system coupling and various hydraulic parameters on the analytical prediction of chugging instabilities. Coupling between the combustion chamber and feed system was controlled by varying the compliance of the injector-dome region. The coupling with the feed system above the pump was varied by changing the amount of cavitation compliance at the pump inlet. The stability limits and chugging frequencies proved to be strongly dependent on the degree of feed-system coupling. The maximum stability condition occurred with intermediate coupling. Under conditions of a high degree of feed-system-combustor coupling, the stability limits and chugging frequencies were primarily dependent on the feed-system characteristics; the responses were characterized by beating patterns. For the system analyzed, the pump <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> had little effect on the stability limits or chugging frequencies. Beating, present under the condition of near zero injector -dome compliance, was eliminated when the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> was decoupled by employing a sufficiently high value of pump-inlet compliance.

40|$|Despite the turbomachines {{are used}} in space {{propulsion}} since the beginning, they still represent crucial components for liquid-propelled rockets. The complexity of these devices requires to {{pay particular attention to}} their design behavior, especially in presence of cavitation. Indeed turbomachines are usually asked to work with a two-phase flow which can affect not only the pumping performance, but can also generate peculiar flow instabilities closely connected with the cavitation and whose amplitude depend on the cavitation level. Cavitation is at the basis {{of one of the most}} important technical problems faced in rockets powered by turbomachines: the arising of the POGO phenomenon. This phenomenon has been known since the dawn of the space missions and it consists of a resonance where the dynamics of the longitudinal vibrations of the rocket structure can couple with the thrust oscillations eventually leading to mission failure. The POGO oscillations are very related to the presence of cavitation which can alter the dynamic response of the turbomachines to pressure and flow rate oscillations generated in the ducts by flow/combustion instabilities or other types of instabilities. In this thesis the changes brought to the test facility at Alta S. p. A. in order to adapt the test rig to the experimentation of the POGO phenomenon will be shown. The innovative system for the generation of the oscillations is based on the vertical vibration of the tank so that pressure oscillations are produced and, thanks to the impedance of the discharge and <b>suction</b> <b>lines,</b> also flow rate oscillations are consequently generated. These oscillations are assessed by means of piezoelectric pressure transducers placed along the lines whose readings have been used for evaluating the dynamic transfer matrix for different pumps. In particular three different pumps have been tested: two inducers and a centrifugal pump. Both the inducers have been derived from the DAPAMITO inducers family whose design has been drawn by means of the model developed by Professor dâAgostino. The new inducers have been modified in the leading edge shape, whose tip shape has been rounded in order to study its effect on the performance and on flow instabilities, which are notoriously affected by the shape of the leading edge. The experimental study of these machines outlined weak effects of the leading edge shape on the non-cavitating performance, but greater effect has been noticed on the suction performance which shows an early head degradation. The analysis of the flow instabilities has also shown the effect of the shape of this important part which can affect the presence of some forms of instabilities. Indeed a comparison with the previous inducers and a later one with sharp edges confirmed the effect of this part on the flow instabilities, some of which, like the high-order surge, can disappear with the rounding of the leading edge. Anyway a deeper analysis of the cavitation effects should be carried out given the relatively high values of cavitation numbers tested. This should be performed in order to verify if some phenomena (especially the some rotating instabilities) could arise at lower cavitation numbers thus showing a delaying effect of the rounded leading edge on the flow instabilities. The study of the flow instabilities on the centrifugal pumps outlined instead the need in the next future to make some changes to the test rig so that the pressure taps can be placed nearer to the pump. Indeed in the actual configuration, because of the distance of the pressure taps, some possible rotating instabilities have been detected as axial. For the characterization of the dynamic response of the considered pumps the test facility has been modified on the basis of a model previously developed. The model outlined the need to have two different configurations which could give the possibility to perform distinct tests and so to get the dynamic matrix of the pumps. A first test campaign has been performed and it outlined many different problematics which demonstrated to be of crucial importance for the successof the experiment. Among the different problems there have been detected: excessive vibrations of the suction and discharge lines which have been almost completely eliminated by using reinforced concrete plynths to block the two pipes beside the tank; too many air pockets in the water have been detected and the number of the dearinting cycles have been so increased; some differences in the sensitivity of the pressure transducers have been found and so a specific calibration has been performed in order to find a way to properly correct the sensitivity at varying the frequency and the pressure amplitude in sucha a way that all the transducer would have given the same result for the same input. A second experimental campaign for the dynamic matrix characterization has been performed only on two test items: the three bladed inducer and the centrifugal pump. This experimental campaign, anyway, hasnât brought the expected results. The vibrating table proved to be able to generate significant pressure oscillations, but the trend of the dynamic matrix elements showed to be very different from the one foreseen by the model or by the few previous experimental results reported in literature. Some models have been also developed and presented in this thesis in order to understand the results obtained. Their capabilities have been compared by fitting the experimentala data available in literature. Each proposed model shows a different complexity in describing the physics involved in turbomachines, but the model which best fits the experimental data has been the one already used in the design of the experiment. So this model has been used in order to better characterize the dynamics of the whole circuit on the basis of the experimental data recorded during the second experimental campaign and it gives the possibility to get the component of the dynamic matrix by fitting the data related to the pressure oscillations at the pump inlet. This model of the circuit has also allowed to assess the very high condition number of the problem and it has highlighted how much some errors on the measurements can influence the assessment of the dynamic matrix. In particular it has been noticed that an error on the evaluation of the amplitude of the pressure oscillations had minor effects than the errors on the determination of their phases which resulted to totally change the trend of the dynamic matrix components at vearying the frequency of the imposed oscillation. The same model has been also used to identify some configurations which can give different geometrically independent configurations by only changing the position or the value of a compliance, which is physically represented by an hydraulic accumulator. In this way different experiments can be performed for the same imposed oscillating frequency and it is so allowed the possibility to reduce the effect of measurement errors on the transfer matrix assessment. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of another very important problem: the rotordynamic forces acting on turbomachines, especially in the presence of cavitation. The experimental activity has concerned an inducer, similar to those previously tested, a centrifugal pump and their combination. In this thesis, anyway, it is reported only the work performed on the inducer. The effects of the flow coefficient, the intensity of the cavitation and of the temperature on the forces is shown. In the tests it came out that the inducer is weakly affected by the intensity of the cavitation until this becomes such intense to lead the pump head to drop. In this case the force acting on the pump can vary significantly in intensity and also in behavior. The effect of the temperature has been instead almost negligible for all the tested conditions whereas the incidence angle showed some interesting effects on the disposition and the values of the maxima and minima of the rotordynamic force...|$|E

Two-phase mixture is pumped until the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> has been evacuated and the fluid level has been pushed into the front suction intake chamber by atmospheric pressure. During normal pumping operation this pump works like an ordinary centrifugal pump.|$|R

The heat pump uses refrigerant type of hydrocarbon that is friendly to the environment, such as refrigerant R- 290. From the results obtained research that the highest of Coefficient of Performance (COP) in the heat pump using heat exchangers is 4. 8 and without using heat exchanger is 4. 1. So value of COP of haet pump between using heat exchanger and withaout heat exchanger is 0. 7. The highest efficiency obtained on the heat pump using heat exchangers is 90. 3...|$|R
50|$|A relief or {{safety valve}} on the {{discharge}} {{side of the}} positive displacement pump is therefore necessary. The relief valve can be internal or external. The pump manufacturer normally has the option to supply internal relief or safety valves. The internal valve is usually only used as a safety precaution. An external relief valve in the discharge line, with a return line back to the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> or supply tank provides increased safety.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this paper is an experimental investigation of the oil return characteristics of alternative refrigerants for residential air conditioning systems using R 22. Due to the phase-out of HCFC refrigerants, the production of R 22 will be stopped by the year 2020. In some cases of vapor compression systems installed in the field, {{it will be necessary to}} replace the R 22 with alternative drop-in refrigerants as a part of maintenance procedures. Since R 22 system typically use mineral oils and HFC replacement refrigerants use POE or PAG oils. It may be necessary to change the type of oil used inside the system when retrofitting an existing R 22 system with an alternative drop-in refrigerant. Changing the oil in a vapor compression system is an expensive proposition due to the required flushing and cleaning of the system before the new oil can be installed. Therefore, refrigerant manufacturers are searching for alternative refrigerants, which are compatible with mineral oils and have similar working performance and conditions as R 22. The measurement of the oil return in the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> helps to draw conclusions about the ability of the oil circulating back to the compressor. In this study, a unitary spilt-system air conditioner with a cooling capacity of 7 kW was equipped with an oil separator and oil measuring cylinder in the <b>suction</b> <b>line.</b> The experimental test setup was designed and built to measure the mass of oil returned to the compressor. Ã The weight of the oil collected in the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> using three different compositions of the alternative drop-in refrigerant R 438 are compared to the mass of oil returned when using R 22...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{mixing and}} boron {{dilution}} in a {{pressurized water reactor}} were analyzed with COMMIX codes. The reactor system was the four loop Zion reactor. Two boron dilution scenarios were analyzed. In the first scenario, the plant is in cold shutdown and the reactor coolant system has just been filled after maintenance on the steam generators. To flush {{the air out of}} the steam generator tubes, a reactor coolant pump (RCP) is started, with the water in the pump <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> devoid of boron and at the same temperature as the coolant in the system. In the second scenario, the plant is at hot standby and the reactor coolant system has been heated up to operating temperature after a long outage. It is assumed that an RCP is started, with the pump <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> filled with cold unborated water, forcing a slug of diluted coolant down the downcomer and subsequently through the reactor core. The subsequent transient thermal mixing and boron dilution that would occur in the reactor system is simulated for these two scenarios. The reactivity insertion rate and the total reactivity are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Every {{household}} refrigerator and freezer operates with a capillary tube-suction line heat exchanger. The proper design of these heat exchangers is thus {{an important factor}} in energy conservation. ^ The capillary tube is a long length of small diameter (0. 028 inch for this study) drawn, copper tubing which restricts and regulates the refrigerant flow in a refrigeration system. The <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> is a lesser length of larger diameter (0. 25 inch for this study) copper tubing which acts as the return line from the evaporator to the compressor. The capillary tube and <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> are soldered together to form the capillary tube-suction line heat exchanger. ^ A literature survey showed that substantial literature and information exists for designing adiabatic capillary tubes (zero heat transfer with the <b>suction</b> <b>line),</b> but there is very little information {{that can be used to}} design capillary tube-suction line heat exchangers. ^ An experimental test loop was designed and built for testing the capillary tube-suction line heat exchanger. This test loop completely simulated a refrigeration system while providing easily controlled test conditions. A capillary tube-suction line heat exchanger was also instrumented with pressure taps and thermocouples. ^ A capillary tube-suction line heat exchanger was experimentally tested for a wide range of conditions including; variable heat exchanger length conditions, subcooled inlet, quality inlet and choked flow. The resulting experimental data was used to calculate the thermo-dynamic state along the capillary tube-suction line heat exchanger, to verify the theoretical model, and to make design decisions. ^ The capillary tube-suction line heat exchanger was theoretically modeled by dividing the capillary tube flow into two regions, subcooled and two-phase. Each of the two regions was described by four governing differential equations and boundary conditions. The governing differential equations were solved by an implicit finite difference method that marched the solution along the heat exchanger from a known initial condition. The results of the theoretical models compared satisfactorily with measured experimental data when initial conditions were accurately known. ...|$|R
50|$|Flow control, or metering, of the {{refrigerant}} {{is accomplished}} by use of a temperature sensing bulb, filled with a similar gas as in the system, that causes the valve to open against the spring pressure in the valve body as the temperature on the bulb increases. As the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> temperature decreases, so does the pressure in the bulb and therefore on the spring causing the valve to close. An air conditioning system with a TX valve is often more efficient than other designs that do not use one.|$|R
5000|$|The high {{pressure}} liquid then enters the expansion valve where the TX valve allows {{a portion of}} the refrigerant to enter the evaporator. In order for the higher temperature fluid to cool, the flow must be limited into the evaporator to keep the pressure low and allow expansion back into the gas phase. The TXV has sensing bulbs connected to the <b>suction</b> <b>line</b> of the refrigerant piping. The gas pressure in the sensing bulbs provides the force to open the TXV, therefore adjusting the flow of refrigerant and the superheat.|$|R
