The minimum capital requirements for the corporate, interbank and <b>sovereign</b> <b>loan</b> portfolios of a representative bank in each EMU country are evaluated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations depending on the credit rating agencies chosen by the bank to risk-weight its exposures. Three main results emerge from the analysis. First, although the use of different combinations of credit rating agencies leads to significant differences in minimum capital requirements, these differences never exceed 10 % of banks’ regulatory capital for loans to corporates, banks and sovereigns on average in the EMU. Second, the standardised approach provides a small regulatory capital incentive for banks to use several credit rating agencies to risk-weight their exposures. Third, the minimum capital requirements for the corporate, interbank and <b>sovereign</b> <b>loan</b> portfolios of EMU banks will be higher in Basel II than in Basel I. I also show that the incentive for banks to engage in regulatory arbitrage in the standardised approach to credit risk is limited.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} of how risk premia emerge in the <b>sovereign</b> <b>loan</b> market. The economy is composed of countries which borrow each period from private banks. In the event of default, the bank imposes a penalty by seizing the country's overseas assets. The country may also choose to appeal to an international authority, such as the IMF, which determines whether the country must repay the loan or pay the penalty. This process takes one period to be completed and its outcome is stochastic. In an environment with a deterministic penalty to default, the supply of funds schedule is upward sloping. The interest rate on sovereign loans {{is greater than the}} prime rate charged on private loans, implying the existence of risk premia. ...|$|E

Using developing country data from the period 1973 - 1981 and constructing continuous variables for credit history, we find that past default is a significant determinant of the spread, even after including country fixed effects. Moreover, its reduced-form effect is very similar to its structural form effect, indicating that most of the influence of past repayment problems is through the reputation channel. Overall, reserves to imports, past and predicted future default are substantial determinants of sovereign bank loan spreads...|$|E

Increased political instability increases the equilibrium loan size in the first regime and decreases it in the second. Using out-of-sample evidence, we identify the two regimes in the data.

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis began with {{observations of the}} debate in the media over the implications of the debt crisis, who was to blame and possible solutions. The terminology used (liquidity, solvency, default, repudiation, arrears, etc.) was not considered to be helpful in critically analysing the situation. Indeed, this terminology was likely to create confusion when trying to understand the causes, consequences and alternatives for the debt crisis. What causes debt repayment problems. Why do borrower countries prefer to suspend debt repayments rather than simply repudiate debt. How have lenders coped with this situation. Is there any evidence of an improvement in the situation. For a reader interested and familiar with the debt literature, these questions are not new. What is important is to have an understanding of the possible remedies and be able to design a solution that might resolve the debt crisis in a timely manner rather than allow it to drag on indefinitely with all the costs that that would imply. This thesis explores these questions and shares the views of the advocates of debt relief as part of the solution to the debt problem. In order to place the debt problem in context, the thesis begins with a brief historical account of the borrowing practices of Latin American countries since their independence from Spain. Default is not a new phenomenon. What is new is the source of lending (private banks and not bond holders) and the institutions involved (IMF and World Bank). This has implications for the way debt has been handled which we explore in chapter 1. In addition we review the efforts of researchers in modelling <b>sovereign</b> <b>loans,</b> explaining debt restructuring and searching for the determinants of debt repayment problems. The complexities found when dealing with <b>sovereign</b> <b>loans</b> lie in their nature, or more simply, the lack of collateral. In chapter 2, we take into consideration more explicitly the peculiar nature of <b>sovereign</b> <b>loans</b> and design a two period horizon pure "willingness to pay" model to explore its implications in the loan market equilibrium. If we assume sufficiently risk-averse borrowers and neither adverse selection nor moral hazard, we find that the competitive equilibrium is inefficient. We then reframe this basic model into a bilateral monopoly context and include some bargaining elements. We derive the elements of conflict, the Pareto negotiation locus and discuss possible bargaining solutions {{in the context of the}} static axiomatic approach. The design of any solution to the debt crisis requires an understanding of what precipitates a borrower into arrears. Chapter 3 offers an empirical study of LACs during 1971 - 86 which aims to compare different empirical specifications and trace variables that might usefully be included in our statistical model. Using those results, in chapter 4, we test our empirical model which now includes economic indicators, "crude" political proxies and country heterogeneity fixed effects. Our findings suggest that they are relevant in the assessment of the causes of debt servicing problems. Finally, in chapter 5, we consider the debate concerning "debt overhang" in Latin America. We also provide an account of how the debt problem has been managed and conclude that a prompt solution can not rely on "refinancing" nor on voluntary market debt reduction schemes...|$|R

40|$|There {{are three}} reasons for {{attempting}} to reach a common understanding of the responsibilities of sovereign borrowers and their lenders. First, the flow of capital to sovereign debtors is exceptionally important to the world economy. Industrialized countries rely on it to finance their budget deficits, these days to a breathtaking extent. Developing countries need it to develop. Misbehaviour, either by the sovereign debtors or by the creditors, destabilizes this key component of the international financial system, making credit less available and more costly. Second, sovereign finance is uniquely unforgiving of mistakes. Unlike corporate or personal debtors, sovereigns {{do not have access}} to a formal bankruptcy process in which insupportable liabilities can be adjusted according to pre-established rules. From a legal standpoint, sovereign debts are therefore ineradicable absent the consent and cooperation of the creditors. Unfortunately, the process by which that consent and cooperation must be sought – sovereign debt restructuring – remains unpredictable and disorderly. Third, the human cost of prodigal sovereign borrowing, reckless sovereign lending or incompetent sovereign debt restructuring is incalculable. Perusing a major international newspaper on any day of any year is all that is required to make good this proposition. A consensus about the responsibilities of sovereign borrowers and lenders, together with improvements in the way in which <b>sovereign</b> <b>loans</b> are planned, executed, documented and, when necessary, restructured, will directly affect the lives of most of the people that live on this planet. ...|$|R

(3) Countries which interrupted service recovered more quickly from the Great Depression than countries which resisted default.

(S} The readjustment of defaulted debts was protracted: the analogy with Chapter 11 corporate bankruptcy proceedings is no more applicable to the 1930 s than to the 1980 s. (6) Although default led in some cases to a substantial reduction of transfers from debtors to creditors, on balance returns on <b>sovereign</b> <b>loans</b> compared favorably with returns on domestic investments. (7) Creditor-country governments did more in the 'thirties than in the 'eighties to accelerate the settlement process.

We find that the choice of the up-front fees does not affect the number of banks that join the syndicate.
