40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The {{sexual molestation}} of {{children}} {{is one of the}} most pressing problems of our times. Considering that as many as one in every four girls, and one in every ten boys are sexually victimized as children, the sexual molestation of children seems to be a common occurrence. Child sexual abuse results in emotional symptoms such as depression, low self esteem, sexual disfunction, impaired health, eating disorders and other emotional disturbances. The vast number of children being subjected to sexual molestation, as well as the cost in terms of human suffering, necessitates studies that focus on determining why certain individuals violate sexual boundaries with children. Mainstream theories and research to date only focus on the conscious functioning of men who sexually molest children. The focus is therefore only on the description of the outward manifestation of symptoms. Research to date does not succeed in describing the mechanisms or processes that culminate in the sexual molestation of children. This study represents a first step in addressing this void in the body of knowledge pertaining to men who sexually molest children. By means of a method of analysis, namely Medical Hypnoanalysis, the <b>subconscious</b> <b>thought</b> patterns of two males, which culminated in the molestation of children, were revealed, described and explained. The problem statement and purpose of the study, namely to reveal, describe and explain the dynamic development and course of the <b>subconscious</b> <b>thought</b> patterns which eventually culminated in the molestation of children, inspired a qualitative multiple case study as a research design. After an in-depth analysis of each individual case, the dynamic development and course of the <b>subconscious</b> <b>thought</b> patterns of the two cases were integrated with each other by means of a cross case analysis. The cross case analysis enabled the researcher to develop detailed explanations, better insight and theories pertaining to the <b>subconscious</b> <b>thought</b> patterns underlying the sexual molestation of children. The cross case analysis was integrated with the theory of Medical Hypnoanalysis to form a general psychological structure consisting of the dynamic development and course of the <b>subconscious</b> <b>thought</b> patterns of men who molest children. The general psychological structure was subsequently integrated with previous literature, which allowed for the development of new theory. This study has found that the absence of love, which was experienced since the prenatal period, and intensified throughout, resulted in the perception of worthlessness. The absence of love led to an insecurity with regards to the self and a feeling of spiritual emptiness, a death-like feeling. Without love a person cannot survive; without love life is just not worthwhile. The subconscious mind is genetically programmed to survive, and is therefore compelled to engineer ways to establish survival. For various reasons, sexual interaction became the proof to the two molesters in this study that they were loved, that they were worthy, and thus alive. Sexual interaction was therefore the way in which survival was established. For both molesters, sexual interaction developed into a compulsion. Their emotional and spiritual survival were threatened whenever they were deprived of sexual interaction. This led to severe anxiety, which was provided by the subconscious mind in order to compel the men to have sexual interaction, and survive. It is this compulsion, together with the fact that both respondents’ emotional development was arrested at an earlier age, which led to the sexual molestation of children. The study was concluded with recommendations to psychologists on how to treat men who molest children...|$|E

5000|$|In the {{international}} peer-reviewed journal JAMA Psychiatry, James C. Harris, MD, writes that for Miró, “painting was {{a means to}} express his inner life through visionary art” (p 226). This is a reference to Miró’s style of painting, automatism, essentially painting without planning the subject or composition. In this process the artist paints whatever comes to mind, thereby painting his <b>subconscious</b> <b>thoughts.</b> Once the shapes are on the canvas, the artist is able to create images out of the forms based on his imagination. In 1931, Miró said, “I’m only interested in anonymous art, the kind that springs from the collective unconscious” (JAMA Psychiatry). This quote tells {{us a great deal}} about Harlequin's Carnival, since it was Miró’s first surrealist painting. Through this painting Miró is trying to convey his subconscious, which inadvertently reflects on his life experiences. By analyzing this painting the viewer learns of Miró’s sadness, happiness, and creative imagination.|$|R

The story begins when Elizabeth, who attends an {{exclusive}} private school called Ashbury, is forced to begin a letter correspondence with a student from the local comprehensive high school (Brookfield), by her new English teacher, Mr. Botherit. The recipient of Elizabeth's letter is a girl named Christina Kratovac. Elizabeth and Christina become friends almost immediately. Elizabeth confides in Christina as she feels very alone and confused about her life. She does not fit in at Ashbury and she has an awkward relationship with her father (who left Elizabeth's mother when she was pregnant and moved to Canada with another woman and her son), who has just been reintroduced into her life in a permanent way. But mainly, her concerns revolve around her best friend, an awkward, free-spirited girl named Celia Buckley who has run away from home without leaving any details as to her whereabouts. Added to this are the barrage of letters that Elizabeth constantly receives from various societies and clubs, each pointing out her faults and generally bringing her down. The letters are reflections of Elizabeth's own <b>subconscious</b> <b>thoughts</b> and are not actually real.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{doctoral}} research project was to explore the conscious and <b>subconscious</b> <b>thoughts</b> and feelings clients had about their experience of brief-term therapy and the therapeutic relationship. The methodology chosen was IPA because it examines in systematic detail the complex understandings from individuals’ making sense of a phenomenon. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with 10 clients who had recently ended their therapy with trainee integrative practitioners at one low-cost counselling agency. To reach psychological depth, an ‘object-tray’ of miniature objects was used in each interview to facilitate access to clients’ intrapsychic and intersubjective processes, and to trigger metaphorical thinking. Findings detail {{a wide range of}} clients’ multi-faceted fears and thoughts, and reveal how these relate to client negativity, defensiveness and resistance. They demonstrate how clients were active in overcoming their fears (or not!) and illustrate how clients reflected upon their therapeutic relationships. This study also offers clients’ perceptions of various helpful interventions found to be therapeutically successful for reducing fears, and for facilitating psychological recovery and personal growth. The impact of this study could influence assessment procedures, and therapeutic practice and trainings by helping assessors and therapists develop their skills in demystifying therapy for clients and addressing client fears; it could also potentially help to understand the reasons for drop-outs. Furthermore, this study emphasises the need for therapists to obtain client feedback both early on and continually throughout the course of therapy and for therapists to work collaboratively according to clients’ needs and wants. However it must be recognised that, as this was small scale research carried out in one particular location, it is possible that another group of ex-client participants would have different sense-making narratives and another researcher might have responded differently in the interview process, perhaps drawing out different data with correspondingly different considerations...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 55) The oboe???s noble history {{dates back}} {{hundreds of years}} prior to many of its modern orchestral counterparts. This rich history lends a plethora of solo compositions written by prominent composers of every musical era. Such outstanding composers include Richard Strauss, Paul Hindemith, Heinrich von Herzogenberg and George Friedrich Handel. Each of these German men lived through times of great political strife, war and turmoil within their own countries and throughout Europe. All of them composed solo or chamber works for the oboe during these tumultuous times. Through {{the examination of the}} circumstances surrounding the composition of each solo oboe piece, light will be shed on each of these four composer???s decision making process in choosing to write for this particular medium. Through historical records the technical developments and origins of the oboe will be explored that also have factored into the periods of popularity in the oboe repertoire during the lifetimes of these great men. 		The oboe has consistently been associated with pastoral elements so it naturally follows that music would be written for it of the same characteristic. Pastoral elements with a rustic, tranquil and quaint lifestyle are often closely associated with an escape for the conscious mind during times of hardship and stress. Many pastoral scenes include representations of the Swiss Alps, the Mediterranean coast, and country landscapes. From its origin as the medieval shawm to its transition into the French hautboy, the oboe has been the chosen representation of shepherds, geese, birds and provincial scenes by monumental composers such as Hector Berlioz and J. S. Bach. Eventually the oboe became a representation for lost desire partially through its human representation of the female voice. Although it cannot communicate through words, the oboe???s inability to convey linguistic meaning is what allows it to transcend words and communicate more directly through emotion. It is this voiceless longing that launched these composers??? <b>subconscious</b> emotional <b>thoughts</b> of escaping reality that eventually led to the ultimate composition of these pieces, today considered to be cornerstones in the solo oboe repertoir...|$|R
