5|$|The discourses {{contained}} {{with this}} gospel {{seem to be}} concerned with issues of the church–synagogue debate at the time of composition. It is notable that in John, the community appears to define itself primarily in contrast to Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian community. Though Christianity <b>started</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> movement within Judaism, it gradually separated from Judaism because of mutual opposition between the two religions.|$|E

Its height also gave it an unfortunate reputation as the focal point of many suicide attempts in its early days, until the tall Singapore Improvement Trust flats at Upper Pickering Street were built.|$|E
5|$|Although Harvey <b>started</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wicketkeeper at school, {{he became}} a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} {{to work with the}} idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction <b>started</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.|$|E
