40|$|Indonesia {{is one of}} {{countries}} which is rich in zeolite deposits. Volcanic activities in this country millions years ago released much of volcanic tuff as source of zeolite materials. The most important of zeolite characteristics are high cation exchange capacity (CEC), capability to absorb ammonium ions, and their unique porous structures. Those characteristics {{can be used for}} many utilities of zeolite for agriculture such as soil ameliorant, <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> of nitrogen fertilizer, and growth media of horticultural plants. Application of zeolite as soil ameliorant gave good effect if applied in low CEC soil such as Oxisol, Ultisol, and some Inceptisol with high dossage of 10 - 15 ton/ha. Although zeolites improved the soil characteristics and crop production, only a few farmers used zeolites due to economical reasons. Therefore, other techniques should be developed for stimulating farmers to use zeolites. Application of zeolite with lower dosage can be mixed directly with urea in ratio of 1 : 1 or 30 % if the mixtures are pelletized. Zeolite can be applied in company with other soil ameliorants such as compost, liming, and humic acid...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} nutrient for rubber plant is potassium. Its deficiency cause weakness of stems and plant tissue damaging by bacteria, fungi, insects, nematodes and viruses. The roles of potassium are involve in tapping bark regeneration, latex stability, balance of magnesium (Mg), increasing yield and {{the resistance of}} disease. On the other hand stomata activity {{and the rate of}} transpiration in sufficient potassium decrease with increasing soil moisture stress. In the cycle of nutrient potassium in a rubber plantation is an open system. The source of its nutrient through mineral dissolution, organic materials decomposition, rainwater, leaches out of canopy and fertilization. Otherwise potassium in the soil has been immobilization partially in the plant tissue become timber and the remaining absorbed by cover crops (LCC). Furthermore the losses of nutrient also occur through soil erosion and latex harvesting. Rubber plantation in Indonesia generally cultivated on acidic soil like Inceptisol, Ultisol and Oxisol. Inherently those have low quality of soil fertility including low potassium content. Some technologies have been applied by rubber planters for managing soil fertility viz. fertilization of potassium, using additives material such as <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> for reaching more effectiveness and, soil tillage and planting LCC as source of organic matter and erosion control...|$|E
40|$|Supercritical antisolvent {{precipitation}} is {{a relatively}} recent technology {{which can be used}} for controlled preparation of polymer particles from solutions. This is done by the addition of an antisolvent to a polymer solution causing supersaturation of the polymer, especially under supercritical conditions. The particle size of the precipitates can be adjusted mainly by the rate of supersaturation. Spherical xylan or mannan particles having a narrow particle size distribution were precipitated from hemicellulose solutions in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) or DMSO/water mixtures by carbon dioxide as an antisolvent. By {{depending on the type of}} hemicellulose, the DMSO/H 2 O ratio, and the precipitation conditions such as pressure and temperature, the resulting particle size can be adjusted within a wide range from less than 0. 1 to more than 5 [*]m.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a patient who {{suffered}} generalized urticaria, chest tightness, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. Two hours earlier she had taken Eulitop Retard following lunch. She had tolerated all the implicated food after the reaction. Allergy evaluation revealed intense positive responses to intradermal tests with bezafibrate active component and Eulitop Retard (skin tests in control subjects were negative). Specific IgE tests (RAST) to Eulitop Retard were negative. An IgE mechanism is suggested to be responsible for this adverse reaction {{on the basis of the}} positive skin tets. The delayed onset (two hours) of this anaphylactic shock is unusual. Although infrequent, it may be caused by the specific pharmacokinetic characteristics of this drug, which is a <b>slow</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>agent,</b> mainly absorbed in the gut. The drug was taken just after lunch, and this concomitant food ingestion could also have produced a delay in gastric drainage and a retarded drug absorption. An IgE-mediated accelerated type reaction could also explain this delay. Apparently the patient reacted after the first contact to the drug, and the absence of a sensitization period is not usual in this type of immune reponse. Finally, we recommend the performance of prick and intradermal skin tests prior to any systemic challenge when allergic reactions to fibric acid derivatives are suspected...|$|R

The xylan concentration significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced both the particle size and zeta potential of the oat spelt xylan hydrogels, and the later was also influenced significantly (P < 0. 05) by the hydrolysis time. The horse radish peroxidase was encapsulated in situ, both during and after formation of the xylan hydrogels and was released in an active form for a period of 180 min.

40|$|Although zeolites {{have been}} known since the 502 ̆ 7 s the {{application}} of zeolites in Indonesia started in the 802 ̆ 7 s after promotion by the Mineral Technology Research Centre. Before that period, zeolites were only used as construction materials for wall decoration. Zeolites became popular after publication of zeolite research into many aspects of possible applications. Applications of zeolites are based on their characteristics. Initially natural zeolites were used as fillers in the paper industry, ion exchangers in water treatment, separation of nitrogen and oxygen, sorbents in drying, and construction materials. At the same time, applications of zeolites were developed as feed additives for animals and for water treatment in shrimp ponds. In some countries, zeolites {{have been used as}} industrial materials, improvement of agricultural production, and environmental protection. In agriculture, applications of zeolites can be used directly to soils as materials for growth media, mixed with manures during decomposition process, and for mixing with urea as <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> The number of zeolite factories in Indonesia is still low and they produce zeolites in powder and grain forms. In recent years, some zeolite factories have been built to produce zeolites for material of industry, agriculture and environmental protection. The most important effort for zeolite factories is how to produce high quality of zeolite. The prospect of zeolite applications in agriculture is very good as (1) soil amelioration for low cation exchange capacity of soils, (2) material for mixing with fertilizer, (3) material as growth media for horticulture and seedling plantation plants, (4) material for improvement of compost quality, (5) material for water treatment of fish ponds, (6) food additives for animals...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to test {{alginate}} gels of different compositions as a system for controlled release of manganese ions (Mn(2 +)) for application in manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI), in order to circumvent the challenge of achieving optimal MRI resolution without resorting to high, potentially cytotoxic doses of Mn(2 +). Elemental analysis and stability studies of Mn-alginate revealed marked differences in ion binding capacity, rendering Mn/Ba-alginate gels with high guluronic acid content most stable. The findings were corroborated by corresponding differences in the release rate of Mn(2 +) from alginate beads in vitro using T(1) -weighted MRI. Furthermore, intravitreal (ivit) injection of Mn-alginate beads yielded significant enhancement of the rat retina and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons 24 [*]h post-injection. Subsequent compartmental modelling and simulation of ivit Mn(2 +) transport and concentration revealed that application of <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> contrast <b>agents</b> can achieve a significant reduction of ivit Mn(2 +) concentration compared with bolus injection. This is followed by a concomitant increase in the availability of ivit Mn(2 +) for uptake by RGC, corresponding to significantly increased time constants.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> fertilizers by using Leonardite and Zeolite. Two formulations of <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> fertilizer were prepared namely the Leonardite and Zeolite <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> fertilizer and the Leonardite <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> fertilizer. Theirnutrient releasing rates were investigated and comparedwith {{that of the}} commercially availableslow release fertilizer which contained N 8 :P 24 :K 24. Specifically the <b>slow</b> <b>release</b> fertilizers were formulated from leonardite, zeolite and other fertilizer materials such as ammonium phosphate and potassium chloride. Each formulation was then pelletized and baked at 100 °C for 1 hr to remove water; then they were kilned at 150 °C for 1 hr. All the kilned fertilizers were analyzed subsequently by using the Fertilizer Test Kit (KU. 5) to determine the releasing rates of the main N, P and K nutrients. Each fertilizer was immersed in distilled water and shakenat the speed of 150 rpm for 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr and 2 hr. The nutrients released into the distilled water were determined following the standard methodology.

Within {{the aerospace industry}} (where thermoset matrix systems are widely used), external <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are applied to coat the mold prior to the curing process [7]. After the crosslinking reaction of the resin-system and the demolding of the parts, <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues are found on the parts surface as several times shown (e.g. [6 – 9]). This indicates a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer during {{the production of the}} parts. These <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues lower the adhesion of the parts and therefore their initial bondability [10]. Within industrial applications, the challenge of the relatively bad initial bondability is solved by an additional process step—the bonding pre-treatment. Even if there are different approaches, like a laser [8] or plasma [9] application, which allow a sufficient and potentially automated bonding pre-treatment, it is still an additional process step which lowers the production efficiency.|$|R
