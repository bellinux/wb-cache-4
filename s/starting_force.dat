25|$|The {{diaphragm}} {{is usually}} manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A {{variety of different}} materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well damped, to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped {{with little or no}} audible ringing due to its resonance frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves trade-offs. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some carbon fiber, Kevlar, glass, hemp or bamboo fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.|$|E

Magnetic field strength drops off rapidly with increasing distance. In the reciprocating electric motor the distance between armature and field coil must necessarily increase considerably over its minimum value; this reduces the motor's output power and <b>starting</b> <b>force.</b> Vibration is also an issue.|$|E

50|$|Proportional Solenoid -Included in this {{category}} of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature {{as a function of}} coil current. These solenoids, whether axial or rotary, employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> (torque), and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically. The resulting force (torque) profile as the solenoid progresses through its operational stroke is nearly flat or descends from a high to a lower value. The solenoid can be useful for positioning, stopping mid-stroke, or for low velocity actuation; especially in a closed loop control system. A uni-directional solenoid would actuate against an opposing force or a dual solenoid system would be self cycling. The proportional concept is more fully described in SAE publication 860759 (1986).|$|E
50|$|At the Red Bull Ring, Austria, {{the team}} was {{expected}} to struggle for performance due to the high speed nature of the track. But surprisingly, the car performed above everybody's expectations as Button qualified 5th and started in 3rd, equalling his best qualifying position since 2014 British Grand Prix where qualifying was also held in mixed conditions, due to Rosberg and Vettel receiving 5 place grid penalties. Alonso meanwhile struggled with the car and managed to qualify down in 14th, due to the team's error in sending him out in old tyres instead of the newer ones. During the race, Button managed to get into 2nd before the first corner, overtaking the slow <b>starting</b> <b>Force</b> India of Nico Hülkenberg. Button managed to finish in 6th place after faster cars such as Red Bulls and Ferraris overtook him and Alonso retiring from the race during the final couple of laps due to an energy storage battery failure.

50|$|From 1926 to 1937, {{literary}} {{publications and}} arts societies gradually sprang up in Taiwan. Most {{of them had}} anti-Japanese sentiments, and aimed at encouraging patriotism among the Taiwanese public. In 1927, Chen Manying, Lai He and Chen Shaoxin (陈满盈，赖和，陈绍馨) founded the New Student Study Society (新生学会), while overseas students in Japan, Xu Naichang, Yang Yunping, Yang Gui (许乃昌，杨云萍，杨贵) et al. organized the Social Science Study Group (社会科学研究部). In 1932, Zhuang Chuisheng, Ia̍p Êng-cheng (庄垂胜，叶荣钟) et al. published the Southern Voice (《南音》) magazine. In March 1933, overseas students Zhang Wenhuan, Wu Yongfu, Wang Baiyuan, Liu Jie, Su Weixiong, Shi Xuexi (张文环，巫永福，王白渊，刘捷，苏维熊，施学习) et al. founded the Taiwan Arts Society (台湾艺术研究会) in Tokyo, and published the Formosa (《福尔摩沙》) magazine. In October 1933, Guo Qiusen, Liao Hanchen, Huang Deshi, Wang Shilang, Chen Junyu, Lin Kefu (郭秋生，廖汉臣，黄得时，王诗琅，陈君玉，林克夫) et al. founded the Taiwan Literature Association (台湾文艺协会) in Taipei, and published the <b>Starting</b> <b>Force</b> (《先发部队》) magazine which was later renamed First Line (《第一线》). In 1934, the Taiwan Arts Society and the Taiwan Literature Association amalgamated into the Taiwan Literature and Arts League (台湾文艺联盟), and the League published the Taiwan Literature and Arts (台湾文艺) magazine. In 1935, Yang Kui (杨逵) and his wife left the Taiwan Literature and Arts magazine, and founded the Taiwan New Literature Society (台湾新文学社) with Ye Tao (叶陶) and his wife. They published the New Taiwanese Literature (台湾新文学) magazine.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{design for}} a solenoid-based electromechanical actuator would provide greater <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> than does a comparable conventional design. As used here, <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> signifies the magnetic force exerted by the actuator {{at one end of}} its stroke when the gap in its magnetic circuit is the widest. A solenoid of conventional design exerts a large force when its gap is closed. The magnetic force decreases as the gap increases. Hence, typically, the <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> exerted by a conventional solenoid is small; depending upon the specific application, the <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> may even be insufficient to initiate closure. Whereas a conventional solenoid design provides for only one core, the proposed design calls for three cores, two of these being fixed to one another with a separate core between these two. Analysis shows that in comparison with conventional solenoids, the solenoids of the proposed design would not have a cost impact, could have longer operational lives, and exhibit larger forces in an open position. It was also reported that the proposed design could be extended to multiple-staged solenoid design, which would yield increased force {{in the middle of the}} stroke as well...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to identify {{the relationship between the}} starting requirements and the structure parameters of the diesel free piston linear alternator on the structural design stage. In this article, the forces applied on the moving part during the starting process are analyzed, and an oscillation model is established. The numerical simulation results of the oscillation model are presented, and the energy-transfer mechanism is analyzed. Then, the oscillation model is simplified by utilizing the energy balance theory. Expressions of the achieved starting frequency and required <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> are derived and the effects of different design variables on them are investigated. The results show that the achieved compression ratio is determined by the energy balance between the friction consumption and the energy supplied by the <b>starting</b> <b>force.</b> The starting frequency achieved and <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> required are associated with the cylinder bore, the moving mass, and effective stroke of the engine, which {{can be applied to the}} matching design and optimization of the prototype...|$|E

40|$|The frequencies, {{harmonic}} {{force field}} and absolute IR intensities for C 4 H 2 and C 4 D 2 are reported. The experimental harmonized frequencies obey the Teller—Redlich product rule very well. An approximate harmonic force field {{was obtained from}} a refinement procedure in which the starting values are adjusted in order to fit the experimental harmonized C 4 H 2 and C 4 D 2 frequencies. The <b>starting</b> <b>force</b> constant values {{were taken from the}} harmonic force field of propyne.

Two sets of ∂μ→/∂S values can be derived from the experimental intensities by use of an iterative least-squares fitting procedure. One final set can be selected by applying the isotopic invariance criterion and by comparing with the corresponding derivatives of propyne. The final ∂μ→/∂S values are reduced to bond-charge parameters and atomic charges.
