5|$|A {{doctor at}} Shanghai's Jing'an Hospital said that over 20 people {{injured in the}} fire had been admitted, many {{suffering}} from asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation. State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in <b>serious</b> <b>condition.</b> At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people {{were reported to have}} been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Mandela {{was briefly}} hospitalised with a {{respiratory}} infection, attracting international attention, before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012. After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, his lung infection recurred {{and he was}} briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in <b>serious</b> <b>condition.</b> The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela {{at the hospital and}} prayed with Machel, while Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day. In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, although his condition remained unstable.|$|E

5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a <b>serious</b> <b>condition</b> and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{effective}} antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV-positive {{individuals are}} {{at increased risk}} of <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> (cardiovascular, liver and renal disease, and cancers), perhaps due in part to ongoing inflammation and/or coagulation. To estimate the potential risk reduction in <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death from any cause that might be achieved with treatments that reduce inflammation and/or coagulation, we examined associations of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), D-dimer, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels with <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death in 3 large cohorts. In HIV-positive adults on suppressive ART, associations of IL- 6, D-dimer, and hsCRP levels at study entry with <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death were studied using Cox regression. Hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for age, gender, study, and regression dilution bias (due to within-person biomarker variability) were used to predict risk reductions in <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death associated with lower "usual" levels of IL- 6 and D-dimer. Over 4. 9 years of mean follow-up, 260 of the 3766 participants experienced <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death. IL- 6, D-dimer and hsCRP were each individually associated with risk of <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death, HR = 1. 45 (95 % CI: 1. 30 to 1. 63), 1. 28 (95 % CI: 1. 14 to 1. 44), and 1. 17 (95 % CI: 1. 09 to 1. 26) per 2 x higher biomarker levels, respectively. In joint models, IL- 6 and D-dimer were independently associated with <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death, with consistent results across the 3 cohorts and across serious non-AIDS event types. The association of IL- 6 and D-dimer with <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death was graded and persisted throughout follow-up. For 25 % lower "usual" IL- 6 and D-dimer levels, the joint biomarker model estimates a 37 % reduction (95 % CI: 28 to 46 %) in the risk of <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death if the relationship is causal. Both IL- 6 and D-dimer are independently associated with <b>serious</b> non-AIDS <b>conditions</b> or death among HIV-positive adults with suppressed virus. This suggests that treatments that reduce IL- 6 and D-dimer levels might substantially decrease morbidity and mortality in patients on suppressive ART. Clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis...|$|R
