500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E

60|$|Religious {{institutions}} are {{things to be}} legitimately distinguished from the creeds and cosmogonies with which one finds them associated. Customs are far more enduring things than ideas,--witness the mistletoe at Christmas, or the old lady turning her money in her pocket {{at the sight of}} the new moon. And the exact origin of a religious institution is of much less significance to us than its present effect. The theory of a religion may propose the attainment of Nirvana or the propitiation of an irascible Deity or a dozen other things as its end and aim; the practical fact is that it draws together great multitudes of diverse individualized people in a common solemnity and self-subordination however vague, and is so far, like the State, and in a manner far more intimate and emotional and fundamental than the State, a synthetic power. And in particular, the idea of the Catholic Church is charged with synthetic suggestion; it is in many ways an idea broader and finer than the constructive idea of any existing State. And just as the Beliefs I have adopted lead me to regard myself as in and of the existing State, such as it is, and working for its rectification and development, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a reasonable case for considering oneself in and of the Catholic Church and bound to work for its rectification and development; and this in spite of the fact that one may not feel justified in calling oneself a Christian in any sense of the term.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] he said, talking {{it over with}} several of his chums, [...] "that sooner or later we must have some {{fighting}} in Egypt. I cannot understand {{how it is that}} some of the regiments there have not long ago been sent down to Suakim. We have smashed up the Egyptian army, and it seems to me that as we are really masters of the place we are bound to protect the natives from these savage tribes who are attacking them down on the Red Sea and up in the Soudan. The Egyptians always managed them well enough until we disbanded their army. If Hicks Pasha had had, as he asked for, an English regiment or two with him, he would never have been smashed up by the Mahdi's people; and it seems to me awful that the garrisons of Sinkat and Tokar should be deserted when we have a lot of troops lying idle at Cairo, while Baker is trying in vain to get up a native force to march to their relief. I wish, instead of going to Egypt, we were going straight down to Suakim to help him. There is one thing, if Baker fails and Sinkat and Tokar fall into the hands of the natives, there will be such indignation that government will have to do something. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a very good chance of our seeing some active service there, which will be a thousand times better than sweltering in hot barracks in Cairo." ...|$|E

I mean, we're all human and we weren't born rock stars. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> an interesting story to tell of the pain and struggling.

60|$|SECONDLY, What death {{they must}} die? I answer, Not a {{corporeal}} one, but {{that which is}} mystically such. And I choose to understand it thus, because this suiteth best with their state and condition, which is mystical. Besides, thus did they (when they did overcome,) slay their enemies, even with the fire or sword of their mouth: 'If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed' (Rev 11:5). As therefore they went about to kill their enemies, so their enemies will kill them: But they sought to kill their enemies by their testimony, as to their antichristian spirit, and church-state; and their enemies will kill them, as to their Christian heat and fervency of mind; and also as to their Christian church-state. So that, (at least <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,)</b> <b>there</b> will be such ruins brought both upon the spirit of Christianity, and the true Christian church-state, before this Antichrist is destroyed, that there will for a time scarce be found a Christian spirit, or a true visible living church of Christ in the world: Nothing but the dead bodies of these will be to be seen of the nations; nor them neither, otherwise than as so many ruinous heaps. For the love that I bear to the church of Christ, I wish, as to this, I may prove a false prophet: But this looks so like the text, and also so like the dispensations of God with his church of old, that I cannot but {{think it will be}} so. For the text, I have spoken to that already; wherefore I will now present you with some things that look like parallel cases.|$|E
60|$|When {{the census}} of the {{population}} of Missouri was taken in 1860, the slaves amounted to ten per cent. of the whole number. In the Gulf States the slave population is about forty-five per cent. of the whole. In the three border States of Kentucky, Virginia, and Maryland, the slaves amount to thirty per cent. of the whole population. From these figures it will be seen that Missouri, which is comparatively a new slave State, has not gone ahead with slavery as the old slave States have done, although from its position and climate, lying as far south as Virginia, it might seem to have had the same reasons for doing <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is {{every reason to believe that}} slavery will die out in Missouri. The institution is not popular with the people generally; and as white labor becomes abundant--and before the war it was becoming abundant--men recognize the fact that the white man's labor is the more profitable. The heat in this State, in midsummer, is very great, especially in the valleys of the rivers. At St. Louis, on the Mississippi, it reaches commonly to ninety degrees, and very frequently goes above that. The nights, moreover, are nearly as hot as the days; but this great heat does not last for any very long period, and it seems that white men are able to work throughout the year. If correspondingly severe weather in winter affords any compensation to the white man for what of heat he endures during the summer, I can testify that such compensation is to be found in Missouri. When I was there we were afflicted with a combination of snow, sleet, frost, and wind, with a mixture of ice and mud, that makes me regard Missouri as the most inclement land into which I ever penetrated.|$|E

Elder for his book The Best Film You've Never Seen, director Neil LaBute explains his feelings on the film: “I was both intrigued and frustrated by what was happening. There’s this fractured telling of the story, several trips to Venice and the rest takes place in Venice, California. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was attraction to it by the frustration of it—like, ‘What’s happening here?

5000|$|When Ditka {{was hired}} as the {{head coach of the}} New Orleans Saints in 1997, he persuaded Stanfel, then 70 years old, to come out of {{retirement}} as the Saints' offensive line coach. Stanfel said at the time that it was his respect for Ditka that lured him back to coaching: [...] "I respect the man. He's a hell of a coach. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's an honest person and a fair man, and he asked me to come back[...] [...] [...] He's always been good to me, and we've coached a long time together.

He continued on, [...] "Everybody seems to have forgotten Scott. If you look back in the early days we won a lot of games with special teams and him kicking field goals. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> somewhere up there (the Wall) for Scott to be, but nobody wants to acknowledge him because he missed a kick. But as I recall, I missed some tackles in that game, Bruce missed some. Thurman dropped some balls and Jim threw interceptions, but nobody realizes that here is a guy that made major contributions to what this organization was about. It just irks me that people have forgotten him." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} {{to the introduction of}} proposed clean coal technology, Flannery has stated: [...] "Globally there has got to be some areas where clean coal will work out, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will always be a coal export industry Australia ...

5000|$|I {{think the}} {{economic}} arguments are clear. I think {{being part of}} a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues {{is that a lot of}} people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are definite benefits for us in economic terms.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} Leigh Whannell was asked [...] "If {{there is a}} fourth Insidious film, {{would that be a}} sequel to Chapter 3, another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline?" [...] Whannell stated: [...] "I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet. But {{for the purposes of this}} interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film. That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift, I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a lot of room there. We've kind of established Lin Shaye in this particular film as kind of this superhero, so that would be kind of interesting to explore in the other films." ...|$|E

He has said: [...] "I personally like to see these things in writing and codified." [...] He expressed a preference for the establishment of such a policy by the Department of Defense rather than the Obama administration: [...] "My view about government is you should always use those resources that are available to you first before you move up to the next level, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are a number of things we can do inside this building for the Department of Defense".

It was just a rough time of life right then, and I don't think I was in a very good frame of mind to make a record. You kind of hear it on that record, the songs aren't as good, the performances aren't as good. It was kind of experimental too, we were trying to do something else and it didn't really work.

I really don't know what they want from me. I've never really been able to write for them. I've only written and performed that which interests me. So essentially they have an agreement with me and that's great. I mean, I've lost audiences many times over the years, and they've come back again for one reason or another. I've sort of got that mutual agreement with them. If it's not going very well then they stay away. Which is fair enough, you know.|$|R

He also offered opportunity to collaborate in the future with WestJet should they need a regional Caribbean hub. According to the Barbados Advocate newspaper Sealy stated [...] "We are game if Westjet is interested, in becoming the regional hub for more of your business and we would certainly like to see not four flights a week, but eventually, if we can have a daily service.
