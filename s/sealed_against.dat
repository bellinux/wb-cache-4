5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} pressure inside the casing is maintained {{slightly higher than}} atmospheric pressure to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|After the Armistice with Germany, O-5 {{operated}} {{out of the}} Submarine School at New London, Connecticut until 1923. O-5 then {{sailed to}} Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, for a brief tour. On 28 October, as O-5 entered Limon Bay, preparatory to transiting the Panama Canal, she was rammed by the United Fruit Company steamer Abangarez and sank {{in less than a}} minute. Three men died; 16 others escaped Two crewmembers, Henry Breault and Lawrence Brown, were trapped in the forward torpedo room, which they <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> the flooding of the submarine. Local engineers and divers were able to rig cranes and other equipment and lift O-5 far enough off the bottom that the bow broke the surface, exposing a hatch which led to the compartment where the two men were trapped, allowing them to be freed. Henry Breault was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E

2500|$|Southey's major failing is that, with {{a spirit}} of free inquiry that he cannot {{suppress}} in himself, he attempts to suppress free inquiry in others. Yet, even in Southey's political writings, Hazlitt credits him as refraining from advocating what might be practised by [...] "those whose hearts are naturally callous to truth, and whose understandings are hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> all impressions but those of self-interest". He remains, after all, [...] "a reformist without knowing it. He does not advocate the slave-trade, he does not arm Mr. Malthus's revolting ratios with his authority, he does not strain hard to deluge Ireland with blood." ...|$|E

50|$|At first, the insert has a sealing function. With its o-ring on {{the pipe}} end side, the <b>sealing</b> <b>against</b> the pipe is achieved. The <b>sealing</b> <b>against</b> the {{connecting}} part {{is done by}} the F37-Seal or a bonded seal. If the connecting part has a soft seal on the face side, an insert with a flat face has to be used. For the connection of two pipes, an insert with cones on both sides, which are soft sealed by o-rings, can be used as well.|$|R

60|$|The {{room was}} not of very large dimensions, and every part was {{glittering}} with the collected light {{of half a dozen}} Candles, aided by the fierce rays that glanced from the grate, which held a most cheerful fire of sea-coal. The mouldings of the dark oak wainscoting threw back upon the massive table of mahogany streaks of strong light, which played among the rich fluids that were sparkling on the board in mimic haloes. The outline of this picture of comfort was formed by damask curtains of a deep red, and enormous oak chairs with leathern backs and cushioned seats, as if the apartment were hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> the world and its chilling cares.|$|E
60|$|She had, {{as we have}} hinted, {{travelled}} a {{good deal}} in foreign countries; for a brother, to whom she was much attached, had been sent upon various missions of national importance to the Continent, and she had more than once embraced the opportunity of accompanying him. This furnished a great addition to the information which she could supply, especially during the last war, when the Continent was {{for so many years}} hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> the English nation. But, besides, Mrs. Bethune Baliol visited different countries, not in the modern fashion, when English travel in caravans together, and see in France and Italy little besides the same society which they might have enjoyed at home. On the contrary, she mingled when abroad with the natives of those countries she visited, and enjoyed at once the advantage of their society, and the pleasure of comparing it with that of Britain.|$|E
60|$|He {{unlocked}} the iron door, and lit the hanging lamp {{that was used}} in all-night sittings on steamer days. It revealed a smartly furnished office, with a high desk for his clerks, and a smaller one for himself in one corner. In the centre of the wall stood a large safe. This he also unlocked and took out a few important books, as well as a small drawer containing gold coin and dust to the amount of about five hundred dollars, the large balance having been deposited in bank on the previous day. The act was only precautionary, as he did not exhibit any haste in removing them to a place of safety, and remained meditatively absorbed in looking over a packet of papers taken from the same drawer. The closely shuttered building, almost hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> light, and perhaps sound, prevented his observing the steadily increasing light of the conflagration, or hearing the nearer tumult of the firemen, and the invasion of his quiet district by other equally solicitous tenants. The papers seemed also to possess some importance, for, the stillness being suddenly broken by the turning of the handle of the heavy door he had just closed, and its opening with difficulty, his first act was to hurriedly conceal them, without apparently paying a thought to the exposed gold before him. And his expression and attitude in facing round towards the door was quite as much of nervous secretiveness as of indignation at the interruption.|$|E
50|$|The {{spring in}} {{the rim of the}} {{diaphragm}} forms a <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> the vaginal walls. The diaphragm covers the cervix, and physically prevents sperm from entering the uterus through the os.|$|R
50|$|A simpler valve appears {{similar to}} the venturi valve, but works by the float principle. These are simple poppet valves, {{operating}} by direct float action and <b>sealing</b> <b>against</b> the upper valve seat.|$|R
50|$|A Wills Ring is an O-ring in {{the form}} of a hollow {{metallic}} tube. They are pressurised internally by gas pressure The advantages of this construction are that the rings can <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> a wide range of conditions. Metallic construction makes them robust against high or low temperatures and chemical attack. Softer coatings may be applied to provide even better compatibility, or to <b>seal</b> <b>against</b> roughly machined surfaces. Internal pressurisation makes them compliant, both for the range of movement required and with their speed of response being faster than elastomeric O-rings. Their flexure is also unaffected by temperature.|$|R
6000|$|... "Turn, now, {{to other}} {{indications}} of {{the employment of}} a vigor most marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses--very thick tresses--of grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You {{are aware of the}} great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp--sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L'Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police {{for the same reason that}} the breadth of the shutters escaped them--because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.|$|E
60|$|Applause and pity {{from the}} fickle and forgetful the Prince had won, but his {{condition}} was now desperate. Refusing {{to accept a}} pension from France, he was poor; his jewels he had pawned for the Scottish expedition. He had disobeyed his father's commands and mortally offended Louis by refusing to leave France. His adherents in Paris (as their letters to Rome prove) were in despair. His party, as has been shown, was broken up into hostile camps. Lochiel was dead. Lord George Murray had been insulted and estranged. The Earl Marischal had declined Charles's invitation to manage his affairs (1747). Elcho was a persistent and infuriated dun. Clancarty was reviling Charles, James, Louis, England, and the world at large. Madame de Pompadour, Cardinal Tencin, and de Puysieux were all hostile. The English Jacobites, though loyal, were timid. Europe was hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>against</b> the Prince. Refuge in Fribourg, where the English threatened the town, Charles had refused. Not a single shelter was open to him, for England's policy was to drive him into the dominions of the Pope, {{where he would be}} distant and despised. Of advisers he had only such attached friends as Henry Goring, Bulkeley, Harrington, or such distrusted boon companions as Kelly--against whom the English Jacobites set all wheels in motion. Charles's refuge at Avignon even was menaced by English threats directed at the Pope. The Prince tried to amuse himself; he went to dances, he introduced boxing matches, {41a} just as years before he had brought golf into Italy. But his position was untenable, and he disappeared.|$|E

25|$|Although in two {{dimensions}} the seal system of a Wankel {{looks to be}} even simpler {{than that of a}} corresponding multi-cylinder piston engine, in three dimensions the opposite is true.
