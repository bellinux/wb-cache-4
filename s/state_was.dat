5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC <b>State</b> <b>was</b> able to acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line.

After a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby Crumpler for 24yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled for a big loss, losing some of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC <b>State</b> <b>was</b> unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} qubit channels for which three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> always sufficient to achieve the Holevo capacity. For these channels {{it is known that}} there are cases where two orthogonal <b>states</b> <b>are</b> sufficient, two non-orthogonal <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required, or three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> necessary. Here a systematic theory is given which provides criteria to distinguish cases where two <b>states</b> <b>are</b> sufficient, and determine whether these two <b>states</b> should <b>be</b> orthogonal or non-orthogonal. In addition, we prove a theorem on the form of the optimal ensemble when three <b>states</b> <b>are</b> required, and present efficient methods of calculating the Holevo capacity.
