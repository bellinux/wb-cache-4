5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> <b>virus,</b> has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} first {{identified}} in rodents collected in 2004 {{as part of}} a survey of wild mammals at Playa de Oro in Manzanillo, Colima, western Mexico. The discovery was published in 2008 by Yong-Kyu Chu and colleagues. Among 600 small mammals, antibodies against the hantavirus <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> <b>virus</b> were found in 23 individuals (out of 358 studied) of Oryzomys couesi, a rice rat that was the most common species found, six (out of 87) of the cotton rat Sigmodon mascotensis, and one (out of 77) of the pygmy mouse Baiomys musculus. In addition, twelve O.couesi and one S.mascotensis yielded hantavirus RNA. Viruses were found in males more often than in females. Because the amino acid sequences in sequenced parts of the virus's genome differed by as much as 7 to 10% from closely related hantaviruses, Chu and colleagues identified the virus found at Playa de Oro as a new species, called Playa de Oro virus or OROV. Although the authors could not prove that the virus fulfilled all the criteria for identifying a new virus species, they argued that it was likely that it did fulfill those criteria. It is currently treated as a probable species in the Hantavirus genus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman MxA {{protein is}} a type I interferon-inducible intracytoplasmic protein, which mediates {{antiviral}} actions against a variety of negative-strand RNA viruses including influenza A, measles, and vesicular stomatitis viruses. Recently, {{it has also been}} shown that several members of theBunyaviridaefamily are inhibited by MxA protein. The hantavirus genus in theBunyaviridaefamily includes important human pathogenic viruses, e. g., Puumala (PUUV), Hantaan, and <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> <b>viruses.</b> Tula virus (TULV) is a new member of the genus, but its pathogenicity in man remains to be determined. As assumed by the similarities in replication strategy, MxA would be a good candidate molecule for antiviral action against these viruses, also. To gain more insight into the MxA action on PUUV, we studied PUUV and TULV replication in stably MxA gene-transfected Vero cells. We show that MxA protein has the capacity to inhibit both viral protein and RNA accumulation in virus-infected cells. We also studied PUUV and TULV infection in MxA-transfected U- 937 cell clones. In these cell lines both hantaviruses grew poorly, independent of whether the cells were expressing MxA or not. Whether cell line-specific differences in the antiviral activity of MxA protein against hantaviruses exist cannot be conclusively determined {{due to the lack of}} productive infection of PUUV and TULV in U- 937 cells...|$|R
40|$|Systemic in¯ammation {{is common}} in {{patients}} with nephropathia epidemica (NE), a Euro-pean form of hemorrhagic fever. Markers of in¯ammation were studied in a patient with NE with respiratory insuf®ciency (patient 1), 18 other patients with NE, and 13 patients with a viral infectious disease other than NE. Neutrophil and monocyte CD 11 b expression levels, determined by ¯ow cytometry; soluble interleukin (IL) ± 2 receptor (sIL- 2 R), IL- 6, and IL- 8 concentrations, determined by means of Immulite; and soluble E-selectin, determined by ELISA, were higher in patients with NE than in healthy subjects. The ®ndings were not speci®c for NE and did not correlate with serum creatinine levels, but the ®ndings correlated inversely with mean arterial pressure (sIL- 2 R and monocyte CD 11 b expression) and minimum platelet count (sIL- 2 R, IL- 6, neutrophil, and monocyte CD 11 b expression). Monocyte CD 11 b ex-pression in patient 1 was extremely high, suggesting that monocytes may contribute to de-velopment of lung injury. Severity of in¯ammation in patients with NE is related to hypo-tension and platelet consumption but not to renal injury.

40|$|AbstractSegment reassortment of {{negative}} strand viruses {{is an important}} mechanism {{for the development of}} new virus strains with altered pathogenicity. This study reports on in vitro generation of reassortants between Andes (ANDV) and <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> (SNV) <b>viruses.</b> Although they both cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), ANDV is the only hantavirus that has been transmitted from person to person (Enria et al., 1996, Medicina (B Aires) 56, 709; Padula et al., 1998, Virology 241, 323). Following dual infection of cells with ANDV and SNV, 8. 9 % of 337 progeny plaques contained reassortants, of which 66 % were diploid, and 34 % were monoploid. The monoploid reassortants contained the S and L segments of SNV and ANDV M segment. Analysis of replication of the monoploid reassortant indicated its efficiency was similar to ANDV rather than SNV. Results described in this study illustrate the ability to rapidly generate new hantavirus genotypes between genetically unrelated viruses by gene reassortment and provide a tool to dissect the pathogenesis of these important viruses...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunologic}} {{responses that}} mediate viral clearance of and recovery from hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) due to <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> (SN) <b>virus</b> are unknown. Serial serum samples from 26 patients with acute SN virus infection were tested for IgG, IgA, and IgM reactivity to recombinant viral nucleocapsid (N) and glycoprotein G 1 antigens by a novel strip immunoblot assay. The titers of antibodies capable of neutralizing SN virus in vitro also were determined for each sample.

40|$|AbstractGenetic reassortment {{has been}} shown to play an {{important}} role in the evolution of several segmented RNA viruses and in the epidemiology of associated diseases. <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> (SN) <b>virus</b> is the cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome throughout the western United States. Like other hantaviruses, it possesses a genome consisting of three negative-sense RNA segments, S, M, and L. Recent analysis has demonstrated the presence of at least three different hantaviruses in Nevada and eastern California, including SN, Prospect Hill-like, and El Moro Canyon-like viruses. In addition, two distinct lineages of SN virus can be found inPeromyscus maniculatusrodents (sometimes in close proximity) trapped at study sites in this region. Data obtained by phylogenetic analysis of sequence differences detected among the S, M, and L genome segments of these SN viruses are consistent with reassortment having taken place between SN virus genetic variants. The results suggest that M (and to a lesser extent S or L) genome segment flow occurs within SN virus populations inP. maniculatusin this region. No reassortment was detected between SN virus and other hantavirus types present in the area. This finding suggests that as genetic distance increases, the frequency of formation of viable reassortants decreases, or that hantaviruses which are primarily maintained in different rodent hosts rarely have the opportunity to genetically interact...|$|R
40|$|This study reports {{completion}} of the genetic characterization of the entire genome of <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> (SN) <b>virus</b> (NMH 10) detected in autopsy tissues from a patient who died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The large (L) genome segment {{was found to be}} 6, 562 nucleotides in length and encoded a putative L polymerase that was 2, 153 amino acids in length. No evidence of segment reassortment with other well-characterized hantaviruses was obtained.

Only 16 nucleotide differences were detected between the virus genomes, and none of these resulted in virus protein amino acid substitutions. Determination of the exact 5 '- and 3 '-terminal sequences of all genome segments of SN virus and representatives of other serologic groups in the Hantavirus genus, family Bunyaviridae, showed the existence of conserved nucleotide domains that may be involved in important regulatory mechanisms, such as RNA encapsidation, polymerase binding, and control of transcription and replication...|$|R
40|$|To address <b>Sin</b> <b>Nombre</b> (SN) <b>virus</b> {{persistence}} in deer mice, we sacrificed experimentally infected deer mice at eight time points from day 21 to day 217 postinoculation (p. i.) and examined their tissues for viral nucleocapsid (N) antigen expression and both negative-strand (genomic) and positive-strand (replicative/mRNA) viral S segment RNA titers. All {{the animals that}} we inoculated developed persistent infections, and SN virus could be isolated from tissues {{throughout the course of}} infection. The transition from an acute to a persistent pattern of infection appeared to occur between days 60 and 90 p. i. Beginning on day 60 p. i., the heart, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and lung retained antigen expression and genomic viral RNA the most frequently. We found a statistically significant association among the presence of replicative RNA in the heart, lung, and BAT, widespread antigen expression (in ≥ 5 tissues), and RNA viremia. Of these three tissues, the heart retained negative-strand RNA and viral N antigen the most consistently (in 25 of 26 animals). During persistence, there were two distinct patterns of infection: restricted versus disseminated tissue involvement. Mice with the restricted pattern exhibited N antigen expression in ≤ 3 tissues, an absence of viral RNA in the blood, neutralizing antibody titers of ≤ 1 : 1, 280 (P = 0. 01), and no replicative RNA in the heart, lung, or BAT. Those with the “disseminated” pattern showed N antigen expression in ≥ 5 tissues, neutralizing antibody titers of 1 : 160 to 1 : 20, 480, replicative RNA in the heart, lung, and BAT at a high frequency, and RNA viremia. Virus could be isolated consistently only from mice that demonstrated the disseminated pattern. The heart, lung, and BAT are important sites for the replication and maintenance of SN virus during persistent infection...|$|R
