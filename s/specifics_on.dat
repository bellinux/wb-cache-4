5|$|Utilizing his findings, Gray {{developed}} an objective, statistical forecast for seasonal hurricane activity; he predicted only {{the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes, foregoing <b>specifics</b> <b>on</b> tracks and potential landfalls due to the aforementioned inconsistencies. Gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season, which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and Caribbean basin sea-level pressures. The endeavor proved modestly successful. He subsequently issued forecasts ahead of {{the start of the}} Atlantic hurricane season in May and before the peak of the season in August. Students and colleagues joined his forecast team in the following years, including Christopher Landsea, Paul W. Mielke Jr., and Kenneth J. Berry.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a low gate source voltage (Vgs) N-LDMOS element that is fully {{operational}} at a CMOS Logic Gate voltage (3. 3 or 5 V) realized using the 0. 35 µm BCDMOS process. The basic structure of the N-LDMOS element presented here has a Low Vgs LDMOS structure to which the thickness of a logic gate oxide is applied. Additional modification {{has been carried out}} in order to obtain features of an improved breakdown voltage and a <b>specific</b> <b>on</b> resistance (Rsp). A N-LDMOS element can be developed with improved features of breakdown voltage and <b>specific</b> <b>on</b> resistance, which is an important criterion for power elements by means of using a proper structure and appropriate process modification. In this paper, the structure has been made to withstand the excessive electrical field on the drain side by applying the double gate oxide structure to the channel area, to improve the <b>specific</b> <b>on</b> resistance in addition to providing a sufficient breakdown voltage margin. It is shown that the resulting modified N-LDMOS structure with the feature of the <b>specific</b> <b>on</b> resistance is improved by 31 %, and so it is expected that optimized power efficiencies and the size-effectiveness can be obtained.

The wounds sustained were ambulatory, meaning U.S. forces conducting the mission were able to take themselves off the battlefield, according to Pentagon spokesperson, Capt. Jeff Davis. Some reports indicate that two of the wounded Navy SEALs suffered injuries to their arms and were flown to a hospital in Djibouti. These reports were not confirmed by US officials.|$|E

25|$|The {{synthesis}} of bacterial cellulose is a multistep process that involve two main mechanisms: the {{synthesis of}} uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPGIc), followed by the polymerization of glucose into long and unbranched chains (the β-1→4 glucan chain). <b>Specifics</b> <b>on</b> the cellulose synthesis has been extensively documented. The former mechanism is well known while the latter still needs exploring. The production of UDPGIc starts with carbon compounds (such as hexoses, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and dicarboxylic acids) entering the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, or the pentose phosphate cycle depending on what carbon source is available. It then goes through phosphorylation along with catalysis, followed by isomerization of the intermediate, and {{a process known as}} UDPGIc pyrophosphorylase to convert the compounds into UDPGIc, a precursor to the production of cellulose. The polymerization of glucose into the β-1→4 glucan chain has been hypothesized to either involve a lipid intermediate or not to involve a lipid intermediate, though structural enzymology studies and in vitro experiments indicate that polymerization can occur by direct enzymatic transfer of a glucosyl moiety from a nucleotide sugar to the growing polysaccharide. A. xylinum usually converts carbon compounds into cellulose with around 50% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy has {{periodically}} {{monitored the}} environmental {{conditions of the}} site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. nuclear-powered ships and boats. The reports provide <b>specifics</b> <b>on</b> the environmental sampling of sediment, water, and marine life that is done to ascertain whether the submarine has significantly affected the deep-ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting this deep sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm {{that there has been}} no significant effect on the environment. The nuclear fuel aboard the submarine remains intact and no uranium in excess of levels expected from the fallout from past atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has been detected by the Navy's inspections. In addition, Scorpion carried two nuclear-tipped Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedoes (ASTOR) when she was lost. The warheads of these torpedoes are part of the environmental concern. The most likely scenario is that the plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking, and they remain at or close to their original location inside the torpedo room of the boat. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} took action into regulating the migrant service business by imposing {{a law in}} 2009 aiming for more control on “Migrant Workers Offices,” the law simply demands that such an office would register in the ministry of labour; the law emphasizes on the business owner to be a Lebanese citizen with no previous criminal record. It mentions as well {{the need to provide}} a location for the workers to stay in, moreover it is not allowed for the business or its clients to abuse the workers and should there be any disputes, they should be reported to the ministry or the appropriate legal entities. Finally, the law identifies the rights of the worker to days off and the responsibility of the office to return the worker within three months of arrival in Lebanon in case the workers refuse to work, escaped from their working place or in case of pregnancy; the law gives more <b>specifics</b> <b>on</b> the duties of the office with regards to the working states of the workers in Lebanon. Other measurements taken by the government of Lebanon includes adding more regulations to the process of bringing foreign workers into the country. The measurements apply on workers from the state of Madagascar, where no office is allowed to bring workers from Madagascar without the approval of the consulate of Madagascar in Lebanon. The offices then are obliged to present the approval document and the application paper to the ministry of labour.|$|E

The Soviets initially proposed to have their bases in Vilnius, Kaunas, Alytus, Ukmergė, and Šiauliai.
