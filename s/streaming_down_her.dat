500|$|The video {{features}} Aguilera with [...] "strawberry-blonde" [...] hair. It {{begins with}} a close-up of a gun barrel. Then, she slowly walks through a [...] "deserted" [...] bedroom and lies down in the room, which is filled with charcoal, while crying. She is seen with mascara <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. As the scene moves on, Aguilera is fighting against a shirtless man, who is considered her lover. The clip ends as Aguilera takes off her shirt in an [...] "Inception-like dreamworld". Critical response to [...] "You Lost Me" [...] video was positive: Latina writer Mariela Rosario and UK magazine OK! noted that the clip was a comeback by Aguilera following the video for Bionic lead single [...] "Not Myself Tonight". Monica Hererra from Billboard also thought that it represents [...] "a kind of return to form for Aguilera". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Brad Wete thought that the video for [...] "You Lost Me" [...] "has some quality material". Similarly, MTV Buzzworthy's Chris Ryan complimented {{it as one of}} Aguilera's best videos ever.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} pilot {{script was}} darker in tone {{than the one}} filmed. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN [...] "credit" [...] as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices. There was also a lengthy debate as to whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually consented. In the aired version of the episode, Lilly Kane was found by the pool {{in the same spot}} where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly's body was originally going {{to be found in the}} ocean, and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly's body being dumped. When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, the network felt that it was [...] "too dark and creepy" [...] for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter's body to protect his son, and the idea was changed. Much of the series' scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego. During the filming of the pilot, producer Paul Kurta said that much of the filming would take place in Oceanside, California. Kurta liked that it was [...] "a seaside town that still feels like middle-class people live there ... Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven." [...] The setting of Neptune High, which was featured in the first two seasons, was also located in Oceanside. The school, Oceanside High School, was paid $7,750 by Stu Segall Productions for the use of the campus and extras. When Thomas watched the final cut of the scene in which Veronica realizes that she has been raped, Thomas thought that he had cast the role correctly. [...] "I’m watching her from the monitor, and tears start <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face, and I’m just like, 'Holy shit! We have a star!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gloria Foster died on September 29, 2001, at age 67. The {{cause of}} her death was diabetes. Though {{she was no longer}} married, her ex-husband, Clarence Williams III, was the one to {{announce}} her death. [...] A memorial was held at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn on October 15, 2001. Many of her close friends and actors and actresses who had performed with her came to attend the funeral. [...] Judith Rutherford James, a well-known producer and good friend who worked with Foster on In White America and Having Our Say played a huge part in the memorial service and helped to oversee that it ran smoothly. [...] Many of the speeches given at the service showed and spoke about how Gloria Foster not only played her part, but also embodied the character, both emotionally and physically. [...] Martin Duberman, the author of In White America, told the audience that, [...] "she embodied it. [...] At the end of the scene each night, there were tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face, her body was trembling, but her dignity was intact...Foster had to be covered with blankets in order to calm her shaking".|$|E
60|$|Fay's {{hands clasped}} Shefford's in strong, {{trembling}} pressure; the tears <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> white cheeks; a tragic and eloquent joy convulsed her face.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Martha {{stood on}} the piazza ready to receive the boys, and when she beheld Tom's pale face the tears <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "But Ralph {{was my only}} child! And {{his father}} gone, too!" [...] and Mrs. Nelson heaved a deep sigh, while the tears <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks anew.|$|R
60|$|And {{she began}} to laugh hysterically with tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Annabel {{clutched}} her sister's hands. The tears were <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face, {{her voice was}} thick with sobs.|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} again opened, and Greta flew in, her cheeks flushed, her hair {{floating}} behind her, and tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Her {{cheeks were}} flushed, and <b>her</b> wet hair <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> back. She was barefooted, a fact which {{she tried to}} conceal by leaning forward a little.|$|R
60|$|The major was not mistaken. With a {{swelling}} heart, but smiling countenance, {{his sister}} threw herself into his arms, when she kissed and was kissed until the tears <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|She sunk {{back in her}} chair, exhausted; {{the tears}} <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. Her companions hovered round her, {{not knowing what to}} make of this sudden dawn of reason. Her lover sobbed aloud. She opened her eyes again, and looked upon them with an air of the sweetest acknowledgment. [...] "You are all so good to me!" [...] said she, faintly.|$|R
6000|$|... "When you {{described}} the young man, I {{thought of my}} poor boy, didn't I, Julia?" [...] cries the mother, with tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a commotion}} {{at one side}} of the room, the arras parted, and Eleanor, Queen of England, {{staggered}} toward the throne, tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> pale cheeks.|$|E
60|$|The {{tears were}} already <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks, {{and this was}} too much. She flung her arms about his neck and sobbed on his bosom with the abandon of girlish grief.|$|E
60|$|Morris {{released}} him, and {{he crawled}} to a sitting posture. Mrs. Miner fell {{on her knees}} by his side, and began wiping the blood from his face. She was breathless with sobbing {{and the children were}} screaming. The tears <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face, which was white and drawn into ghastly wrinkles.|$|R
60|$|Shefford wheeled as if a {{powerful}} force had turned him on a pivot. He saw Fay Larkin. She seemed to be almost running. She was unhooded and <b>her</b> bright hair <b>streamed</b> <b>down.</b> <b>Her</b> swift, lithe action was without its usual grace. She looked wild, and she almost fell crossing the stepping-stones of the brook.|$|R
60|$|Harry did so, and as {{they stood}} {{watching}} her the schooner slued round until she was almost beam to wind. The sea <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> weather side, which rose up like a wall, and Frank could see her wheel behind the low deckhouse jerking to and fro. There {{was no sign of}} life anywhere on board her.|$|R
60|$|With {{the tears}} <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face, {{she put her}} two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there.|$|E
6000|$|Hurrying {{out into}} the yard, I saw my mother {{standing}} {{a few yards from}} the door, her sweet face distorted, the tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. [...] "What is it, mother?" [...] I called out.|$|E
6000|$|Pointing to her parents, they implored her {{for their}} sake to recant. Pale as death, and with tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks, {{she shook her}} head quietly. [...] "I cannot deny the Lord who died for me," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|Up on the {{platform}} Nola, the daughter of Menecreta, smiled at the world through a few lingering tears. She was very happy now that her golden hair was allowed to <b>stream</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, {{and that it was}} only because the praefect had so ordered it that the low price of twenty aurei would be accepted for her.|$|R
50|$|Over the 1889-90 season Seymour toured America as {{a dancer}} with Professor Hermann's Transatlantiques Vaudevilles company. During the tour one American press release {{described}} Seymour as having hair that <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> shoulders like rivers of gold. and another declared Dainty Katie Seymour dances like a fairy or butterfly. By July 1890 {{she was a member}} of the Bank Holiday Company at London's Oxford Music Hall.|$|R
60|$|Bud knelt before her, and, while tears <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> little face, {{she told}} her errand, and pleaded earnestly that the exiled Fairies might be forgiven, and not be left to pine far from their friends and kindred. And as she prayed, many wept with her; and when she ceased, {{and waited for her}} answer, many knelt beside her, praying {{forgiveness}} for the unhappy Elves.|$|R
60|$|When she arose, he, {{looking on}} the ground all the time, saw {{suddenly}} sprinkled on the black wet beech-roots many scarlet carnation petals, like splashed drops of blood; and red, small splashes fell from her bosom, <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> dress to her feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just had}} to come," [...] she said, and then she caught Tom and held him tightly. The tears were <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks, and the others had to turn away. [...] "Oh, Tom! Tom!" [...] she murmured, over and over again.|$|E
60|$|On {{returning}} to the cave he found that Madame Duchesne had wakened from her long sleep. She was, however, quite unconscious; her eyes were opened, and she was muttering rapidly to herself. Myra was sitting beside her with the tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Jessy, {{standing}} where {{the light of a}} big lamp <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> upon <b>her</b> through the boughs of a leafless maple, bade Vane farewell at her brother's gate.|$|R
60|$|Miss Emmerson said no more, but {{she turned}} an {{expressive}} {{look on her}} ward, which Julia was too much occupied with her thoughts to notice. The illness of her father, {{and the prospect of}} a long separation from her sister, were too much for the fortitude of Katherine at any time, and hastily gathering her work in her hand, she left the room just in time to prevent the tears which <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks from meeting the eyes of her companions.|$|R
60|$|As he {{continued}} speaking, Agatha {{had risen from}} her seat, and she was now kneeling {{at the foot of}} his bed, hiding her face between her hands, and the tears were <b>streaming</b> fast <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God you {{are both}} safe, dears!" [...] she exclaimed with tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. [...] "I {{thought of you}} {{in the middle of it}} all; but I was sure that Monsieur Sandwith would see what was being done and would get you away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hist!', {{her husband}} hastily {{interrupted}} her, {{as the door}} opened, and Sylvie and Bruno came in, with their arms twined lovingly round each other--Bruno sobbing convulsively, with his face hidden on his sister's shoulder, and Sylvie more grave and quiet, but with tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the crowd}} had turned away, Dr. Arrowsmith {{made his way to}} the point where Ruth had been standing. Somewhat to his {{surprise}} he found her still on her feet. She was leaning back in the corner with her eyes closed, and the tears <b>streaming</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Miller, in his emotion, was {{squeezing}} the handkerchief hard, {{and a cold}} <b>stream</b> was running <b>down</b> <b>her</b> neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{course it}} would, at laist I suppose so; but Martin," [...] {{and she smiled}} faintly as she looked up into his face, [...] "I want the two dear, dear girls, and I want {{yourself}} to have some little thing to remember me by; and your dear kind mother,--she doesn't want money, but if I ask her {{to take a few}} of the silver things in the house, I'm sure she'll keep them for my sake. Oh, Martin! I do love you all so very--so very much!" [...] and the warm tears <b>streamed</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|Her lashes fell again, and {{the tears}} began to <b>stream</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. She knew the worst now. His face had {{convinced}} her. She could not tell him the grounds of her belief-that every time he had said, [...] "I don't {{like to see a}} woman do -this or that," [...] or, [...] "I like to see a woman fix up around the house," [...] she had considered his words in the light of courtship, believing that in such ways the Yankees made love. So she stood suffering dumbly while he loaded his cream can and stood by the wheel ready to mount his wagon.|$|R
