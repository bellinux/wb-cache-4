The change in flow in flowing testing mode was realized by adjusting the choke, and the shut-in time in transition was negligible.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a study undertaken to appraise spatially complex hydrocarbon reservoir models constructed {{with the use}} of 3 D post-stack seismic data and well logs. Developments are centered about the interpretation of data acquired in an active gas field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The availability of time records of fluid production provides an independent way to quantify the accuracy and reliability of several methods commonly employed to construct reservoir models. We make use of geostatistical inversion to construct spatial distributions of porosity and permeability that honor well logs and 3 D post-stack seismic data in the inter-well region. The constructed reservoir models are compared against models constructed with standard geostatistical procedures that do not make use of seismic data. Multi-phase fluid-flow simulation is performed to assess the consistency of the constructed reservoir models against the existing time record of flow rates of gas/water and <b>shut-in</b> <b>well</b> pressures. For the field study under consideration, it is found that geostatistical inversion consistently yields the closest match to dynamic measurements of reservoir pressure and fluid production...|$|E

At first it was developed slowly, because of difficulties in drilling and keeping wells productive, but as ever-richer reservoirs were revealed {{in the next two}} decades it gradually {{became one of the most}} productive fields in the state. A mature field in decline, estimated reserves have dwindled to 2.3 million barrels, less than one percent of the total produced in the preceding century. A total of 243 wells remained active, although a field revitalization program commenced by ERG Resources in 2011 intends to extend the field's lifetime by extracting reserves previously considered unrecoverable.

40|$|AbstractEarly kick {{detection}} is {{of great}} concern while drilling wells. The late kick detection can lead to uncontrolled blowout which increases the possibility of injury and potential lose of life and equipment. Causes of kick {{and the importance of}} early kick detection are introduced. Kick detection from mud logging real time data and kick detection in the offshore Nile Delta are discussed. Limitation of the conventional well control procedure in low permeable formation is introduced. A comparison between gas parameters warning sign and drilling parameters warning sign was carried out. A new advanced early kick detection method is proposed based on more than 10 years of experience in monitoring real time mud logging data while drilling and analyzing flow and kick reports. The proposed advanced early kick detection method uses additional accurate flow check using trip tank and recommends adding two additional accurate pressure sensors while <b>shut-in</b> <b>well.</b> The proposed method has a great advantage using gas parameters which can detect near-balance state before kick occur. The advanced kick detection method does not require any rig equipment modification nor interfere with any drilling operation.

40|$|Blocking of {{petroleum}} producing pipelines with clathrate hydrates of natural gases {{is a large}} issue in the industry. It causes loss of income in addition with health, safety and environmental concerns. This master thesis considers inhibition and dissociation of clathrate hydrates of natural gases with the thermodynamic inhibitor potassium formate. Potassium formate is a salt frequently used during drilling operations, but the writer has not found information about the usage of the salt as a thermodynamic inhibitor in petroleum production. Its application as a thermodynamic inhibitor is of large interest due to its properties, especially for shut-in wells as the salt is considered very heavy and has a large solubility in water. The distribution of the salts sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium formate (HCOOK) in a two-meter vertical pipe was investigated to simulate a <b>shut-in</b> <b>well</b> or riser. The salt solutions {{were added to the}} top of the distilled water filled pipe. Pycnometers were used to measure the brine densities at different heights in the pipe. Higher densities corresponded with more salt. The hypothesis about the heavy HCOOK salt accumulating at the bottom of the pipe was not confirmed, when it was found that both salts became almost homogeneously dispersed in the pipe after short time for all brine concentrations investigated. It means that the salt would inhibit the whole water phase and not only the lower or upper part, as the conventional hydrate inhibitors in the petroleum industry are known to do. Potassium formate s quick distribution to a homogeneous mix could improve flow assurance in production wells. It is an advantage for producing wells to have a homogeneous salt distribution, because the whole water phase gets protected against hydrates. But it is a disadvantage for hydrate dissociation in the bottom a pipe if the inhibitor should be used to penetrate the water phase and accumulate at the bottom to dissociate hydrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to evaluate the feasibility of carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) sequestration in Texas low-rank coals and to determine the potential for enhanced coalbed methane (CBM) recovery as an added benefit of sequestration. The main objective for this reporting period was to perform pressure transient testing to determine permeability of deep Wilcox coal to use as additional, necessary data for modeling performance of CO{sub 2 } sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. To perform permeability testing of the Wilcox coal, we worked with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in selecting the well and intervals to test and in designing the pressure transient test. Anadarko agreed {{to allow us to}} perform permeability tests in coal beds in an existing <b>shut-in</b> <b>well</b> (Well APCT 2). This well is located in the region of the Sam K. Seymour power station, a site that we earlier identified as a major point source of CO{sub 2 } emissions. A service company, Pinnacle Technologies Inc. (Pinnacle) was contracted to conduct the tests in the field. Intervals tested were 2 coal beds with thicknesses of 3 and 7 feet, respectively, at approximately 4, 100 ft depth in the Lower Calvert Bluff Formation of the Wilcox Group in east-central Texas. Analyses of pressure transient test data indicate that average values for coalbed methane reservoir permeability in the tested coals are between 1. 9 and 4. 2 mD. These values are in {{the lower end of the}} range of permeability used in the preliminary simulation modeling. These new coal fracture permeability data from the APCT 2 well, along with the acquired gas compositional analyses and sorption capacities of CO{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }, and N{sub 2 }, complete the reservoir description phase of the project. During this quarter we also continued work on reservoir and economic modeling to evaluate performance of CO{sub 2 } sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery...|$|E

The cumulative oil production for this particular well was 62  m 3 for this particular month.

30|$|Water {{production}} {{is the main}} problem in oil/gas well operations as reservoirs mature (Seright 2003; Bai et al. 2008). Veil et al. (2004) reported that {{nearing the end of}} oil/gas production lives, water production can be 98  % of the material brought to the surface. Water production makes oil/gas wells unproductive and economically wasteful, which can cause early <b>shut-in</b> <b>wells</b> and decreased oil/gas production. Also, more water production can increase the costs of removing both scale and corrosion, and separating water from hydrocarbon. These costs increase as the water production increases (Dalrymple 1997). Worldwide, approximately three barrels of water are produced daily with each barrel of oil (Wiedeman 1996; Bailey et al. 2000). The situation is even worse in the United States, where more than 10 barrels of water are produced for each barrel of oil (Nemec 2014). Bailey et al. (2000) reported that the cost of treating and removing the surplus water {{production is}} expected to be 40  billion U.S. dollars (USD) globally. Hence, conformance control treatments and water shut-off are important in the oil industry.|$|R
50|$|The aim of oil {{operations}} is to complete all tasks {{in a safe}} and efficient manner without detrimental effects to the environment. This aim can only be achieved if control of the well is maintained at all times. The understanding of pressure and pressure relationships is important in preventing blowouts.

40|$|Operation and {{drilling}} in highly fractured carbonate formations {{are associated with}} several challenges. Some of the main challenges include large/total losses of drilling fluids, loss of hydrostatic pressure and gas influxes. One of the modern drilling technologies that provides a solution, is Pressurized Mud Cap Drilling (PMCD). The main principle of PMCD is to drill with a cheap sacrificial fluid that is forced into the fractured formation along with all cuttings. Nothing is circulated back to surface. The annulus is filled with a fluid designed to cause underbalanced pressure, which encourages influx of gas. When the pressure at the surface rises to a certain level due to gas migration, bullheading is used to force the kick {{back down into the}} formation. To help get a greater understanding of the pressure development before and during PMCD bullheading, computing software is used to model and simulate such complex flow scenarios. In the past, work has been done to implement a PMCD bullheading operation into a numerical scheme, which allowed for simulation and analysis. The model used is a transient model, which uses the numerical procedure of the AUSMV scheme to solve conservation equations from the drift flux model. MatLab computing software is used to perform the calculations, and the model is written in matlab programming language. The goal of this thesis is to continue building on the previous model, and increase the realism of the simulations. The previous version of the PMCD bullheading code, had shortcomings with regards to injection. Pressure development through time did not account for formation injectivity, and bottomhole injection pressure was fixed to an assumed value. During bullheading, all fluids were assumed to be injected without any resistivity from the formation. Also, during gas migration in the <b>shut-in</b> <b>well,</b> the model did not allow any fluids to flow back into the formation as the pressure increased in the bottom. In this thesis, the Injectivity Index model is implemented into the model to solve these two problems. The injectivity model was simulated and tested with two different methods of implementation, through the boundary cell fluxes, and through the source term of the partial differential equations. Tests were also done to see effects from different degree of injectivity. Compared to the original pressure plots, the new results showed a much more realistic pressure development, both during bullheading and during gas migration in <b>shut-in</b> <b>well.</b> The results also showed that the pressure development in the well is highly dependent on the injectivity of the formation. For simulation with injection through the bottom cell, the difference between the boundary cell flux method, and the source term method were insignificant. However, the source term method has an advantage, since it allows us to place the injection zone in any cell through the well. One problem was encountered though, for a high number of cells in the discretization, the pressure started to oscillate {{during the first half of}} the bullheading procedure, even though the timestep was adjusted. This was not solved, and needs further investigation. The Production Index (PI) model was also used in an experimental test, where the goal was to see if the gas kick could be taken through the model. Previously the kick was forced into the bottom of the well by a fixed rate. The results showed that a much smaller amount of gas mass was taken into the well. It is much harder to control how much gas that is taken, since in not only depends on the PI-value but also the pressure difference between the reservoir and the well, which varies through time. Some additional research was done to boundary treatment of slope limiters and pressure calculation. The original model came with two ways of doing the boundary cell calculation of slope limiters, one that extrapolated the values from the closest neighbor cell and one that fixed them to zero. The results showed minimal difference between the two slope limiter methods. Similar for pressure calculation in the boundary cells, there was two ways of doing it, one that extrapolated from the closest neighbor cell and one that calculated the pressure based on physical values. For the bottomhole pressure the results were very similar, but some difference was seen in the surface pressure...|$|E
40|$|In {{traditional}} {{material balance}} calculations, <b>shut-in</b> <b>well</b> pressure data {{are used to}} determine average reservoir pressure while recent techniques do not require the well to be shut-in and use instead flowing well pressure-rate data. These methods, which are known as “dynamic” material balance, are developed for single-phase flow (oil or gas) in reservoirs. However, utilization of such methods for gas-condensate reservoirs may create significant errors in prediction of average reservoir pressure due to violation of the single-phase assumption in such reservoirs. In a previous work, a method for production data analysis in gas-condensate reservoirs was developed. The method required standard gas production rate, producing gas-oil ratio, flowing well pressure, CVD data and relative permeability curves. This paper presents a new technique which does not need relative permeability curves and flowing well pressure. In this method, the producing oil-gas ratio is interpolated in the vaporized oil in gas phase (Rv) versus pressure (p) data in the CVD table and the corresponding pressure is located. The parameter pressure/two-phase deviation factor (p/ztp) is then evaluated at the determined pressure points and is plotted versus produced moles (np) which forms a straight line. The nature of this plot is such that its extrapolation to point where p/ztp =  0 will give initial moles in place. Putting initial pressure/initial two-phase deviation factor (pi/ztp,i) (known parameter) and estimated initial moles (ni) into the material balance equation, average reservoir pressure can be determined. A main assumption behind the method is that the region where both gas and condensate phases are mobile is of negligible size compared to the reservoir. The approach is quite simple and calculations are much easier than the previous work. It provides a practical engineering tool for industry studies as it requires data which are generally available in normal production operations. However, it is only applicable when average reservoir pressure approaches dew point pressure and falls below it. The methodology is validated using synthetic production data for several examples. In addition, the method is evaluated through estimation of average reservoir pressure and original gas in place from actual field data. The results show a fairly good agreement in gas in place obtained from the new method and that of volumetrically calculated value for this field...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to evaluate the feasibility of carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) sequestration in Texas low-rank coals and to determine the potential for enhanced coalbed methane (CBM) recovery as an added benefit of sequestration. there were two main objectives for this reporting period. first, they wanted to collect wilcox coal samples from depths {{similar to those of}} probable sequestration sites, with the objective of determining accurate parameters for reservoir model description and for reservoir simulation. The second objective was to pursue opportunities for determining permeability of deep Wilcox coal to use as additional, necessary data for modeling reservoir performance during CO{sub 2 } sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. In mid-summer, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation agreed to allow the authors to collect Wilcox Group coal samples from a well that was to be drilled to the Austin Chalk, which is several thousand feet below the Wilcox. In addition, they agreed to allow them to perform permeability tests in coal beds in an existing <b>shut-in</b> <b>well.</b> Both wells are in the region of the Sam K. Seymour power station, a site that they earlier identified as a major point source of CO{sub 2 }. They negotiated contracts for sidewall core collection and core analyses, and they began discussions with a service company to perform permeability testing. To collect sidewall core samples of the Wilcox coals, they made structure and isopach maps and cross sections to select coal beds and to determine their depths for coring. On September 29, 10 sidewall core samples were obtained from 3 coal beds of the Lower Calvert Bluff Formation of the Wilcox Group. The samples were desorbed in 4 sidewall core canisters. Desorbed gas samples were sent to a laboratory for gas compositional analyses, and the coal samples were sent to another laboratory to measure CO{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }, and N{sub 2 } sorption isotherms. All analyses should be finished by the end of December. A preliminary report shows methane content values for the desorbed coal samples ranged between 330 and 388 scf/t., on ''as received'' basis. Residual gas content of the coals {{was not included in the}} analyses, which results in an approximate 5 - 10 % underestimation of in-situ gas content. Coal maps indicate that total coal thickness is 40 - 70 ft in the Lower Calvert Bluff Formation of the Wilcox Group in the vicinity of the Sam K. Seymour power plant. A conservative estimate indicates that methane in place for a well on 160 -acre spacing is approximately 3. 5 Bcf in Lower Calvert Bluff coal beds. When they receive sorption isotherm data from the laboratory, they will determine the amount of CO{sub 2 } that it may be possible to sequester in Wilcox coals.

Such excess water production usually results in increased environmental concerns, increased levels of corrosion and scale and ultimately leads to early <b>shut-in</b> of <b>wells</b> that still contain significant volumes of hydrocarbons (Liu et al. 2006; Bai et al. 2007 a).|$|R

A good history match between the actual field oil production rate history (FOPRH) and observed field oil production rate (FOPR) of more than 23  years was achieved as shown in Fig.  4. The average reservoir pressure of 1801 psia was then found which was still more than the bubble point pressure {{at the end of}} the history match period.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to evaluate the feasibility of carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) sequestration in Texas low-rank coals and to determine the potential for enhanced coalbed methane (CBM) recovery as an added benefit of sequestration. There were three main objectives for this reporting period, which related to obtaining accurate parameters for reservoir model description and modeling reservoir performance of CO{sub 2 } sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. The first objective was to collect and desorb gas from 10 sidewall core coal samples from an Anadarko Petroleum Corporation well (APCL 2 well) at approximately 6, 200 -ft depth in the Lower Calvert Bluff Formation of the Wilcox Group in east-central Texas. The second objective was to measure sorptive capacities of these Wilcox coal samples for CO{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }, and N{sub 2 }. The final objective was to contract a service company to perform pressure transient testing in Wilcox coal beds in a <b>shut-in</b> <b>well,</b> to determine permeability of deep Wilcox coal. Bulk density of the APCL 2 well sidewall core samples averaged 1. 332 g/cc. The 10 sidewall core samples were placed in 4 sidewall core canisters and desorbed. Total gas content of the coal (including lost gas and projected residual gas) averaged 395 scf/ton on an as-received basis. The average lost gas estimations were approximately 45 % of the bulk sample total gas. Projected residual gas was 5 % of in-situ gas content. Six gas samples desorbed from the sidewall cores were analyzed to determine gas composition. Average gas composition was approximately 94. 3 % methane, 3. 0 % ethane, and 0. 7 % propane, with traces of heavier hydrocarbon gases. Carbon dioxide averaged 1. 7 %. Coal from the 4 canisters was mixed to form one composite sample that was used for pure CO{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }, and N{sub 2 } isotherm analyses. The composite sample was 4. 53 % moisture, 37. 48 % volatile matter, 9. 86 % ash, and 48. 12 % fixed carbon. Mean vitrinite reflectance was 0. 54 %. Coal rank was high-volatile C to B bituminous. Comparison of the desorbed gas content (395 scf/ton, as received) at reservoir pressure (2, 697 psi) with the sorption isotherm indicates that Lower Calvert Bluff coal at this well site is oversaturated, but lost gas may have been overestimated. This high gas content suggests that little or no depressurization {{would be required to}} initiate methane production. Sorption isotherms results indicate that the sorptive capacity of CO{sub 2 } is about 2. 5 times that of CH{sub 4 } at 1, 000 psia. This ratio {{is similar to that of}} higher rank bituminous coals from other basins (e. g., Carroll, and Pashin, 2003), and it is very low in comparison to results of other low-rank coals and to the values that we used in our preliminary reservoir modeling. If this value from the APCL 2 well is representative, Wilcox coals in this area will sequester less CO{sub 2 } on a per ton basis than we had earlier inferred. However, because measured methane contents are higher, enhanced coalbed methane production potential is greater than we earlier inferred. Pressure transient testing for determining coal fracture permeability will be conducted soon by Pinnacle Technologies. The data from these analyses will be used to finalize our coal model for the reservoir simulation phase of the project...|$|E
30|$|Unwanted water {{production}} {{is a crucial}} issue for most oil producers (Wen et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2017). Corrosion, the load on fluid handling facilities, and environmental problems are increased by {{increasing the amount of}} unwanted water production. Even in certain cases, this phenomenon can lead to <b>shut-in</b> <b>well.</b> Fractures are able to establish a connection between an injection well and a production well (Li et al. 2017). Hitherto, several carbonate fractured reservoirs were examined and their fluid properties which influence oil recovery were determined (Abdelazim 2016; Barros-Galvis et al. 2017; Parker-Lamptey et al. 2017; Rahimi et al. 2017; Ruidiaz et al. 2017). However, controlling unwanted water production has been the major purpose of oil and gas producers (Chen et al. 2017; Izadmehr et al. 2017). One of the best cost-effective methods to alleviate this problem is gel treatment in which the major role of gel is to absorb water through highly permeable zones. There are two kinds of gels that absorb water: in situ gels and PPGs. PPGs are adjustable in size from µm to cm and can swell in water and have a controllable swelling rate. They can resist against many kinds of salt solutions with high concentrations and can withstand high pressure and temperature. To do so, oil producers confirm that PPGs are more successful than in situ gels in controlling unwanted water production from oil or gas reservoirs (Bai et al. 1999, 2007 b; Bai and Zhang 2011; Tongwa et al. 2013 a, b). Since PPGs were more successful than in situ gels in controlling unwanted water, the present paper mainly focused on physical and chemical properties of the synthesized PPG, which is basically attributed to the approach to be utilized in the synthesis process. The synthesis approach of PPG and saltwater properties in which PPG is placed can affect PPG performance (Tongwa and Baojun 2015). Hitherto, many {{attempts have been made to}} synthesize PPGs and to examine their behavior under different conditions by many researchers. Isik (2004) synthesized a copolymer of acrylamide and acrylic acid and explored its swelling performance. Different weight ratios of AAm/AA, the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, and mole percentage of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide on swelling behavior of hydrogels showed that an increase in AA, PEG 4000, and cross-linker concentration results in decreased capacity of hydrogels swelling. Caykara et al. (Çaykara and Akçakaya 2006) synthesized ionic hydrogels from acrylamide (AAm), dimethylamylamine (DMAAm), and itaconic acid (IA) by free radical cross-linking copolymerization approach. Results showed that the swelling behavior of hydrogels at buffer solutions with different pHs can be described by the modified Flory–Rehner equation based on the affine and phantom network models. Liu et al. (2006) synthesized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) with the use of a special kind of hectorite (Laponite XLS) modified with tetrasodium pyrophosphate. The outcomes demonstrated that these hydrogels have good mechanical properties and complex deswelling behavior which was due to high clay content of hydrogels. Bai et al. (2007 a) reported that gelant compositions, temperature, brine salinity, and pH are vital factors affecting PPG properties. Moreover, the results revealed that gel swelling capacity decreases with the increase in salinity unlike swollen gel strength. In addition, temperature effect on the swelling capacity is contrary to salinity. Hussain et al. (2012) produced superabsorbent cross-linked poly(acrylic acid) via suspension polymerization in supercritical CO 2. The solubility of acrylic acid in supercritical CO 2 has a strong effect on the particle morphology. Ahmed (2015) examined several technologies of hydrogel preparation and additionally considered their physical and chemical properties. Malana et al. (2014) synthesized pH-sensitive hydrogels from acrylamide, methacrylate, and acrylic acid with the use of different cross-linker agents and investigated the effect of pH and the nature of cross-linker agent on the swelling capacity of hydrogels. It was concluded that the network parameters and absorbency changed very sharply with changing pH value. Tongwa et al. (Tongwa and Baojun 2015) synthesized a preformed particle gel with calcium montmorillonite as a nanomaterial and disclosed that the presence of the nanomaterial in hydrogel causes a remarkable improvement in gel properties and its behavior in comparison with hydrogels without any nanomaterial. Pacheco et al. (2014) prepared hydrogels from acrylamide and sodium methacrylate (NMA) by solution polymerization and examined the swelling behavior of hydrogels. Results showed that the weight of sodium methacrylate can greatly affect the swelling behavior of hydrogels and can reduce the dynamic correlation length (ξ). Hamouda et al. (Hamouda and Amiri 2014) reported that the weight percentage of alkaline sodium silicate in reaction solution, low pH value, presence of divalent ions, and temperature reduction can accelerate the gelation time, and the increase in Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ion concentration can increase gel strength. Othman et al. (2015) synthesized hyperbranched polyimide derived from melamine by emulsion polymerization. The effect of monomer feed ratio, reaction medium properties, and temperature was studied to find the optimal synthesis conditions. Craciun et al. (2016) outlined the synthesis of acrylamide and acrylic acid in aqueous solutions. Diffusion coefficient and network parameters of hydrogels were investigated, and a possible reaction mechanism was suggested. Zhong et al. (2016) found that the mechanical properties of poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels are significantly attributed to the contents of covalent cross-linker ions and water.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of {{changing}} pressure, temperature, and density profiles in a wellbore {{as a function}} of time is crucial for design and analysis of pressure-transient tests (particularly when data are gathered above perforations), real-time management of annular-pressure buildup (ABP) and identifying potential flow-assurance issues. Other applications of this modeling approach include improving design of production tubulars and artificial-lift systems and gathering pressure data for continuous reservoir management. This work presents a transient wellbore model coupled with a semianalytic temperature model for computing wellbore-fluid-temperature profile in flowing and <b>shut-in</b> <b>wells.</b> The accuracy of the analytic heat-transfer calculations improved with a variable-formation temperature model and a newly developed numerical-differentiation scheme. Surrounding formation temperature is updated in every timestep up to a user specified distance to account for changes in heat-transfer rate between the hotter wellbore fluid and the cooler formation. Matrix operations are not required for energy calculations because of the semianalytic formulation. This efficient coupling with the semianalytic heat-transfer model increased the computational speed significantly. Either an analytic or a numeric reservoir model can be coupled with the transient wellbore model for rapid computations of pressure, temperature, and velocity. The wellbore simulator is used for modeling a multirate test from a deep offshore well. Thermal distortion and its effects on pressure data is studied using the calibrated model, resulting in development of correlations for optimum gauge location in both oil and gas wells. Finally, predictive capabilities of the wellbore model are tested on multiple onshore wells experiencing annular-pressure buildup problems. Modeling results compare quite well with the field data and also with the state-of-the-art commercial wellbore simulator...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring fluid {{injection}} into a multilayered reservoir, {{a different}} pressure gradient is generated {{across the face}} of each permeable layer. This pressure gradient generates driving forces in the wellbore during <b>well</b> <b>shut-in</b> that causes the injected fluid moves from higher pressure layers to lower pressure layers, a phenomenon known as interwell cross-flow. Cross-flow behavior depends on the initial pressure in the permeable layers and may be referred to as natural cross-flow (identical or natural initial pressures) and forced cross-flow (different initial pressures because of exploitation). Cross-flow may induce sand production and liquefaction in the higher pressure layers as well as formation damage, filter cake build-up and permeability reduction in the lower pressure layers. Thus, understanding cross-flow during <b>well</b> <b>shut-in</b> is important from a production and reservoir engineering perspective, particularly in unconsolidated or poorly consolidated sandstone reservoirs. Natural and forced cross-flow is modeled for some injection wells in an oil reservoir located at North Sea. The solution uses a transient implicit finite difference approach for multiple sand layers with different permeabilities separated by impermeable shale layers. Natural and forced cross-flow rates for each reservoir layer during shut-in are calculated and compared with different production logging tool (PLT) measurements. It appears that forced cross-flow is usually more prolonged and subject to a higher flow rate when compared with natural cross-flow, and is thus worthy of more detailed analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} study the {{mechanism}} {{of oil and gas}} coordinated development in oil rim reservoirs, three-dimensional visualized gas-cap reservoir physical simulation device was established to simulate the processes of oil and gas development at different gas production rates. According to experimental result, it is shown that migration speed of oil-gas interface was reduced with increasing gas production rates while migration speeds of internal and external oil-gas interfaces gradually became close, which effectively slows down occurrence of gas channeling, reduces production gas oil ratio and increases the swept volume of gas drive, so as to improve its development effect. Moreover, optimization of coordinated development methods of gas-cap and oil ring under three different conditions was studied as well,. According to optimization result, it is shown that optimal gas production rate for coordinated development of oil and gas was different under different conditions and policies. If <b>well</b> <b>shut-in</b> problem (due to gas channeling) is not considered, optimal gas production rate is small, since development years of reservoir will become longer and its development effects will become better. If <b>well</b> <b>shut-in</b> problem is considered, accumulative oil and gas equivalent will be maximized when gas production rate is between 2 % and 4 %.

40|$|Downhole {{temperature}} measured by distributed temperature sensors shows distinct response during multi-stage fracture treatments. A forward model {{is needed to}} interpret the measured dynamic temperature data during injection and <b>shut-in</b> of a <b>well</b> in complex flow systems to quantitatively diagnose fracturing treatments and characterize created fractures. In this study, a forward thermal model predicting temperature distribution along a wellbore is established considering formation, wellbore, and fracture heat transfer. The fracture model can predict fracture propagation, fluid distribution, and fracture temperature based on mass and energy conservation equations. Temperature distribution in the reservoir can also be obtained by coupling a reservoir model with fracture model and wellbore model. For multi-stage fracture treatments, a sequential simulation method is applied by introducing real time control. Using the algorithm from single-stage treatment, a work flow for multi-stage fracture simulation is created by performing a single-stage stimulation, shutting in the stage, and moving along the wellbore to the next stage. Warm-up of the entrained fracturing fluid during shut-in periods is simulated by removing the fluid injection term and implementing different boundary conditions. Due to the large temperature difference between the injection fluid and the surrounding formation, simulated results show temperature signal change occurs at fracture locations during the injection period. Warm-back behavior is also obvious at fracture locations after <b>shut-in</b> the <b>well.</b> The effect of injection flowrate, fluid distribution, fluid properties, and reservoir characteristics on temperature behavior are investigated. At first initiation of the fracture, injection flowrate {{plays an important role}} on fracture half-length and leak-off front. Heat conduction is the dominant mechanism governing temperature response during shut-in. For a shale formation, the time to reach thermal equilibrium is on the order of weeks.

A compositional simulation model is constructed {{to represent the}} hydraulic fractures through local-grid refinement. The process is analyzed from both operational and reservoir/hydraulic-fracture perspectives.

These parameters are varied at five levels. A full-factorial experimental design is utilized to run 1250 cases. The study shows that within the ranges studied, the gas-injection process is applied successfully for a 20 -year project period with net present values based on the incremental recoveries greater than zero. It is observed that the cycle rate limit, injection and soaking periods must be optimized to maximize the efficiency.

40|$|Extraction {{of natural}} gas from organic rich shales is {{challenging}} and complicated. The most prominent property of shale gas reservoirs is low permeability, {{and this is one}} of the reasons why shales are some of the last major sources {{of natural gas}} to be developed. However, shale can store enormous amounts of gas and may, by the use of modern recovery techniques, be very profitable. Due to the low permeability, hydraulic fracturing is almost always performed at initial phases of the development of shale gas reservoirs. The gas production from the well will typically decrease rapidly, demanding regularly stimulation of the wells to maintain production. Several techniques exist for performing this stimulation. The most well-established technique is to apply the hydraulic fracturing on a regular basis. Another strategy is to switch between production and <b>well</b> <b>shut-ins</b> in a cyclic manner. <b>Well</b> <b>shut-ins</b> allow for recharging of fractures with gas and pressure build up in the stimulated regions of the reservoir. This second approach will be the focus of this master thesis, in particular assessing the potential of applying model-based optimization as a means to maximize production and long-term recovery. The project includes the following tasks: 1. Finalize the development and validation of an appropriate model for wells in shale gas reservoirs. 2. Analyze production from one well using a cyclic production strategy. 3. Develop a system model for shale gas reservoirs which includes several wells as well as a suitable compression unit. 4. Formulate the production problem as an optimization problem. Both long-term recovery as well as short-term production planning should be included. Discuss alternative formulations and review literature as a background for the discussion. 5.
