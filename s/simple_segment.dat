50|$|Minicomputers {{during the}} late 1970s were running up against the 16-bit 64-KB address limit, as memory had become cheaper. Some {{minicomputers}} like the PDP-11 used complex bank-switching schemes, or, {{in the case of}} Digital's VAX, redesigned much more expensive processors which could directly handle 32-bit addressing and data. The original 8086, developed from the simple 8080 microprocessor and primarily aiming at very small and inexpensive computers and other specialized devices, instead adopted <b>simple</b> <b>segment</b> registers which increased the memory address width by only 4 bits. By multiplying a 64-KB address by 16, the 20-bit address could address a total of one megabyte (1,048,576 bytes) which was quite a large amount for a small computer at the time. The concept of segment registers was not new to many mainframes which used segment registers to swap quickly to different tasks. In practice, on the x86 it was (is) a much-criticized implementation which greatly complicated many common programming tasks and compilers. However, the architecture soon allowed linear 32-bit addressing (starting with the 80386 in late 1985) but major actors (such as Microsoft) took several years to convert their 16-bit based systems. The 80386 (and 80486) was therefore largely used as a fast (but still 16-bit based) 8086 for many years.|$|E

A multi-scale approach allows the detection of any warning and yield traffic signs, whatever their distance to the vehicle. This algorithm is applied to a set of selected corners obtained with a coding gradient method. Baseline detection uses the scale of selected triangles to confirm the presence of traffic signs. The study demonstrates that RSLD is a low computation method compared to standard triangle detection. The performance of the method proposed is compared with recently published methods on road sign databases, which use colour information. An equivalent detection rate is obtained with this algorithm, working on grey-scale images. This algorithm is implemented and runs in real time at 30 frames per second...|$|E

Since first introduced as a consumer trend in 2009, nowism has received growing attention as a trend that deserves recognition, yet no empirical {{research has been conducted}} on this subject. This leaves managers with no information or guidelines on how to handle this influential consumer trend. Our main goal with this dissertation is to rectify this situation We employ a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, where our objective is to explore the construct of nowism, identify its underlying drivers, and uncover its impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty. We hypothesize that positive life orientation; impulsive behavior; extraversion; and individualism, all influence nowism positively. Moreover, we hypothesize that these relationships are moderated by discretionary income and free time. Further, we employ a segmentation technique based on life cycle, and hypothesize that the young, free and <b>simple</b> <b>segment</b> is {{more likely to have a}} high degree of nowism compared to the segments chaos in my life and got my life back. Lastly, we hypothesize that nowism will have a negative effect on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The Norwegian markets of grocery chains and mobile subscriptions are set as contexts when assessing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Data was collected using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling, yielding a final sample of 378. Our proposed models are tested by employing analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analyses, and further replicated by using partial least squares (PLS). The results reveal that positive life orientation; impulsive behavior; extraversion; and individualism all have a positive impact on nowism. However, we found no moderating effects from discretionary income and free time. Further, our research reveals that young independent individuals are most likely to adhere to nowism. Lastly, we found no significant effects of nowism on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Overall, our findings will help managers gain a deeper understanding of nowism, and enable them to exploit business opportunities related to the trend. This may in turn lead to competitive advantages and economic prospering...|$|E

40|$|Article dans revue scientifique avec comité de lecture. Image {{matching}} {{consists of}} finding features in different images {{that represent the}} same feature of the observed scene. It is a basic process in vision whenever several images are used. This paper describes a matching algorithm for lines segments in two images. The key idea of the algorithm is {{to assume that the}} apparent motion between the two images can be approximated by a planar geometric transformation (a similarity or an affine transformation) and to compute such an approximation. Under such an assumption, local planar invariants related the kind of transformation used as approximation, should have the same value in both images. Such invariants are computed for <b>simple</b> <b>segment</b> configurations in both images and matched according to their values. A global constraint is added to insure a global coherency between all the possible matches: all the local matches must define approximately the same geometric transformation between the two images. These first matches are verified and completed using a better and more global approximation of the apparent motion by a planar homography, and an estimate of the epipolar geometry. If more than two images are considered, they are initially matched pairwise, then global matches are deduced in a second step. Finally, from a set of images representing different aspects of an object, it is possible to compare them, and to compute a model of each aspect using the matching algorithm. This work uses in a new way may elements already known in vision: some of the local planar invariants used here where presented as quasi-invariants by Binford and studied by Ben-Arie in his work on the Peaking Effect. The algorithm itself uses other ideas coming from the geometric hashing and the Hough algorithms. Its main limitations come from the invariants used. They are really stable when they are computed for a planar object or for many man-made objects which contain many coplanar facets and elements. On the other hand, the algorithm will probably fail when used with images of very general polyhedra. Its main advantages are that it still works even if the images are noisy and the polyhedral approximation of the contours is not exact, if the apparent motion between the images is not infinitesimal, if they are several different motions in the scene, and if the camera is uncalibrated and its motion unknown. The basic matching algorithm is presented in section 2, the verification and completion stages in section 3, the matching of several images is studied in section 4 and the algorithm to model the different aspects of an object is presented in section 5. Results obtained with the different algorithms are shown in the corresponding sections...|$|E

As a result, both policy and temporal credit assignment problem become unnecessarily complex - often beyond the reach of current machine learning methods.

The correlation suggests some relationship between acquisition rate and language structure, but the nature of this relationship is not well understood. This article presents a computational model, the VOCABULARY EXPANSION MODEL (VEM), designed to explore how acquisition rate might interact with other constraints on phonological development to give rise to rate-dependent {{differences in}} the structure of words in a developing vocabulary. In VEM, words from a simulated adult target vocabulary are evaluated according to well-specified articulatory and perceptual costs, and selected into child vocabularies at different rates. Comparisons of the structure in the simulated child vocabularies show that words acquired early during vocabulary development have simpler phonological structures than words acquired later, and that slow word acquisition results in vocabularies with shorter words, <b>simpler</b> <b>segments,</b> greater segment to <b>segment</b> similarity, and <b>simpler</b> syllable structures than more rapid word acquisition.

The algorithm can be employed in different degrees of supervision. For the challenge, however, we demonstrate three unsupervised versions.
