2500|$|<b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>we</b> {{have spoken}} {{only of the}} office of Prime {{properly}} so called, which ends like the other Little Hours. It is followed by some prayers which are called the office of the chapter, and are composed in the Roman Liturgy of the reading of the martyrology, of a prayer, [...] "Sancta Maria et omnes sancti" [...] ("May holy Mary and all the Saints..."), a prayer concerning work, [...] "Respice in servos tuos [...] [...] [...] Dirigere et sanctificare" [...] ("Look upon thy servants... Direct and sanctify"), and a blessing. This addition to Prime is a legacy bequeathed by the monks to the secular clergy. As has been said above, originally after Prime the monks had to betake themselves to manual work or reading. The office therefore ended with a prayer for their work [...] "... et opera manuum nostrarum dirige super nos et opus manuum nostrarum dirige" [...] ("...and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct."), and the prayer [...] "Dirigere". Later the reading of the martyrology, the necrology, the rule, and a prayer for the dead were added.|$|E

Bird was delighted with the victory, calling his achievement [...] "incredible" [...] and congratulated Formula E for organising the ePrix: [...] "I can imagine how difficult it was, but it’s been an amazing week <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>We</b> had pretty good speed today." [...] He said that the Berlin races were [...] "a turning point" [...] for his team {{as they had been}} extensively educated on their performance and praised his teammate Lynn for taking the pole position. Vergne was pleased to finish in second place but claimed his getaway off the grid prevented him from winning the race as there was a large amount of dirt off the racing line which caused him to lose positions. However, he was aware he could reclaim ground in the opening phase of the event, and increased his pace to conserve more electrical energy than Bird and felt the latter deserved the victory. Sarrazin said that he felt [...] "very good" [...] to secure a third-place finish, and despite making a small error in qualifying, he was aware that his car was good but felt [...] "lucky" [...] because of Abt's final lap problem.|$|E

We would obviously be very keen to find out where she was, and who she was with, between then and 4.20pm on Sunday. She was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a white, long sleeved T-shirt and black Nike trainers... We will interview friends, her boyfriend and all her associates." [...] Ross Hemphill, who hadn't seen Nelson {{on the day of the}} murder, was interviewed by detectives and ruled out as a suspect. Police began checking CCTV and telephone records as well as interviewing friends and family and carrying out house-to-house enquiries. Witnesses reported seeing a fire on Monkey Hill at around 11.20pm on the night of the murder. D/Supt Robertson said: [...] "We know there was a fire at 11.20pm on Saturday in exactly the spot where Zoe was found. You would need local knowledge to go there. We firmly believe the answers in this case lie in this community... It had only got dark at 10pm and it was the hottest day of the year so there must have been people around this area." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lockerbie {{judgment}} stated: [...] "From {{the evidence}} {{which we have}} discussed <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> <b>we</b> are satisfied {{that it has been}} proved that the primary suitcase containing the explosive device was dispatched from Malta, passed through Frankfurt and was loaded onto PA103 at Heathrow. It is, as we have said, clear that, with one exception the clothing in the primary suitcase was the clothing purchased in Mr Gauci's shop on 7 December 1988. The purchaser was, on Mr Gauci's evidence, a Libyan. The trigger for the explosion was an MST-13 timer of the single solder mask variety. A substantial quantity of such timers had been supplied to Libya. We cannot say that it is impossible that the clothing might have been taken from Malta, united somewhere with a timer from some source other than Libya and introduced into the airline baggage system at Frankfurt or Heathrow. When, however, the evidence regarding the clothing, the purchaser and the timer is taken with the evidence that an unaccompanied bag was taken from KM180 to PA103A, the inference that that was the primary suitcase becomes, in our view, irresistible. As we have also said, the absence of an explanation as to how the suitcase was taken into the system at Luqa is a major difficulty for the Crown case, but after taking full account of that difficulty, we remain of the view that the primary suitcase began its journey at Luqa. The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception, planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan origin. While no doubt organisations such as the PFLP-GC and the PPSF were also engaged in terrorist activities during the same period, we are satisfied that there was no evidence from which we could infer that they were involved in this particular act of terrorism, and the evidence relating to their activities does not create a reasonable doubt in our minds about the Libyan origin of this crime." ...|$|E
