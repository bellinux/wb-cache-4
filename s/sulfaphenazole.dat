However, these enzymes, which generate vasodilator epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, may also produce oxygen-derived free radicals, which attenuate the bioavailability of NO. Here, we studied the involvement of CYP 2 C 9 in modulating endothelium-dependent and-independent changes in forearm blood flow (FBF) in healthy volunteers and in patients with manifest coronary artery disease. Methods and Results—The effects of <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> a selective inhibitor of CYP 2 C 9, on endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) FBF responses were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography in 5 healthy subjects and in 16 patients with angiographically documented stable coronary artery disease. <b>Sulfaphenazole</b> did not modify FBF responses to acetylcholine or SNP in healthy subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A nitric oxide-independent response, {{possibly}} {{mediated by}} hyperpolarization, regulates vascular tone, {{acting as a}} compensatory mechanism {{in the presence of}} impaired nitric oxide availability. Cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) is a source of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors and modulates tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) release from endothelial cells; however, no effect of hyperpolarization on fibrinolysis has been documented in humans. We aimed to assess the effect of <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> a specific CYP 2 C 9 inhibitor, on tPA release in normotensive subjects and patients with essential hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: tPA release was measured in the forearm microcirculation of 56 normotensivesubjects and 57 patients with essential hypertension after bradykinin (0. 015 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)) and acetylcholine (1. 5 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)) infusions, with or without <b>sulfaphenazole</b> (0. 03 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)). Bradykinin and acetylcholine infusions were repeated with N(G) -monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA; 100 microg x 100 mL(- 1) x min(- 1)) and/or <b>sulfaphenazole.</b> tPA release by bradykinin and acetylcholine was higher in normotensive subjects than in patients with essential hypertension (P< 0. 01). <b>Sulfaphenazole</b> (P< 0. 01) blunted bradykinin-induced but not acetylcholine-induced tPA release in both groups. In normotensive subjects, L-NMMA infusion reduced tPA release (P< 0. 01). When L-NMMA was coinfused with <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> tPA release induced by bradykinin, but not by acetylcholine, was further reduced (P< 0. 01). In patients with essential hypertension, tPA release by both agonists was unaffected by L-NMMA, but only bradykinin-induced tPA release was blunted by <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> alone or with L-NMMA (P< 001). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Sulfaphenazole</b> inhibits bradykinin-induced tPA release, which suggests a modulatory role of CYP 2 C 9 -derived endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors in tPA release in humans.

We studied the involvement of cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow in humans and the interaction between CYP 2 C 9 and NOS. Seven males performed knee extensor exercise. Blood flow was measured by thermodilution and blood samples were drawn frequently from the femoral artery and vein at rest, during exercise and in recovery. The protocol was repeated three times on the same day. The first and the third protocols were controls, and in the second protocol either the CYP 2 C 9 inhibitor <b>sulfaphenazole</b> alone, or <b>sulfaphenazole</b> in combination with the NOS inhibitor Nω-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) were infused. Compared with control there was no difference in blood flow at any time with <b>sulfaphenazole</b> infusion (P > 0. 05) whereas with infusion of <b>sulfaphenazole</b> and l-NMMA, blood flow during exercise was 16 ± 4 % lower than in control (9 min: 3. 67 ± 0. 31 vs. 4. 29 ± 0. 20 l min− 1; P 0. 05). The results demonstrate that CYP 2 C 9 plays an important role in the regulation of hyperaemia and oxygen uptake during exercise. Since inhibition of neither NOS nor CYP 2 C 9 alone affect skeletal muscle blood flow, an interaction between CYP 2 C 9 and NOS appears to exist so that a CYP-dependent vasodilator mechanism takes over when NO production is compromised...|$|E

The impact of parathyroidectomy (PTx) on endothelial function was also assessed. Background: Endothelial dysfunction is reported in patients with PHPT, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. Methods: We evaluated forearm blood flow changes (strain gauge plethysmography) induced by intraarterial acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside in 17 PHPT women and 17 age-matched controls. Nitric oxide (NO) availability and oxidative stress were studied by repeating acetylcholine during intraarterial infusion of L-N(G) -monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA, a NO synthase inhibitor) and ascorbic acid (an oxidative stress scavenger). The role of cytochrome P 450 epoxygenase (CYP 2 C 9) -derived endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) was assessed by repeating acetylcholine under intraarterial <b>sulfaphenazole.</b> In six PHPT patients, the study was repeated 12 months after successful PTx. Results: Responses to sodium nitroprusside and acetylcholine were similar in PHPT patients and controls. L-NMMA inhibited the response to acetylcholine in controls (P < 0. 001), whereas it had no effect in PHPT patients. In both groups, ascorbic acid failed to affect acetylcholine. <b>Sulfaphenazole</b> administration, although not affecting vasodilation to acetylcholine in controls, blunted the response to acetylcholine in PHPT patients (P < 0. 005).

40|$|A {{significant}} endotheliumdependent vasodilation persists after {{inhibition of}} {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) in the coronary vasculature, which {{has been linked to}} the activation of cytochrome P- 450 (CYP) epoxygenases expressed in endothelial cells and subsequent generation of vasodilator epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Here, we investigated the contribution of CYP 2 C 9 metabolites to regulation of porcine coronary vasomotor tone in vivo and in vitro. Twenty-six swine were chronically instrumented. Inhibition of CYP 2 C 9 with <b>sulfaphenazole</b> (5 mg/kg iv) alone had no effect on bradykinininduced endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilation in vivo but slightly attenuated bradykinin-induced vasodilation in the presence of combined NOS/COX blockade with N ω-nitro-L-arginine (20 mg/kg iv) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg iv). <b>Sulfaphenazole</b> had minimal effects on coronary resistance vessel tone at rest or during exercise. Surprisingly, in the presence of combined NOS/COX blockade, a significant coronary vasodilator response to sulfaphenzole became apparent, both at rest and during exercise. Subsequently, we investigated in isolated porcine coronary small arteries (~ 250 μm) the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the paradoxical vasoconstrictor influence of CYP 2 C 9 activity. The vasodilation by bradykinin in vitro in the presence of NOS/COX blockade was markedly potentiated by <b>sulfaphenazole</b> under control conditions but not {{in the presence of the}} ROS scavenger N-(2 -mercaptoproprionyl) -glycine. In conclusion, CYP 2 C 9 can produce both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator metabolites. Production of these metabolites is enhanced by combined NOS/COX blockade and is critically dependent on the experimental conditions. Thus production of vasoconstrictors slightly outweighed the production of vasodilators at rest and during exercise. Pharmacological stimulation with bradykinin resulted in vasodilator CYP 2 C 9 metabolite production when administered in vivo, whereas vasoconstrictor CYP 2 C 9 metabolites, most likely ROS, were dominant when administered in vitro...|$|E

Increased cytochrome P- 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) signaling {{can contribute to}} oxidative stress-mediated suppression of EDD, but its role in aging is unknown. We hypothesized that inhibition of CYP 2 C 9 signaling with <b>sulfaphenazole</b> would improve EDD in older, but not young, healthy sedentary adults. At baseline, increases in forearm blood flow (FBF; venous occlusion plethysmography) in response to brachial artery infusions of ACh (1, 2, 4, and 8 μg· 100 ml forearm volume− 1 ·min− 1), an endothelium-dependent dilator, were smaller in older [n = 14, 63 ± 1 (SE) yr] than in young (n = 11, 23 ± 2 yr) adults (P < 0. 05), with a reduction in peak FBF of 32 % (11. 8 ± 1. 7 vs. 17. 3 ± 2. 3 ml· 100 ml tissue− 1 ·min− 1). Infusion of <b>sulfaphenazole</b> at doses that block CYP 2 C 9 signaling in humans {{did not affect the}} FBF responses to ACh in the older (peak FBF = 13. 0 ± 4. 3 ml· 100 ml tissue− 1 ·min− 1, P = 0. 41) or the young (peak FBF = 17. 1 ± 1. 9 ml· 100 ml tissue− 1 ·min− 1, P = 0. 55) adults. Coadministration of the nitric oxide inhibitor l-NMMA and <b>sulfaphenazole</b> decreased the FBF response to ACh in young and older subjects (P < 0. 05); the effect was smaller in the older subjects, but group differences in EDD remained (P < 0. 05). Endothelium-independent dilation assessed with sodium nitroprusside was not different in the young and older subjects. These results provide the first support for the concept that increased CYP 2 C 9 signaling does not contribute to impairments in EDD with aging in healthy adults...|$|E
40|$|The {{endothelium}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the control of flow, coagulation, fibrinolysis and inflammation. To date, several clinical studies have focused on the assessment of endothelium-dependent vasomotion as a surrogate measure of endothelial function. However, endothelium-dependent vasodilation may not be representative of other important aspects of endothelial function, such as the regulation of fibrinolytic system. This is a crucial aspect to investigate since the initiation, progression and resolution of thrombus associated with eroded or unstable coronary plaque are critically dependent on the efficacy of endogenous fibrinolysis. In particular, the acute release of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), the main activator of fibrinolysis, from the endothelium strongly contributes to the defense against intravascular thrombosis. The aim of the following studies was to investigate the role of endothelial pathways in the regulation of endothelial t-PA release in physiological condition and in patients with essential hypertension. The first aim was to determine the possible regulatory role of nitric oxide (NO) -synthase pathway in modulating endothelial t-PA release in healthy conditions and in a clinical condition characterized by impaired NO availability and increased cardiovascular risk, such as essential hypertension. In healthy volunteers and essential hypertensive patients, we studied local t-PA release and forearm blood flow changes (strain-gauge plethysmography) induced by intrabrachial administration of acetylcholine (0. 45 - 1. 5 µg/ 100 mL/min), and of sodium nitroprusside (0. 5 - 1. 0 µg/ 100 mL/min), an endothelium-dependent and –independent agonist, respectively. Acetylcholine was also repeated in the presence of intra-arterial infusion of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) (100 µg/ 100 mL/ min). In normotensive subjects, vasodilation to acetylcholine was blunted by L-NMMA. In these subjects, acetylcholine infusion induced a significant, dose-dependent increase in net forearm t-PA release. The inhibition of NO synthase with L-NMMA significantly reduced basal as well as acetylcholine-induced t-PA release. In essential hypertensive patients, vasodilation to acetylcholine was reduced as compared to controls and resistant to L-NMMA. In contrast to what observed in healthy controls, in hypertensive patients acetylcholine had no effect on t-PA release and L-NMMA failed to affect either tonic or agonist-induced t-PA release. In conclusion, both tonic and agonist-induced release of NO are directly involved on t-PA release by endothelial cells. Essential hypertension, characterized by a reduction in both tonic and stimulated NO availability, is also associated with impaired capacity of t-PA release. Taken together these findings suggest major role of impaired nitric oxide availability in worsening not only endothelium-dependent vasodilation but also t-PA release from endothelial cells. The second aim of our studies was to determine the relationship between adrenergic stimuli and NO in modulating t-PA release from endothelial cells in the forearm microcirculation of healthy subjects and essential hypertensive patients. Sympathetic activation is a well known stimulus for fibrinolysis and it is also involved in the determination of cardiovascular risk in essential hypertension. However, whether a cross-talk between adrenergic stimuli and NO pathway in modulating t-PA release exists is still unknown. In this study we assessed the release of t-PA in the forearm microcirculation of healthy subjects and essential hypertensive patients under specific intra-arterial adrenergic stimuli. Adrenaline induced t-PA release was significantly higher in healthy subjects as compared to hypertensive patients. L-NMMA infusion blunted adrenaline-induced t-PA release in healthy subjects but not in hypertensive patients. In healthy controls, t-PA release by adrenaline, not affected by the beta-blocker phentolamine co-infusion, was abolished in the presence of the beta-blocker propanolol. The beta-agonist isoproterenol induced a significant increase in t-PA release, an effect blunted by L-NMMA co-infusion. In hypertensive patients, response to isoproterenol was impaired and unaffected by L-NMMA. In conclusion, adrenergic-induced t-PA release is mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors via a mechanism which involves the activation of NO pathway. The reduced NO availability characterizing essential hypertension impairs adrenergic-stimulated t-PA release, thereby reducing endothelial fibrinolytic capacity in this clinical condition. Finally, in the third study we sough to evaluate the role of cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) -derived endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in the modulation of local t-PA release in healthy subjects and in essential hypertensive patients by utilizing <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> a selective CYP 2 C 9 inhibitor. The vasoactive role of CYP 2 C 9 -derived EDHF and its compensatory role in the presence of impaired NO availability are well documented. CYP 2 C 9 -derived EDHF also modulates t-PA expression and release from culture endothelial cells. However, no regulatory role on endogenous fibrinolysis has been documented in humans. The release of t-PA was measured in the forearm microcirculation of 42 healthy subjects and 44 essential hypertensive patients following intra-brachial bradykinin (0. 015 µg/ 100 mL/min), either in the absence or in the presence of <b>sulfaphenazole</b> (0. 03 µg/ 100 ml/min). The infusion of bradykinin was repeated in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) (100 µg/ 100 mL/ min) and/or <b>sulfaphenazole</b> (0. 03 µg/ 100 ml/min). Bradykinin-induced t-PA release was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in healthy subjects as compared to hypertensive patients. <b>Sulfaphenazole</b> significantly (p< 0. 01) blunted t-PA release in both groups. In healthy subjects, L-NMMA infusion, significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced t-PA release. When L-NMMA was co-infused with <b>sulfaphenazole</b> stimulated t-PA release was further reduced (p< 0. 01). In hypertensive patients, while t-PA release was unaffected by L-NMMA, the co-infusion of <b>sulfaphenazole</b> alone or <b>sulfaphenazole</b> plus L-NMMA significantly (p< 001) reduced bradykinin-induced t-PA release. These findings show that CYP 2 C 9 -derived EDHF modulates bradykinin-induced t-PA release in humans. In essential hypertension, t-PA release depends exclusively on EDHF pathway, which is an ineffective compensatory mechanism in the presence of impaired NO availability...|$|E

One enzyme that synthesizes PE is the conserved enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd 1 /yeast; PSD- 1 /worms), which is lodged in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We previously found that decreasing the level of PE due to knockdown of Psd 1 /psd- 1 affects the homeostasis of α-syn in vivo.

40|$|Human urotensin II (hU-II) is {{a potent}} {{vasoactive}} peptide which modulates some of {{the functions of the}} cardiovascular and other systems. The in vivo mechanism of action by which hU-II may influence blood pressure in developmental and pathological conditions, is poorly understood. Herein, the blood pressure effects of hU-II (0. 1 - 10 nmol/kg) injected intravenously (i. v.) were studied on ketamine/xylazine anesthetized male WKY and SHR rats aged 4 and 8 weeks. hU-II elicited dose-dependent decreases in mean arterial pressure in both strains of animals. The hypotensive responses to hU-II were, however, significantly higher in SHR rats, independently of age. Four-week-old SHR rats (which are normotensive) were, however, less responsive than their hypertensive 8 -week-old counterparts. A series of pharmacological inhibitors were used to identify putative endogenous (endothelial) factors that might account for the hU-II-mediated hypotension in 8 -week-old SHR. These include the non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (5 micromol/kg), the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor meclofenamate (16 micromol/kg), the voltage-sensitive and ATP-sensitive K+-channel inhibitors, 4 -aminopyridine (5 micromol/kg) and glybenclamide (10 micromol/kg), the cytochrome P 450 CYP 2 C 9 inhibitor <b>sulfaphenazole</b> (15 micromol/kg), the cytoskeletal fixation agent phalloidin (15 micromol/kg), the endothelin ETB receptor antagonist BQ- 788 (35 micromol/kg), the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 (0. 5 micromol/kg), the angiotensin AT 2 antagonist PD 123319 (10 micromol/kg) and the UT receptor antagonist urantide (10 micromol/kg). These agents were administered i. v. either at 2. 5, 10 or 40 min prior hU-II injection (10 nmol/kg). Among these inhibitors, <b>sulfaphenazole</b> and phalloidin were able to reduce hU-II-induced hypotension. This suggests that the vasodepressor effect of hU-II is mediated by UT receptors and relies in part on the release of epoxide related products; increased microvascular permeability may also contribute to the blood pressure lowering effect of hU-II. Since urantide blocks the constrictor effects of hU-II on isolated aorta, but is inactive against the hypotensive action of hU-II in vivo, the results presented in this paper provide, for the first time, evidence for the existence of two different functional sites for hU-II...|$|E

40|$|We thank Drs Brown and Pretorius {{for their}} {{interest}} in our article {{about the effect of}} <b>sulfaphenazole</b> on tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) release. 1 Drs Brown and Pretorius are correct in observing that the t-PA concentrations in Table 2 are reported as ng · min 1 · 100 mL 1 instead of ng/mL, which is a clear typographical error. In fact, the calculation of t-PA release (balance) was properly reported in the Methods, and t-PA release was calculated accordingly. We agree that t-PA release by bradykinin in our study is lower than that reported by other investigators with similar doses. 2 A possible explanation is that our study population is significantly older (426 years) than that of Brown et al (28. 92. 1 years). 2 Aging significantly reduces nitric oxide (NO) availability. Given that an NO pathway promotes t-PA release, an aging effect is conceivable. Moreover, we infused a single bradykinin dose (equivalent to 225 ng/min) for 10 minutes instead of cumulative doses (100 to 40...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{that higher}} natural {{antioxidants}} (NA) intake provides cardiovascular protection is contradictory. The endothelium plays {{a pivotal role}} in cardiovascular homeostasis, and for this reason, the molecular events resulting from the interaction of NA with endothelial cells (ECs) are actively investigated. Here, we show that moderately high doses of coumaric acid (CA) induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ECs death. Treatment of ECs with cyclosporine A, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, prevented the oxidative-mediated cell damage indicating mitochondrial involvement in CA-induced ECs impairment. CA-induced intracellular ROS generation was counteracted by the specific cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 C 9 inhibitor <b>sulfaphenazole</b> (SPZ). SPZ also prevented CA-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ECs death, implicating CYP 2 C 9 in mediating the cellular response upon CA treatment. Our results indicate that moderately high doses of CA can promote CYP 2 C 9 -mediated oxidative stress eliciting mitochondrial-dependent ECs death and may pave the way toward mechanistic insight into NA effects on cardiovascular cells...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (P 450) enzymes play a {{significant}} role in promoting myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. CYP 2 C 9, an isoform of P 450, is known to generate superoxide radicals in the reperfused heart. <b>Sulfaphenazole</b> (SPZ), a CYP 2 C 9 inhibitor, has been shown to decrease I/R injury; how-ever, the mechanism of cardioprotection by SPZ is not well elucidated. The objective of this study was to test whether SPZ mitigates myocardial I/R injury by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion. Hearts were perfused with SPZ and/or N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME). Coronary flow (CF), left-ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), and rate-pressure product (RPP) were monitored. Su-peroxide and nitric oxide (NO) generation in the reperfused tissue was determined using fluorescence methods. Myocar-dial infarct size was measured using triphenyltetrazolium chlo-ride staining.

40|$|Studies {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} natural antioxidants (NA) on Endothelial Cells (ECs) have dramatically increased during the last years, since a deregulated ECs redox state is {{at the base of}} the onset and progression of several cardiovascular diseases. However, whether NA can provide cardiovascular benefits is still a controversial area of debate. Resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenol found in grapes, is believed to provide cardiovascular benefits by virtue of its antioxidant effect on the endothelium. Here, we report that tissue-attainable doses of resveratrol increased the intracellular oxidative state, thus affecting mitochondrial membrane depolarization and inducing EC death. Cyclosporine A, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, prevented oxidative-mediated cell death, thus implicating mitochondria in resveratrol-induced EC impairment. The specific cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 C 9 inhibitor, <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> counteracted both oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, providing EC protection against resveratrol-elicited pro-oxidant effects. Our findings strongly suggest that CYP 2 C 9 mediates resveratrol-induced oxidative stress leading to mitochondria impairment and EC death...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to examine the ability of {{cytochrome}} P 450 - 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) to activate cyclophosphamide (CPA) and elicit tumor cell death. A CYP 2 C 9 -deficient human lymphoblastoid cell line (AHH- 1 cells) and a derivative cell line (H 2 C 9 cells) stably transfected with a cDNA encoding CYP 2 C 9 were used. The catalytic activity present in cell lines was examined by measuring the conversion of diclofenac, a CYP 2 C 9 -specific substrate, to its 4 ′-hydroxy metabolite by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Initial rate plots were constructed and the maximal rate of formation (Vmax) and the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for diclofenac metabolism were determined. Cytotoxicity was studied by exposing the cells to 0. 01 to 4 mM CPA in the presence or absence of <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> a CYP 2 C 9 -specific inhibitor. Cell survival was quantitated by determination of the level of tritiated thymidine incorporation. H 2 C 9 cells quickly metabolized diclofenac, indicating the presence of high levels of CYP 2 C 9. Kinetic experiments demonstrated a Vmax and Km of 0. 62 ± 0. 012 pmol/min/ 106 cells and 6. 16 ± 0. 62 μM, respectively, for diclofenac metabolism. Diclofenac 4 ′-hydroxylase activity was undetectable in AHH- 1 cells. H 2 C 9 cells were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of CPA (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50], 0. 80 ± 0. 03 mM) than AHH- 1 cells (IC 50, 4. 07 ± 0. 35 mM). The cytotoxicity (IC 50, 1. 99 ± 0. 14 mM) of CPA to H 2 C 9 cells was blocked by <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> demonstrating that the chemosensitivity of these cells is a consequence of intracellular prodrug activation. H 2 C 9 cells mediated a bystander killing effect for CYP 2 C 9 -negative PPC- 1 cells, reducing the IC 50 of CPA from about 14 to 3. 62 ± 0. 73 mM in PPC- 1 cells when they were cocultured with H 2 C 9 cells. These results suggest that the enzyme-prodrug system of CYP 2 C 9 and CPA may be an effective combination for gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy. Ongoing studies are examining the utility of this system for use in prostate cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular (CV) {{benefits}} of Natural Antioxidant (NA) supplementation are contradictory. Endothelial Cells (EC) are pivotal player on CV diseases onset/progression and thus represent a good model {{to study the}} NA impact on vascular pathophysiology. We show that two NA, coumaric acid and resveratrol, affect intracellular ROS levels and cell physiology in human EC. While at lower doses both compounds were antioxidant, at mildly high doses they became pro-oxidant, eliciting cell death by apoptosis and phospho-Akt inhibition. Pro-oxidant effects were counteracted by diphenyleneiodonium, hinting a role for flavin oxidases in NA-induced toxicity. ECs treatment with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor prevented oxidative cell damage indicating mitochondrial involvement in NA-induced ECs impairment. Pro-oxidant effects were also hindered by <b>sulfaphenazole</b> (SPZ), suggesting a role for CYP 2 C 9 in NA-induced toxicity. SPZ also prevented NA-induced p-Akt down-regulation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) impairment indicating that Akt works downstream of CYP 2 C 9 in mediating cellular responses to NA. Stimulation of p-Akt by insulin, counteracted NA-induced MMP impairment and cell death, an effect abolished by Akt inhibitors further suggesting that Akt regulates cell survival in response to NA-induced stress. Our study show that mildly high-doses of NA induce mitochondria-dependent cell damage mediated by CYP 2 C 9 and the Akt pathway in a human vascular model...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P- 450 enzymes (CYPs) {{are present}} in the heart and {{coronary}} circulation. The activation of CYP 2 J 2 / 3 to increase the production of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) may be cardioprotective in cardiac ischemia and reperfusion. On the other hand, inhibition of CYP 2 C 9 with cimetidine, or more selectively with <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> is cardioprotective in the perfused rat heart. In a dog model of cardiac ischemia and reperfusion, inhibitors of CYP co-hydroxylases (e. g., CYP 4 A, CYP 4 F) reduce infarct size. Inhibition of selected CYPs as an approach to the treatment of myocardial infarction should therefore be further developed. The function of CYPs in the coronary artery and other blood vessels is varied and complex, and only just beginning to be elucidated. In the coronary artery, when nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is inhibited, the activity of CYPs may be increased, with the production of vasodilatory EETs. Conversely, when CYP 2 C 9 is inactivated in humans with coronary artery disease (CAD), acetylcholine-induced NO-mediated vasodilatation is enhanced. In the presence of CAD/oxidized LDL, the EET vasodilator/system may be inhibited. Drugs that target CYPs and/or EETs are thus expected to be useful in the elucidation of the role of this system, and may also have therapeutic utility. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{cytochrome}} P 450 in the metabolism of dextromethorphan, amitriptyline, midazolam, S-mephenytoin, citalopram, fluoxetine and sertraline {{was investigated}} in rat and human brain microsomes. Depending on the parameters, the limit of quantification using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods was between 1. 6 and 20 pmol per incubation, which generally contained 1500 microg protein. Amitriptyline was shown to be demethylated to nortriptyline by both rat and human microsomes. Inhibition studies using ketoconazole, furafylline, <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> omeprazole and quinidine suggested that CYP 3 A 4 is the isoform responsible for this reaction whereas CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 D 6 {{do not seem to}} be involved. This result was confirmed by using a monoclonal antibody against CYP 3 A 4. Dextromethorphan was metabolized to dextrorphan in rat brain microsomes and was inhibited by quinidine and by a polyclonal antibody against CYP 2 D 6. Only the addition of exogenous reductase allowed the measurement of this activity in human brain microsomes. Metabolites of the other substrates could not be detected, possibly due to an insufficiently sensitive method. It is concluded that cytochrome P 450 activity in the brain is very low, but that psychotropic drugs could undergo a local cerebral metabolism which could have pharmacological and/or toxicological consequences...|$|E

To probe {{the mechanism of}} this lipolysis-induced event, we evaluated the pro-inflammatory potential of lipid classes derived from human postprandial TGRL by lipoprotein lipase (LpL). Incubation of TGRL with LpL for 30 min increased the saturated and unsaturated FFA content of the incubation solutions significantly. Furthermore, concentrations of the hydroxylated linoleates 9 -hydroxy ocatadecadienoic acid (9 -HODE) and 13 -HODE were elevated by LpL lipolysis, more than other measured oxylipids. The FFA fractions elicited pro-inflammatory responses inducing TNFα and intracellular adhesion molecule expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). The FFA-mediated increase in ROS was blocked by both the cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 inhibitor <b>sulfaphenazole</b> and NADPH oxidase inhibitors. Compared with linoleate, 13 -HODE {{was found to be}} a more potent inducer of ROS production in HAECs, an activity that was insensitive to both NADPH oxidase and cytochrome P 450 inhibitors. Therefore, although the oxidative metabolism of FFA in endothelial cells can produce inflammatory responses, TGRL lipolysis can also release preformed mediators of oxidative stress (e. g., HODEs) that may influence endothelial cell function in vivo by stimulating intracellular ROS production...|$|E
40|$|Ischemia and reperfusion both {{contribute}} to tissue damage after myocardial infarction. Although many drugs {{have been shown}} to reduce infarct size when administered before ischemia, few {{have been shown to}} be effective when administered at reperfusion. Moreover, although it is generally accepted that a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs at the onset of reperfusion and contributes to tissue damage, the source of ROS and the mechanism of injury is unclear. We now report the finding that chloramphenicol administered at reperfusion reduced infarct size by 60 % in a Langendorff isolated perfused rat heart model, and that ROS production was also substantially reduced. Chloramphenicol is an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis and is also an inhibitor of a subset of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (CYPs). We could not detect any effect on mitochondrial encoded proteins or mitochondrial respiration in chloramphenicol-perfused hearts, and hypothesized that the effect was caused by inhibition of CYPs. We tested additional CYP inhibitors and found that cimetidine and <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> two CYP inhibitors that have no effect on mitochondrial protein synthesis, were also able to reduce creatine kinase release and infarct size in the Langendorff model. We also showed that chloramphenicol reduced infarct size in an open chest rabbit model of regional ischemia.

Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results The linear range of 22 sulfonamides were 10 ~ 100 μg/kg, r> 0. 99. The recoveries of sulfamethizole, trimethoprim and sulfaguanidine were below 40 %, the others were above 60 %.

Treatment of the biotransforming culture with FK- 506 increased demethylase activity 2. 4 -fold and stabilized the cytochrome P- 450 protein. The enzyme responsible for this demethylation (31 -O-FK- 506 demethylase) was isolated and shown to be a soluble cytoplasmic protein which is constitutively expressed in the cells, which requires NADPH, ferredoxin-NADP(sup+) -reductase, and ferredoxin for activity, and which shows a cytochrome P- 450 light absorption characteristic. Carbon monoxide saturation of the enzyme preparation and known mammalian cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors such as quinidine HCl, ketoconazole, troleandomycin, and <b>sulfaphenazole</b> abolish the demethylating activity extensively. The purified enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 42 kDa and shows its maximal activity at a pH of 7. 4 and an incubation temperature of 34 (deg) C. The first 19 N-terminal amino acids in the sequence of the purified protein have been determined, with no cytochrome P- 450 match found in the OWL and Swiss-Prot 23 databases. The isolated demethylase is therefore a cytochrome P- 450 protein that {{can be used as a}} catalyst for the synthesis of 31 -O-desmethylFK- 506, an important immunosuppressant and a known metabolite of FK- 506 metabolism by human liver microsomes...|$|E

The cellular mechanisms underlying the increased contribution of EDCF were explored in 16 and 30 -week-old male TH and age-matched male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (n = 4 - 9). Blood glucose and serum lipid profiles were markedly increased in the TH mice. Superoxide generation, assessed with a lucigenin chemiluminescence assay, was markedly increased in the aortae of TH mice. Endothelium-dependent vascular relaxations and contractions to acetylcholine (ACh), but not endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside, were impaired and vascular contractions to phenylephrine were significantly enhanced in aortae from TH mice. N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester markedly increased the ACh-induced contractions in TH mice, whereas SQ 29548, a thromboxane receptor antagonist, and cytochrome P 450 (CYP) inhibitors 17 -octadecynoic acid and <b>sulfaphenazole,</b> the latter being specific for CYP 2 C 6 and 2 C 9, decreased and (or) normalized the contractile response to ACh in TH mice. The present study indicates that enhanced contribution of prostaglandin H- 2 /thromboxane A(2) receptor and CYP, likely CYP 2 C 6 and 2 C 9, {{play a critical role in}} the pathogenesis of increased EDCF in the aortae of type 2 diabetic TH mice...|$|E

The contribution of the CYP families 1, 2 and 3 was studied using chemical inhibitors. Testosterone metabolites were analyzed by HPLC. The metabolites androstenedione, 6 β- and 11 β-hydroxytestosterone were found in microsomes of all species, but the pattern of metabolites varied within species. Androstenedione was more prominent in the animal species, and an increase over time was seen in equines. Testosterone hydroxylation was predominantly catalyzed by the CYP 3 A subfamily in all three species. While CYP 2 C 9 did not metabolise testosterone, the canine ortholog CYP 2 C 21 produced androstenedione. Quercetin significantly inhibited 6 β- and 11 β-hydroxytestosterone in all species investigated, suggesting that CYP 2 C 8 is involved in testosterone metabolism, whereas <b>sulfaphenazole</b> significantly inhibited the formation of 6 β- and 11 β-hydroxytestosterone in human microsomes, at 60 min in equine microsomes, but not in canine microsomes. A contribution of CYP 2 B 6 in testosterone metabolism was only found in human and equine microsomes. Inhibition of 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 indicated its involvement in androstenedione formation in humans, increased androstenedione formation was found in equines and no involvement in canines.

The study used 6 groups: I/R (control); SPZ; L-NAME; L-NAME[*]+[*]SPZ; 1400 W (an inhibitor of iNOS); 1400 W[*]+[*]SPZ. The agents were administered orally through drinking water for 3 days prior to induction of I/R. Myocardial oxygenation (pO 2) at the I/R site was measured using EPR oximetry. The preischemic pO 2 value was 18 [*]±[*] 2 [*]mm Hg in all groups. At 1 [*]h of reperfusion, the SPZ group showed a significantly higher hyperoxygenation when compared to control (45 [*]±[*] 1 vs. 34 [*]±[*] 2 [*]mm Hg). The SPZ group showed a significant improvement in the contractile functions and reduction in infarct size. Histochemical staining of SPZ-treated hearts exhibited significantly lower levels of superoxide and peroxynitrite, and markedly increased levels of iNOS activity and nitric oxide.
