40|$|Accidents {{involving}} bus rollover can {{be classified}} {{as one of the}} most fatal types compared to other types of motor-vehicle accident. There are various aspects that lead to occupant injury and fatality. Two prominent aspects are <b>superstructure</b> <b>strength</b> and occupant kinematics. This study deals with the two stages of analyses which are <b>superstructure</b> <b>strength</b> having rollover and occupants kinematic analysis. In accordance to UNECE R 66, the bus superstructure should be able to withstand the impact load produced by the rollover accident. The validation process using finite element model was done by comparing the strain results obtained from simple box rollover experiment with the simulation results. A total of four full-scale models of the bus superstructures had undergone rollover simulation using finite element analysis software. The predicted results suggested that the structural strength having rollover strongly depends on the bus design parameters in terms of the beam profile size and main bus dimensions. Analyses of the occupant kinematics were also included in this study. Occupant’s injury of restraint occupant was compared to unrestraint occupant using the Mathematical Dynamic Model (MADYMO) software. Overall, the injury indexes for unrestraint occupant are greater than that for restraint occupant. By using a restraint system, the occupant injury and number of fatalities can significantly be reduced...|$|E
50|$|Structural {{design of}} the box-girder bridge was guided by two {{applications}} of finite modeling. One modeled the cross-section of the concrete box of the bridge and allowed for aircraft to be placed variously. This yielded implications for the transverse reinforcement and post-tensioning in the top slab of the concrete box. A second model yielded implications for the <b>superstructure's</b> flexural <b>strength</b> requirements, for connections to the integral abutments, for the two huge abutment walls, and for drilled shafts. The abutment walls are each 230 ft long, 30 ft tall, and from 7.5 ft to 6 ft thick.|$|R
40|$|Past {{experience}} {{shows that}} bridge abutments attract {{a large portion}} of seismic forces during seismic events. It is often reported, in post earthquake investigations, the pervasive problem of insufficient shear capacity of the bridge transverse keys (i. e. Kocaeli, Turkey, Earthquake, Reconnaissance Report, Earthquake Spectra). The problem is, at the same time, related to the correct definition of design forces {{as well as to the}} design of details. However, an accurate determination of design forces, at shear key locations, is often difficult and requires the use of dynamic nonlinear analysis. The proposed solution provides a reasonable estimate of the maximum shear forces transferred to the abutments, simply based on pier <b>strength,</b> <b>superstructure</b> mass and maximum expected acceleration...|$|R

As {{part of a}} {{systematic}} study of the collisional properties of Fe ions {{carried out by the}} IRON Project, electron excitation rates (eective collision strengths) are computed for all the ne-structure transitions within the n = 3 complex of Fe xv in the electron temperature range 105 T=K 107. Conguration-interaction target wave-functions are generated with the atomic structure code <b>superstructure,</b> and collision <b>strengths</b> are computed in the close-coupling approximation with a Breit{Pauli R-matrix package. Special care is taken to resolve the res-onance structure and to ensure the convergence of the partial wave expansion, specially for dipole allowed tran-sitions. By comparing with previously calculated collision strengths in the distorted wave approximation, a 20 % ac-curacy rating is assigned to transitions with eective col-lision strengths (T) > 10 − 2.

40|$|The {{founding}} {{depths of}} pile foundations depend {{primarily on the}} loading conditions of the <b>superstructure</b> and the <b>strength</b> of subsoil. The depth of Grade III weathered rock, the top of completely decomposed granite (CDG), and standard penetration test N-value of 200 (SPT- 200) are often used as indicators for decision-making in arriving at the preliminary founding depth of piles in Hong Kong. The work reported in this paper focuses on evaluation of the spatial variability characteristics of the above founding depth indicators at a construction site, using statistical models based on random field theory. Spatial variability characteristics are evaluated using the measured data in terms of scale of fluctuation. Geostatistics is used to obtain additional data at unsampled locations for mapping profiles of founding depth indicators over the site, using the measured data from borehole records and site investigation results. It is observed from the results that, if faults are not present, {{the depth of the}} Grade III surface exhibits the largest scale of fluctuation among the three indicators, and the variability of the ground is observed to increase with the weathering grade. The effect {{of the size of the}} sampling domain on the auto-correlation characteristics of the founding depth indicators is also studied. The results demonstrate that the scale of fluctuation increases with increase in the size of the sampling domain...|$|R
