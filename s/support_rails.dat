[...] In a council held that night, the Loyalists decided to attack, since the alternative of finding another crossing might give Moore time to reach the area. During the night, Caswell decided to abandon that position and instead take up a position on the far side of the creek.

50|$|The 271 ft Great Plains Life Building {{was left}} with a visible twist in its superstructure, leaving many to fear it {{was in danger of}} collapse; several radio towers on the roof were twisted or broken off. Much of the plaster in the {{stairwell}} walls between the 4th and 16th floors had cracked, and 60% of the building's windows were shattered. A foot of permanent deformation damage occurred at the steel frame on the south side, and three of the building's four elevators were damaged, with the <b>support</b> <b>rails</b> bent. In spite of the severity of the damage and amid cries to demolish, the owners chose to repair it instead, and it still stands. Some sources erroneously claim that the building was impacted by F5 winds. A thorough damage survey indicated that the F5 damage contour commenced farther north in the Guadelupe neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study and prepare basic time for piling works by synthetic equations. The time data of 7 work elements of piling works were collected from 10 different construction sites in Phuket Province of Thailand.

These work elements consisted of pile driving work, moving piling rig left or right on <b>supporting</b> <b>rails,</b> moving <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> left or right, moving piling rig and <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> back or forth, joining of two-piece pile by welding, joining of two-piece pile by steel coupling, and pile driving with pushing post. These synthetic equations were used to determine the basic time, standard time, and productivity values for various types and sizes of square precast concrete pile.

40|$|This is an {{abridged}} {{version of the}} assembly sequence described by the DO assembly subgroup of Cooper, Hrycyk, Kowalski, Rapidis, and Ratzmann. This primarily is used to indicate major steps during the sequence and to list fixturing requirements. Assembly - (1) Place <b>support</b> <b>rails</b> in (1) 3 Chip Ladder Construction fixture. The two rails get held under vacuum. (2) Apply adhesive to the region where contact will be made with the beryllium substrates. (3) Place underside beryllium pieces (active and dummy ends) into the (1) 3 Chip Ladder Construction fixture. These pieces get placed in the fixture against the appropriate pins to mimic final positioning in the bulkhead. Apply vacuum to the beryllium pieces. Allow to cure? (4) Align silicon in (1) 3 Chip Ladder Construction fixture. Reference features on the fixture will be parameterized. Holes in the fixture near the silicon center line will be targeted to set the silicon axis relative to the beryllium slot edge. Z positioning of the detectors will be achieved by shimming between the detectors and butting up {{the end of the}} silicon against the fixture. (5) Remove silicon detectors and apply adhesive to the rails and upper surfaces of the beryllium. (6) Replace silicon and check final position of the detectors. (7) Release vacuum on the rails so they cure in a stress-free state. Allow adhesive to cure. (8) Apply adhesive and align HDI to the silicon using (2) 3 Chip HDI Gluing fixture. The HDI will have tabs which are held by the fixture for location relative to the detectors. Allow adhesive to cure. (9) Move ladder to (3) 3 Chip Wirebonding Fixture.

5000|$|Ladder {{track is}} a type of railway track in which the track is laid on {{longitudinal}} supports with [...] connectors holding the two rails at the correct gauge distance.

30|$|Discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> {{model and}} {{continuous}} <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model are two classical {{models for the}} traditional mechanical analysis of railway track [1, 2]. In the discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, the stiffness of fastener supporting track is a spring constant, while in the continuous <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, it is denoted by track modulus, which is calculated with the spring constant divided by the spacing between centers of discrete supports. The stiffness measurement method based on the Winkler elastic foundation model uses track modulus to characterize the overall track stiffness.|$|R
40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is an {{important}} factor in safety of railway track. This parameter is defined as support force imposing on rail length unit per rail unit displacement in vertical direction. <b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is important because it affects track performance and maintenance requirements. Both low and large modulus is undesirable. Low modulus of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> has been shown to cause differential settlement that then increases maintenance needs. On the other hand, higher value of <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> causes axle load to be distributed on fewer sleepers and therefore received dynamic loads for any sleeper and rail-sleeper fastening will be increased. Sandy desert areas are critical regions about the contamination of ballast. In these areas, flowing sand grains influence between ballast aggregates and increase the stiffness of ballast layer and the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus. In this paper, the results of a field investigation about the effect of ballast contamination on the values of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus in sandy desert areas are presented...|$|R
