5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots.

500|$|In {{developing}} the Budd-Michelin railcar, the Budd Company used the formed steel technology {{in which they}} were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a welding technique that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. On August 20, 1932, Earl J. Ragsdale, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed a patent application for a [...] "Method and product of electric welding"; on January 16, 1934, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted US patent 1,944,106 to the Budd Company. Shotwelding, as Ragsdale termed his method, involved automatic control of the timing of individual spot welds. [...] In spot welding, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an electrode {{on each side of the}} joint. A very high electric current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. If a <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> is heated too long, heat will spread from the weld at a middling temperature that weakens the stainless steel and compromises its corrosion-resistant properties unacceptably; Ragsdale's precisely-timed welds solved the problem. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the cars produced by Budd were a truly unique product.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the applicability of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> different steel sheets toultrasonic testing, because resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> of the steel sheets is widely used in the car bodies andtransport fields and ultrasonic testing is a good way to evaluate the fatique life of the <b>spot</b> <b>welds.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Methodology {{of this paper}} is that two different steel sheets (AISI 304 typeaustenitic stainless steel sheet and Galvanized steel sheet) were welded to each other by using resistance spotwelding. Some pre-welding tests were made to obtain suitable and optimum weld nugget diameter; and thewelding current vs. nugget diameter curve were obtained. By using this curve and kepting constant weldingparameters such as current, electrode pressure, weld time, etch., fully identical four <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> specimenshaving 5 mm (± 0. 2) nugget diameter were obtained. The specimens and nugget diameters were tested by usinga special ultrasonic test apparatus which is designed for <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints. Findings: Findings are that after the first ultrasonic tests, the four identical <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> sheets which have AISI 304 – Galvanized steel sheet combination were subjected to the fatigue test in four different number of cycles. There is no any rupture or fracture in <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints after fatigue tests. The <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> specimens subjectedto fatigue test were tested in ultrasonic test apparatus to observe the variation in the weld nugget and joint. Theultrasonic test results before fatigue and after fatigue were compared with each other; and the decreasing of theweld nugget diameter were observed while increasing the number of cycles. The results were shown in figuresand discussed. Research limitations/implications: <b>Spot</b> <b>welding</b> of different steel sheets forms different microstructures whichrespond different values to ultrasonic testing.

5000|$|The {{advantages}} of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. When high strength in shear is needed, spot welding is used in preference to more costly mechanical fastening, such as riveting. While the shear strength of each weld is high, {{the fact that the}} weld spots do not form a continuous seam means that the overall strength is often significantly lower than with other welding methods, limiting the usefulness of the process.

50|$|The E. G. Budd Company of Philadelphia {{recognized}} the important metallurgical characteristics of 18/8 stainless steel (known today as SAE 304 austenitic stainless steel) {{and developed a}} spot welding process {{to take advantage of}} the oxidized layer on the surface of stainless steel. Heat treating the 18-8 stainless steel leaves a metal with non-magnetic and ductile properties. Repeatedly reheating the metal to 1000-1100 °C impairs the mechanical and chemical properties of the metal. The metal becomes susceptible to corrosion due to carbide precipitation, and loses fatigue resistance. The important factor in controlling the metal's properties is the dwell time at those temperatures. Using a controlled time element and recorder, a power supply with smooth current, and very brief high currents, a satisfactory <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> may be produced.|$|E

50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the <b>spot</b> <b>weld,</b> causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|E
