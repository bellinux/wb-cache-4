25|$|Following his judgment, Richard Mawrey ordered Lutfur Rahman {{to pay the}} petitioners' {{costs to}} be {{assessed}} on the <b>standard</b> <b>basis</b> if not agreed between the parties. An order for an interim payment of £250,000 to be paid within 14 days was also made pending agreement or assessment of costs, estimated at £500,000. Rahman was also ordered to pay the costs of John Williams, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police, and expenses incurred in the hosting of the election court. As {{a result of the}} cost order, Andy Erlam obtained interim charging orders on two investment properties registered solely in Rahman's name as security for the judgment debt. Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute beneficial interest on one of the two property, and 74% beneficial interest in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final charging order on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim charging order was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a beneficial interest in it.|$|E
