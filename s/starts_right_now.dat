40|$|Abstract. The UNL Programme of the United Nations University (UNU) was {{launched}} in 1996 aiming at the elimination of linguistic barriers in Internet. Now, eight years later, UNL {{is not ready to}} support real applications due to several circumstances. This eight-year period can be divided in two: a first fouryear period devoted to the formal definition of UNL as a formal language (under the sponsorship of the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) of the UNU) and the remaining four years devoted to the technical experimentation of UNL. A new period is <b>starting</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> which could be the period of maturity at all levels, especially at technical and business levels. In this paper, the authors summarize the more significant experiences until now, their conclusions and the set of procedures to produce marketable multilingual services. This kind of work will be the work of the UNL consortium during the next two years before launching UNL to the market. ...|$|R
50|$|A BrightBuilt Barn, is an {{eco-friendly}} {{project that}} is directed towards {{creating a more}} sustainable building. It was first established in Rockport, Maine by Kaplan Thompson Architects and company, when a rich entrepreneur contacted them {{by the name of}} Keith Collin. The BrightBuilt Barn is the creator's sample of what a more sustainable building can look like, for people to possibly live in. The idealist Keith Collin and company wanted a sustainable, low cost, and environmentally friendly home. At least that was the Collin's plan,since 2006. So far there are only prototype BrightBuilt houses produced. Collin wants the beginning design to be a pathway towards implying more technological applications into common day houses, to bring better result for the environment, or at least that is his vision. From its inception, the design was driven by five guiding principles: livability, sustainability, replicability, disentanglement, and education. In the eyes of the designers this barn project is a stepping stone toward the future improvements that can <b>start</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> especially since the barns Net Zero design can benefit the environments situation. The benefit could mean more energy is conserved in the years to come, which can help other small towns like Collin's.|$|R

40|$|Although {{interventions}} {{that take an}} individualized, holistic approach to service delivery have been recommended for homeless youth, few such interventions have been described in the literature. This study sought to examine a unique, multi-faceted, community-based intervention developed in 2009 in Tampa, FL to provide services to homeless adolescents who are no longer living {{in the custody of}} a parent or guardian (i. e. unaccompanied youth). The intervention, titled <b>Starting</b> <b>Right,</b> <b>Now</b> (SRN), has served over 100 youth to date. The program provides residential, educational, recreational, and professional development services, as well as mental and physical health care. Each youth also receives a trained mentor who is in frequent contact with the youth. Other individualized services are provided as needed. Although SRN has been in existence for six years, the program has only been evaluated using measures such as changes in GPA, absentee rates, etc. In the current study, individual interviews with nine program participants who had been in SRN for at least one year were analyzed to explore how the youth themselves perceived that their lives had been impacted. Thematic analysis of interviews provided an opportunity to examine common themes among participants. Results showed that despite encountering some challenges, participants perceived that they had been lifted to higher educational and personal levels through obtainment of resources; adult and peer support systems; renewed trust in adults; increased hope; improved mental health; and a heightened sense of community. Practical implications for practice and research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|I {{attended}} the Power Electronic Building Block (PEBB) workshop at DOE HQ on June 21, 1995. Accompanying me was Doug Hopkins, who is contracting with the Lab through Mark Newton on power electronics. The PEBB concept, and the workshop in particular, are {{sponsored by the}} Office of Naval Research (ONR) and DOE. The general concept behind PEBB is a ``second electronics revolution`` facilitated by a single-package, smart, multi-function power control block. The PEBB will potentially replace all conventional power electronic elements at scales from watts to megawatts, thus shifting power engineering from circuit design to system design. ONR is interested because power distribution aboard ships is expensive, complex, and bulky, and getting worse. The same applies to aircraft and many other military systems. DOE`s interest is in electric vehicles, utility power systems, and various end-use applications such as adjustable speed drives. There was obvious enthusiasm from industry, academia, and Government at this workshop. The PEBB concept is in its infancy. Exactly what a PEBB will encompass is still up for discussion. What is certain is that everything is up to industry: standards, innovations, marketing strategies, etc. ONR and DOE are only acting as facilitators and coordinators, and perhaps offering a little seed money. The program will be long-term but fast-paced, relying on concurrent engineering in a serious way. Great strides are required in semiconductors, packaging, controls, and system design. ONR {{want to put a}} big knee in the historic power density and dollar-per-watt curves, <b>starting</b> <b>right</b> <b>now...</b>|$|R
40|$|ASTRONOMERS’ OBSERVING GUIDES provide {{up-to-date}} information for amateur astronomers {{who want to}} know all about what it is they are observing. This is the basis of {{the first part of the}} book. The second part details observing techniques for practical astronomers, working with a range of different instruments. [...] We live in a violent universe. The media constantly remind us of the possibility of an object suddenly appearing and hitting Earth. A hit by an asteroid is believed to have spelled the end of the dinosaurs. Such a collision by an object from space could cause another extinction event, if the object were large enough. And such objects are definitely out there. Often called “the vermin of the sky,” asteroids roam our Solar System often unseen. Many have been tracked, and their orbits calculated. But there are still many to be discovered and assessed. Many amateur astronomers are helping in this effort, sometimes even working with professional astronomers, to contribute to our knowledge and avert danger. Some people just enjoying locating these or the dwarf planets, such as Pluto, and then following their paths. Whatever your interest, Asteroids and Dwarf Planets and How to Observe Them will help you get started. It will tell you what you are looking at and why you should look. It will also help you learn how to look. This is definitely an area where amateurs can make a difference.

500|$|Nixon later {{characterized}} {{the attitude of}} his backers and aides as, [...] "We want you to <b>start</b> campaigning <b>right</b> <b>now</b> for 1956, and we think {{the way to do}} it is to have available the funds to make speeches, make trips to California, and so forth." [...] Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000. Nixon was not to be informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon [...] "will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest". By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000, principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54. Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.|$|R

5000|$|According to lead vocalist Gerard Way, {{the band}} had {{struggled}} with the departure of drummer Bob Bryar and was dissatisfied with {{the progress of the}} sessions for their fourth studio album until the recording of [...] "Na Na Na". A breakthrough was achieved once the chord progressions for the song were in place, with Way explaining,"That's the moment where we said, 'This song changes everything. We're <b>starting</b> over <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> We're <b>starting</b> it over with Rob Cavallo, and we're doing it now'. Everything up to that point had felt like we had been in this kind of stasis, and as artists, stasis really equals death. So, it was so bad, the vibe wasn't good, and then 'Na Na' happened. And then, all of a sudden, there was this real, big intensity underneath us, and it was the momentum we needed to dig deep and record another album". The song was not originally intended as a single, but due to the positive response to the album's teaser video, [...] "Art is the Weapon", it was released and a full music video was shot.|$|R
40|$|There is no {{escaping}} our economic future. It {{is clean and}} green or it is no future at all. Our past prosperity relied on coal-fred power, but coal can no longer secure us a prosperous and safe future. Coal-fred pollution and the ways we bring electricity into our homes and businesses have barely changed at all over the past 100 years. But like the digital revolution that is transforming so many aspects of our lives, energy generation and its delivery is undergoing a revolution propelled by sophisticated technology and increasingly controlled by everyday Australians. Renewable technologies lower prices for everyone and are advancing in leaps and bounds {{and will continue to}} do so for a long time to come. By contrast, prices for fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas will continue to increase as they become harder and harder to reach and exploit. The global warming emergency that Australia and the rest of the world face requires leadership and strong intervention from government to overcome the market failures that continue to entrench dangerous pollution. In the face of the climate challenge, the rest of the world is moving rapidly to transform their economies and we cannot risk being left behind. To avoid catastrophic global warming and stabilise warming at 1. 5 degrees, Australia must cut pollution rapidly to achieve netzero pollution by 2040. The Australian Greens have a strategy to get there, and our plan for at least 90 % clean energy by 2030 is a critical component. A clean energy powered economy is inevitable. However, for Australia to secure all the benefts of lower prices, better technologies, more jobs, competitive advantages, signifcant export opportunities for innovative Australian technologies and services, building the clean economy needs to <b>start</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> If we don’t start now, we will get stuck importing technologies while our best minds leave to take their ideas to be developed overseas.  ...|$|R
