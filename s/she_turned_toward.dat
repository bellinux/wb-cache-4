25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere behind her and to her right, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, {{with his hands in}} front of his face and throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E
500|$|While {{steaming}} off the Norwegian coast, Admiral Hipper {{was ordered}} to divert course to locate the destroyer Bernd von Arnim, which had fallen behind Group 1. In the mist, the destroyer encountered the British destroyer the two destroyers engaged each other until Bernd von Arnims commander requested assistance from Admiral Hipper. Upon arriving on the scene, Admiral Hipper was initially misidentified by Glowworm to be a friendly vessel, which allowed the German ship to close the distance and fire first. Admiral Hipper rained fire on Glowworm, scoring several hits. Glowworm attempted to flee, but when it became apparent she could not {{break away from the}} pursuing cruiser, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> Admiral Hipper and fired a spread of torpedoes, all of which missed. The British destroyer scored one hit on Admiral Hippers starboard bow before a rudder malfunction set the ship {{on a collision course with}} the German cruiser.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> me, [...] "will {{you do me}} {{the favor}} to flirt with me? Say for twenty-five minutes," [...] looking at her watch; [...] "that will bring us to four o'clock, when I must go indoors." ...|$|R
60|$|He fanned the fainting {{flame of}} her life; by-and-by <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> slowly <b>toward</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Yvonne {{had closed}} {{her eyes for a}} moment as she entered; now <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> appealingly <b>toward</b> her guide.|$|R
60|$|Jeanne {{hesitated for}} a moment. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the door.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> him, and the {{moonlight}} showed {{her face was}} reassuringly quiet.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> one {{of those}} fairy-like rooms, but Jordan {{interrupted}} her desperately.|$|E
60|$|She {{finished}} her letter, {{and put the}} address, and closed the envelope. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>toward</b> me again.|$|R
2500|$|These two {{conflicting}} romances {{account for}} the ironic combination of chastity and availability encoded by the woman’s body. [...] The demure turn of her head shows that <b>she</b> has <b>turned</b> away from the Indian. [...] Yet this very gesture of refusal is also a sign of her availability: <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> the viewer. [...] It is by her role as sexual stereotype that the woman in Couse’s painting is really captive.” ...|$|R
60|$|Whether {{she heard}} or not, {{he could not}} say; certain it is that she made no reply, nor did <b>she</b> <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> him at all. The light of the lanthorn lit up her {{delicate}} profile, pale and drawn, her tightly pressed lips, the look of utter contempt in her eyes, which even the fitful shadow cast by her hair over her brows could not altogether conceal.|$|R
60|$|The fire {{dropped out}} of Miss Mayfield's eyes and cheeks. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the stranger.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> John, {{and caught}} the deprecating glance which flashed from him to Stephen.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> him, {{watching}} his face. [...] "Early Tudor? How very delightful! And I suppose {{there are a}} great many others." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS GILPIN (indicating {{the chairs}} {{in front of}} the windows on the left, forward). Won't you gentlemen sit down? (Carmody grunts sullenly and plumps himself into the one nearest the door. Nicholls hesitates, glancing down at the {{suit-case}} he carries. Miss Gilpin turns to Eileen.) And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me---- (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>toward</b> the door in rear, centre.) ...|$|R
60|$|Lys {{stood with}} a heavy blanket wrapped around her slender figure, and as I {{approached}} her, <b>she</b> half <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> me to see who it was. When she recognized me, <b>she</b> immediately <b>turned</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> us. [...] "Here's {{a pretty}} kettle of fish! There's a two-horse sleigh outside, {{with a man}} driving, and a gentleman {{in the back seat}} who I am sure is Dr. Morris, and he has come all the way on this bitter cold morning to see the patient I sent for him to come to. Now, who is going to tell him he has come on a fool's errand?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the terrace, and Ramsden, {{his head}} buzzing, tottered {{into the jungle}} to find his ball, {{followed}} by the boy.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> {{the door}} ready to go, {{but in order}} to reach it from where she stood, she had to go past the foot of the bed.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked to}} the corner of the street and stood waiting while the brougham came round to them. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> a florist's and looked into the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} talk with you, Mary," [...] cried Bertrade, {{stamping}} her sandaled foot, {{and with a}} toss of her pretty head <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> abruptly <b>toward</b> the castle.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Lilian's eyes grew hazy, {{and she looked}} away from him. Then, though there was {{moisture}} on her lashes, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> fully <b>toward</b> her companion, holding out her hand.|$|R
6000|$|She {{tried to}} look at Winterfield, but her eyes sank. <b>She</b> could <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> him, and that was all. [...] "Is it the sea-piece in the study?" [...] {{she said to him}} faintly.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, after all," [...] said Olive, [...] "give me {{the flowers}} {{that can not}} take care of themselves." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> a bed of carnations, bright under the morning sun.|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} at the table {{arranging}} the pages she was going to read, and at the question <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> me. Her face was flushed, but not, I think, with displeasure.|$|E
60|$|Then as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> me, evidently with {{a word of}} {{explanation}} on her lips, her eyes suddenly widened as they rested upon me, and with a little exclamation she started toward me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now,' <b>she</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> them {{as soon as}} {{the door}} closed. The {{smallest}} of the crowd smiled at her, and shook his head before he buried it in his sister's skirts.|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{waved his}} arm, and, {{trimming}} the jib over, drove the Rowan ahead. As he did so, the steamer's screw splashed round {{half out of}} water, and <b>she</b> slowly <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the north.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{poor old}} thing is tired, and must go in. Good-morning, and many thanks," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the steps, {{which they would}} have passed unseen but for the prudent poodle's hint.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} {{had been all}} she asked for. In a few minutes <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> them again. Her sweet voice was steady once more; her eyes rested softly on Horace as she went on.|$|E
60|$|Phaidor alone {{retained}} {{her presence}} of mind. Two {{of the guards}} she ordered to bear away Thuvia of Ptarth; the others she commanded to remain and prevent me from following. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> him for {{the first}} time. In her new position, she was clearly visible in the light. He looked at her attentively. [...] "I have seen you somewhere," [...] he said, [...] "before now." ...|$|E
50|$|Her {{fourth and}} final sortie began on 15 December 1941, taking her from Lorient, through the Bay of Biscay to a point in mid-Atlantic north of the Azores. <b>She</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the Mediterranean.|$|R
50|$|Wall {{was born}} Lucille Loretta Wall in Chicago, Illinois; {{she had a}} sister, Mildred. During her teenage years, Wall leaned toward a career in music, but <b>she</b> {{eventually}} <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> radio for her career.|$|R
6000|$|The woman {{appeared}} bewildered, first {{looking at}} the admiral, and then at her husband, after which she bowed her head low, and devoutly crossed herself. Recovering from this self-abasement, <b>she</b> again <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> Columbus, demanding earnestly-- ...|$|R
