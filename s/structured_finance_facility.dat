40|$|A hospice-care program {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} to provide effective palliative care for patients terminally ill with malignant disease and to develop improved methods for coping {{with the problems of}} the dying patient. All patients for whom antitumor therapy does not offer a reasonable possibility of cure are eligible for Church Hospital's multidisciplinary program, the focus of which is on both the patient and his family. Acceptance by medical staff, patients and families has been enthusiastic. Both conventional and unconventional methods can be helpful in making terminally ill patients more comfortable. Much has been learned about the control of pain in such patients. Intestinal obstruction can often be managed non-operatively without the use of nasogastric tube. Other common symptoms such as weakness, anorexia, depression, dyspnea, etc. can be relieved with varying degrees of success. An objective of the program is to allow the patient to be at home for most of his terminal illness and to die there if possible. By utilizing patient and family instruction, visiting nurses and home health aides, approximately two-thirds of the patients in the program at any given time are at home. Basing the program in an acute care hospital has allowed coordination with the curative treatment of malignant disease and effective use of radiation and chemotherapy for palliative purposes. The organizational <b>structure,</b> <b>financing,</b> <b>facilities</b> and clinical experience with 100 consecutive patients of the Church Hospital hospice-care program are described...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} to the competitiveness of sustainable economic development is a country's global economic position. Small and medium industries, supposed to be drivers of economic development of a country, receive much of negative impact following the global economic uncertainty environment. This includes facing increasingly critical financial facilities. This study seeks to analyze the empirical relationship between small and medium industries and the <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in the short-run and long-run {{in the state of}} Sabah, Malaysia. The ARDL bound testing approach was applied, using annual time series data for the years between 1976 through 2005. The successes of small and medium industries have been related to availability of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Results show that the relationships between small and medium industries and <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> seem to exist in the long-run. In addition, there is a causal relation between small and medium industries and financial loan. The conclusion is that <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> {{may not be the most}} important factor in the development of small and medium scale industries, but small and medium industries on the other hand functions as the paramount important factor in the development of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> SMI, <b>Financing</b> <b>facilities,</b> ARDL, Sabah...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In May 2003, the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) {{decided to}} {{establish}} a Working Group on Ratings in <b>Structured</b> <b>Finance</b> to explore the role of rating agencies in the rapidly evolving markets for <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> instruments. To facilitate {{a better understanding of}} this role and of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> markets more broadly, the Working Group was mandated to identify and explain methodological differences that exist between the rating of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> instruments and more traditional credit products, and to explore the various methodological and organisational challenges involved in rating <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> products. This report documents the Working Group's findings, complementing earlier work by the CGFS and other official forums, such as CGFS (2003) and Joint Forum (2004 b). It highlights several of the characteristics of structured products, challenges arising for the rating agencies and other market participants, and implications for central banks and investors. The report is based on the Group's discussions, written contributions by Group members on a number of technical topics, and series of interviews with rating agency officials and other participants in the <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> markets. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{encourage}} the private funding and {{provision of infrastructure}} services, governments have used specialized <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> to offer financial support to investors, often {{in the form of}} grants, soft loans, or guarantees. The authors present case studies of infrastructure <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in various stages of development in Colombia, India, and Pakistan. They also present case studies of government-sponsored <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> (not of infrastructure) in Argentina, and Moldova. They find that these facilities have often fallen short of their objectives for two main reasons. First, the environment was not conducive to private participation in infrastructure because of poor sector policies, an unstable macroeconomic environment, and inadequate financial sector policies, among other reasons. Second, the facility was faulty in design - in terms of sectors targeted, pricing of instruments, and consistency of objectives, and instruments.
