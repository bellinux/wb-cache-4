40|$|The pricing {{of health}} {{products}} {{in the developing world}} has become a center of controversy among policymakers, with important implications for the efficient targeting of social programs more generally. A key issue in this debate is whether higher purchase prices lead to more intensive product use and, therefore, greater health benefits. We present results from an experiment in Lusaka, Zambia, designed to test whether charging more for a home water purification solution results in more use of the product. Our methodology separates the <b>screening</b> effect of <b>prices</b> (charging more changes the mix of buyers) from the causal effect of prices (charging more stimulates greater use for a given buyer). We find that higher <b>prices</b> <b>screen</b> out less intensive users of the product. High prices do not cause greater product use than low prices for a given buyer, but {{there is some evidence that}} the act of paying increases use.

A field experiment verifies {{a theory of}} bounded rationality as deliberation costs that can explain findings from previous experiments on pricing in developing countries. The model predicts that (1) eliminating deliberation costs will increase purchasing at a higher price without impacting behavior at a lower price, (2) bounded rationality has certain greater effects on poorer people, and (3) deliberation costs can suppress <b>screening</b> by <b>prices.</b> Each prediction is confirmed by an experiment that sold soap in rural Indian villages. The experiment interacted assignment to different subsidized prices with a treatment that eliminated marginal deliberation costs.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the high}} burden of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection in sub-Saharan Africa, absence of widespread screening and poor access to treatment leads {{to most people}} remaining undiagnosed until later stages of disease when prognosis is poor and treatment options are limited. We examined the cost-effectiveness of community-based screening and early treatment with antiviral therapy for HBV in The Gambia. Methods: In this economic evaluation, we combined a decision tree with a Markov state transition model to compare a screen and treat intervention consisting of adult community-based screening using a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid test and subsequent HBV antiviral therapy versus current practice, {{in which there is}} an absence of publicly provided screening or treatment for HBV. We used data from the PROLIFICA study to parameterise epidemiological, primary screening, and cost information, and other model parameter inputs were obtained from a literature search. Outcome measures were cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted; cost per life-year saved; and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between current practice and the screen and treat intervention. Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective. Costs (expressed in 2013 US$) and health outcomes were discounted at 3 % per year. Findings: In The Gambia, where the prevalence of HBsAg is 8 Â· 8 % in people older than 30 years, adult screening and treatment for HBV has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $ 540 per DALY averted, $ 645 per life-year saved, and $ 511 per QALY gained, compared with current practice. These ICERs are in line with willingness-to-pay levels of one times the country's gross domestic product per capita ($ 487) per DALY averted, and remain robust over a wide range of epidemiological and cost parameter inputs. Interpretation: Adult community-based screening and treatment for HBV in The Gambia {{is likely to be a}} cost-effective intervention. Higher cost-effectiveness might be achievable with targeted facility-based <b>screening,</b> <b>price</b> reductions of drugs and diagnostics, and integration of HBV screening with other public health interventions.

It argues that D 2 Ì 6 O insurers act as gatekeepers and guarantors of corporate governance, <b>screening</b> and <b>pricing</b> corporate governance risks to maintain the profitability of their risk pools. As a result, D 2 Ì 6 O insurance premiums provide the insurerâs assessment of a firmâs governance quality. Most basically, firms with relatively worse corporate governance pay higher D 2 Ì 6 O premiums. This simple relationship could signal important information to investors and other capital market participants. Unfortunately, the signal is not being sent. Corporations lack the incentive to produce this disclosure themselves, and U. S. securities regulators do not require registrants to provide this information.
