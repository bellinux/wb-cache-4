50|$|Streptomyces spectabilis is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces. Streptomyces spectabilis produces hangtaimycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin B, <b>sisomycin,</b> tobramycin, paromomycin, spectinabilin, aminocyclitol, actinospectacin, prodigiosine and the streptovaricin complex.|$|E
30|$|Antibiotic {{susceptibility}} {{was evaluated}} using 6 -mm BBL Sensi-Discs (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing nystatin (50  μg), nystatin (30  μg), salinomycin (30  μg), amphotericin (2  μg), or gramicidin S (30  μg) and other antibiotics including teicoplanin, amikacin, ampicillin, lincomycin, nalidixic acid, kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, neomycin, penicillin, vancomycin, erythromycin, oleandomycin, amoxicillin, spiramycin, rifampicin, polymixin B, bacitracin, tetracycline, cycloheximide, roxithromycin, sphingomyelin, apramycin, hygromycin B, capreomycin, <b>sisomycin,</b> phosphomycin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin.|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} susceptibilities of 242 {{isolates}} of Serratia marcescens to 17 antibacterial drugs have been determined. Oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, cefoxitin, and amikacin {{were the most}} active drugs. Ampicillin, kanamycin, and cephalothin were among the least active. A 4 -year study showed that resistance of S. marcescens to dibekacin, tobramycin, <b>sisomycin,</b> and gentamicin has increased at least one order of magnitude in that period, whereas resistance to amikacin showed but a twofold increase...|$|E
40|$|Aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as streptomycin, gentamycin, {{kanamycin}} and neomycin, {{are widely}} used for therapeutic purposes. Both the acute (e. g. sudden cardiorespiratory failure) and chronic (e. g. cochlear and vestibular lesions) toxic effects of these drugs are currently attributed to their calcium-antagonist properties. In the present report, it is shown that the aminoglycoside antibiotic <b>sisomycin</b> is a potent inhibitor of insulin release, and that such inhibition {{also appears to be}} due to a calcium-antagonistic effect of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{prevalence}} of MRSA strains {{is reported to}} be increasing, there are no studies of their prevalence in community-acquired primary pyodermas in western India. Aims: This study aimed at determining the {{prevalence of}} MRSA infection in community-acquired primary pyodermas. Methods: Open, prospective survey carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai. Materials and Methods: Eighty-six patients with primary pyoderma, visiting the dermatology outpatient, were studied clinically and microbiologically. Sensitivity testing was done for vancomycin, <b>sisomycin,</b> gentamicin, framycetin, erythromycin, methicillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, penicillin G and ciprofloxacin. Phage typing was done for MRSA positive strains. Results : The culture positivity rate was 83. 7 &#x 0025;. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in all cases except two. Barring one, all strains of Staphylococcus were sensitive to methicillin. Conclusions: Methicillin resistance is uncommon in community-acquired primary pyodermas in Mumbai. Treatment with antibacterials active against MRSA is probably unwarranted for community-acquired primary pyodermas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective To {{investigate}} the underlying resistance mechanisms in 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Methods Ten K. pneumoniae strains according to distinct bacteriocin typing and REP-PCR, were examined for their plasmid content, {{their ability to}} transfer their resistance to aminoglycosides and third-generation cephalosporins, and their production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and β-lactamases. Results Transfer {{of resistance to the}} above-mentioned antibiotics as well as to co-trimoxazole and tetracycline in Escherichia coli strain RC 85 at a frequency of 5 – 106 was achieved for all strains by conjugation. Similar strains harbor a self-transferable multiresistant plasmid (80 kb) with similar EcoRI and HindIII restriction patterns. This plasmid encodes an extended-spectrum β-lactamase which confers high-level resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam. It produces SHV- 5 β-lactamase, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing and DNA sequencing. Aminoglycoside resistance was co-transferred, and AAC(6 ′) -I, mediating resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin, and AAC(3) -I, mediating resistance to gentamicin and <b>sisomycin,</b> were encoded in all isolates and their transconjugants, while APH(3 ′) -I, mediating resistance to kanamycin and neomycin, was encoded in seven strains. Conclusions It appears that a multiresistant transferable plasmid encoding the SHV- 5 β-lactamase, causing unusually high resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam, and the combination AAC(6 ′) -I + AAC(3) -I of acetylating enzymes causing, also resistance to all clinically available aminoglycosides, is established in K. pneumoniae in Greece...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Elimination of allergens/topical {{medications}} causing {{contact dermatitis}} in venous eczema, which poses {{a significant problem}} in its chronicity and treatment, provides the basis for better therapeutic outcome. Our objective {{was to determine the}} pattern of contact sensitization in venous eczema patients in Himachal Pradesh (India). Methods: Thirty-four patients (M:F, 31 : 3) and 10 controls (M:F, 6 : 4) were patch tested with Indian standard series and 10 commonly used topical medicaments. Results: Positive patch test results were seen in 50 &#x 0025; (M:F, 16 : 1) of the patients. Common allergens were Fragrance mix (15 &#x 0025;), p-phenylendiamine (15 &#x 0025;), nickel (9 &#x 0025;), wool alcohol (9 &#x 0025;), chinoform (9 &#x 0025;), balsum of Peru (5 &#x 0025;), cobalt chloride (5 &#x 0025;), potassium dichromate (3 &#x 0025;), epoxy resin (3 &#x 0025;), thiuram mix (3 &#x 0025;) and formaldehyde (3 &#x 0025;). Only <b>sisomycin</b> and miconazole among the topical medications elicited a positive patch test reaction in 3 and 5 &#x 0025; patients, respectively. Neomycin contact sensitivity was not seen in any of the patients. One patient who had exacerbation of venous eczema following accidental application of topical diclofenac showed a positive patch test reaction to it. Conclusions: Patch test should be used to identify the topical agents that may be responsible for perpetuation or aggravation of eczema, especially in patients who do not improve despite adequate treatment of other underlying cause(s) ...|$|E
