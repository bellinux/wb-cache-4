JavaScript code may access the area through a full <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> functions {{similar to those of}} other common 2D APIs, thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics.

5000|$|Although {{originally}} part of PostScript, Type 1 fonts used {{a simplified}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> operations compared to ordinary PostScript (programmatic {{elements such as}} loops and variables were removed, much like PDF), but Type 1 fonts added [...] "hints" [...] to help low-resolution rendering. Originally, Adobe kept {{the details of their}} hinting scheme undisclosed and used a (simple) encryption scheme to protect Type 1 outlines and hints, which still persists today (although the encryption scheme and key has since been published by Adobe). Despite these measures, Adobe's scheme was quickly reverse-engineered by other players in the industry. Adobe nevertheless required anyone working with Type 1 fonts to license their technology.|$|E

Special Effects, co-written by Pelczarski and David Lubar later the same year, helped establish the company's slogan, [...] "the graphics people".

Graphics Magician was aimed toward developers or anyone wanting to be a developer, allowing any programmer to create animations for arcade-style games and compact graphic images for adventure games and educational software.|$|E

30|$|The SML {{estimates}} of our {{model can be}} used to predict potential adjustments in labor supply due to changes in the tax-benefit system. In our analysis, these predictions are computed through the procedure of Creedy and Duncan (2002). For each couple, we first draw up to 750 realizations from the extreme value distribution and the estimated asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimates, such that under the baseline tax-benefit system, the observed alternative in the choice set has the highest utility. This gives us one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>draws</b> <b>of</b> the random taste-shifter and the parameters estimates which rationalizesthe observed labor supply choices of the two spouses under the baseline tax-benefit system. Only for couples where none of the 750 realizations yields maximum utility at the observed alternative, labor supply of the two spouses is considered to be invariant. Through repeated applications of this process, we construct 250 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>draws</b> for all random components of the model, and for each of them we predict labor supply choices of the two spouses under a reform scenario to obtain 250 predictions of labor supply transitions. Finally, we average over the sample and report the mean and the fifth and ninety-fifth percentiles of the distribution of transitions. These percentiles are the bounds of a two sided confidence interval of about 90 percent.|$|R

Peggy, a family friend, is stabbed {{in the head with a}} pickaxe, and the babysitter has her head forced into a lit oven and is stabbed in the throat with a pair of scissors, but not before sending the brother off to get help. Katia struggles from her bed to take on the killer herself. Mikos breaks into Katia's bedroom and attacks her, but she manages to stab him in the eyes with a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> compasses. She then stumbles down the hallway as the blinded killer staggers after her. He stalks her through the house, but Katia manages to elude him. The priest arrives and struggles with Mikos, and Katia grabs an axe from a decorative suit of armor and decapitates Mikos with it. The police and the rest of the family arrive to discover Katia standing in the doorway, covered in blood holding Mikos's severed head.|$|E

The times required to complete rule definitions are approximately the same as slide creations with some presentation software.
