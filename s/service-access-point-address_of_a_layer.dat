40|$|AbstractThe {{method of}} {{calculation}} of wave fields in media with curvilinear interfaces is proposed. After integral transformations, the solution in the explicit form is obtained. For solving the problem, we introduce {{the notion of the}} generalized thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer.</b> This value becomes real in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plane boundary and coincides with <b>an</b> “ordinary” thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer.</b> If the boundary is curvilinear, the generalized thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> becomes <b>a</b> complex value. The use of the generalized thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> brings about the fact that conditions on infinity (Sommerfeld’s conditions) are automatically fulfilled. The conditions of appearance of loops on the travel-time curves for different boundaries have been elucidated. Some examples of calculations are given...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{instability}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fluid confined {{between two}} horizontal parallel planes and heated from {{above or below}} under the action <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gravitational field varying with height is investigated analytically. It is found that if gravity remains downward (upward) throughout the flow domain, neutral modes do not exist. A sufficient condition for stability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from above is that gravity remain directed downward over a sufficiently {{large part of the}} flow domain. A circle theorem limiting the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> arbitrary oscillatory mode (whether stable, neutral or unstable) is established. A sufficient condition for instability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from below is found to be that gravity remain directed downward and the gravity profile have concave curvature throughout most of the flow domain. For a linearly varying gravity field with the downward gravitational acceleration increasing with height or decreasing with height slowly, (i) <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from above is stable, (ii) <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> heated from below is unstable, and (iii) the circle theorem is modified depending on whether the gravitational acceleration is increasing or decreasing with height...|$|R

40|$|As a {{simplified}} approach for estimating theoretically {{the influence of}} local subsoils upon the ground motion during an earthquake, the problem <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idealized <b>layered</b> system subjected to vertically incident plane body waves was studied. Both the technique of steady-state analysis and the technique of transient analysis {{have been used to}} analyze the problem. In the steady-state analysis, a recursion formula has been derived for obtaining the response <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> system to sinusoidally steady-state input. Several conclusions are drawn concerning the nature of the amplification spectrum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonviscous <b>layered</b> system having its layer stiffnesses increasing with depth. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effect of layer parameters on the amplification spectrum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> system. In the transient analysis, two modified shear beam models have been established for obtaining approximately the response <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> system to earthquake -like excitation. The method of continuous modal analysis was adopted for approximate analysis of the models, with energy dissipation in the layers, if any, taken into account. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the models and the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> system in modifying the input motion. Conditions are established, under which the theory is applicable to predict the influence of local subsoils on the ground motion during an earthquake. To demonstrate the applicability of the models to actual cases, three examples of actually recorded earthquake events are examined. It is concluded that significant modification of the incoming seismic waves, as predicted by the theory, is likely to occur in well defined soft subsoils during an earthquake, provided that certain conditions concerning the nature of the incoming seismic waves are satisfied...|$|R
