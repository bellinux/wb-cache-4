40|$|Abstract [...] Stand tables provide {{number of}} trees per acre for each {{diameter}} class. This paper presents a general technique to predict a future <b>stand</b> <b>table,</b> {{based on the}} current <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> and future stand summary statistics such as trees and basal area per acre, and average diameter. The stand projection technique involves (a) predicting surviving trees for each class, and (b) growing tree diameters such that the <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> {{at the end of}} the growth period produces future stand summaries identical to those mentioned above. Linear and nonlinear diameter growth models produced similar results.

The new models were fit to 92, 882 observations from 153 permanent plots located in loblolly pine plantations and 33, 792 observations from 71 permanent plots located in slash pine plantations throughout east Texas. The new models were validated with 12, 750 observations from 22 permanent plots and 3, 724 observations from nine permanent plots located in loblolly and slash pine plantations, respectively. The validation data were used to select between the four methodologies. The results indicated that the new model based on the methodology of Cao and Baldwin (1999) produced the best results, based on error indexes calculated for trees per acre and basal area per acre at the <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> and diameter class levels across a range of projection lengths.

40|$|Many forest {{management}} planning decisions {{are based on}} information {{about the number of}} trees by species and diameter per unit area. This information is commonly summarized in a <b>stand</b> <b>table,</b> where a stand is defined as a group of forest trees of sufficiently uniform species composition, age, condition, or productivity to be considered a homogeneous unit for planning purposes. Typically information used to construct stand tables is gleaned from observed subsets of the forest selected using a probability-based sampling design. Such sampling campaigns are expensive and hence {{only a small number of}} sample units are typically observed. This data paucity means that stand tables can only be estimated for relatively large areal units. Contemporary {{forest management}} planning and spatially explicit ecosystem models require <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> input at higher spatial resolution than can be affordably provided using traditional approaches. We propose a dynamic multivariate Poisson spatial regression model that accommodates both spatial correlation between observed diameter distributions and also correlation between tree counts across diameter classes within each location. To improve fit and prediction at unobserved locations, diameter specific intensities can be estimated using auxiliary data such as management history or remotely sensed information. The proposed model is used to analyze a diverse forest inventory dataset collected on the United States Forest Service Penobscot Experimental Forest in Bradley, Maine. Results demonstrate that explicitly modeling the residual spatial structure via a multivariate Gaussian process and incorporating information about forest structure from LiDAR covariates improve model fit and can provide high spatial resolution <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> maps with associated estimates of uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} planned to compute growth by the lateral surface method (Russian method) {{and by the}} most {{commonly}} used conventional method, the <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> projection method, in an evenage stand of lodgepole pine (Pines contorta Dougl), near the school forest. One-quarter acre plots (40 plots) were taken at random to measure D. B. H., bark thickness, and heights of the trees.

The data were summarized into the <b>stand</b> <b>table,</b> placing the trees in one-inch classes, from 4. 5 inch to 21. 5 inch classes. The growth was computed by both methods and the results tested statistically. The study shows that there is no significant difference in quantity of growth in cubic feet by these two methods. The computa­tional procedure of the lateral surface method is less complicated, faster, and more economical in comparison with the <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> projection method, but it has only been employed in evenage stands.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Typically, when {{different}} forms of growth and yield models are considered, they are grouped into convenient discrete classes. As a heuristic device, I chose to use a contrasting perspective, that all growth and yield models are diameter distribution models that merely differ in regard to which diameter distribution is employed and how the distribution is projected to future conditions. I describe different diameter distributions, whether they are the classical contmuous diameter distributions, the implied distributions of whole-stand models, or the discrete diameter distributions of size-class or individual tree models. There are also intermediates between these types of diameter distributions. Aggregation vs. disaggregation describes the alternate poles for how diameter distributions can be projected to future conditions. There are intermediates between these extremes, as well. There are several alternatives that vary from the classical paradigms. One alternative is a continuous analog to <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> projection that employs a “distribution modifying function ” to project diameter distributions in time. One discrete variant of <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> projection is termed “non-naWe ” size class models, as they relax {{one or more of}} the assumptions of size class models. An “individual tree kernel ” model is one that uses a simple kernel function to distribute probability around an individual tree, rather than concentrate the probability at the measured diameter, as in typical individual tree models. Other variants are mentioned. These variants suggest that there is an infiite universe of alternative growth and yield models, and the classic labels for types of growth and yield models do not embrace these alternatives...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters for characterizing a forest stand is its <b>stand</b> <b>table.</b> In this thesis, the problem of estimating stand tables in stands with only a few sample plots (i. e. in small areas) is considered. An alternative estimation strategy to the common design-unbiased approach is proposed and it will be shown that drastic savings in mean squared error can be achieved by relaxing the restriction of unbiasedness. In contrast to previous works on small area estimation of stand tables, a com-posite estimator is suggested that takes into account the mean squared errors instead of only the variances of its component estimators. As component estima-tors serve the common design-unbiased estimator and a synthetic estimator that links external data by kernel smoothing. The weighting scheme of the proposed composite estimator is based on a weight estimator for estimating Schaible’s approximation to the optimal constant weighting scheme.

Most similar neighbour (MSN) approaches {{can be used for}} estimating stand tables from information commonly available on forest cover maps (e. g. height, volume, per cent canopy cover and species composition). Simulations were used to compare MSN (using an entire database) with two stratified MSN approaches. The first stratified MSN approach used species composition to partition the population into two inventory type strata, while the second stratified MSN approach used average stand age to partition the data into two stand development stages (strata). The MSN approach was used within the whole population and within each stratum to select a reference stand and to impute the ground variables of the reference stand to each target stand. Observed vs estimated stand tables were then compared for the stratified and non-stratified simulations. The imputation within a stratum did not result in better estimates than using the MSN approach within the whole population. Possible reasons for poor performance of stratified MSN are provided...|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} {{that there was a}} significant difference in sound CWD in LoD stands between burned and unburned splits, but not in sound CWD in HiD <b>stands</b> (<b>Table</b> 3). We believe this is due to a greater heterogeneity of fuel consumption in the HiD stands. In order to conduct the burns within prescribed weather and fuel moisture conditions, most burning occurred after the first rain of the fall season. The LoD stands were quite open and the fuels appear to have dried and burned more uniformly following the rains than the fuels in the HiD stands. Additionally, a component of each HiD stand was that 10 % to 15 % of the area was left in dense, unthinned patches of up to 0.8 ha (Oliver 2000). Many of these thickets did not dry sufficiently to burn and contributed to high variability in consumption of CWD in the HiD stands. Thus, even though the difference between burned and unburned HiD stands was not statistically significant, likely due to burn heterogeneity, there was a 57 % reduction in the total mass of sound CWD in the HiD burned <b>stands</b> (<b>Table</b> 2).|$|R

A {{theoretically}} based {{analytic model}} of plant growth in single species conifer communities {{based on the}} species fully occupying a site and fully using the site resources is introduced. Model derivations result in a single equation simultaneously describes changes over both, different site conditions (or resources available), and over time for each variable for each species. Leaf area or biomass, or a related plant community measurement, such as site class, {{can be used as}} an indicator of available site resources. Relationships over time (years) are determined by the interaction between a stable foliage biomass in balance with site resources, and by the increase in the total heterotrophic biomass of the stand with increasing tree size. This structurally based, analytic model describes the relationships between plant growth and each species ’ functional depth for foliage, its mature crown size, and stand dynamics, including the self-thinning. <b>Stand</b> <b>table</b> data for seven conifer species are used for verification of the model.

40|$|Growth and yield {{modeling}} has a {{long history}} in forestry. Methods of measuring the growth of uneven-aged forest stands have evolved from those developed in France and Switzerland during the last century. Furthermore, uneven-aged growth and yield modeling has progressed rapidly since the first models were pioneered by Moser and Hall (1969) (Moser Jr., J. W., Hall, O. F., 1969. For. Sci. 15, 183 – 188). Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands using both individual and stand-level approaches. Modeling methodology not only has moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based mechanistic approach, but also has incorporated a variety of techniques, such as, (1) systems of equations, (2) nonlinear <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> projections, (3) Markov chains, (4) matrix models, and (5) artificial neural network models. However, modeling the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands has received much less attention than that of even-aged stands. This paper reviews the current literature regarding growth and yield models for uneven-aged stands, discusses basic types of models and their merits, and reports recent progress in modeling the growth and dynamics of uneven-aged stands. Furthermore, future trends involving integration of new computer technologies (object-oriented programming and user-friendly interfaces), tree visualization techniques, and the spatially explicit application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) into uneven-aged modeling strategies are discussed. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|A cohort {{simulation}} model of forest growth and yield in the Solomon Islands is presented. The model takes <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> information of the 12 common big tree species and simulates recruitment, growth and mortality of cohorts through {{time on the}} basis of basal area increment functions and size-specific mortality estimates derived over 1964 - 1994 from permanent sample plots in natural forest on Kolombangara, Solomon Islands. A cohort is defined as a set of trees on the same plot which are deemed sufficiently similar in size and condition to be grouped for the purpose of simulation. Recruitment is modelled in a two-step process involving the calculation of a total number of new recruits to be added to a plot, followed by partitioning this total according to species-specific probability values. Total recruitment and species-specific probability values are derived from empirical data on recruitment of the 12 species onto the Kolombangara plots following a cyclone in 1967. The model allows harvesting to be simulated according to user-defined logging rules and felling cycle. Post-logging mortality is predicted from functions relating mortality of residual stems on the Kolombangara plots to the degree of disturbance caused by the 1967 cyclone, and both harvesting intensity and post-logging mortality are extrapolated forward into the prediction of recruitment after lag periods of 7 and 10. 5 years. The major limitation of the current model is that cohorts are updated according to parameters and functions obtained from plots in natural forest disturbed by a cyclone and not in managed forests disturbed by logging. Therefore we recommend that the model be used a tool for research and not as a guide to forest management. Future research should concentrate on developments of the framework model presented here, and collecting and analysing data from forests logged at known dates. </p...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Presentation date: 1986 - 04 - 28 Western hemlock-Sitka spruce forests, where prior precommercial {{thinning}} has occurred, constitute one of {{the most}} productive young-growth management types along the Pacific Coast from Oregon to southeast Alaska. These stands are ready for a first commercial thinning entry, however, {{the costs and benefits of}} such entries and resulting impacts at final harvest are not well documented. The purpose of this study was to provide appropriate harvesting, silviculture and economic data in a comprehensive evaluation of four alternative stand management treatments (three different thinning prescriptions with a basal area per acre removal ranging from 49 percent to 67 percent and a no-thin, control prescription) conducted on a 32 year old managed western hemlock-Sitka spruce plantation. A detailed logging production/cost study of Skyline thinning showed high harvesting cost and resulting negative stumpage values. Thinning treatments influenced harvesting costs; herringbone strip thinning costs 31 percent less than a conventional selective thinning method with the same volume removal. Also, a residual tree damage study, conducted during logging, showed that damage was considerably lower for strip thinning compared with selective thinning. Various logging techniques and crew skill levels influenced stand damage. An assessment of wind damage and tree growth rates was completed two years after skyline thinning. Annual windthrow losses totalled only 0. 28 trees per acre for all treatments and was significantly lower in strip thinning than selective thinning. Windthrow also appeared to be related to specific site, tree or stand conditions. Diameter growth increment rates declined in the unthinned units. However, in all thinned units, an immediate diameter growth response occurred. In the herringbone strip thinning method, trees exhibited a growth response regardless of distance from strip edge. A <b>stand</b> <b>table</b> projection model and harvest simulation model were used for determining costs and revenues from clearcutting at rotation age. Final harvest costs and revenues per cunit were similar for all treatments. The unthinned stand had the highest present net worth per acre. A sensitivity analysis of real interest rate changes along with changing harvesting cost and pond values during thinning or final harvest did not alter the outcome. Results of this study suggest that managed plantations of western hemlock-Sitka spruce can receive sufficient density control from precommercial thinning to maintain adequate stand development to a rotation age harvest without commercial thinning entries...|$|E
