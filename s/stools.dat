40|$|Background: <b>Stool</b> colour {{assessment}} is a screening method for biliary tract obstruction in infants. This study is aimed to be a {{proof of concept}} work of digital photograph image analysis of <b>stool</b> colour compared to colour grading by a colour card, and the <b>stool</b> bilirubin level test. Materials and Methods: The total bilirubin (TB) level contents in <b>stool</b> samples from 17 infants aged less than 1 year, seven with confirmed cholestatic jaundice and ten healthy subjects was measured, and outcome correlated with the physical colour of the <b>stool.</b> Results: The seven infants with cholestasis included 6 cases of biliary atresia and 1 case of pancreatic mass. All pre-operative <b>stool</b> samples in these cases were indicated as grade 1 on the <b>stool</b> card (<b>stool</b> colour in healthy infants ranges from 4 to 6). The average <b>stool</b> TB in the pale <b>stool</b> group was 43. 07 μg/g compared to 101. 78 μg/g in the non-pale <b>stool</b> group. Of the 3 colour channels assessed in the digital photographs, the blue and green light were best able to discriminate accurately between the pre-operative <b>stool</b> samples from infants with cholestasis and the samples from the healthy controls. With red, green, and blue (RGB) image analysis using wave level as the ANN input, the system predicts the <b>stool</b> TB with a relationship coefficient of 0. 96, compared to 0. 61 when <b>stool</b> colour card grading was used. Conclusion: Input from digital camera images of <b>stool</b> had a higher predictive capability compared to the standard <b>stool</b> colour card, indicating using digital photographs may be {{a useful tool for}} detection of cholestasis in infants...|$|R

5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft <b>stools</b> or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stool</b> {{energy losses}} and {{the sources of}} energy within the <b>stool</b> were {{determined}} in 20 healthy controls and 20 patients with cystic fibrosis while on their habitual pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment. <b>Stool</b> energy losses were equivalent to 3. 5 % of gross energy intake in healthy children (range 1. 3 - 5. 8 %). Despite a comparable gross energy intake, <b>stool</b> energy losses were three times greater in patients with cystic fibrosis than controls averaging 10. 6 % of gross energy intake (range 4. 9 - 19. 7 %). <b>Stool</b> lipid could account for only 29 % and 41 % of the energy within the <b>stool</b> in controls and patients with cystic fibrosis respectively and was poorly related to <b>stool</b> energy. Approximately 30 % of the energy within the <b>stool</b> could be attributable to colonic bacteria in both the healthy children and patients with cystic fibrosis. These results suggest that <b>stool</b> energy losses in healthy children are relatively modest but that even when patients with cystic fibrosis are symptomatically well controlled on pancreatic enzyme replacement, raised <b>stool</b> energy losses may continue to contribute towards an energy deficit sufficient to limit growth in cystic fibrosis.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these literary sources, various film scholars have suggested that Méliès was heavily influenced by other works, especially Jacques Offenbach's operetta Le voyage dans la lune (an unauthorized parody of Verne's novels) and the A Trip to the Moon attraction at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The French film historian Thierry Lefebvre hypothesizes that Méliès drew upon both of these works, but in different ways: {{he appears to have}} taken the structure of the film—"a trip to the moon, a moon landing, an encounter with extraterrestrials with a deformity, an underground trek, an interview with the Man in the Moon, and a brutal return to reality back on earth"—directly from the 1901 attraction, but also incorporated many plot elements (including the presence of six astronomers with pseudo-scientific names, telescopes that transform into <b>stools,</b> a moonshot cannon mounted above ground, a scene in which the moon appears to approach the viewer, a lunar snowstorm, an earthrise scene, and umbrella-wielding travelers), not to mention the parodic tone of the film, from the Offenbach operetta.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} <b>stool</b> characteristics (consistency and frequency) and gut transit time in children and {{to determine whether the}} Bristol <b>Stool</b> Form Scale is a reliable method of assessing intestinal transit rate in children. STUDY DESIGN: From March 2011 to March 2012, 44 children (25 boys and 19 girls, mean age 7. 8 years) with a diagnosis of functional constipation and 36 healthy, nonconstipated children (17 boys and 19 girls, mean age 7. 6 years) were enrolled. All participants maintained a 1 -week <b>stool</b> diary, recording the time and date of every bowel movement and <b>stool</b> form, and then completed a validated questionnaire on functional constipation according to Rome III criteria. Whole gut transit time (WGTT) was then assessed using the radiopaque markers test. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between <b>stool</b> form and WGTT in both constipated and nonconstipated children (correlation coefficient - 0. 84, P<. 001). By contrast, there was no correlation between either <b>stool</b> frequency and WGTT or <b>stool</b> frequency and <b>stool</b> form. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, using WGTT as a dependent variable, showed that the sole variable significantly associated with WGTT was <b>stool</b> form (regression coefficient 2. 9, OR 18. 4, 95 % CI 5. 4 - 62. 5, P<. 001). CONCLUSION: In this prospective, observational, case-control study, we show that <b>stool</b> form, as measured by the Bristol <b>Stool</b> Form Scale, rather than <b>stool</b> frequency, correlates with WGTT in both constipated and nonconstipated children...|$|R

Detection of C. difficile by anaerobic bacterial culture and/or cytotoxicity assays has been largely replaced by rapid enzyme immunoassays (EIA).

Six testing modalities were evaluated, including <b>stool</b> EIA, culture EIA, and real-time PCR (tcdA and tcdB) of cultured isolates and <b>stool</b> samples.

For newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients, <b>stool</b> IS 6110 -PCR had 86 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity compared with results obtained by sputum culture, and <b>stool</b> PCR had similar sensitivities for HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients (P = 0. 3).
