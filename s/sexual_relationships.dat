5|$|In general, {{speculative}} fiction {{on television}} and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. <b>Sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> in major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's early {{romantic and}} <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> were {{exclusively}} with men. Keynes {{had been in}} relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan. Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters. Keynes's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Macmillan's company first published his tract Economic Consequences of the Peace.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{produced}} by Tricky with assistance from Mark Saunders, who helped him utilize dub production techniques and heavily altered samples taken {{from a variety of}} musical sources. The record's groove-oriented and low-tempo sound incorporates elements from hip hop, soul, rock, ambient techno, reggae, and experimental music. The songs explore themes of cultural decline, dysfunctional <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships,</b> fear of intimacy, and recreational drug use. In writing them, Tricky drew on his experiences in the British drug culture and the influence of his deceased mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} couples, one of whom suffers from dementia, continuing with a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship,</b> their level of satisfaction with their <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> and the associations of remaining sexually active. DESIGN: A survey of married couples enrolled in a prospective dementia study. SETTING: Psychiatric services and a memory clinic. SAMPLE: The partners of 47 married patients with mild to moderate dementia. MEASURES: The assessment included the GMS/HAS/SDS package, the Marital Intimacy Scale (with some additional questions regarding sexual relations), the CAMCOG, the Carers Stress Scale, the Cornell Depression Scale and the Burns Symptom Checklist. Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R, McKhann, McKeith, Hachinski and HAS AGECAT criteria. RESULTS: Forty partners completed the study. Nine (22. 5 %) continued to have a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship,</b> {{all of whom were}} satisfied with the situation. Twelve (38. 7 %) of the carers who were not sexually active were dissatisfied with the absence of a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship.</b> There was a trend for male carers to be more likely to be involved in a continuing <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship.</b> Dissatisfaction with the absence of a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> was significantly associated with a diagnosis of vascular dementia in the patient and showed a trend towards an association with younger patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly a quarter of married dementia sufferers are involved in a continuing <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship,</b> emphasizing the importance of further research in this area...|$|R
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships,</b> or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Near the Congo River {{a female}} who participates in strong {{emotional}} or <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> with another female among the Nkundo people {{is known as}} yaikya bonsángo (a woman who presses against another woman). Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who {{played a central role}} in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> with anyone other than her husband.|$|E
5|$|The Joker is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships,</b> while Robinson believes that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. <b>Sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{downfall}} came {{shortly after}} she had recovered from her final miscarriage. Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy, adultery, or witchcraft remains {{a matter of debate}} among historians. Early signs of a fall from grace included the King's new mistress, the 28-year-old Jane Seymour, being moved into new quarters, and Anne's brother, George Boleyn, being refused the Order of the Garter, which was instead given to Nicholas Carew. Between 30 April and 2 May, five men, including Anne's brother, were arrested on charges of treasonable adultery and accused of having <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> with the queen. Anne was also arrested, accused of treasonous adultery and incest. Although the evidence against them was unconvincing, the accused were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536. At 8am on 19 May 1536, Anne, age 36, was executed on Tower Green.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships,</b> producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking {{in the back seat of}} the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E
