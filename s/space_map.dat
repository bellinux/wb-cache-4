40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>space</b> <b>mapping</b> is applied, {{for the first}} time, {{to the design of}} {{microwave}} dispersive delay structures (DDSs).

This understanding is translatable to understanding spatial localization in humans, a mammalian relative of the bat. Today, knowledge learned from neuroethology are being applied in new technologies.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} tuning <b>space</b> <b>mapping</b> (TSM) for computer-aided design and optimization of microwave circuits.

We exploit a coarse-mesh method of moments (MoM) solver as the coarse model and align it with the {{fine-mesh}} MoM solution through <b>space</b> <b>mapping.</b> We employ two plans: (I) implicit and output <b>space</b> <b>mapping,</b> and (II) input and output <b>space</b> <b>mapping.</b> We propose a local meshing method which avoids inconsistencies in the coarse model. The proposed techniques are implemented through our user-friendly <b>space</b> <b>mapping</b> framework (SMF) system. In a double annular ring antenna example, the S-parameter is optimized. The finite ground size effect for the MoM is efficiently solved by <b>space</b> <b>mapping</b> plan I and the design specification is satisfied after only three iterations.

50|$|Another {{definition}} of spatial network {{derives from the}} theory of space syntax. It can be notoriously difficult to decide what a spatial element should be in complex spaces involving large open areas or many interconnected paths. The originators of space syntax, Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson use axial lines and convex spaces as the spatial elements. Loosely, an axial line is the 'longest line of sight and access' through open space, and a convex space the 'maximal convex polygon' that can be drawn in open space. Each of these elements {{is defined by the}} geometry of the local boundary in different regions of the <b>space</b> <b>map.</b> Decomposition of a <b>space</b> <b>map</b> into a complete set of intersecting axial lines or overlapping convex spaces produces the axial map or overlapping convex map respectively. Algorithmic definitions of these maps exist, and this allows the mapping from an arbitrary shaped <b>space</b> <b>map</b> to a network amenable to graph mathematics to be carried out in a relatively well defined manner. Axial maps are used to analyse urban networks, where the system generally comprises linear segments, whereas convex maps are more often used to analyse building plans where space patterns are often more convexly articulated, however both convex and axial maps may be used in either situation.|$|E

50|$|Knudsen altered owls’ {{auditory}} cues by plugging one ear or {{removing the}} ruff feathers and preaural flaps. Initially this caused the birds to inaccurately judge sound source location, since the cues normally {{associated with each}} location in space had been changed. However, over time, the map shifted to restore a normal auditory sound map, aligned with the visual <b>space</b> <b>map,</b> despite the abnormal cues. New associations were formed between the abnormal cue values and the spatial locations they now represented, adjusting the map to translate the cues the bird was receiving into an accurate representation of its environment. This adjustment happens most rapidly and extensively in young birds. However, the map never perfectly reflects abnormal experience, even when cues are altered so early that the bird never experiences normal cues. This indicates {{that there is some}} innate “programming” of the map to reflect typical sensory experience.|$|E
40|$|A {{powerful}} {{concept in}} neuromodeling of microwave circuits based on <b>Space</b> <b>Mapping</b> technology is described. The ability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to model high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems is exploited {{in the implementation}} of the <b>Space</b> <b>Mapping</b> concept. By taking advantage of the vast set of empirical models already available for many microwave structures, <b>Space</b> <b>Mapping</b> based neuromodels decrease the number of EM simulations for training, improve the generalization and extrapolation performance and reduce the complexity of the ANN topology with respect to the conventional neuromodeling approach. Five innovative techniques are proposed to create <b>Space</b> <b>Mapping</b> based neuromodels for microwave circuits: <b>Space</b> <b>Mapped</b> Neuromodeling (SMN), Frequency-Dependent <b>Space</b> <b>Mapped</b> Neuromodeling (FDSMN), Frequency <b>Space</b> <b>Mapped</b> Neuromodeling (FSMN), Frequency Mapped Neuromodeling (FMN) and Frequency Partial-Space Mapped Neuromodeling (FPSM).

We contrast our approach with the conventional neuromodeling approach employed in the microwave arena, as well as with other state-ofthe-art neuromodeling techniques. We use Huber optimization to efficiently train the simple ANN that implements the mapping in our SM-based neuromodels.

50|$|Together with John Olsen and Steven Esterly, Knudsen {{studied the}} pattern of {{response}} to IID and ITD in the <b>space</b> <b>map.</b> They presented owls with sound stimuli while recordings were made from the optic tectum. Consistent with the previous findings regarding {{the organization of the}} optic tectum in terms of elevation and azimuth, they found that ITD varied primarily along the horizontal axis and IID along the vertical axis. However, the map according to elevation and azimuth does not line up perfectly with the ITD/IID map. Azimuth and ITD do not have a strictly linear relationship. In addition, IID is used not only to determine elevation of the sound source, but also, to a lesser degree, azimuth. Finally, IID and ITD are not the only two cues the owl uses to determine sound location, as shown by Knudsen’s research into the effect of bandwidth on sound localization accuracy. Information from multiple types of cues is used to create the map of elevation and azimuth in the optic tectum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effect of}} the mapping is that {{generalized}} (i.e. including zero curvature) -spheres in the base <b>space</b> <b>map</b> onto -blades, and so {{that the effect of}} a translation (or any conformal mapping) of the base space corresponds to a rotation in the higher-dimensional space. In the algebra of this space, based on the geometric product of vectors, such transformations correspond to the algebra's characteristic sandwich operations, similar to the use of quaternions for spatial rotation in 3D, which combine very efficiently. A consequence of rotors representing transformations is that the representations of spheres, planes, circles and other geometrical objects, and equations connecting them, all transform covariantly. A geometric object (a -sphere) can be synthesized as the wedge product of [...] linearly independent vectors representing points on the object; conversely, the object can be decomposed as the repeated wedge product of vectors representing [...] distinct points in its surface. Some intersection operations also acquire a tidy algebraic form: for example, for the Euclidean base space , applying the wedge product to the dual of the tetravectors representing two spheres produces the dual of the trivector representation of their circle of intersection.|$|E
