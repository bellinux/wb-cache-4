40|$|Renal <b>stone</b> disease <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by the differences depending on the age, gender, and the geographic location of the patients. Seventy-five percent of the renal <b>stone</b> components <b>is</b> the calcium (Ca). The {{most common type of}} the <b>stones</b> <b>is</b> the Ca oxalate stones, while Ca phosphate, uric acid, struvite, and sistine <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> more rarely reported. Other than these types, triamterene, adenosine, silica, indinavir, and ephedrine <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> also reported in the literature as case reports. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, aluminum hydroxide <b>stones</b> <b>was</b> not reported reported before. Herein we will report a 38 -years-old woman with the history of recurrent renal colic disease whose renal <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> determined as aluminum hydroxide stone in type. Aluminum mineral may be considered in the formation of kidney <b>stones</b> as it <b>is</b> widely used in the field of healthcare and cosmetics...|$|R

5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases if more than one of the same <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> picked up by the player. Each <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E

50|$|The Ardre image <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> re-used as paving {{under the}} wooden {{floors of the}} local church in the Ardre parish of Gotland. Before the {{historical}} significance of rune and image <b>stones</b> <b>was</b> understood or appreciated, they were often used as materials {{in the construction of}} roads, bridges, and buildings. The image <b>stones</b> <b>were</b> re-discovered when the church was being restored around 1900. The <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> now preserved in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm.|$|R

5|$|Two other fragmentary {{copies of}} the same decree were {{discovered}} later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees (the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of PtolemyIV, c. 218 BC). The Rosetta <b>Stone</b> <b>is,</b> therefore, no longer unique, {{but it was the}} essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term Rosetta <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Above the Lias is the Lower Oolite Series {{which are}} chiefly clays and oolitic limestone. The famous Bath <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> {{obtained}} from the Great Oolite bed. Oxford Clay is the chief member of the Middle Oolite Series; and above this are the Upper Cretaceous rocks with Gault, Upper Greensand and Chalk. Alluvial flats and peat bogs occupy much of the centre of Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in the bridges and the water tower, the structures are built in brick or stone. The <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> almost invariably red sandstone, obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas. Unless stated otherwise, the buildings (except the bridges and the water tower) are constructed in local red sandstone with slate roofs. Their locations {{can be found on}} the map of all coordinates.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> quarried {{in various}} parts of Wales, and slate {{quarrying}} has been a major industry in North Wales. The Cilgwyn Quarry was being worked in the 12th century, but later Blaenau Ffestiniog became the centre of production. The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing slates, though at a reduced capacity compared to its heyday, and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a visitor attraction. Several of the railways that used to carry the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions, including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.|$|E
40|$|The {{quarrying}} {{of stone}} began in prehistoric times. Later, <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> commonly used for walling and buildings in some regions. By the middle ages, quality <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> a nationally important commodity for high status buildings. <b>Stone</b> <b>was</b> also quarried and dressed to make millstones for processing cereals, and grindstones for honing edge tools and weapons...|$|R

5|$|The Black <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> {{attached}} to the east corner of the Kaaba, known as al-Rukn al-Aswad (the Corner of the Stone). Another stone, known as the Hajar as-Sa’adah (Stone of Felicity) is set into the Kaaba's opposite corner, al-Rukn al-Yamani (the Yemeni Corner), at a somewhat lower height than the Black Stone. The choice of the east corner may have had ritual significance; it faces the rain-bringing east wind (al-qabul) and the direction from which Canopus rises.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone {{proved to be the}} key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E

50|$|The {{date and}} {{location}} of discovery of the Majmuna <b>Stone</b> <b>are</b> unknown. It is traditionally held that the <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> found in an area known as Ta' Majmuna, between the Gozitan villages of Xewkija and Sannat. However, {{it is also possible}} that the <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> not found in Malta at all, and it might originate from Tunisia, North Africa.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to have been first created around the year 600, with most dating to after 1000 but before the Spanish conquest. The only method available for dating the carved <b>stones</b> <b>is</b> stratigraphy, but most <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> no longer in their original locations. The culture of the people who made them disappeared after the Spanish conquest.|$|R
5|$|The Singapore <b>Stone</b> <b>is</b> a {{fragment}} of a large sandstone slab which originally stood {{at the mouth of}} the Singapore River. The large slab, which is believed to date back to at least the 13th century and possibly as early as the 10th or 11th century, bore an undeciphered inscription. Recent theories suggest that the inscription is either in Old Javanese or in Sanskrit, which suggested a possibility that the island was an extension of the Majapahit civilisation in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{cross is}} thought to date from the tenth century, and {{exhibits}} distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle of Barry. The name of the <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> likely to derive from the extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy.|$|E
5|$|As of August 2015, {{access to}} see his white {{rectangular}} marble tomb slab is denied. His remains are not under the white slab, they are under a grey circular stone near his slab. Under this grey <b>stone</b> <b>is</b> a red brick staircase which leads to an underground burial chamber that was studied {{for the first time}} ever in 2004. In the chamber are many family members. Gian Gastone had a lead coffin in a wooden frame. It was replaced with a modern coffin. Near him are the remains of many De Medici children who were buried in unmarked graves. Some of them still have their garments.|$|E
50|$|Rocking stones (also {{known as}} logan <b>stones</b> or logans) <b>are</b> large <b>stones</b> that <b>are</b> so finely {{balanced}} that {{the application of}} just a small force causes them to rock. Typically, rocking <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> residual corestones formed initially by spheroidal weathering and have later been exposed by erosion or glacial erratics left by retreating glaciers. Natural rocking <b>stones</b> <b>are</b> found throughout the world. A few rocking <b>stones</b> might <b>be</b> man-made megaliths.|$|R
