The relationship between physical, apparatus-related deposition parameters, and the chemical characteristics of ESD coatings was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy {{to be able to}} deposit CaP coatings with tailored chemical properties. The results showed that the chemical characteristics of CaP coatings, deposited with use of the ESD technique, were strongly dependent on the deposition temperature, the nozzle-to-substrate distance, the liquid flow rate, and the geometry of the <b>spraying</b> <b>nozzle.</b> By investigating the influence of the deposition temperature, information could be obtained on the formation mechanism of CaP coatings-and specifically the biologically interesting carbonate apatite phase-using the ESD technique.

In particular, due to the necessity of reducing NOx emission established by Euro 5 standard (2009), Euro 6 (2014) and American Tier 4 (2014), new equipment were developed for diesel vehicles (truck as well as car). The most promising technology is called Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and takes advantage of the reduction feature of ammonia (NH 3) on NOx. As NH 3 cannot be stored directly within the vehicle for safety reasons (toxicity & flammability of ammonia) urea in water solution was selected to initiate the reaction by means of a <b>spraying</b> <b>nozzle.</b> To get {{a better understanding of the}} involved hot corrosion mechanisms and afterward to improve material selection, a dedicated laboratory test was developed at Isbergues Research Center.

A bare soil surface and a soil covered with an average of 79 percent corn residue were used in the comparison. Point injection was found to decrease losses due to a combination of volatilization, photodegradation, and runoff thus increasing persistence for alachlor and propachlor applied to soil. The relative persistence of atrazine applied to soil was found to be about the same for both application methods 21 days after application. Losses were higher for the herbicides sprayed on the corn residue as compared to point-injection into the soil;Weed control with the PIC and broadcast spray with disk incorporation was determined for various herbicides using oats as the test species.

40|$|In current {{viticulture}} {{protection of}} grapevine is obtained with uniform distribution of fungicides, typically repeated according a regular calendar. This continuous protection approach can easily result in {{ten to fifteen}} treatments per season in vineyards of several wine-producing regions. Primary infections exhibit nevertheless discrete foci, with uneven spatial distribution. Hence {{it can be argued}} that detection of symptoms at early disease stages and their targeted treatment would reduce the spread of the infection to wider patches in the vineyard, while enabling reduced use of pesticides. Within the UE-project CROPS, a modular and multifunctional agricultural robot system for specialty crops is being developed and one of the tasks that has to accomplished is selective spraying of diseases. The robotic system setup integrates a six degrees of freedom manipulator, an optical sensor system and a precision spraying actuator. After a brief description of the requirements of the system, this contribution gives a detailed description of its components and discusses the results obtained in first experiments. As case study we consider here the automatic detection and selective spraying of grapevine canopy areas exhibiting symptoms of powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator), one of the major diseases for this crop. Based on optical sensing feedback, the precision spraying actuator is positioned by the manipulator to selectively and accurately apply pesticides solely to infected areas. Disease foci identification and localization is based on on-the-go processing of images sensed by a multispectral camera inspecting the vertical structure of the grapevine canopy. At the end of the manipulator arm is located the precision spraying actuator, constituted by an axial fan with a flow straightener and an axially mounted <b>spraying</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The sprayer can deliver an air-carrier flow with an adjustable velocity, producing a circular spraying pattern of a constant diameter of 0. 15 m over a wide range of spraying distances.

40|$|Supercritical fluid {{technology}} is a well documented and emergent technology used in many industries today {{for the formation of}} micro- and nano- particles. The use of supercritical fluids allows synthesis of various types of particles since their properties can be varied with temperature or pressure, which sequentially can control the physical and chemical properties of the particles produced. Several different processes designed to generate powders and composites using supercritical fluids have been proposed in the past 20 years which can be used to synthesize materials with high performance specifications and unique functionality. In this research work, an extrusion micronization process using supercritical fluid has been proposed. This powder production technique could be a promising alternative to conventional techniques in terms of improvement in product quality as it provides a better control over particle size, morphology and particle size distribution, without degradation or contamination of the product. In addition, as extrusion is globally used for polymer production and processing, particle production by extrusion will allow production and processing in a single process step, eliminating the need for secondary particle production methods. 	The micronization process designed and described in this thesis involves a twin screw extruder equipped with a converging die and a high resistance <b>spraying</b> <b>nozzle</b> for particle production. A special CO 2 injection device and polymer collection chamber was designed for CO 2 supply and powder collection. To ensure complete dissolution of CO 2 into the polymer matrix, stable injection of CO 2, pressure generation and constant spray of micronized polymer particles, a special screw configuration was carefully designed for the extrusion process. The feasibility and the performance of this process have been demonstrated by experimental studies performed with low molecular weight polyethylene wax. Carbon dioxide at supercritical conditions was used as a solvent for processing the polymer. 	The generated polyethylene particles from the polyethylene wax/carbon dioxide solution system were analyzed and studied using an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, capillary rheometer and differential scanning calorimeter. A detailed study on the effects of the processing parameters, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate and supercritical fluid on properties of polyethylene particle produced was carried out. The particle size data collected using an optical microscope indicate a significant impact of temperature and CO 2 content on particle size. The obtained size data were utilized to generate particle size distribution plots and studied to analyze the effect of the processing variables. It was found that particle size distribution is affected by processing temperature and CO 2 content. Studies of the SEM images reveal that the morphology of particles can be controlled by varying processing variables like temperature, polymer feed rate and CO 2 content. 	The particles generated during this study indicate that particle production in an extrusion process using supercritical carbon dioxide is achievable and appears to be a promising alternative to conventional polymer particle production methods such as grinding, milling and other supercritical fluid-based precipitation methods. To validate and generalize the applicability of this process, micronization of other polymeric material should be performed. Commercialization of this technology will further require predictability and consistency of the characteristics of the product, for which a detailed understanding of the influence of all relevant process variables is necessary. In addition, development of theoretical models will further assist in the scale-up and commercialization of this supercritical fluid assisted micronization technology in the near future...|$|E
