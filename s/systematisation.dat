5|$|The first {{documented}} use {{of royal}} arms {{dates from the}} reign of Richard I (1189-1199). Lions had previously {{been used by the}} Norman dynasty as royal emblems, and much later, Attributed arms were retrospectively invented for kings who pre-dated the <b>systematisation</b> of hereditary English heraldry that occurred {{in the second half of}} the 12th century. Henry II (1133–1189) used a lion as his emblem, and may have used a coat of arms with a single lion or two lions, but no documentation of this survives. His children experimented with different combinations of lions on their arms. Richard I (1189–1199) used a single lion rampant, or perhaps two lions affrontés, on his first seal, but later used three lions passant in his 1198 Great Seal of England, and thus established the lasting design of the Royal Arms of England. In 1177, his brother John had used a seal depicting a shield with two lions passant guardant, but when he succeeded his brother on the English throne he would adopt arms with three lions passant or on a field gules, and these were used as the Royal Arms (or King's Arms) by John (1199–1216), Henry III (1216–1272), Edward I (1272–1307), and Edward II (1307–1327).|$|E

40|$|By {{studying}} the modes by which dialogue is inscribed in Le Cote de Guermantes, {{as well as}} the way it operates within the narrative discourse, we show that the sociolectal realism of this novel is derived mostly from the inscription and the circulation, within the fictional discourse, of pragmalinguistic and socio-ideological presuppositions obtaining in the "faubourg Saint-Germain" of the French III$ sp{ rm rd}$ Republic. Indeed, this novel absorbs and reproduces, in addition to a limited number of socially marked words or expressions, the role relationships, the power relationships, and, especially, the discursive strategies of the real world aristocratic ideology. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that if Proustian intratextual utterances undergo many <b>systematisations,</b> distortions and subjectivations promoting the insertion, within the dialogal component, of functional and structural characteristics of the description which modify the temporality of real dialogue and introduce pragmatico-structural modifications unthinkable in the real world, these <b>systematisations,</b> distortions and subjectivations partake of the text's aesthetic and ideological presuppositions, that is the anti-mimetism both of the characters' discourse in novels and of literature, the incapacity of language to reveal the truth directly...|$|R

40|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{significant}} aspects differentiating humans from other animals is the fact that we are inherently musical. Our compulsion to listen to and appreciate sound arrangements beyond the mere purposes of linguistic communication is extraordinary. From the discovery almost three thousand years ago of the direct relationship between the pitch of a note and the length of a string or pipe to the latest computer models of human musical cognition and intelligence, composers have increasingly looked to science to provide new and challenging ways to study and compose music. Music is generally associated with the artistic expression of emotions, but it is clear that reason plays an important role in music making. For example, the ability to recognise musical patterns and to make structural abstractions and associations requires sophisticated memory mechanisms, involving the conscious manipulation of concepts and subconscious access to intuitive knowledge. One of the finest examples of early rational approaches to music composition appeared in the 11 th century, when Guido d’Arezzo proposed a lookup chart for assigning pitch to the syllables of religious hymns. He also invented the musical stave for systematic notation of music and established the medieval music scales known as the church modes. Any attempt at distinguishing the rational from the intuitive in musical composition needs to take into account the music technology of the time. Between d’Arezzo’s charts and the first compositional computer programs that appeared in the early 1950 s, countless <b>systematisations</b> of music for com-position purposes were proposed. The use of the computer as a composition tool thus continues the tradition of Western musical thought that was initi-ated approximately a thousand years ago. The computer is a powerful tool for the realisation of abstract design constructs, enabling composers to create musical <b>systematisations</b> and judge whether they have the potential to pro...|$|R
60|$|In a {{very obvious}} way, {{sociology}} seemed to Comte to crown the edifice of the sciences; {{it was to}} be to the statesman what pathology and physiology were to the doctor; and one gathers that, for the most part, he regarded it as an intellectual procedure in no way differing from physics. His classification of the sciences shows pretty clearly that he thought of them all as exact logical <b>systematisations</b> of fact arising out of each other in a synthetic order, each lower one containing the elements of a lucid explanation of those above it--physics explaining chemistry; chemistry, physiology; physiology, sociology; and so forth. His actual method was altogether unscientific; but through all his work runs the assumption that in contrast with his predecessors he is really being as exact and universally valid as mathematics. To Herbert Spencer--very appropriately since his mental characteristics make him the English parallel to Comte--we owe the naturalisation of the word in English. His mind being of greater calibre than Comte's, the subject acquired in his hands a far more progressive character. Herbert Spencer was less unfamiliar with natural history than with any other branch of practical scientific work; and it was natural he should turn to it for precedents in sociological research. His mind was invaded by the idea of classification, by memories of specimens and museums; and he initiated that accumulation of desiccated anthropological anecdotes that still figures importantly in current sociological work. On the lines he initiated sociological investigation, what there is of it, still tends to go.|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty {{as to the}} legal consequences of software linking, in other words incorporating one computer program by reference into another, in relation to copyright: The substantive argument made in this work is that, in the European Union, these claims would be most naturally assessed as alteration under Article 4 (1) (b) of the Computer Programs Directive 2009 / 24, which provides that the exclusive rights of the right holder include {{the right to do}} or to authorise any alteration of a computer program. Such a proposition raises two issues. First is theoretical: Can the act of developing a computer program that makes calls to another program so as to utilise code contained therein constitute alteration {{in the sense that it}} would be an act of primary infringement? If so, the tort is complete before operation of the programs on the users' computer. Secondly, how, and according to which crite- ria, should software linking be assessed in practice? This thesis proposes a framework for the above in accordance with the copyright law of the EU. The methods used in the present study consist of doctrinal research calling on authorities and commentary from several jurisdictions in Europe and the United States. This involves legislation and legislative materials as well as case law of European and national courts, on which interpretations and <b>systematisations</b> build. The us provides valuable data with which to test the propositions, but this is not a comparative review; examination of foreign law is subservient to the doctrinal enquiry. The main conclusions set forth a logical test, consisting both of substance and of form, which proceeds from the existence of a protected work and a restricted act via a balancing stage of substantial similarity to possible defences. Instead of bright-line rules, the assessment must be based on more flexible legal standards. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

In {{the highly}} {{saturated}} global fashion industry, clothing brands {{attempt to create}} and sustain the illusion of uniqueness and exclusivity by deploying a multitude of artificial, both time- and volume-related product shortages, allegedly select shopping experiences and ever accelerating launch intervals of new collections. One of those ephemeral forms of customer inspiration represents the new phenomenon of temporary popup-stores. Since pop-up-stores constitute a novel and still immature store format, little scientific {{research has been conducted}} to date. Existing academic articles limit their analyses to general <b>systematisations</b> and the appraisal of isolated, recurrent success factors such as the location or store design. This paper analyses both the existing pop-up-retail literature and empirical studies in related disciplines for critical success factors of pop-up-stores, identifies relevant dimensions of success and eventually proposes a success factors model, hierarchically structured into a macro and a micro level. The model's consistency is subsequently challenged using two explorative case studies from the international fashion industry. This approach demonstrates the model's suitability for practical application, the latter serving not only descriptive and explicative functions, but also managerial purposes by offering concrete guidelines to executives of pop-up-stores in terms of the strategic conception, operational execution and subsequent performance evaluation...|$|R

His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the social Darwinist paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the Western civilisation. In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that Calvinist (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the social innovation and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the rationalism of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational <b>systematisation</b> and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise. In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in magic, or what he referred to as [...] "disenchantment of the world".|$|E

60|$|This {{arrangement}} of the sciences and the Law of the Three States are together explanatory of the course of human thought and knowledge. They are thus the double key of Comte's <b>systematisation</b> of the philosophy of all the sciences from mathematics to physiology, and his analysis of social evolution, which {{is the basis of}} sociology. Each science contributes its philosophy. The co-ordination of all these partial philosophies produces the general Positive Philosophy. 'Thousands had cultivated science, and with splendid success; not one had conceived the philosophy which the sciences when organised would naturally evolve. A few had seen the necessity of extending the scientific method to all inquiries, but no one had seen how this was to be effected.... The Positive Philosophy is novel as a philosophy, not as a collection of truths never before suspected. Its novelty is the organisation of existing elements. Its very principle implies the absorption of all that great thinkers had achieved; while incorporating their results it extended their methods.... What tradition brought was the results; what Comte brought was the organisation of these results. He always claimed to be the founder of the Positive Philosophy. That he had every right to such a title is demonstrable to all who distinguish between the positive sciences and the philosophy which co-ordinated the truths and methods of these sciences into a doctrine' (G. H. Lewes).|$|E
60|$|The {{elaborate}} and minute <b>systematisation</b> of life, proper to {{the religion of}} Humanity, is to be directed by a priesthood. The priests are to possess neither wealth nor material power; they are not to command, but to counsel; their authority is to rest on persuasion, not on force. When religion has become positive and society industrial, then {{the influence of the}} church upon the state becomes really free and independent, which was not the case in the Middle Age. The power of the priesthood rests upon special knowledge of man and nature; but to this intellectual eminence must also be added moral power and a certain greatness of character, without which force of intellect and completeness of attainment will not receive the confidence they ought to inspire. The functions of the priesthood are of this kind:--To exercise a systematic direction over education; to hold a consultative influence over all the important acts of actual life, public and private; to arbitrate in cases of practical conflict; to preach sermons recalling those principles of generality and universal harmony which our special activities dispose us to ignore; to order the due classification of society. To perform the various ceremonies appointed by the founder of the religion. The authority of the priesthood is to rest wholly on voluntary adhesion, and there is to be perfect freedom of speech and discussion; though, by the way, we cannot forget Comte's detestable congratulations to the Czar Nicholas on the 'wise vigilance' with which he kept watch over the importation of Western books.|$|E
60|$|Yet we {{know that}} with Mr. Mill as with Turgot this deep {{distrust}} of sect was no hindrance to the most careful <b>systematisation</b> of opinion and conduct. He did not interpret many-sidedness in the flaccid watery sense which flatters the indolence {{of so many of}} our contemporaries, who like to have their ears amused with a new doctrine each morning, to be held for a day, and dropped in the evening, and who have little more seriousness in their intellectual life than the busy insects of a summer noon. He says that he looked forward 'to a future which shall unite the best qualities of the critical with the best qualities of the organic periods; unchecked liberty of thought, unbounded freedom of individual action in all modes not hurtful to others; but also convictions as to what is right and wrong, useful and pernicious, deeply engraven on the feelings by early education and general unanimity of sentiment, and so firmly grounded in reason and the true exigencies of life, that they shall not, like all former and present creeds, religious, ethical, and political, require to be periodically thrown off and replaced by others' (p. 166). This was in some sort the type at which he aimed in the formation of his own character--a type that should combine organic with critical quality, the strength of an ordered set of convictions, with that pliability and that receptiveness in face of new truth, which are indispensable to these very convictions being held intelligently and in their best attainable form. We can understand the force of the eulogy on John Austin (p. 154), that he manifested 'an equal devotion to the two cardinal points of Liberty and Duty.' These are the correlatives in the sphere of action to the two cardinal points of Criticism and Belief in the sphere of thought.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{as to the}} {{maintenance}} of that coherency, interdependence, and <b>systematisation</b> of opinions and motives, which is said to make character organic, and is therefore so highly prized by some schools of thought. No doubt the loosening of this or that {{part of the fabric of}} heterogeneous origin, which constitutes the character of a man or woman, tends to loosen the whole. But do not let us feed ourselves upon phrases. This organic coherency, what does it come to? It signifies in a general way, to describe it briefly, a harmony between the intellectual, the moral, and the practical parts of human nature; an undisturbed cooperation between reason, affection, and will; the reason prescribing nothing against which the affections revolt, and proscribing nothing which they crave; and the will obeying the joint impulses of these two directing forces, without liability to capricious or extravagant disturbance of their direction. Well, if the reason were perfect in information and method, and the affections faultless in their impulse, then organic unity of character would be the final consummation of all human improvement, and it would be criminal, even if it were possible, to undermine a structure of such priceless value. But short of this there can be no value in coherency and harmonious consistency as such. So long as error is an element in it, then for so long the whole product is vitiated. Undeniably and most fortunately, social virtues are found side by side with speculative mistakes and the gravest intellectual imperfections. We may apply to humanity the idea which, as Hebrew students tell us, is imputed in the Talmud to the Supreme Being. God prays, the Talmud says; and his prayer is this,--'Be it my will that my mercy overpower my justice.' And so with men, with or without their will, their mercifulness overpowers their logic. And not their mercifulness only, but all their good impulses overpower their logic. To repeat the words which I have put into the objector's mouth, we do not always work out every vicious principle to its remotest inference. What, however, is this but to say that in such cases character is saved, not by its coherency, but by the opposite; to say not that error is useful, but what is a very different thing, that its mischievousness is sometimes capable of being averted or minimised? ...|$|E
