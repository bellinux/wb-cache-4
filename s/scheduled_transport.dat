[...] Using Zeppelins, the world's first airline, DELAG, was established in Germany in 1910, operating pleasure cruises rather than a <b>scheduled</b> <b>transport</b> service: by the outbreak of war in 1914 1588 flights had been made carrying 10,197 fare-paying passengers.

[...] Germany was alone in constructing rigid airships, and airship development elsewhere concentrated on non-rigid and semi-rigid designs. [...] The only British attempt to construct a large rigid aiship, HMANo.1, broke its back before making a single flight and was abandoned, and the single French-built rigid was not much more successful.|$|E

The assumption that harvesters serviced by road transport are effectively operating from the rail siding from which their bins are supplied seems a reasonable {{starting point for the}} analysis. There is a need to manually modify the schedule {{to take into account the}} road <b>transport</b> <b>schedule</b> to ensure that full bins are not collected before the road transport system delivers them back to the rail siding...|$|R

50|$|Fenualoa is {{the second}} largest island in the Reef Islands, {{administratively}} located in the Solomon Islands province of Temotu. At low tide, Fenualoa {{is connected to the}} neighboring island of Nifiloli to the north. The west side of the island is mainly sandy beaches facing the huge lagoon and the Great Reef. The east side is steep rocky cliffs with the deep Forest Passage separating Fenualoa from the largest island of the group Lomlom. The island is very densely populated with four main villages, each made up of sub-villages and total approximately 1500 inhabitants (2008), all {{on the west side of}} the 8 km by 600m long and thin island. The largest villages are Tuo (Tuwo), Maluba, Tanga and Malapu (running south to north). There are three schools on the island and the people are Melanesian. A few yachts (1 or 2 per year) visit the island by entering the huge lagoon through the Great Reef (the lagoon is approximately 25 km east west by 8 km north south).

50|$|In 1724 the Spanish Crown {{decided to}} {{establish}} a settlement {{on the east coast}} of Río de la Plata, with a view to countering the dominance of Portugal, which had contravened the Treaty of Tordesillas to found the Colonia de Sacramento opposite Buenos Aires.The building of the city, called San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo, was completed towards the end of 1726. At this time, both Montevideo and Buenos Aires were virtually isolated from the other Spanish colonies in America. As early as 1748, the Governor of Buenos Aires organised <b>scheduled</b> <b>transport</b> services between that city and the villages within Peru and Chile. The first mail service, called El Príncipe, reached the port of Montevideo in May 1767. The regulations stated that the mailbags were to be delivered to the port of Montevideo, where the correspondence for Buenos Aires was transferred to launches. In 1785 a weekly overland service was introduced between Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The correspondence was carried in three launches called chasqueras (boats) as far as Colonia del Sacramento, where it was transferred to Montevideo by military couriers.|$|E

40|$|In a {{horizontal}} product differentiation model, it is {{shown that a}} stable service pattern in <b>scheduled</b> <b>transport</b> competition only exists if consumers are sufficiently sensitive {{to the quality of}} non-scheduling service characteristics.

40|$|<b>Scheduled</b> <b>transport</b> operators' pricing, {{departure}} {{timing and}} frequency decisions are analysed in a horizontal product differentiation model with two dimensions. The first dimension concerns {{the availability of a}} departure at the preferred time of consumers. The second dimension concerns exogenous quality differentiation between operators' services. This model shows that operators choose intervals between their own departures that minimise consumers' waiting costs, and set prices that do not depend on the level of competition in terms of frequency. Operators do not have a strategic incentive to duplicate each other's departures and choose similar frequencies. The combined schedule of operators' individual schedules shows interlaced departures in which a departure from one operator is followed by a departure from the other. © 2006 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|E
