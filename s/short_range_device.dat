40|$|The {{frequency}} response of an implantable antenna {{is key to}} the performance of a wireless implantable sensor. If the antenna detunes significantly, there are substantial power losses resulting in loss of accuracy. One reason for detuning is because of a change in the surrounding environment of an antenna. The pulsating anatomy of the human heart constitutes such a changing environment, so detuning is expected but this has not been quantified dynamically before. Four miniature implantable antennas are presented (two different geometries) along with which are placed within the heart of living swine the dynamic reflection coefficients. These antennas are designed to operate in the <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>devices</b> frequency band (863 - 870 MHz) and are compatible with a deeply implanted cardiovascular pressure sensor. The measurements recorded over 27 seconds capture the effects of the beating heart on the frequency tuning of the implantable antennas.

The impact of pulsating anatomy on antenna design and the need for wideband implantable antennas is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the rapid}} growth in {{wireless}} data traffic has posed not only unique opportunities but also great challenges for the wireless industry. In {{order to meet the}} growing demand without excessive cost or energy consumption, one feasible option for the operators is to acquire more spectrum for wireless communication. Unlike the lengthy allocation process for exclusive spectrum licenses, secondary spectrum access is deemed as a flexible alternative to obtain additional spectrum at low cost. In particular, the VHF/UHF TV band, so called ’TV White Space’, is considered as the most promising candidate for secondary access thanks to its well defined primary usage and favorable propagation characteristic for building penetration and wide area coverage. Therefore, secondary access in the TV band has been extensively studied by both academic and industry. Most of the research have focused on the detection of ’spectrum holes’ with sensing technologies, while a few others have provided high level analysis of the potential of TV white space with simplistic secondary interference model for single secondary user. Only A limited number of studies have investigated aggregate interference from multiple secondary users, but even these studies have ignored the adjacent channel interference from secondary users close to the TV receivers. Thus, in this thesis we first concentrate on examining the effect of harmful interference on TV reception from <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>devices</b> transmitting on adjacent channels, and model the accumulative effect of multi-channel interferences observed in the measurement. Then the basic methodology for evaluating the potential of TV white space is developed {{in the second part of}} the thesis, where we propose a new analytical approach for regulating the secondary transmit power that significantly outperforms the existing method in the regulatory framework. Finally, we combine the aggregate interference model and the basic regulation methodology to extend the analysis from single user to multiple user case, first with only users transmitting on different adjacent TV channels and later also including users transmitting on co-channels. Our performance evaluation have shown that the effect of adjacent channel interference at close distance is far from negligible and the accumulative effect of multi-channel interferences has substantial impact on the scalability of a secondary system. In fact, the adjacent channel interference proves to be the primary limiting factor of the TV white space availability for low power <b>short</b> <b>range</b> systems. Nonetheless, because the proposed approach can adapt to varying environmental conditions and consequently utilize the spectrum reuse opportunity more efficiently than existing frameworks, we can still note considerable amount of TV white space available for <b>short</b> <b>range</b> secondary <b>devices.</b> QC 20121106 QUASA...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- In ad hoc networks, {{devices are}} {{required}} to selforganize themselves into a network without previously established infrastructure. The kind of ad hoc network we consider in this paper {{is made up of}} a multitude of relatively low mobility, <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> wireless <b>devices,</b> pervasively deployed throughout the environment. One of the most important design criteria for this type of network is energy efficiency. This paper looks at the energy efficiency aspect of the system design. Specifically, this paper looks at the optimum one-hop transmission distance that will minimize the total system energy. The analysis assumes that the individual devices do not have power control, but that the transmission range of all the devices as a group can be varied in the design stage. The results show that the optimum one-hop transmission distance is independent of the physical network topology, the number of transmission sources, and the total transmission distance. It only depends on the propagation environment and the device parameters. With this result, some system design trade offs can be made to minimize the total system energy. We discuss what these parameters are, how they interact with each other, and how they can be used to obtain an energy efficient wireless system. We also discuss the implications this result has for future developments of low bit rate, <b>short</b> <b>range,</b> and highly dense wireless devices for ad hoc networks. I...|$|R

Therefore, the analytical model refers to the inquiry process described in the official Bluetooth standard protocol version 1. 2 and thus includes a specific mode - named interlaced scan mode-which was introduced to speed up discovery times.
