50|$|Early {{into the}} 19th century, the {{settlement}} {{began to grow}} around the Adams’ mill as more settlers, mostly Loyalists and Scottish or Irish immigrants, established homesteads on the surrounding land. At this point, the settlement was home to a gristmill and a sawmill, later accompanied by an oat kiln and <b>stone</b> <b>flour</b> mill. By the 1840s, the sons of Gideon and Joel Adams inherited the land {{of what was to}} be the village of Ventnor; the settlement had by this time a blacksmith, a carriage shop, a general store and a hotel. During the 1850s, land was surveyed and divided into lots, and plans and maps were created detailing the further development of the village of Adams. In 1864, the village established its own post office, which ultimately led to its name change; Adams was deemed unacceptable by postal authorities as another village named Adams existed within Ontario. Ventnor was allegedly randomly chosen from a list of suggested untaken names given by Canada Post, and the village was immediately renamed Ventnor.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{investigated the}} impact of the particle shape of organic additives on the anisotropy of a clay ceramic and its thermal and mechanical properties. The impact of the particle shape was elucidated by addition in the clay ceramic mixture of Olive <b>Stone</b> <b>Flour</b> (OSF) in the form of powder and Wheat Straw (WS) in the form of fibers. The OSF powder reduced the clay ceramic anisotropy with a formation of round shape pores during the firing process. The flexural strength of the clay ceramic was improved by 13 % in case of an 8 wt% addition of OSF. On the other hand, the WS fibers increased the anisotropy by the formation of orientated pores along the extrusion plane. The thermal diffusivity of the clay ceramic was improved by 41 % {{in the direction of the}} thermal gradient of the walls in case of an 8 wt% addition of WS. Hence, this study proved the particle shape of the organic additives as a useful parameter to control the anisotropy of clay ceramics and improve their thermal and mechanical properties.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study on a clay ceramic used for building applications. The thermal and mechanical properties of the clay ceramic were improved by addition of organic additives. The organic additives consisted of Olive <b>Stone</b> <b>Flour</b> (OSF), with round-shape particles of 55 µm, and Wheat Straw (WS), with 877 µm particles in the form of fibers. It was found that the combustion of OSF and WS resulted in a porosity formation during the firing process. The morphology of these pores corresponded to that of the organic additives. Therefore, the addition of small OSF particles decreased the median pore size of the clay ceramic. It improved the mechanical strength of the clay ceramic by 12 % for an 8 wt% addition of OSF. On the other hand, the WS fibers increased the clay ceramic anisotropy. This resulted in a 41 % improvement of the thermal conductivity using an 8 wt% addition of WS. Finally, a model was developed from these experimental results to predict the thermal conductivity and the mechanical strength of the clay ceramic with other organic additives. They were predicted from the parameters of the organic additives (i. e., true density, swelling degree, particle size distribution, particle shape factor). The predictions indicated that the thermal conductivity is improved by 50 % with a 25 % improvement of the mechanical strength using small organic fibers, which is a step forward in the development of fired clay bricks {{that can be used for}} both insulation and structure purposes in building applications...|$|E

The specific variety, called the Criolla or Mission grape, was first planted at Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1779; in 1783, the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from the mission's winery.

We find, in the oldest records of Egypt, that each woman then ground her own grain between two <b>stones,</b> mixed the <b>flour</b> with water and then baked it on hot stones or in the ashes. But by the time the Isrealites came to Egypt, leavened bread was in common use. The yeast plant, that we know now, was grown by the ancient Greeks. Microscopic examination of bread found in buried Pompeii shows the form of yeast that we use to-day. The pure strong yeast to be found in all markets and the carefully milled flour of the present time make possible a bread unobtainable among barbarians or any less civilized people. In spite of all this, poor bread is lamentably common. Good light bread is a palatable, digestible and nutritious food, and from an economical as well as dietetical standpoint holds an important, one may almost say first, place among our foods...|$|R
