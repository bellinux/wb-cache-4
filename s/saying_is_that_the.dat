2500|$|For filmmakers to {{do justice}} to the biblical {{accounts}} of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism. Absent such scholarly and theological understanding, productions such as The Passion could likely falsify history and fuel the animus of those who hate Jews. Rabbi Daniel Lapin, the head of the Toward Tradition organization, criticized this statement, and said of Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL, [...] "what he is <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate your faith".|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{all these}} {{characteristics}} {{of our own}} society mark tendencies that are common enough in all societies. They often spring from an indolence and enervation that besets {{a certain number of}} people, however invigorating the general mental climate may be. What we are now <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> general mental climate itself has, outside of the domain of physical science, ceased to be invigorating; that, on the contrary, it fosters the more inglorious predispositions of men, and encourages a native willingness, already so strong, to acquiesce in a lazy accommodation with error, an ignoble economy of truth, and a vicious compromise of the permanent gains of adhering to a sound general principle, {{for the sake of the}} temporary gains of departing from it.|$|E
60|$|According to that hypothesis, {{two factors}} are at work, {{variation}} and selection. Next to nothing {{is known of}} the causes of the former process; nothing whatever of the time required for the production of a certain amount of deviation from the existing type. And, as respects selection, which operates by extinguishing all but a small minority of variations, we have not the slightest means of estimating the rapidity with which it does its work. All that we are justified in <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rate at which it takes place may vary almost indefinitely. If the famous paint- root of Florida, which kills white pigs but not black ones, were abundant and certain in its action, black pigs might be substituted for white in the course of two or three years. If, on the other hand, it was rare and uncertain in action, the white pigs might linger on for centuries.|$|E

[...] This belief, in more barbaric shape, still survives in the Greek islands.* [...] "The sun is still to them a giant, like Hyperion, bloodthirsty when tinged with gold.

Beginning with 8th-century historical records, monkeys were sacred mediators between gods and humans; around the 13th century, monkeys also became a [...] "scapegoat" [...] metaphor for tricksters and dislikable people. These roles gradually shifted until the 17th century, when the monkey usually represented the negative side of human nature, particularly people who foolishly imitate others. Japanese anthropologist Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:59-60) explains the idiom saru wa ke ga sanbon tarinai (猿わ毛が三本足りない, [...] "a monkey is human minus three pieces of hair"): [...] "The literal meaning of this <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monkey is a lowly animal {{trying to be a}} human and therefore is to be laughed at.

30|$|Urban {{organisation}} actually undergoes {{the effects}} of continuous alternation between order and disorder. In {{the context in which}} the two concepts will be used in this paper it is not possible to imagine them as alternatives, but they are taken as dialectically constituting territorial reality. “Order” and “disorder” oppose each other but do not clash with each other. In the hectic organisation of urban and territorial reality one stimulates the other and each, in opposing, determines change. What we mean to <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inclination towards order (or tendency towards order) tends, on the one hand, to “repair” the disorder but, on the other, brings out the conditions for disorder to show itself again and materialise with its problems but with the vitality implicit in change.|$|R
