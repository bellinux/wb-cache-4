40|$|Chocolate is a {{suspension}} of solid particles (sugar, cocoa solids and milk solids) {{in a continuous}} fat phase. Chocolate manufacturing is complex and requires a combination of several ingredients and technological operations to achieve the desired rheological, textural and melting qualities. Cocoa nibs contribute which around 30 % of the final chocolate fat content. Particle size distribution is a key determinant of the flow (rheological) properties in chocolates with a direct influence on sensory perception. Quality in finished chocolates is highly dependent on inherent size distribution of solid particles, composition of fat phase and emulsifiers. The rheological parameters (yield stress and plastic viscosity) of chocolates is usually quantified during processing, mainly through Casson model. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate structural chocolates characteristics made with different fat content and particles size by three steps test. The rheological behavior of the formulations was determined by a Haake MARS rheometer at 40 ◦C with the test (CR) taken in three steps: (1) 0, 00 1 /s a 65, 00 1 /s, t = 180 s; (2) 65, 00 1 /s, t = 60 s; (3) 65, 00 1 /s a 0, 00 1 /s, t = 180 <b>s.</b> <b>Fat</b> content and quality as well particles size were determined.

40|$|The gregarious braconid wasp Cotesia congregata parasitizes host larvae of Manduca sexta, {{and several}} other sphingid species. Parasitism induces host {{immunosuppression}} due to the disruptive action of the wasp 2 ̆ 7 s polydnavirus (PDV) on host blood cells. During {{the initial stages of}} parasitism, these cells undergo apoptosis followed by cell clumping, which clears the hemolymph {{of a large number of}} cells. In this study, the persistence and expression of Cotesia congregata PDV (CcPDV) were examined using Southern and Nor-them blots, respectively. Digoxygenin-labelled total polydnaviral DNA was used to probe genomic DNA isolated from fat body and brains of hosts with emerged wasps taken 6 days following egress of the parasitoids, and significant cross-hybridization between the host fat body genomic DNA with viral DNA was seen. Thus, the virus persists in the host for the duration of parasitism. even during the post-emergence period, and may even be integrated in the host caterpillar DNA. Viral gene expression was examined using Northern blots and probes to the Cotesia rubecula CrV 1 homolog, and the CrV 1 -like mRNAs were expressed as early as 4 h post-parasitization for at least 72 h and faint hybrization is even seen at the time the wasps eclose. In contrast, in Pieris rapae larvae the CrV 1 transcript is expressed only for a brief time, during which time hemocyte function is disrupted. The effect is transitory, and hemocytes regain their normal functions after the parasites emerge as first instars. The genome of CcPDV contains one copy of the CrV 1 -like homolog as shown on Southern blots of viral genomic DNA. In conjunction with our earlier studies of the PDV-encoded early protein 1, the current work suggests multiple viral transcripts are produced following parasitization of the host. and likely target host hemocytes to induce their apoptosis, thereby preventing encapsulation of the parasitoid 2 ̆ 7 s eggs.

Também se estudou os parâmetros bioquímicos séricos, hematológicos e histológicos de ratos alimentados com dietas à base de mortadelas para se avaliar o potencial toxicológico da ingestão de produtos cárneos formulados com sangue tratado com CO, uma vez que esta informação não está disponível na literatura. Os valores de lipídios e proteínas das mortadelas com diferentes níveis de adição de sangue não diferiram (P> 0, 05) entre si. O aminograma das mortadelas mostrou que todas apresentaram escore químico maior que 100 %, indicando ausência de aminoácidos limitantes. Os resultados do PDCAAS não indicaram diferença entre as mortadelas. A qualidade protéica foi avaliada por ensaios biológicos em ratos pela determinação do Coeficiente de Eficiência Protéica (PER), da Razão Protéica Líquida (NPR) e da digestibilidade verdadeira. Os valores de PER, PER Relativo, NPR e NPR Relativo das dietas à base de mortadelas não diferiram (P> 0, 05) daqueles obtidos para a dieta à base de caseína. Entre as mortadelas, aquela formulada com nível de 15 % de sangue apresentou valores de PER, PERR, NPR e NPRR superiores (P 0, 05) em relação àqueles submetidos à dieta de caseína. Também não houve diferença (P> 0, 05) entre os níveis de sangue quanto ao teor de hemoglobina. Os exames macro e microscópico dos animais não mostraram alteração anatomopatológica que pudesse ser atribuída ao efeito do CO sobre órgãos e tecidos analisados. O ensaio para o estudo do efeito do CO sobre dosagem sanguínea de carboxiemoglobina (COHb) mostrou que as concentrações não variaram (P> 0, 05) em função dos níveis de sangue adicionados na mortadela. O aumento na adição de sangue promoveu elevação (P 0, 05) na recuperação de hemoglobina e comparável à da dieta-padrão de sulfato ferroso. Porém, ao se {{considerar}} apenas o nível de repleção de 24 ppm de ferro na dieta, observou-se uma tendência de aumento na biodisponibilidade de ferro com a elevação no nível de utilização de sangue nas mortadelas. Neste nível de repleção (24 ppm) apenas a dieta de mortadela formulada com 20 % de substituição de carne por sangue apresentou ganho de hemoglobina similar ao da dieta controle de sulfato ferroso. No período de 14 dias do experimento, observou-se incremento no ganho de hemoglobina proporcional à adição de ferro na dieta, demonstrando que grande parte do ferro fornecido pelas mortadelas foi absorvida, embora nenhuma das fontes (inclusive sulfato ferroso) fosse capaz de restituir os níveis de hemoglobina em ratos, mesmo quando foram fornecidas 24 mg de Fe/kg de dieta. Em resumo, as mortadelas, independente dos níveis de sangue adicionados, apresentaram proteína de alta digestibilidade e valor nutricional, além de ferro de boa biodisponibilidade. Diante dos parâmetros avaliados, pode-se concluir que a presença do CO nos embutidos não é tóxica, como sugerido pelos parâmetros bioquímicos, especialmente os níveis de COHb no sangue dos ratos. Assim, sangue tratado com CO pode ser empregado, em substituição à carne, em produtos cárneos em níveis de até 20 %. Aiming {{a greater}} animal blood use for human consumption, {{the effect of}} substituting beef for carbon monoxide treated pork blood at levels of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % in mortadela s formulation was evaluated in Wistar rats fed mortadela based diets for protein quality, iron bioavailability, protein, fat and iron concentration. Blood serum biochemical parameters, hematological and histological parameters were also evaluated {{in order to establish}} the toxicological potential of ingesting meat products formulated with the addition of carbon monoxide treated blood, an information not available in the literature. Mortadela <b>s</b> <b>fat</b> and protein levels were not affected (P> 0. 05) by blood substitution level while its iron level increased (P 0. 05) from those of casein based control diet. Among the mortadelas those formulated with 15 % of beef replacement for blood presented higher (P 0. 05) alterations on blood serum levels of albumin, bilirubin, creatinine and triglycerides, glucose and GTP (Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase). For serum cholesterol levels, casein based diets presented lower (P 0. 05) from that of rats on casein based diets. There was no effect, as well, of level of beef replacement with blood on rats blood hemoglobin content. Macro and microscopic exams did not evidence anatomicpathological alterations that could be attributed to the CO effect over the analyzed organs and tissues. The assay relating the effect of carboxyhemoglobin ingestion on blood COHb level did not evidence differences (P> 0. 05) due to levels of beef replacement for CO treated blood in the mortadelas formulations. Increasing blood addition in the formulation lead (P< 0. 05) to an increase in mortadela s iron content. Even so, considering all the iron repletion levels (6, 12 and 24 mg Fe/kg of diet), iron bioavailability, evaluated through hemoglobin recovery levels in anemic rats, indicated that mortadela based diets had a similar hemoglobin recovery efficiency that was comparable to that of the ferrous sulfate. However, considering only the 24 ppm iron repletion level there was (P< 0. 05) a tendency of increasing iron bioavailability with increasing substitution of meat for blood in mortadela s formulation. In this repletion level (24 ppm) only mortadela diet formulated with 20 % of meat substitution for blood revealed hemoglobin gain {{similar to that of the}} control ferrous sulfate diet. In the 14 days of the experiment there was an increase (P< 0. 05) in blood hemoglobin gain with increasing diet iron content suggesting that a great proportion of the mortadelas iron was absorbed. Even so, none of the iron sources, including ferrous sulfate, was able to restore the normal hemoglobin levels of the rats, even when the diet contained 24 mg Fe/kg of diet. In conclusion, independent of the levels of beef replacement with blood, the mortadelas presented protein of high quality and digestibility as well as iron of good bioavailability. From the parameters evaluated it can be also be concluded that the presence of CO in sausages does not present toxicological hazard, since it did not alter the biochemical indexes, specially the blood COHb level, which is an indication of its safety when used in meat products. So, carbon monoxide treated blood may be used, as a replacement for meat, in meat sausages at levels up to 20 %...|$|E

40|$|Fats {{and oils}} are a {{chemically}} {{diverse group of}} compounds. They have the highest average energy density among all macro nutrients (2. 25 - 3. 80 x most cereal grains). Besides having high caloric value, some fats and oils like vegetable-based acidulated oils a. k. a. “acid oils ” can be {{a major source of}} essential fatty acids (Ω- 3 and Ω- 6), which cannot be synthesized by pigs, as well as fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and antioxidants, such as phytosterols, tocopherols and carotenoids, which help preserve and stabilize fats. These micronutrients are important for animal health, growth and carcass quality. Moreover, the use of certain types of fats and oils in swine rations, particularly those with high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, can increase the metabolizable energy of the total ration beyond the calculated energy of the diet, boosting feed efficiencies as well as average daily gains by 1 - 2 % for each 1 % of fat added to the diet up to a ceiling of 5 - 6 %. This “extra-caloric ” effect of the fat comes from the increased utilization of other dietary components. The main factor affecting the metabolizable energy of fats is their digestibility, which is dependent on the length of the fatty acid carbon chain, the degree of saturation of the fatty acid profile, and the quality/source of the fat. In general, oils of vegetable origin have higher metabolizable energy values than animal fats by equivalent weight, as they contain high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids (U), unlike fats of animal origin, which typically contain high amounts of saturated fatty acids (<b>S).</b> <b>Fats</b> and oils from animal and vegetable sources are often blended to attain a specific U:S ratio, which can increase the digestibility of animal fats, and thus produce a final product with superior metabolizable energy.

Pigs were blocked by BW within gender, and allocated randomly to pens (6 pigs/pen) which were then assigned randomly within each block and gender to either corn-SBM diets 1) that were devoid of synthetic lysine (Ctrl); 2) with reduced CP diets where lysine was added to all diets (RCP 1); 3) with reduced CP where lysine, threonine, and tryptophan were added to all diets (RCP 2); 4) with where lysine, threonine, and tryptophan were added to all diets (RCP 3); or 5) with reduced CP diets where lysine, threonine, tryptophan, and isoleucine was added to all diets (RCP 4). During finisher phase 3, 10 mg/kg of ractopamine was included in all diets. A subsample of whole pork loins was processed into chops for data collection. Another subsample from the whole pork loin and the <b>s.</b> c. <b>fat</b> from each jowl was freeze dried for fatty acid determination. Gilts had a greater (P = 0. 02) (lightness) L* value and drip loss than barrows, but the ultimate pH, marbling, and intramuscular fat (IMF) of the LM were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 04) for barrows than gilts. Color measurements were not affected (P 3 ̆e 0. 06) by the RCP diets, with the exception of redness (a*) which increased (P = 0. 01) with decreasing CP levels. There were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) proportions of SFA in the LM of barrows than the LM from gilts. However, gilts had an increase in PUFA content with decreasing levels of CP in the diet and barrows had a decrease in PUFA content of the LM (P = 0. 056). Barrows had greater (P = 0. 008) SFA and less (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) PUFA content in the jowl fat than gilts. The results point toward the reduced CP diets improving fresh pork quality, especially IMF. Also, pork lean and jowl fat were altered in their fatty acid composition by the reducing dietary CP...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an online learning problem on a continuum. A decision maker {{is given a}} compact feasible set S, and is faced with the following sequential problem: at iteration t, the decision maker chooses a distribution x^(t) ∈Δ(S), then a loss function ℓ^(t) : S →R_+ is revealed, and the decision maker incurs expected loss 〈ℓ^(t), x^(t) 〉 = E_s ∼ x^(t) ℓ^(t) (s). We view the problem as an online convex optimization problem on the space Δ(S) of Lebesgue-continnuous distributions on S. We prove a general regret bound for the Dual Averaging method on L^ 2 (S), then prove that dual averaging with ω-potentials (a class of strongly convex regularizers) achieves sublinear regret when <b>S</b> is uniformly <b>fat</b> (a condition weaker than convexity) ...|$|R
40|$|A 28 -day {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 10 normolipidemic adult subjects to investigate the effects of soybean and coconut oil rich diets with/without psyllium fiber on serum lipids and fecal fat excretion levels. Subjects were fed soybean oil, soybean oil plus fiber, coconut oil and coconut oil plus fiber diets. Soybean and coconut oil feeding with psyllium fiber significantly reduced serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo-B levels in comparison to the values of soybean and coconut oil diets without psyllium fiber. Coconut oil feeding increased serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo-B levels. Fiber feeding with soybean and coconut oil diets significantly increased wet and dry fecal weights, fecal fat and palmitic acid excretion, and decreased fecal transit times as compared to the levels of soybean and coconut oil diets alone. Addition of psyllium fiber to saturated and polyunsaturated fat diets may be beneficial in the dietary management of hypercholesterolemic subjects. ^ In the second project, the USDA 2 ̆ 7 s Nationwide Food Consumption Survey 1987 - 88 was used to assess the intakes of dietary fat, cholesterol and fiber in the U. <b>S.</b> population. <b>Fat</b> intakes were significantly higher in the younger age groups than in the intakes of older individuals.

40|$|Advisor: David <b>S.</b> SenchinaBody <b>fat</b> percent {{measurement}} is {{an important}} indicator of health in {{the general public and}} important in athletics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine possible differences between a more expensive hand-to-foot (whole-body) bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device (Bodystat 1500 ?) and an inexpensive foot-to-foot (lower-body) BIA device (Tanita Innerscan BC 534 ?). We hypothesized that there would be no difference in percent body fat or percent body water determination between the whole-body and lower-body method. Sixteen subjects of both genders volunteered to participate. Height and weight was taken on a physicians scale without shoes, then each subject had BIA performed on them with both devices. It was found that there were no statistically significant differences between percent body fat and percent body water between the two machines. There was also no difference between the physicians scale and the Tanita for weight. Differences in recommended daily caloric intake (DCI) were statistically significant between the BodyStat and the Tanita with the Tanita recommending greater calorie consumption. This experiment showed that there was no difference between whole-body and lower-body BIA assessment using these specific devices. The cheaper foot-to-foot scale provides accurate measurements and is more practical for most people and regular athletes to use.

40|$|Sixteen pluriparous {{lactating}} buffaloes {{were divided}} in two groups homogeneous for parity, lactation stage, milk yield and weight. The diets assigned to two groups, based on maize silage (M group) and sorghum silage (S group), {{had the same}} energy-protein level (0. 90 Milk FU/kg DM and 155 g/kg DM of crude protein). Five records of milk yield and quality during lactation were carried out. The physical-chemical characteristics (pH, fat, protein, lactose and urea), somatic cell count, coagulation properties and nutritional parameters (cholesterol, alfa tocopherol, 13 cis and trans retinol and 13 cis/trans retinol ratio) were analysed. Statistical analysis was performed using a factorial model. The average daily milk yield during experimental period was similar: 9. 29 and 9. 55 kg respectively in M and <b>S</b> groups. <b>Fat</b> and protein content were not different, while the urea content was significantly different varying from 39. 13 mg/dl in M group to 45. 55 mg/dl in S group. The coagulation properties, the estimated Mozzarella yield, somatic cell count and the nutritional parameters analysed were not different between the two groups. These {{results indicate that the}} sorghum silage diet utilised did not affect the milk yield and quality, then it could be adopted in lactating buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{program for}} beef cattle in Japan {{has changed dramatically}} over 4 decades. Visual judging was done initially, but progeny testing in test stations began in 1968. In the 1980 s, the genetic evaluation program using field records, so-called on-farm progeny testing, was first adopted in Oita, Hyogo, and Kumamoto prefectures. In this study, genetic trends for carcass traits in these 3 Wagyu populations were estimated, and genetic gains per year were compared among the 3 different beef cattle breeding programs. The field carcass records used were collected between 1988 and 2003. The traits analyzed were carcass weight, LM area, rib thickness, <b>s.</b> c. <b>fat</b> thickness, and beef marbling standard number. The average breeding values of reproducing dams born the same year were used to estimate the genetic trends for the carcass traits. For comparison of the 3 breeding programs, birth years of the dams were divided into 3 periods reflecting each program. Positive genetic trends for beef marbling standard number were clearly shown in all populations. The genetic gains per year for all carcass traits were significantly enhanced by adopting the on-farm progeny testing program. These {{results indicate that the}} on-farm progeny testing program with BLUP is a very powerful approach for genetic improvement of carcass traits in Japanese Wagyu beef cattle...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} ewe fatness on fetal weight at term was tested without the {{confounding}} effects of placental weight and feed intake. We hypothesised that fetal weights should be similar in fat or lean ewes with placentas {{of a similar}} size, and tested the hypothesis by manipulating nutrition so that, at mating, Merino ewes carrying a single fetus were in a medium (score 2. 9, liveweight 46. 6 kg) or lean (score 2. 0, liveweight 40. 6 kg) condition. They were maintained at this fatness difference until slaughter at Day 146 of pregnancy when fetal, placental, and maternal tissues were weighed and analysed for composition. Subgroups (n = 8 per fatness group) slaughtered at Day 110, a stage when most placental hypertrophy is complete {{but the majority of}} fetal hypertrophy is yet to occur, confirmed that the treatments differed in ewe fatness (3. 82 v. 9. 19 kg empty-body <b>fat,</b> <b>s.</b> e. m. = 0. 960, P 0. 05). By Day 146, fatness differences (4. 77 v. 9. 56 kg empty-body <b>fat,</b> <b>s.</b> e. m. = 0. 960, P 0. 05) were maintained, and both groups produced fetuses of similar size (4408 v. 4382 g, s. e. m. = 204. 6, P > 0. 05). However, the fetuses in the lean ewes had 20 % less fat/kg fat-free body weight (24 v. 30 g/kg, s. e. m. = 1. 3, P < 0. 01). Fetal weight was correlated with placental weight (r = 0. 70, P < 0. 01) but not with ewe fatness. Fetal fatness, however, was correlated with ewe fatness (r = 0. 69, P < 0. 01). Ewe fatness per se did not influence fetal size but did influence the deposition of fat in the fetus, possibly via a greater ability of fatter ewes to partition more glucose toward their fetus...|$|R
40|$|Weight bias {{is often}} {{referred}} to as one of the last accepted and unaddressed forms of discrimination in the U. <b>S.</b> today. <b>Fat</b> individuals are often stereotyped as inactive, unmotivated, and lazy. As a result, fat people experience discrimination and stigma in many aspects of their daily lives including employment, income, romantic relationships, as well as relationships with family, friends, and peers. This discrimination also extends to fat children and young adolescents who experience bullying, victimization, and harassment in school. In the present study, a film and discussion-based intervention was developed to reduce fat stigma and weight bias among middle school-aged children. In addition, this intervention was created to increase body respect and appreciation among participants regardless of their size. Analyses showed that this intervention was successful in reducing fat stigma among girls but not among boys. However, body respect and appreciation did not increase among either girls or boys. These results indicate that all children, especially boys, should be given more opportunities to engage in discussions and activities that address body size, shape, and stigma, prior to middle school in order to cultivate and encourage more open mindedness and positive attitudes toward fat. This intervention has the potential to reduce weight-based stigma among middle school-aged children, however, it must be modified so that girls and boys can benefit equally...|$|R
40|$|Increased intraabdominal (visceral) fat is {{associated}} with a high risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We have previously shown that the mesodermal developmental transcription factor Tbx 15 is highly differentially expressed between visceral and subcutaneous (<b>s.</b> c.) <b>fat</b> in both humans and rodents, and in humans visceral fat Tbx 15 expression is decreased in obesity. Here we show that, in mice, Tbx 15 is 260 -fold more highly expressed in s. c. preadipocytes than in epididymal preadipocytes. Overexpression of Tbx 15 in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes impairs adipocyte differentiation and decreases triglyceride content. This defect in differentiation can be corrected by stimulating cells with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi). However, triglyceride accumulation remains decreased by ∼ 50 %, due to a decrease in basal lipogenic rate and increase in basal lipolytic rate. 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes overexpressing Tbx 15 also have a 15 % reduction in mitochondrial mass and a 28 % reduction in basal mitochondrial respiration (P = 0. 004) and ATP turnover (P = 0. 02), and a 45 % (P = 0. 003) reduction in mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Thus, differential expression of Tbx 15 between fat depots {{plays an important role in}} the interdepot differences in adipocyte differentiation, triglyceride accumulation, and mitochondrial function that may contribute to the risk of diabetes and metabolic disease...|$|R
