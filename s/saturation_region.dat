5000|$|Parameters of {{transistors}} {{depend on}} junction temperature. As junction temperature increases, leakage current due to minority charge carriers (ICBO)(collector base current with emitter open) increases. As ICBO increases, ICEO(collector emitter current with base open) also increases, causing {{an increase in}} collector current IC. This produces heat at the collector junction. This process repeats, and, finally, the Q-point may shift into the <b>saturation</b> <b>region.</b> Sometimes, the excess heat produced at the junction may even burn the transistor.

50|$|Saturable {{inductor}} {{current sensor}} {{is based on}} the detection of an inductance change. The saturable inductor is made of small and thin magnetic core wound with a coil around it. The saturable inductor operates into its <b>saturation</b> <b>region.</b> It is designed {{in such a way that}} the external and internal flux density will affect its saturation level. Change in the saturation level of a saturable inductor will alter core’s permeability and, consequently, its inductance L. The value of saturable inductance (L) is high at low currents (based on the permeability of the core) and low at high currents (the core permeability becomes unity when saturated).Fluxgate detectors rely on the property of many magnetic materials to exhibit a non-linear relationship between the magnetic field strength H and the flux density B.|$|E
5000|$|Depletion-load NMOS logic {{refers to}} the logic family that became {{dominant}} in silicon VLSI {{in the latter half}} of the 1970s; the process supported both enhancement-mode and depletion-mode transistors, and typical logic circuits used enhancement-mode devices as pull-down switches and depletion-mode devices as loads, or pull-ups. Logic families built in older processes that did not support depletion-mode transistors were retrospectively referred to as enhancement-load logic, or as saturated-load logic, since the enhancement-mode transistors were typically connected with gate to the VDD supply and operated in the <b>saturation</b> <b>region</b> (sometimes the gates are biased to a higher VGG voltage and operated in the linear region, for a better power-delay product, but the loads then take more area).

5000|$|For analog {{operation}} of a class-A amplifier, the Q-point is placed so the transistor stays in active mode (does not shift to operation in the <b>saturation</b> <b>region</b> or cut-off region) when input is applied. For digital operation, the Q-point is placed so the transistor does the contrary - switches from the [...] "on" [...] (saturation) to the [...] "off" [...] (cutoff) state. Often, the Q-point is established {{near the center of}} the active region of a transistor characteristic to allow similar signal swings in positive and negative directions.The Q-point should be stable; in particular, it should be insensitive to variations in transistor parameters (for example, should not shift if transistor is replaced by another of the same type), variations in temperature, variations in power supply voltage and so forth.The circuit must also be practical; both easily implemented and cost-effective.|$|E
50|$|The circuit {{works by}} rapidly {{switching}} the transistor. Initially, current {{begins to flow}} through the resistor, secondary winding, and base-emitter junction (see diagram) which causes the transistor to begin conducting collector current through the primary winding. Since the two windings are connected in opposing directions, this induces a voltage in the secondary winding which is positive (due to the winding polarity, see dot convention) which turns the transistor on with higher bias. This self-stroking/positive-feedback process almost instantly turns the transistor on as hard as possible (putting it in the <b>saturation</b> <b>region),</b> making the collector-emitter path look like essentially a closed switch (since VCE will be only about 0.1 volts, assuming that the base current is high enough). With the primary winding effectively across the battery, the current increases at a rate proportional to the supply voltage divided by the inductance. Transistor switch-off takes place by different mechanisms dependent upon supply voltage.|$|E
5000|$|In {{electronic}} circuits, transformers and inductors with ferromagnetic cores operate nonlinearly {{when the}} current through them {{is large enough to}} drive their core materials into saturation. This means that their inductance and other properties vary with changes in drive current. In linear circuits this is usually considered an unwanted departure from ideal behavior. When AC signals are applied, this nonlinearity can cause the generation of harmonics and intermodulation distortion. To prevent this, the level of signals applied to iron core inductors must be limited so they don't saturate. To lower its effects, an air gap is created in some kinds of transformer cores. [...] The saturation current, the current through the winding required to saturate the magnetic core, is given by manufacturers in the specifications for many inductors and transformers. [...] On the other hand, saturation is exploited in some electronic devices. Saturation is employed to limit current in saturable-core transformers, used in arc welding, and ferroresonant transformers which serve as voltage regulators. When the primary current exceeds a certain value, the core is pushed into its <b>saturation</b> <b>region,</b> limiting further increases in secondary current. In a more sophisticated application, saturable core inductors and magnetic amplifiers use a DC current through a separate winding to control an inductor's impedance. Varying the current in the control winding moves the operating point {{up and down in the}} saturation curve, controlling the AC current through the inductor. These are used in variable fluorescent light ballasts, and power control systems.|$|E
