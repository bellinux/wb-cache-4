40|$|SUMMARY: The {{presence}} of oxalates is widespread {{not only as}} kidney stones, but in whole nature. It {{is well known that}} oxalates are products of some plants, fungi and lichens. The accumulates of calcium oxalates are increased in: <b>sorrel,</b> <b>rhubarb,</b> spinach, soya, dieffenbachia, etc. Oxalates serve many important functions in plants such as calcium regulation, protection from herbivory and metal detoxification. Aluminum detoxification is ability of plants, which is critical factor for crop production. Breeding of commercially viable low oxalate cultivars or genetic manipulation with crops should deal to enhance of nutritional quality and enhance of agricultural production too. The presentation of oxalates in rocks is well representing by calcium oxalate minerals, whewellite and weddellite. Minerals occur in sediments into precipitated forms within concretions and hydrothermal veins or dispersed form into modern sediments, e. g. peats. Oxalates are biologic products, therefore they can indicate biological activities, so oxalates should be sought for researching on cosmic objects. The observation of oxalates on Earth and interpretation of the Raman spectra is necessary in these types of study...|$|E
25|$|Despite the name, {{buckwheat}} is {{not related}} to wheat, as it is not a grass. Instead, buckwheat is related to <b>sorrel,</b> knotweed, and <b>rhubarb.</b> Because its seeds are eaten and rich in complex carbohydrates, it is referred to as a pseudocereal.|$|R
50|$|Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a plant {{cultivated}} for its grain-like seeds. Despite the name, buckwheat is {{not related}} to wheat, and is in fact related to <b>sorrel</b> and <b>rhubarb.</b> It is a type of pseudocereal, being a non-grass used {{in much the same way}} as a true cereal. Over a million acres of buckwheat were harvested in the United States in 1918. Its cultivation declined sharply in the 20th century with the adoption of nitrogen fertilizer which increased the productivity of other staples. Buckwheat is gluten-free, and pure buckwheat whisky is an alternative for those who report an allergic response to other whiskies.|$|R
50|$|Horticulture shows {{a certain}} degree of success. Plants such as broccoli, radishes, spinach, leeks, lettuce, turnips, chervil, {{potatoes}} and parsley are grown up to considerable latitudes, while the very south of the country also rears asters, Nemophila, mignonette, <b>rhubarb,</b> <b>sorrel</b> and carrots. Over the last decade, the growing season has lengthened by as much as three weeks.|$|R

5000|$|The exact {{composition}} of Essiac is unclear, but it reportedly contains burdock (Arctium lappa), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella), slippery elm bark (Ulmus rubra), and Indian rhubarb (Rheum officinale) or turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum). Some formulations may also contain watercress, blessed thistle, red clover, and kelp. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, {{who claimed that}} it had been given to her by an Ontario Ojibwa patient she treated. However, this has never been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a Native American or First Nations remedy, and there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American culture. Several of the plants in the mixture (burdock, sheep <b>sorrel,</b> Indian <b>rhubarb</b> and turkey rhubarb) are not indigenous to the Americas, and were not growing in the wilds of Northern Ontario during the time Caisse began prescribing this tea. The name [...] "Essiac" [...] is Caisse's surname spelled backwards. Today, Essiac is often sold with apparatus (such as bottles and infusers) for making the tea, and is sometimes promoted with untrue claims that scientific studies have shown it to be effective.|$|R
