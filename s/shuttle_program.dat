A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>program,</b> with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Lunney became {{manager of}} the space <b>shuttle</b> <b>program,</b> a {{high-level}} position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting {{the agenda for the}} developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA Space Shuttle mission {{and the third}} flight of the Space Shuttle Challenger. It {{launched}} on August 30, 1983 and landed on September 5, conducting the first night launch and night landing of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>program.</b> It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford. The mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives, but was marred by the subsequent discovery that a solid-fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch.|$|E

5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer. An {{employee}} of NASA since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and was on duty during historic {{events such as the}} Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis. At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union. Later, he served as manager of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>program</b> before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming {{a vice president of the}} United Space Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the <b>shuttle</b> <b>program,</b> dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly go wrong with the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E
5|$|Since NASA's Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>program</b> had {{not been}} launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|E

5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>program</b> had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E

The first alumnus to graduate {{and go on to}} become an astronaut was Frank Borman, class of 1950. As of March 2009, the most recent alumnus to become an astronaut was Robert S. Kimbrough, class of 1989. Five alumni were part of Project Gemini, six part of the Apollo program, two have walked on the Moon, and twelve were part of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into direct {{sunlight}} and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a safe position, putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo believes that the uplink is being sabotaged. Belt orders the uplink to be cut, allowing the astronauts to rotate the craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the <b>shuttle</b> <b>program</b> may be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E
