50|$|The {{scale is}} a {{secondary}} prevention strategy used {{to gauge the}} effectiveness of an employee's management of an individual's challenging behaviour.

50|$|Currently, {{the most}} common form of {{treatment}} for SLOS involves dietary cholesterol supplementation. Anecdotal reports indicate that this has some benefits; it may result in increased growth, lower irritability, improved sociability, less <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour,</b> less tactile defensiveness, fewer infections, more muscle tone, less photosensitivity and fewer autistic behaviours. Cholesterol supplementation begins at a dose of 40-50 mg/kg/day, increasing as needed. It is administered either through consuming foods high in cholesterol (eggs, cream, liver), or as purified food grade cholesterol. Younger children and infants may require tube feeding. However, dietary cholesterol does not reduce the levels of 7DHC, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and does not appear to improve developmental outcomes. One empirical study found that cholesterol supplementation did not improve developmental delay, regardless of the age at which it began. This is likely because most developmental delays stem from malformations of the brain, which dietary cholesterol cannot ameliorate due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier.|$|E

Supervisor: Ann Ottengrim Assessor: Rickard Ulmestig   The {{purpose of this study}} has been to understand how professionals in human service organizations (HSO) describe self-injuries behaviour, how they describe the individuals that self-harm and if the professionals describe any possible differences in how men and women self-harm as well as how professional’s knowledge concerning <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> is contructed. The study answers three questions; - What kind of actions do professionals in HSO describe as being <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour?</b> - How is knowledge constructed by professionals in HSO concerning <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour?</b> - How are people who engage in <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> being described? - How do professionals in human service organizations describe potential differences between men and women´s <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour?</b>   Qualitative interviews have been chosen as the method in this study to gather empirical data and the social constructionism theory has been implemented to analyse the empirical data. The result of this study shows that <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> is a complex {{and at the same time}} a dynamic phenomenon. There are a lot of different actions that are being describes as being <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour.</b> An individual that cuts its own body tissue or an individual that often gets involved in psychical fights are examples of acts that are being described as having a <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The informants also described that their knowledge and what they define as <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> has changed over time in the field which indicates that <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> is a dynamic category.

40|$|Understanding and {{treating}} {{individuals who have}} a combination of borderline personality disorders, <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviours</b> and sometimes suicidality, presents {{one of the most}} confusing and problematic challenges to mental health professionals. While the use of mental health legislation for this group is considered unusual, guardianship legislation in Australia is sometimes additionally utilised. To date, there has been no examination of the effectiveness of guardianship for people with borderline personality disorder in the Victorian context. This study aims to examine the role of guardianship for this population by assessing the contributing factors that led to the appointment of a guardian including the mental health responses prior to a guardianship application being made, subsequent service responses provided and finally to enhance current knowledge by determining whether guardianship is an effective intervention. This research has two phases. Phase one assessed guardianship as an intervention by the examination of case materials held by the Office of the Public Advocate. In phase two some participants from phase one were interviewed to elicit their experience of such an intervention. Findings indicated that the combination of high level <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviours</b> and refusal of treatment led to the appointment of a guardian. Service and system responses were quite diverse for this cohort, particularly regarding the ongoing provision of case management. Empathic responses were often not forthcoming from health professionals. Combined results indicated that advocacy rather than guardianship was more beneficial. Recommendations to improve the legal and healthcare framework are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{the application of}} capacity, psychological distress, coping and personality {{to an understanding of}} <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour,</b> with a specific focus on testing the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicidal Behaviour (IPTSB). One hundred and ninety women prisoners took part, completing a history questionnaire and measures of personality, coping styles and psychological distress. It was expected that <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> would be predicted by higher levels of emotional functioning difficulties, by an increased capacity to engage in such behaviours, by previous <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour,</b> decreased levels of emotional stability and increased levels of emotional coping behaviour. Results supported the capacity component of the IPTSB, indicating that an increased history of <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> and of engagement in reckless behaviour were particular predictors. Increased psychological distress in some domains was also a predictor although the exact domain varied across the type of self-injurious engagement Increased levels of extraversion and decreased emotional coping predicted increased self-injurious engagement, although emotional coping only related to threats and cognition.

40|$|Self-injury {{represents}} an alarmingly common yet highly perplexing set of behaviours which are considered notoriously difficult to treat. The current study aimed {{to identify a}} range of social and personal resources which may provide a protective barrier against the initiation of self-injury and also which, if enhanced, may aid in the cessation of such behaviours. Additionally a related {{attempt was made to}} investigate the pattern of help-seeking behaviour undertaken by self-injuring individuals. A community sample of 312 participants completed an online questionnaire which measured <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviours</b> as well as a range of other psychosocial factors. Differences between individuals who were currently self-injuring and those who had ceased such behaviours were investigated, as well as differences between those with no history of self-injury. Results indicated significant differences between the groups on levels of all protective factors such that self-injurers reported significantly lower levels of perceived social support, social connectedness, resilience, self-esteem and life satisfaction compared to those with no history of self-injury. In addition, further analysis indicated that perceived social support, self-esteem and resilience had a unique ability to predict self-injury status. Moreover, self-injuring individuals were significantly less likely to utilize their social network for help-seeking purposes but were no more likely to turn to professional resources as an alternative. The current research has important clinical implications and facilitates an improved understanding of how aspects of the social environment and wider community can be enhanced to protect and prevent individuals from initiating and continuing <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> is {{considerable}} prevalent in youth population. In community samples, rates vary from 12 to 21 % for non-suicidal self-injury, depending on definition and informant sources. In clinical samples, the rates vary from 30 - 60 %, depending on clinical subgroups and used research methods. Yet despite its high prevalence, <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> is little understood. The need for theoretical models to help understand and treat NSSI {{has never been}} more pressing. In the present study, our aim is to understand what motivates people to engage in self-injurious behaviours. Functionality of <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> was surveyed, using an anonymous self-report online questionnaire, with 219 adolescents between 12 and 18 years old who reported at least one self-injurious act. One major reason for youngsters to engage into <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> appears to be emotion regulation (67. 7 % of the self-injurers report “to stop bad feelings”, and 60. 09 % report “self-punishment”). Secondly, NSSI can also be understood in an interpersonal context. For a minority of self-injurers (between 15 to 31 % of the self-injurers), NSSI is used as a means of social influence and has a communicational function. When the private <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviour</b> is disclosed or made visible to others, it provides an intense social signal that is used when other forms of communication fail. Moreover, one self-injurious act can serve multiple functions: the number of reported functions is positively correlated with the severity of self-injurious acts. Notion must be made that the functionality of self-injury can change over time, across situations and across methods of self-injury. This attribution to the conference will finally address how to approach the question of treatment, interwoven with the research findings on functionality of self-injury. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|Certain {{behaviours}} and attributes {{are commonly}} seen among patients suffering from SLOS.

Interestingly, specific autistic behaviours and hyperactivity are often present with SLOS, which provides genetic and biological insights into autism spectrum disorders. The autistic behaviours most characteristic of SLOS patients are opisthokinesis (an upper body movement), stretching of the upper body, and hand flicking. Autism is typically diagnosed separately from SLOS using the DSM-V, and approximately 50-75% of SLOS patients meet the criteria for autism.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the {{dysfunctions}} in {{expression of}} behaviour {{of patients with}} organic personality disorder {{and the development of}} symptom of irritability, which are caused by aggressive and <b>self-injurious</b> <b>behaviours,</b> can be dealt with the administration of carbamazepine.

Methods The study had a cross-sectional design, and participants (n = 370) were aged 14 - 19 years and were divided in three groups: 205 adolescents with normal weight, 82 adolescents from the community with overweight/obesity, and 83 adolescents with overweight/obesity and in outpatient treatment for weight control. Results The prevalence of these behaviours in the overweight community group (25. 6 %) and in the overweight clinical group (14. 5 %) was similar to their healthy weight peers (19 %). Not attending an outpatient treatment for weight control, higher psychopathology and less ability to regulate emotions predict the presence of NSSI. Conclusion Being overweight is not associated with NSSI, but psychosocial variables such as psychopathology, emotional deregulation and the absence of medical care predict these behaviours. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
