25|$|Daniel Pratt {{arrived in}} Autauga County in 1833 and founded the new town of Prattville, north of Atagi on {{the fall line}} of Autauga Creek. His cotton gin factory quickly became the largest {{manufacturer}} of gins {{in the world and}} the first major industry in Alabama. It was at his factory, and with his financial backing, that the Prattville Dragoons, a fighting unit for the Confederacy was organized in anticipation of the Civil War. Other units formed in Autauga County included the Autauga Rifles (Autaugaville), The John Steele Guards (western Autauga Co.) and the Varina Rifles (northern Autauga Co.). None of the fighting of the Civil War reached Autauga County, and Pratt was able to <b>secure</b> <b>payment</b> of debts from Northern accounts soon after the war, lessening the disabling effects of the Reconstruction period in the county.|$|E
500|$|After her commissioning, Gazelle {{was sent}} {{overseas}} from 1902 to 1904, {{assigned to the}} American Squadron. Together with the unprotected cruiser [...] she proceeded to La Guaira and Carúpano in Venezuela to protect German nationals from expected fighting in June 1902, and the following weeks evacuated German and French nationals from the two cities to Saint Thomas. Starting in December 1902, Gazelle participated in the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03. An Anglo-German naval force instituted a blockade of the Venezuelan coast to <b>secure</b> <b>payment</b> of foreign debts. Gazelle and the Falke were the German contribution to the blockading squadron; they joined four British cruisers and three smaller vessels in enforcing the blockade. The Venezuelan gunboat [...] was seized during the blockade. The Germans took her into service as SMS Restaurador and put a crew from Gazelle on board {{under the command of}} Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Titus Türk. In February 1903 the Venezuelan government reached an agreement to pay its debts, concluding the confrontation. In January 1904, Gazelle conducted a goodwill visit to the port of New Orleans, along with Vineta and two other warships. During this period she was commanded by then Korvettenkapitän Reinhard Scheer, the later commander of the High Seas Fleet.|$|E

2500|$|Section 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides, as {{a general}} rule, [...] "o the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor {{that is not an}} allowed secured claim, such lien is void." [...] As used in the Bankruptcy Code, the term [...] "claim" [...] {{includes}} any [...] "right to payment," [...] and the term [...] "lien" [...] means a [...] "charge against or interest in property to <b>secure</b> <b>payment</b> of a debt or performance of an obligation." [...] A claim is [...] "allowed" [...] if proof of the claim is filed under 11 U.S.C. § 501, and the claim is not objected to by a party in interest.|$|E
2500|$|In Flora, the Court {{used the}} word [...] "voluntary" [...] in {{opposition}} to the word [...] "distraint." [...] Distraint is a legal term used in various contexts. For example, distraint is used to refer to the act of a landlord who withholds property of the tenant already in the landlord’s possession to <b>secure</b> <b>payment</b> of past due rent. The property [...] "held for ransom," [...] in a sense, is said to be [...] "distrained," [...] or [...] "distressed." [...] The key connotation of the word [...] "distraint" [...] is that there is often a taking of possession or withholding of property to induce a debtor to pay an obligation. Once the debt is paid, the property is released.|$|E
2500|$|In many European nations, the European Convention on Human Rights {{provides}} {{protection from}} an appropriation {{of private property}} by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that [...] "Everyone {{has the right to}} respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence" [...] and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention, which states that [...] "Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions." [...] Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or public interest, is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to <b>secure</b> <b>payment</b> of taxes.

2500|$|Movers are {{typically}} {{entitled to a}} mover's lien under UCC § 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's goods to <b>secure</b> <b>payment.</b> [...] This is a possessory lien, and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon). [...] However, {{the concept of a}} mover's lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will fraudulently extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate. [...] Because the customer has an interest in obtaining his/her own goods, he/she is under duress to pay the ransom. [...] Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under 49 U.S.C. 13905. [...] The FMCSA regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies. [...] Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.|$|E
