40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, two genes, Prat and Prat 2, encode the enzyme, amidophosphoribosyltransferase, that {{performs}} {{the first and}} limiting step in purine de novo synthesis. Only Prat mRNA {{is present in the}} female germline and 0 - to 2 -hr embryos prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. We studied the maternal-effect phenotype caused by Prat loss-of-function mutations, allowing us {{to examine the effects of}} decreased purine de novo synthesis during oogenesis and the early stages of embryonic development. In addition to the purine syndrome previously characterized, we found that Prat mutant adult females have a significantly shorter life span and are conditionally semisterile. The <b>semisterility</b> is associated with a pleiotropic phenotype, including egg chamber defects and later effects on embryonic and larval viability. Embryos show mitotic synchrony and/or nuclear content defects at the syncytial blastoderm stages and segmentation defects at later stages. The <b>semisterility</b> is partially rescued by providing Prat mutant females with an RNA-enriched diet as a source of purines. Our results suggest that purine de novo synthesis is a limiting factor during the processes of cellular or nuclear proliferation that take place during egg chamber and embryonic development...|$|E
40|$|PR-domain 9 (Prdm 9) is {{the first}} hybrid {{sterility}} gene identified in mammals. The incompatibility between Prdm 9 from Mus musculus domesticus (Mmd; the B 6 strain) and the Hstx 2 region of chromosome (Chr) X from M. m. musculus (Mmm; the PWD strain) participates in the complete meiotic arrest of mouse intersubspecific (PWD 6 B 6) F 1 hybrid males. Other studies suggest that also semisterile intersubspecific hybrids are relevant for mouse speciation, but the genes responsible remain unknown. To investigate the causes of this <b>semisterility,</b> we analyzed the role of Prdm 9 and Chr X in hybrids resulting from the crosses of PWK, another Mmm-derived inbred strain. We demonstrate that Prdm 9 and Chr X control the partial meiotic arrest and reduced sperm count in (PWK 6 B 6) F 1 males. Asynapsis of heterosubspecific chromosomes and <b>semisterility</b> were partially suppressed by removal of the B 6 allele of Prdm 9. Polymorphisms between PWK and PWD on Chr X {{but not in the}} Prdm 9 region were responsible for the modification of the outcome of Prdm 9 - Chr X F 1 hybrid incompatibility. Furthermore, (PWK 6 B 6) F 1 hybrid males displayed delayed fertility dependent on the Prdm 9 incompatibility. While the Drosophila hybrid sterility gene Overdrive causes both delayed fertility and increased transmission of its own chromosome to the offspring, the segregation of Chr X and the Prdm 9 region from the mouse (PWK 6 B 6) F 1 males was normal. Our results indicate extended functional consequences of Prdm 9 - Chr X intersubspecific incompatibility on the fertility of hybrids an...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBarley Rar 1 is a {{convergence}} {{point in the}} signaling of resistance to powdery mildew, triggered by multiple race-specific resistance (R) genes. Rar 1 is shown to function upstream of H 2 O 2 accumulation in attacked host cells, which precedes localized host cell death. We isolated Rar 1 by map-based cloning. The sequence of the deduced 25. 5 kDa protein reveals two copies of a 60 –amino acid domain, CHORD, conserved in tandem organization in protozoa, plants, and metazoa. CHORD defines a novel eukaryotic Zn 2 +-binding domain. Silencing of the C. elegans CHORD-containing gene, chp, results in <b>semisterility</b> and embryo lethality, suggesting an essential function of the wild-type gene in nematode development. Our findings indicate that plant R genes have recruited a fundamental cellular control element for signaling of disease resistance and cell death...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} male and female {{sterility}} in hybrids of Drosophila pseudoobscura-Drosophila persimilis was studied using backcross analysis. Previous studies indirectly assessed male fertility by measuring testis size; these studies concluded that male sterility results from an X chromosome-autosome imbalance. By directly scoring for the production of motile sperm, male sterility is shown to be largely due to an incompatibility between genes on the X and Y chromosomes of these two species. These species have diverged at a minimum of nine loci affecting hybrid male fertility. <b>Semisterility</b> of hybrid females appears to result from an X chromosome-cytoplasm interaction; the X chromosome thus has the largest effect on sterility in both male and female hybrids. This is apparently the first analysis of the genetic basis of female sterility, or of sterility/inviability affecting both sexes, in an animal hybridization...|$|E
40|$|Aphid nymphs with {{enlarged}} fore- and mid-legs {{were found}} from woolly colonies of Thoracaphis kashifolia (Hormaphidinae, Nipponaphidini) on {{leaves of the}} evergreen Quercus glauca in Japan. It was shown that they grasped an introduced moth larva with their legs and some inserted their stylets deep into the body. These defenders were first-instar nymphs of the alate generation and were produced by aleyrodiform apterae from early September onward. There was a large variation {{in the size of}} their forelegs. First-instar nymphs (to be alates) produced early in the season had fore-femorotrochanters shorter than those produced later. The molting rate (the percentage of pharate individuals) of the latter was very low (less than 5 % to zero), suggesting their <b>semisterility.</b> Although first-instar nymphs with various lengths of forelegs joined to attack moth larvae, these facts indicate that an incipient caste differentiation occurs within the first-instar nymphs of the alate generation...|$|E

A summary of results from 1976 to 1989 is reported using temporary chromosome designation letters A to J.

40|$|In Arabidopsis thaliana, {{the three}} MADS box genes SEEDSTICK (STK), SHATTERPROOF 1 (SHP 1), and SHP 2 redundantly {{regulate}} ovule development. Protein interaction {{studies have shown}} that a multimeric complex composed of the ovule identity proteins together with the SEPALLATA MADS domain proteins is necessary to determine ovule identity. Despite the extensive knowledge that has become available about these MADS domain transcription factors, little is known regarding the genes that they regulate. Here, we show that STK, SHP 1, and SHP 2 redundantly regulate VERDANDI (VDD), a putative transcription factor that belongs to the plant-specific B 3 superfamily. The vdd mutant shows defects during the fertilization process resulting in <b>semisterility.</b> Analysis of the vdd mutant female gametophytes indicates that antipodal and synergid cell identity and/or differentiation are affected.

40|$|The semisterile meiotic mutant mei- 352 {{alters the}} {{distribution}} of meiotic exchanges without greatly affecting their total frequency. We show that the mei- 352 mutation is an allele of the klp 3 A gene, which encodes a kinesin-like protein of the Kinesin- 4 family. The <b>semisterility</b> observed in mei- 352 females results from a known defect of klp 3 A oocytes in mediating pronuclear fusion. Interestingly, other klp 3 A alleles also exhibit defects in meiotic recombination {{similar to those of}} mei- 352. Finally, we show that the Klp 3 A protein localizes within the oocyte nucleus during meiotic prophase, the time at which exchange distribution is established, and extensively colocalizes with DNA. The parallel of the klp 3 A phenotype with a meiotic defect observed for kar 3 mutants in yeast suggests a role for kinesins in early meiosis and might reflect a previously suggested role for this class of kinesins in chromosome condensation...|$|E

Four {{different}} plant types, heterozygous for {{reciprocal translocation}} (RT), RT- 1, RT- 2, RT- 3, and RT- 4 showing pollen <b>semisterility,</b> were isolated in induced mutant population of three varieties of grass pea.

In the present study we compare the A 17 chromosomal configuration with that of other accessions by examining pollen viability and genetic maps of intraspecific hybrids. • Hybrids derived from crosses between M. truncatula accessions, representative of the large genetic variation within the germplasm collection, were evaluated for pollen viability using Alexander's stain. Genetic maps were generated for the following crosses: SA 27063 × SA 3054 (n = 94), SA 27063 × A 17 (n = 92), A 17 × Borung (n = 99) and A 17 × A 20 (n = 69). • All F 1 individuals derived from crosses involving A 17 showed 50 % pollen viability or less. Examination of the recombination frequencies between markers of chromosomes 4 and 8 revealed an apparent genetic linkage between the lower arms of these chromosomes in genetic maps derived from A 17. • <b>Semisterility</b> and unexpected linkage relationship are both good indicators of a reciprocal translocation.

40|$|Acyl lipids are {{essential}} constituents of all cells, but acyl chain requirements vary greatly and {{depend on the}} cell type considered. This implies a tight regulation of fatty acid production so that supply fits demand. Isolation of the Arabidopsis thaliana WRINKLED 1 (WRI 1) transcription factor established the importance of transcriptional regulation for modulating the rate of acyl chain production. Here, we report the isolation of two additional regulators of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, WRI 3 and WRI 4, which {{are closely related to}} WRI 1 and belong to the APETALA 2 -ethylene-responsive element binding protein family of transcription factors. These three WRIs define a family of regulators capable of triggering sustained rates of acyl chain synthesis. However, expression patterns of the three WRIs differ markedly. Whereas only WRI 1 activates fatty acid biosynthesis in seeds for triacylglycerol production, the three WRIs are required in floral tissues to provide acyl chains for cutin biosynthesis and prevent adherence of these developing organs and subsequent <b>semisterility.</b> The targets of these WRIs encode enzymes providing precursors (acyl chain and glycerol backbones) for various lipid biosynthetic pathways, but not the subsequent lipid-assembling enzymes.

40|$|Some dandelions, Taraxacum?, are diplosporous gametophytic apomicts. Crosses between {{closely related}} diploid sexuals and {{triploid}} apomicts {{were made to}} study the inheritance of apomixis. Seed-set was less than one-third of that in diploid x diploid crosses, probably because of the inviability of aneuploid pollen or zygotes. Almost 90 % of the viable offspring were diploid {{and the result of}} selfing, as was shown by a discriminating allozyme marker. Aneuploid outcross pollen had a mentor effect on self-pollen, causing a breakdown of the sporophytic self-incompatibility system. A similar phenomenon has been reported before in wide crosses. Of the 26 allozyme- confirmed hybrids, four were diploids, 15 were triploids and seven were tetraploids. Diploid hybrids were significantly less frequent than triploid hybrids, suggesting either low fitness of haploid pollen or more numerous formation of diploid pollen. Emasculation and bagging of flowers indicated apomictic seed- set in none of the diploid, in one-third of the triploid and in all of the tetraploid hybrids. All apomictic hybrids showed partial seed-set, but additional cross-pollination did not increase seed-set. Cytological analysis of the F- 2 progeny confirmed that partial apomixis was caused by <b>semisterility</b> and not by residual sexuality (facultative apomixis). The difference in segregation for apomixis between triploid and tetraploid hybrids may be because the triploids originated from partially reduced diploid pollen grains, whereas the tetraploids originated from unreduced triploid pollen grains.

40|$|Barley (Hordrium sp.) is {{the most}} {{important}} spring sown cereal crop in Utah, both in acreage and in yield of total digestible nutrients per unit area. It also rates high as a feed crop in the United States. For this reason it is important that varieties are available which are high in yield, high in quality, and disease resistant, along with other desirable characteristics. In order to work toward this end most efficiently, it is first necessary that the genetics of the barley plant be worked out. Barley offers the plant breeders and geneticists a valuable material to use in the study of genetics. The fact that it has many easily distinguishable characters, that it is easy to grow large F 2 populations, and that it has a low chromosome number make it desirable for this type of study. That all interspecific crosses are fertile make it all the more desirable for the plant breeder. This study is a by-product of the cereal breeding and improvement program being carried on at the Utah Experiment Station. Recently the study of translocations induced by X 0 rays and other means has gained wide interests among plant breeders, geneticists, and cytologists alike. Translocations or interchanges consist of the exchange of segments of non-homologous chromosomes. As a result <b>semisterility</b> occurs in plants which are heterozygous for the interchange. the objective {{of this study is to}} calculate any linkage which may be found in different crosses involving translocated stocks in barley in order to determine which linkage groups are involved in the translocation; and to note any characters now linked as a result of a translocation which were not linked in normal barley stocks.

F 1 crosses between the interchange stocks, which were intermediate in oil content, {{and each of the}} two inbreds representing extremes in oil percentage, were backcrossed to their respective high or low oil parent. Associations between the points of chromosomal interchange involved and genes conditioning oil content were studied in the resulting backcross progeny. The interchange stocks explored at least one region of each of nine different chromosomes;It appeared from rather limited data that the morphological and physiological effects of <b>semisterility</b> in plants heterozygous for a chromosomal interchange may have resulted in a slight decrease in the oil percentage of the grain. The size of this decrease, however, was apparently very small and it was hoped that it had little effect on the association studies in the backcross progenies;The results in the high oil backcross progenies suggested that genes conditioning oil percentage were present in each of the chromosome regions tested. The genetic effects of each of these chromosome regions, however, were small and of about the same magnitude as any of the other regions tested;In the low oil backcross progenies there was little evidence of any associations between genes conditioning low oil content and the points of chromosomal interchange involved;A discussion was presented concerning the types of results expected in the present study under various assumptions as to the number and distribution of genes conditioning oil percentage. It was pointed out that the observed results were compatible with the hypothesis that the oil content of the strains tested was conditioned by a rather large number of genes, having small and approximately equal effects, and distributed at random over the ten pairs of maize chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrially-targeted {{expression}} of a cytoplasmic male sterility-associated orf 220 gene causes male sterility in Brassica juncea Jinghua Yang 1, 2, Xunyan Liu 1, 2, Xiaodong Yang 1, 2, Mingfang Zhang 1, 2 * Background: The novel chimeric open reading frame (orf) resulting from the rearrangement of a mitochondrial genome is generally {{thought to be a}} causal factor in the occurrence of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Both positive and negative correlations have been found between CMS-associated orfs and the occurrence of CMS when CMS-associated orfs were expressed and targeted at mitochondria. Some orfs cause male sterility or <b>semisterility,</b> while some do not. Little is currently known about how mitochondrial factor regulates the {{expression of}} the nuclear genes involved in male sterility. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the biological function of a candidate CMS-associated orf 220 gene, newly isolated from cytoplasmic male-sterile stem mustard, and show how mitochondrial retrograde regulated nuclear gene expression is related to male sterility. Results: It was shown that the ORF 220 protein can be guided to the mitochondria using the mitochondrialtargeting sequence of the b subunit of F 1 -ATPase (atp 2 - 1). Transgenic stem mustard plants expressed the chimeric gene containing the orf 220 gene and a mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the b subunit of F 1 -ATPase (atp 2 - 1). Transgenic plants were male-sterile, most being unable to produce pollen while some could only produce nonvigorous pollen. The transgenic stem mustard plants also showed aberrant floral development identical to that observed in the CMS stem mustard phenotype. Results obtained from oligooarray analysis showed that some genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism were down-regulated, indicating a weakening of mitochondrial function in transgenic stem mustard. Some genes related to pollen development were shown to be downregulated in transgenic stem mustard and the expression of some transcription factor genes was also altered. Conclusion: The work presented furthers our understanding of how the mitochondrially-targeted expression of CMS-associated orf 220 gene causes male sterility through retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression in Brassica juncea...|$|E
40|$|After a short {{introductory}} {{chapter on}} {{the occurrence of}} Ophiobolus graminis (take-all disease) in the polders, in chapter 2 {{the course of the}} disease and the biology of the fungus are described. The third chapter deals with materials and methods. The following chapters deal with investigations on two aspects of the disease: chapter 4 on the introduction of Ophiobolus into the polders; chapters 5 to 8 on decline of Ophiobolus with continuous cereal growing and the backgrounds of this phenomenon. The reclamation of the Ysselmeer Polders after drainage follows a fixed pattern. In East Flevoland it was: reed as a soil cover, gradual reclamation, rape as a first and wheat as a second crop. In many fields Ophiobolus already patchily occurs in this wheat crop, mostly at the border of a field. But in field trials with wheat directly after reed, Ophiobolus was more widespread and evenly distributed over the field. Shortly after reclamation Ophiobolus was already present on grasses. The Ophiobolus infection of wheat grown directly after reed was suggested to originate from the reed roots, whereas on wheat grown after rape the grasses at the border of the field were primarily responsible. The occurrence of Ophiobolus on grasses on an artificial island, 1 ½ year after its construction, suggested infection by air-borne ascospores. In the greenhouse, where perithecia-bearing wheat plants of other experiments were present, spontaneous infection of wheat by ascospores occurred regularly, if plants were grown on subsoil clay from East Flevoland. In experiments with wheat and grasses sterility or <b>semisterility</b> of the soil proved to be of paramount importance for successful infection by ascospores. Thus grasses, originating from seed and establishing themselves in the polder directly after drainage, are rapidly infected by Ophiobolus. Reed replacing the grasses picks up the infection, which in turn is passed to wheat after reclamation, and to grasses which establish themselves along roads and ditches. In the second or third year of continuous cereal growing there is a peak attack of Ophiobolus. Then the incidence of disease declines to a very low level. This could be clearly demonstrated on field trials in the North-East Polder and East Flevoland. In greenhouse trials decline was induced only by soil application of virulent Ophiobolus (1 % w/w; fresh weight). Wheat growing itself and application of avirulent Ophiobolus or some other fungi were ineffective. Ophiobolus-induced decline is governed by a specific antagonism, as will be shown; by contrast, a non-specific action of the soil microflora is responsible for a less effective antagonism present in every soil. Hereafter antagonism refers to specific antagonism. By applying Ophiobolus in greenhouse trials once in three months antagonism reaches a maximum within 3 - 6 months. It is preserved by growing wheat or barley continuously (in the field) or by continued application of Ophiobolus (in the greenhouse). Interruption of continuous cereal growing with another crop for one season, or for two cycles of three months in the greenhouse, considerably decreases the antagonistic capacity of the soil. The antagonistic capacities of a soil are lost by heating (50 °C or higher for 30 min.) or application of chemical disinfectants. A mixture of antagonistic and nonantagonistic soil shows an antagonistic capacity in proportion to logarithm concentration of antagonistic soil. Growth of Ophiobolus in vivo is reduced by a sterilized water-extract of antagonistic soil. These three results show that antagonism is governed by antibiotics from soil micro-organisms. (The reduction of growth by the waterextract was measured by the length of runner hyphae on roots of wheat grown in sand. In vitro no effect could be demonstrated. Therefore isolation and identification of the active material had to be suspended). No differences could be found in the microflora of antagonistic and non-antagonistic soil by isolating fungi by the dilution method and similar techniques, and by using precolonized or clean baits, followed by testing the antagonistic properties of the isolates in vitro and in vivo. None of the isolates could be demonstrated to be of paramount importance in decline. This failure can be explained as follows. Since antibiotic properties depend on the environment, the actual capacities of an organism cannot be measured in vitro. Conditions of trial even in vivo differ so much from natural conditions that results are not conclusive. Wastie's method did not demonstrate any correlation between the antagonism of a series of soils and their effect on growth of Ophiobolus in vitro. But there was a clear effect on survival and colonization in the seedling test and the Cambridge test, in which the wheat plant indicates the presence of Ophiobolus The trials described show that antagonistic soil reduces the growth of Ophiobolus in its parasitic stage as well as its survival in the saprophytic stage...|$|E
