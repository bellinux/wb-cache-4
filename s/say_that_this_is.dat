Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because when the Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they had to kill the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg {{reported}} {{that more than}} 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, {{it is an important}} indicator for future FDIC activity.|$|E
25|$|Lysaker & Lysaker {{explained}} that Bakhtin theorized {{of human beings}} as entities composed of a multiplicity of voices (self-as-father, self-as-son, self-as-student, self-as-teacher, self-as-sad, self-as-happy, self-as-pro-life) that are in constant flux within him as he dialogues with and relates to the world around him. These voices constantly arrange and re-arrange themselves in hierarchies that are not governed by an overarching ego. Each hierarchy of voices (roles and dispositions) constitutes a dialogical position. Lysaker & Lysaker use the term dialogical positions because they are exactly the positions (roles and dispositions) Dasein takes {{up in the world}} when interacting with and relating to others—-and are constituted by his polyphonic nature. The flux, or re-arrangement, occurs from situational contexts that tells Dasein which dialogical position, or set of voices, must come to the foreground. The flux is also based on increased understanding of the world around human beings and their respective roles in it. Hermeneuts <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a stark contrast to mainstream paradigms in psychotherapy. Instead of a single ego, or voice, that makes up a person's identity and stands above and against the world, a constantly-rearranging hierarchy of multiple voices dialogues with others and co-constitutes a person's identity, and that this is the reason that Taylor writes that we should abandon paradigms such as the self as a highly autonomous individual and re-conceptualize that self as a dialogical self that is always-already a relational being constantly engaged in multiple ongoing conversations.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

500|$|Aguilera's {{new image}} was so widely {{rejected}} by the public that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: [...] " [...] simulated masturbation while wearing {{little more than a}} pair of leather chaps." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as [...] "the world's skeeziest reptile woman," [...] and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that [...] "she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention." [...] Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video [...] "Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome". Writer Emma Forrest remarked: [...] "What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, and to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. ...

500|$|In 2008, Gates {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. [...] The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a [...] "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a [...] "Yes". Some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an homage to Seinfeld's own show about [...] "nothing" [...] (Seinfeld). In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.|$|E
500|$|Many Muslims saw the {{cartoons}} {{as a sign}} of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West. Egyptian preacher and television star Amr Khaled urged his followers to take action to remedy supposed Western ignorance, saying, [...] "It is our duty to the prophet of God to make his message known... Do not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the task of the ulema (religious scholars)it is the task of all of us." [...] Ana Soage said, [...] "the targeting of a religious symbol like Muhammad, the only prophet that Muslims do not share with Jews and Christians, was perceived as the last in a long list of humiliations and assaults: it is probably not a coincidence that the more violent demonstrations were held in countries like Syria, Iran and Libya, whose relations with the West are tense." [...] Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic theologian, called for a day of anger from Muslims in response to {{the cartoons}}. He supported calls for a UN resolution that [...] "categorically prohibits affronts to prophetsto the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, [...] "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence." ...|$|E

2500|$|The current {{preference}} among Shakespearian scholars is to {{deny that}} the Sonnets are autobiographical.

In contrast, assuming that Marlowe did survive and was exiled in disgrace, Marlovians claim that the Sonnets reflect what must have happened to him after that.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{statutes}} {{provide for}} a passive right to retain property against its owner as security for obligations.
