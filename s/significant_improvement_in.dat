5|$|A fast-firing 7-inch/45-caliber gun {{had been}} adopted with the {{previous}} battleship class to replace earlier 6-inch guns; these brought a <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> ballistics, expanding the potential beyond torpedo defense, but came with drawbacks. Various opinions on the best combination of guns existed: all 8-inch, all 7-inch, or a mix.|$|E
5|$|As many as 15 German Tornados {{undertook}} {{combat operations}} {{as a part}} of NATO's campaign during the Bosnian War; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage inflicted by previous strikes and to scout targets for other aircraft to strike. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> target selection throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|After his much publicized {{problems}} on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived at spring training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes hoped they would be high percentage steals. At {{the end of the}} season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement.|$|E

5|$|The first tests using {{electric}} detonators and solid pits {{were performed on}} 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed. The {{electric detonators}} showed a <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> the achieved compression degree and symmetry, and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter. Based on these results, {{by the end of}} February the design of the gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that plagued the early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after guiding Gillingham to promotion, Peter Taylor left {{to manage}} Leicester City, and Hessenthaler was {{appointed}} player-manager. In {{his first season}} in charge, he guided the club to a thirteenth-place finish while continuing to play regularly. A serious leg injury sustained in an FA Cup match against A.F.C. Bournemouth in January 2001 kept him out {{for the remainder of}} the season but did not prevent him being selected for the Football League's Team of the Season. Despite many of the club's rivals having greater budgets available with which to sign and pay players, the team finished the 2001–02 season in twelfth place and the following season in eleventh place in the First Division, Gillingham's best ever finish in over seventy seasons in the Football League. During the 2003–04 season, however, the Gills' fortunes declined, and the team only avoided relegation on goal difference after holding Stoke City to a draw in the last match of the season. As the team continued to struggle at the start of the following season, club owner Paul Scally reiterated his confidence in Hessenthaler but brought in former Swindon Town and Wycombe Wanderers manager John Gorman to assist him. The following month, with no <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> the team's fortunes, Hessenthaler tendered his resignation.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm {{also created}} two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main {{governmental}} body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The Council was intended by the partitioners {{to be an}} institution easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of}} the Russian Empire. It was nonetheless a <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> the Commonwealth governance. The Council, with committees (ministries) on Foreign Affairs, Treasury, Defense, Justice and the Interior (Police), was able to interpret existing laws in the sphere of administration, and provided the Commonwealth with a continuous governing body that operated between the Sejms and was not affected by the liberum veto. The Permanent Council was led by the king, had 36 members elected, half from each chamber of the Sejm, and ruled by majority vote (the king decided in case of a tie). The previously powerful ministers were placed under the control of the new council and supervised by the five parallel departments of the Council. The Council, in addition to its administrative duties, would present to the king three candidates for each nomination to the Senate and other main offices.|$|E
