5|$|Sarah's {{concern for}} her grandchildren briefly {{came to a}} halt, however, when in 1716 her husband had two strokes, the second of which left him without the ability to speak. Sarah <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time with him, {{accompanying}} him to Tunbridge Wells and Bath, and he recovered shortly afterwards. Even after his recovery, Sarah opened his correspondence and filtered the letters Marlborough received, lest their contents precipitate another stroke.|$|E

Appearing {{with her on}} stage were Toundas, the violinist Dimitris Semsis (Salonikios), and oud player Agapios Tomboulis. Eskenazi, however was {{the star of the}} show, earning an unprecedented 200 drachmas per night. She later confided to her biographer Kostas. Hatzidoulis that she should have been much wealthier, just on the income from the show, but that she had a weakness for expensive jewelry and <b>spent</b> too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> income on it.|$|R

She was {{assigned}} to the China Station from 1901 to 1905, before returning to British waters for a brief stint with the Channel Fleet and then the Home Fleet from late 1905 to early 1907. After a refit in 1907, she was then sent to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she remained until April 1909. She then returned to Britain and was reduced to reserve status.

The ship became a gunnery training ship in 1906 until she was paid off in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a good student, earning good grades {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E

50|$|Martin {{developed}} {{an interest in}} writing from an early age. Before she {{was old enough to}} write, she would dictate stories to her mother to write down for <b>her.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> favorite authors at that time were Lewis Carroll, P. L. Travers, Hugh Lofting, Astrid Lindgren, and Roald Dahl. Martin loved creative writing in elementary school and discovered her passion for writing in second grade. She began writing short stories, and her fourth-grade teacher wrote on her student folder that she would make a wonderful writer because she <b>spent</b> so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> free time writing in notebooks. Her favorite subjects in {{middle school and high school}} were English and French. Her least favorite subject was Math.|$|R
5|$|Louise <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time at Kent House, and she {{frequently}} visited Scotland {{with her}} husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll's ancestral home, because {{the couple were}} economising. When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs. By the time of Edward VII's accession, there were four servants and two dogs.|$|E

She was educated {{at home by}} a governess {{until the age of}} eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs. When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon's Anabasis. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, Käthe Kübler, she passed the Oxford Local Examination with distinction at age thirteen.|$|E
5|$|The young Harriet <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{childhood}} at {{the family}} home at Fulbeck Hall in Lincolnshire, sited high on the limestone hills above Grantham. The house, which {{had been given to}} Henry Fane by his father, was a not over-large modern mansion at the time of Arbuthnot's childhood. It was rebuilt following a fire in 1733, and further extended and modernised in 1784 by Henry Fane. At Fulbeck Harriet and her 13 siblings enjoyed a comfortable and reasonably affluent rural childhood.|$|E

60|$|The squire {{was put up}} at Monsieur Martin's, and Polly {{slept in}} the one spare room at her sister's, all the party from the {{pavilion}} going over to the house, to the midday meal and supper. The squire and Polly were much pleased with their visit. It was evident that Patsey had become a prime favourite with her husband's family. Jean's sister Louise was assiduous in teaching her French, and she {{had already begun to}} make some progress. Louise and her mother were constantly running across to the little pavilion, on some errand or other; and Patsey <b>spent</b> as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time with them as she did in her own house.|$|R
5000|$|Nancy Pearl {{was raised}} in Detroit, Michigan and, by her own account, <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> time <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{childhood}} at the public library. Her decision to become a librarian started {{at the age of}} 10 with the inspiration of the children's librarian at her local public library. She credits books and librarians with helping her through a difficult childhood: [...] "It's not too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an exaggeration—if it's one at all—to say that reading saved my life." [...] She earned her master's in library science at the University of Michigan (1967) and became a children's librarian in her hometown library system before moving on to other libraries. As a hobby, Pearl wrote poetry as a young woman and in 1980 published a story in Redbook magazine called [...] "The Ride to School." ...|$|R
5|$|Z38 was a Type 1936A (Mob) {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down in 1941, and completed two years later.

She served with the 4th Destroyer Flotilla her entire time under German service, and <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life escorting escorting task forces, patrolling areas of sea, laying mines, or bombarding land forces. She served in the Baltic briefly in 1943, before being reassigned to the Arctic area around Norway from 1943 to 1945, and then serving in the Baltic again in 1945.|$|E
5|$|HMS Curacoa was a C-class light cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the First World War. She {{was one of the}} five ships of the Ceres sub-class and <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career as a flagship. The ship was {{assigned}} to the Harwich Force during the war, but saw little action as she was completed less than a year before the war ended. Briefly assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in early 1919, Curacoa was deployed to the Baltic in May to support anti-Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic during the Russian Civil War. Shortly thereafter the ship struck a naval mine and had to return home for repairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{the annual}} Teamsters {{convention}} {{was held at}} Caesars with a $650,000 party. The lavish feast included caviar, crab claws, roast beef {{and a range of}} 15 different desserts. In 1991, Sheila King won a $250,000 jackpot in the casino at Caesars Palace on a $500 machine, and won $50,000 twice soon afterwards. Over three years she won $200 million on the machines but kept pumping the money back into the machines. Despite her luck, in 1994 her winnings fell to $500,000, and she <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time {{over the next four years}} in the law courts claiming that the casino operators had tampered with her machines and deceived her to keep her winning.|$|E

50|$|Rakka leaves Reki, devastated, but finds {{and reads}} Reki's diary. From it, {{and from the}} {{forgotten}} memories it reveals, Rakka realizes that Reki has <b>spent</b> so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time as a Haibane performing good deeds that goodness has become her identity, even if she cannot see it. Realizing that Reki truly did care for her and did want someone to trust and to help her in her despair, Rakka returns to Reki's room. Suddenly, she finds herself and Reki trapped inside of Reki's dream, Reki standing on the tracks and the train approaching. Rakka rushes to help - only to learn that Reki cannot be saved without asking for help. On the brink of being run over again, this time by a grey amorphous train-like shape emerging from the wall painting, Reki does ask for help; Rakka rescues Reki just before the shape passes. Reki breaks free from the Circle <b>of</b> Sin, and <b>her</b> wings are restored.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, Lucy had <b>spent</b> so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{time and}} efforts {{at the bank}} that it seemed logical to make her a paid bank employee, and she became such, serving as Mooneys secretary. In the series later years, both Mooney and Lucy moved to California, where Mooney became vice {{president}} of a larger bank and Lucy again served as his secretary. The Mooney characters role expanded with the shift in locale to California, as The Lucy Shows other costar, Vivian Vance, left the series at the same time. Mooney became {{a key figure in}} nearly every episode from this point on. The Mooney character is best remembered for his ill-temper and shouting outbursts at the incompetent [...] "Mrs. Carmichael". During their time in Danfield, he also did battle with Lucys school friend, the Countess Framboise (née Rosie Harrigan), (Ann Sothern), who had been widowed herself by her husband, who was badly in debt. Since she was looking for money to pay off his debts, she crossed swords with Mr. Mooney, whom she invariably called [...] "Mr. Money".|$|R

Charlotte <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time socialising with other ladies, {{where it was}} common to pursue activities such as skating, gossiping, and holding dinner parties. She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also smoked and drank, and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She {{earned a reputation as}} a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending someone and earning their confidence, only to spread their secrets to others.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Austria-Hungary, Panther initially {{served with the}} main fleet. During this period, she visited Spain for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. Starting in the mid-1890s, the ship <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time abroad. From 1896 to 1898, she was stationed in China, and she sent a shore party to help United States Marines protect US civilians during a riot. She went on a cruise in the Mediterranean in 1902, and in 1905, she visited East Africa. Panther was modernized in 19091910 and received a new gun armament. At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the ship {{was assigned to the}} Coastal Defense Special Group; these ships provided artillery support to an Austro-Hungarian Army attack in January 1916 that knocked Montenegro out of the war. The next year, Panther was withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a training ship. Awarded to Britain in the postwar division of war prizes, Panther was broken up for scrap in Italy in 1920.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Centurion {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. Although she <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time in reserve, she had a peripheral role in the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. After her return home in 1924, the ship became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. In 1926 Centurion was converted into a target ship and participated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of aerial bombing {{in addition to her}} normal duties. During the Second World War, the ship was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. When that operation was cancelled, she was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E
50|$|Shakuntala <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> time dreaming <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{new husband}} and was often distracted by her daydreams. One day, a {{powerful}} rishi, Durvasa, {{came to the}} ashrama but, lost in her thoughts about Dushyanta, Shakuntala failed to greet him properly. Incensed by this slight, the rishi cursed Shakuntala, saying that the person she was dreaming of would forget about her altogether. As he departed in a rage, one of Shakuntala's friends quickly explained to him the reason for her friend's distraction. The rishi, realizing that his extreme wrath was not warranted, modified his curse saying {{that the person who}} had forgotten Shakuntala would remember everything again if she showed him a personal token that had been given to her.|$|R
25|$|In March 1976, Mbeki, Albert Dhlomo and Jacob Zuma {{were arrested}} in Swaziland, but the trio managed to escape {{deportation}} to South Africa. Instead, a month after their arrest, they were escorted {{across the border to}} Mozambique. From there, Mbeki went back to Lusaka for a few months before being posted to Nigeria in January 1977. Before leaving Lusaka, Mbeki was appointed as deputy to Duma Nokwe in the Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP). Mbeki's mission in Nigeria was to establish diplomatic relations with Olusegun Obasanjo's regime, – a mission that proved to be quite successful as Mbeki was to build a lasting relationship with the Nigerian authorities, eclipsing the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in Nigeria. Zanele, who was running the Africa offices of the International University Education Fund in Lusaka, <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> 1977 with <b>her</b> husband in Nigeria.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to the United States, {{the praise}} for the tour continued. Annie Zaleski (Riverfront Times) writes the {{performance}} at the Fabulous Fox Theatre was charming, meeting all expectations. She continues, Also fantastic was {{the ease with which}} she transitioned from such seemingly different instruments—all of which were white and covered in rhinestones. For [...] "Thank God I’m a Country Girl", she flew through fiddle, banjo, and harmonica, all feverishly supplied by her [...] "useful and ornamental" [...] hick Chippendale (Steve Summers) who dosey-doed in shirtless abandon in overalls nearby. Evan Rytlewski (Shepherd Express) wrote of Parton's stage persona at her concert at the Riverside Theater, [...] "Parton's hokey facade is a remnant of the old Las Vegas/Grand Ole Opry era of entertainment, and it still dominates her concerts. She <b>spent</b> nearly as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> performance Monday night sharing stories and cracking jokes as she did singing, proving herself quite the comedian. At 62, she's part-grandmother (she riffed on her poor eyesight and mortality), part-cougar (she ogled a dancing beefcake), and her sharp quips had the audience roaring with laughter." ...|$|R
5|$|Commissioned {{too late}} to see any combat in World War II, Boxer <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career in the Pacific Ocean seeing 10 tours in the western Pacific. Her initial duties {{involved}} mostly training and exercises, including launching the first carrier-based jet aircraft, but demobilization prevented much activity in the late 1940s. At {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War, she was used as an aircraft transport before arriving off Korean waters as the third U.S. carrier to join the force. She supported the Inchon landings and subsequent invasion of North Korea, and was among the ships that provided support during the Chinese counteroffensive against an under-prepared and spread out United Nations (UN) force. She saw three subsequent combat tours in Korea conducting close air support and strategic bombing in support of UN ground troops fighting along the 38th parallel, as the battles lines had largely solidified by this time. She was awarded eight battle stars for her service in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Cummings {{joined the}} Los Angeles Athletic Club (LAAC) in 1934 and {{received}} her first financial support in 1935, helping her attend that year's Far Western Championships. She captured the American national 200-meter breaststroke championship in 1936, {{which led to}} her participation in that year's Olympic trials and her selection {{as a member of}} the United States delegation to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. She was required, however, to raise her own funds for travel to the Games and <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time leading up to the tournament collecting money rather than training. In the women's 200-meter breaststroke, she placed fourth in her heat in the opening round and was eliminated. Despite this, she remained as national champion in the event through 1939, although she left the LAAC in 1937. She placed second at the 1939 National Championships and retired from active competition shortly after, deciding that the 1940 Summer Olympics were unlikely to occur. In 1941, she earned a degree in physical sciences and math from the University of Southern California.|$|E

In 1913, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Division. She was then sent to the Caribbean to protect German nationals during the Mexican Revolution. In mid-1914, she carried the former dictator Victoriano Huerta to Jamaica, where the British had granted him asylum. She was due to return to Germany in July 1914, but was prevented by the outbreak of World War I from doing so. At the onset of hostilities, Dresden operated as a commerce raider in South American waters in the Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific Ocean in September and joined Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron.|$|E
