5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!,</b> many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|Copies of Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> were {{purchased}} by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. The VHS tapes circulated widely {{in schools and}} rape crisis centers in Australia; although showings began to decrease as VHS became less popular, the film was a significant teaching tool. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> and therefore broadcast it a second time that year.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!,</b> released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E

5|$|Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the {{youngest}} {{was seven years}} old. The prosecutors found Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> on YouTube and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not admitted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> was {{released}} in the United Kingdom in October 1985 on VHS with notes for teachers and two relevant books, and was distributed by Skippon Video, Skippon's UK-based company. Although several other short children's educational films about sexual abuse were {{on the market in}} the UK including several also released that year, Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> was the only British film; the others were made in Australia, Canada and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!,</b> Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first victim was about the age of the children in Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E

5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Scare, {{filmed in}} a North London school, {{consists}} of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers {{to listen to}} the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote child protection projects in schools. Although Harris appears in Beyond the Scare, his role is less prominent than in Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Kids Can <b>Say</b> <b>No!</b> was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E

At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still <b>say</b> <b>no.</b> Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no.

Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1987, President Ronald Reagan considered appointing Senator Orrin Hatch to fill his seat. But Congress had, during the term which he was still serving, enacted a salary increase for the judiciary. In July 1987, Bork was nominated instead, {{although it is not}} clear how important a role the Ineligibility Clause issue played in the selection. Two months later, Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the Saxbe fix in a written opinion, concluding that it did not resolve the Ineligibility Clause issue. (The Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate, and the seat ultimately went to Anthony Kennedy.) According to Jan Crawford Greenberg, the Justice Department had previously done the same to Senator Hatch the year prior when Hatch put forth his name as a replacement for retiring Chief Justice Warren Burger. According to Greenburg, Michael Carvin used the Ineligibility Clause as a pretext to allow the White House to quietly <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to Hatch.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson finds it hard to <b>say</b> <b>no</b> because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one of the reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
