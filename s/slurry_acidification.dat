Previous studies have reported that livestock production is {{the main source of}} anthropogenic ammonia (NH 3) emissions in Europe (Kai et al., 2008) and an important source of greenhouse gases (Weiske and Petersen, 2006). Effluent treatment has been promoted to improve slurry management and to reduce its environmental impact (Sommer and Hutchings, 2001, Fangueiro et al., 2008 a). Solid-liquid separation of slurry is a useful tool at the farm level producing valuable fractions, a liquid {{that can be used for}} direct fertilisation and a solid fraction that can be composted (Fangueiro et al., 2008 b). Alternatively, acidification of slurry has been proposed to reduce ammonia (NH 3) emissions during storage and field application (Kai et al., 2008). Previous works (Misselbrook et al., 2005; Fangueiro et al., 2008 a) reported that higher NH 3 emissions occurred during storage of liquid fraction of slurry or manure with low dry matter content, probably due to a reduced crust formation that decreases NH 3 emissions. Hence, acidification of the liquid fraction of slurry is strongly recommended. <b>Slurry</b> <b>acidification</b> is common practice in The Netherlands and Denmark (Schils et al., 1999; Eriksen et al., 2008) but this technology still needs to be improved to avoid hazards. It is expected that this technology will be used in more countries since the European Directive (2001 / 81 /CE) demands a decrease of atmospheric pollutants such as NH 3 : targets for lower NH 3 emissions have been already set in Spain (Castrillon et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the acidification process leads to significant carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions (Vandré and Clemens, 1997). Such CO 2 release is problematic when a closed system of <b>slurry</b> <b>acidification</b> is used (when acidified slurry is flushed back to pig houses) since it may lead to foam formation (Vandré and Clemens, 1997; Borst, 2001). Nevertheless, Fangueiro et al. (2010) reported that acidification of slurry or derived fractions led to a decrease in CO 2 emissions following soil addition relative to non acidified materials. The aim of the present work was to measure the CO 2 emissions during the acidification process of the liquid fraction of pig slurry and its subsequent impact during storage and after soil incorporation...|$|E
40|$|Animal manure {{contributes}} considerably to ammonia (NH 3) and {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions in Europe. Various treatment technologies {{have been implemented}} to reduce emissions and to facilitate its use as fertilizer, but a systematic analysis of these technologies {{has not yet been}} carried out. This study presents an integrated assessment of manure treatment effects on NH 3, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) emissions from manure management chains in all countries of EU- 27 in 2010 using the MITERRA-Europe model. Effects of implementing 12 treatment technologies on emissions and nutrient recovery were further explored through scenario analyses; the level of implementation corresponded to levels currently achieved by forerunner countries. Manure treatment decreased GHG emissions from manures in EU countries by 0 - 17 % in 2010, with the largest contribution from anaerobic digestion; the effects on NH 3 emissions were small. Scenario analyses indicate that increased use of <b>slurry</b> <b>acidification,</b> thermal drying, incineration and pyrolysis may decrease NH 3 (9 - 11 %) and GHG (11 - 18 %) emissions; nitrification-denitrification treatment decreased NH 3 emissions, but increased GHG emissions. The nitrogen recovery (% of nitrogen excreted in housings that is applied to land) would increase from a mean of 57 % (in 2010) to 61 % by acidification, but would decrease to 48 % by incineration. Promoting optimized manure treatment technologies can greatly contribute to achieving NH 3 and GHG emission targets set in EU environmental policies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Farm {{livestock}} manure {{is an important}} source of ammonia and greenhouse gases. Concerns over the environmental impact of emissions from manure management have resulted in research efforts focusing on emission abatement. However, questions regarding the successful abatement of manure-related emissions remain. This study uses a meta-analytical approach comprising 89 peer-reviewed studies to quantify emission reduction potentials of abatement options for liquid manure management chains from cattle and pigs. Analyses of emission reductions highlight the importance of accounting for interactions between emissions. Only three out of the eight abatement options considered (frequent removal of manure, anaerobic digesters, and manure acidification) reduced ammonia (3 - 60 %), nitrous oxide (21 - 55 %), and methane (29 - 74 %) emissions simultaneously, whereas in all other cases, tradeoffs were identified. The results demonstrate that a shift from single-stage emission abatement options towards a wholechain perspective is vital in reducing overall emissions along the manure management chain. The study also identifies some key elements like proper clustering, reporting of influencing factors, and explicitly describing assumptions associated with abatement options that can reduce variability in emission reduction estimates. Prioritization of abatement options according to their functioning can help to determine low-risk emission reduction options, specifically options that alter manure characteristics (e. g., reduced protein diets, anaerobic digestion, or <b>slurry</b> <b>acidification).</b> These insights supported by comprehensive emission measurement studies can help improve the effectiveness of emission abatement and harmonize strategies aimed at reducing air pollution and climate change simultaneously...|$|E
30|$|Permeability of {{the waste}} {{controls}} the water table, draw-down curve, migration of contaminants out {{of the waste}} piles, and oxidation rates. The embankment slopes that are generally not as well compacted have a much higher air and water permeability and {{this can lead to}} increased pyrite weathering and sulfate discharge. These discharges, rich in ferric iron (powerful oxidant) typically seep into FCPW or slurry disposal areas and can accelerate <b>slurry</b> oxidation and <b>acidification</b> at least in areas adjacent to the slopes. Since the water holding capacity of compacted CCPW is low, and the replaced soils are likely to be affected by upwardly migrating salts, the vegetation after reclamation can become stressed and over the long-term degraded.|$|R

The aim of this work was to {{study the effects of}} pre-treatment of <b>slurry</b> by <b>acidification</b> and/or the method of slurry application on soil on the nitrogen dynamics, namely gaseous emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) as well as nitrate leaching. A field trial with oat (Avena strigosa) has been carried out in two types of soil, with a sandy structure and the other one with a sandy-loam structure. The treatments applied were control (without slurry application), raw slurry applied by injection, raw slurry applied to soil surface followed by incorporation and acidified slurry applied to soil surface followed or not by incorporation. For each treatment, three replicates have been carried. Gaseous emissions of NH 3 and N 2 O have been measured, as well as leachate sampling whenever precipitation occurred. Leachate samples were analyzed for nitrate concentration, pH and EC. From the results obtained and according to the treatments, it was found that to reduce nitrogen losses by ammonia volatilization and nitrate leaching, the use of acidified slurry followed by soil incorporation is the best option for both soils without causing any decrease in oat production...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Cattle-slurry {{management}} {{became a}} priority in many livestock farms and slurry treatment is used to increase the fertilizer value of slurry and/or minimize its environmental impact. Indeed, significant emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases (GHG) as nitrous oxide (N 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) can occur during and after slurry application to soil. Application of acidified slurry or liquid fraction (LF) obtained by solid-liquid separation are two alternatives to raw slurry application that {{have proven to be}} efficient to minimize ammonia emissions. However, few is known about its effect on GHG emissions. The aim of the present work was to assess the efficiency of cattle <b>slurry</b> treatment by <b>acidification</b> and/or solid liquid separation to mitigate ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions following surface application to a sandy loam soil...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{nitrogen}} (N) in organic manures more effectively reduces losses to the environment. A requirement to take allowance of the N conserved by reduced ammonia (NH 3) -emission techniques would increase manure-N efficiency {{by up to}} 15 %. Covering manure stores and land application of slurry by injection beneath the soil surface and by rapid incorporation of both slurries and solid manures into uncropped soil reduce NH 3 emissions. Injection of cattle slurry also reduces N immobilization compared with application methods, which mix the slurry with soil and increases manure-N efficiency by ca 10 – 15 %. In growing cereals, NH 3 emissions can be reduced by band spreading within the canopy. Anaerobic digestion of slurry may also increase manure-N availability in the season of application by 10 – 20 %, compared with undigested slurry. <b>Slurry</b> <b>acidification</b> may increase manure-N efficiency by 35 – 65 % by reducing total NH 3 losses by 70 % compared with unacidified slurry stored without cover and not incorporated after spreading. To fully utilize the fertilizer value of manure-N, uptake over more than 1 year needs to be accounted for. This is particularly important for solid manures which provide less-available N in the season after application than slurries but release more N to crops in subsequent years. Using manure-N as a sole N source may limit overall manure-N efficiency. Applying manures at reduced rates over a larger crop area, using N fertilizer at times when crop recovery of manure-N may be limited, may give the greatest overall manure-N efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Among {{environmental}} {{issues related to}} intensive livestock activity, emissions to air from manure management are of increasing concern. Thus {{the knowledge of the}} effect of treatment application on subsequent emissions from manure is required to assess the environment impact of management solutions. This work addresses the effect of anaerobic digestion and phase separation on emissions during storage by studying nitrogen losses from lab-scale stores and field pilot-scale stores of a co-digestate cattle slurry and its respective separated fractions. Lab-scale experiment was carried in temperature-controlled room where each fraction (untreated, separated liquid and separated solid) was stored in duplicate for a period of 32 days in 30 L vessel. Pilot-scale experiment was carried out both during the cold season and during warm season for 90 days of storage. In both experimentations samples of the manure were analysed periodically for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total ammonia nitrogen, dry matter and volatile solids and pH. These analyses allow estimating nitrogen losses in different storage conditions. Effects of mechanical separation and season were assessed by ANOVA (Wilcoxon test, P< 0. 05). In temperature controlled conditions nitrogen losses measured account for 13 % and 26 % of TKN for unseparated and separated slurries respectively. In field conditions during cold season nutrient losses were limited. On average unseparated and separated slurries lost respectively 6. 8 % and 12. 6 % of their initial TKN content. Much higher were the TKN losses from the slurries examined in warm season where losses raised up to 40 % of the initial TKN content. Generally mechanical separation increases nutrient losses, but the differences were not significant in field conditions. The results highlighted that nutrient losses, in particular the nitrogen ones, can be considerable especially during summer storage. The latter, in case of separated slurries, are mainly related to the liquid fraction, which is responsible for up 92 % of the losses. When phase separation after anaerobic digestion is used, mitigation options, as covers or <b>slurry</b> <b>acidification,</b> are advisable in order to limit the negative environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|Livestock slurry is a {{valuable}} source of phosphorus (P) fertiliser for crops, but can also result in eutrophication following mobilisation and delivery to watercourses. The transfer of slurry-derived P to watercourses {{is likely to be}} strongly influenced by its particle size distribution and the chemical form of the P within the slurry. Advanced slurry processing (e. g. acidification, anaerobic digestion) is also likely to alter the forms and distribution of P within slurry particle size fractions. In response to this, this thesis explores the effects of slurry processing on P speciation within a range of slurry particle size fractions and on potential P bioavailability and movement through soil. The P characteristics of cattle slurry, acidified slurry, anaerobically digested slurry, in terms of P speciation of different particle size fractions, was studied in Chapter 3 - 5. The results showed that in the whole untreated cattle slurry, labile inorganic P (IP-H 2 O + IP-NaHCO 3) and labile organic P (OP-H 2 O + OP-NaHCO 3) dominated the total P (TP) of the whole slurry (45 % and 24 % of TP respectively). Acidification increased the labile inorganic P proportion to 55 % of TP and decreased the stable P (IP-HCl + OP-HCl + TP-Residue) proportion from 21 % to 15 % of the TP of whole slurry. Anaerobic digestion increased the labile inorganic P and moderately labile P (IP-NaOH + OP-NaOH) proportions of whole slurry to 53 % and 12 %, but decreased the labile organic P proportion to 12 % of TP. After physical separation, the proportion of TP in the liquid fractions (2000, > 500, > 63 μm), while solid fractions tended to show greater proportions of moderately labile and stable P than liquid fractions. After acidification, the P speciation of the solid fractions showed little change. However, the labile inorganic P and the moderately labile P proportions increased in TP in the acidified liquid fractions, while stable P proportion in the liquid fractions decreased. After anaerobic digestion, in the TP of both solid and liquid fractions, the labile inorganic P and moderately labile P proportions increased, while the labile organic P proportion was reduced. The colloidal fraction (0. 45 - 63 μm) accounted for 62 % of the TP of whole untreated cattle <b>slurry.</b> <b>Acidification</b> reduced this proportion, while anaerobic digestion did not change it. In contrast, anaerobic digestion increased the labile inorganic P content of the colloids. P availability in soil after slurry application was explored in an incubation experiment monitored by sequential fractionation method (Chapter 7), and in a pot experiment involving P uptake by ryegrass (Chapter 8). The vertical mobility of P in soil was studied in laboratory microcosms (Chapter 6) and a pot experiment (Chapter 8). The results showed that untreated and treated cattle slurry increased the labile P content of soil and the P lability decreased gradually over time. Ryegrass P uptake was also increased by addition of different slurries. However, the differences between untreated and treated slurry amended treatments was not necessarily significant for labile P content in the soil and P uptake by ryegrass. In Chapter 6, the results implied that colloid-associated P in cattle slurry caused greater potential P leaching and that anaerobic digestion even increased this mode of P loss. Although in the pot experiment, slurry amended treatments showed no difference in cumulative P leaching compared to the control, the colloidal fraction in untreated and treated slurries was still a dominant fraction associated with a large portion of P. Further work is necessary to demonstrate the effect of slurry processing on P bioavailability and mobility at the plot- and field-scale, and on recovering colloidal P prior to land spreading...|$|E
40|$|Achieving global {{optimization}} of inorganic sorbent efficacy, {{as well as}} tailoring sorbent specificity {{for target}} sorbates would facilitate increased wide-spread use of these materials in applications such as producing potable water or nuclear waste treatment. Sodium titanates have long been known as sorbents for radionuclides; {sup 90 }Sr and transuranic elements in particular. We have developed a related class of materials, which we refer to as peroxo-titanates: these are sodium titanates or hydrous titanates synthesized {{in the presence of}} or treated post-synthesis with hydrogen peroxide. Peroxo-titanates show remarkable and universal improved sorption behavior with respect to separation of actinides and strontium from Savannah River Site (SRS) nuclear waste simulants. Enhancement in sorption kinetics can potentially result in as much as an order of magnitude increase in batch processing throughput. Peroxo-titanates have been produced by three different synthetic routes: post-synthesis peroxide-treatment of a commercially produced monosodium titanate, an aqueous-peroxide synthetic route, and an isopropanol-peroxide synthetic route. The peroxo-titanate materials are characteristically yellow to orange, indicating the presence of protonated or hydrated Ti-peroxo species; and the chemical formula can be generally written as H{sub v}Na{sub w}Ti{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }-(xH{sub 2 }O) [yH{sub z}O{sub 2 }] where (v+w) = 2, z = 0 - 2, and total volatile species accounts for 25 - 50 wt % of the solid. Further enhancement of sorption performance is achieved by processing, storing and utilizing the peroxo-titanate as an aqueous slurry rather than a dry powder, and post-synthesis acidification. All three synthesis modifications; addition of hydrogen peroxide, use of a <b>slurry</b> form and <b>acidification</b> can be applied more broadly to the optimization of other metal oxide sorbents and other ion separations processes...|$|R

However there are drawbacks associated to the current acidification treatment, and it is unknown how acidification before separation affects slurry characteristics and gaseous emissions. This thesis presents an in-depth investigation of the combined acidification and separation of slurry by analyzing {{the composition of the}} fractions obtained and the impact on gaseous emissions during storage. Systematic studies for acidification were performed using different additives, target pH values and approaches and different techniques were used to separate different types of slurries. The effects of <b>acidification</b> on <b>slurries</b> dry matter, organic matter and nutrient (N and P) content and their soluble forms were studied and gaseous emissions were followed during storage. The effects of <b>acidification</b> on <b>slurry</b> particle size, nutrient distribution among particles and on separation efficiency were studied. In the acidification experiments, alum emerged as a highly efficient additive for reducing NH 3 emissions. The nutrient composition and potential of N mineralization of acidified slurry fractions differed depending on the separation technique used. Acidification affected differently the particle size in slurries, the nutrient distribution among particles and the separation efficiency depending on the additive used. The use of alum promoted an increase of the solid fraction and an almost complete removal of P (90 %) to the solid fraction. According to our results, combined acidification and separation improves slurry management: It increases the amount of solid fractions, preserves N in slurries by reducing NH 3 emissions during separation, increases the P separation efficiency to the solid fraction, and reduces the total NH 3 and GHG emissions during storage. Therefore, the combined technology provides farmers with an economically sound and environmentally safe approach to slurry re-us...|$|R
40|$|Livestock manure {{contributes}} considerably {{to global}} emissions of ammonia (NH 3) {{and greenhouse gases}} (GHG), especially methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Various measures {{have been developed to}} mitigate these emissions, but most of these focus on one specific gas and/or emission source. Here, we present a meta-analysis and integrated assessment of the effects of mitigation measures on NH 3, CH 4 and (direct and indirect) N 2 O emissions from the whole manure management chain. We analysed the effects of mitigation technologies on NH 3, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from individual sources statistically using results of 126 published studies. Whole-chain effects on NH 3 and GHG emissions were assessed through scenario analysis. Significant NH 3 reduction efficiencies were observed for (i) housing via lowering the dietary crude protein (CP) content (24 – 65 %, compared to the reference situation), for (ii) external <b>slurry</b> storages via <b>acidification</b> (83 %) and covers of straw (78 %) or artificial films (98 %), for (iii) solid manure storages via compaction and covering (61 %, compared to composting), and for (iv) manure application through band spreading (55 %, compared to surface application), incorporation (70 %) and injection (80 %). Acidification decreased CH 4 emissions from stored slurry by 87 %. Significant increases in N 2 O emissions were found for straw-covered slurry storages (by two orders of magnitude) and manure injection (by 26 – 199 %). These side-effects of straw covers and slurry injection on N 2 O emission were relatively small when considering the total GHG emissions from the manure chain. Lowering the CP content of feed and acidifying slurry are strategies that consistently reduce NH 3 and GHG emissions in the whole chain. Other strategies may reduce emissions of a specific gas or emissions source, by which there is a risk of unwanted trade-offs in the manure management chain.

40|$|Animal manures {{are major}} sources of {{nutrients}} and organic matter, {{to be used to}} fertilize crops and improve soil quality. However, when not properly managed, these manures release considerable amounts of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) into the air, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to water bodies, which create a range of unwanted environment impacts. Nutrient losses from manure depend on the management activities and techniques used at different stages of the whole manure management chain, from animal feeding up to manure application to land. The trade-offs and co-benefits of emission mitigation measures and manure treatment technologies are as yet poorly understood, especially when taking the whole manure management chain into account. Moreover, the effects of combinations of measures and technologies have not been well analyzed, and analyses at national scales are lacking. The overall objective of this PhD thesis research is (i) to enhance the quantitative insight into the effects of emission mitigation measures and treatment technologies on emissions of NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4, and the recovery of N and P from animal manure in the whole management chain, and (ii) to explore the effects of combinations of measures and technologies to mitigate these emissions and to increase the N and P recovery. In Chapter 2, methodologies for estimating N excretion factors for the main animal categories in member states of the European Union (EU) were reviewed. In Chapter 3, a transparent and uniform methodology for estimating annual feed use and N excretion per animal category for all countries of the EU- 27 was developed, based on the energy and protein requirements of the animals and statistics of feed use and composition, animal number and productivity. In Chapter 4, firstly the impacts of a suite of NH 3 mitigation measures on emissions of NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4 at individual stages of the manure management chain were analyzed by means of a meta-analysis of published data. Secondly, the overall impacts of alternative combinations of mitigation measures on emissions from the whole chain were evaluated through scenario analysis. Chapter 5 reports on an integrated assessment of the effects of manure treatment on NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from manure management chains in EU- 27 at the national level for 2010, using the model MITERRA-Europe. Whole-chain effects of implementing twelve treatment technologies in EU- 27 on emissions and N and P recovery were further explored through scenario analyses. Chapter 6 reports on a survey conducted under various stakeholder groups with expertise in the domain of manure treatment in four European countries that have regions of high animal density. The survey addressed questions related to i) which factors facilitate and hinder the implementation of treatment technologies in practice, ii) which technologies have the most potential for successful adoption, and iii) how farm characteristics and the scale of the treatment operation affect priorities for adoption. The main conclusions of this PhD thesis are as follows: In EU- 27, the amounts of N and P in manure are as large as or larger than the total amounts of fertilizer N and P used annually. However, there is a huge spatial variation in manure production. Nutrient excretion factors per animal category also vary between countries, as a result of variations in feed use and animal productivity. Clearly, for accurate inventories of national emission {{there is a need for}} estimating nutrient excretion using country-specific feed use data. Increasing the effectiveness of measures to mitigate NH 3 and GHG emissions from animal manure requires proper combination of measures in the manure management chain. Lowering the dietary protein content in animal feed is an effective measure to reduce NH 3 emissions and other N emissions at all stages of the manure management chain. Other measures may reduce emissions of a specific gas or emissions source, by which there is a risk of unwanted trade-offs in the manure management chain. Joint adoption of these measures with low-N feeding strategies and <b>slurry</b> <b>acidification</b> can greatly decrease the risk of pollution swapping. Implementation of manure treatment is on average still limited in EU- 27. Effects of manure treatment on NH 3 and GHG emissions are therefore relatively small at EU level. Increasing the implementation of treatment technologies, including acidification, incineration and thermal drying, or optimized combinations of treatment technologies, can significantly contribute to achieving NH 3 and GHG emission targets of EU environmental policies. Implementation of manure treatment technologies provides opportunities to improve the use of plant nutrients in manures, because of the release of manure products with different N/P ratios. Applying acidification technology and optimized combination of NH 3 emission mitigation measures increase the N recovery from animal manure, and can decrease the demand of mineral fertilizers. However, some technologies decrease the N and P recovery and/or decrease the availability of the N and P in manure products to plants. Implementation of manure treatment in practice is forced by the pressure from EU environmental regulations, and is hindered by financial barriers. To encourage the adoption of manure treatment, policies must be economically appealing to attract new adopters (farmers and industries). Long-term financial support schemes (e. g. subsidies) seem to be necessary, especially with the current low prices for fossil fuels. Outreach strategies are required to convey the knowledge to stakeholders from both the supply and the demand side, with respect to the economic, technical and environmental aspects of manure treatment technologies...|$|E
