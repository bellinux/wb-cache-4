40|$|The gas {{chromatograph}} {{is the most}} commonly used instrumentation for the analysis of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs) worldwide. Recent estimates place the number of GCs currently in use at over 300, 000 instruments. Analysis of ambient atmospheric vapor samples for VOC’s is relevant in industrial safety compliance monitoring, environmental quality monitoring and the diagnostic analysis of human breath. The usefulness of a multi-bed <b>sorption</b> <b>trap</b> using discrete beds of carbon-based sorbents and its use in inlet systems for {{gas chromatograph}}y and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography is demonstrated in this work. The experimental studies presented in this work address different uses of the multi-bed <b>sorption</b> <b>trap</b> for various analyses. These include the analysis of volatile organics in air, the analysis of human breath, and a inlet system designed for pyrolysis-preconcentration with GCxGC. 	Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) is well suited to the analysis of complex samples and is used in the analysis of human breath in this work. Comprehensive two-dimensional separations are achieved by connecting in series two capillary columns using stationary phases of different selectivity by means of a concentration-modulator interface. 	The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate inlets using the sorption-based, multi-bed preconcentrator to solve specific problems relating to the analysis of volatile and semi-volatile compounds. 	Results of the studies presented in this work demonstrate the development of a functional multi-bed sorption based preconcentrator able to collect and inject analytes over a wide range of functionalities and volatilities. Through the addition of a length of thick film capillary column in series with the multi-bed preconcentrator, the effective usable range of the preconcentrator was extended from C 14 to at least C 24. The final work demonstrated the effectiveness of the multi-bed sorption-based preconcentrator combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography for the investigation of the components of human breath...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{describe}} a simple method for sampling, pre-concentrating, and separating volatile and semi-volatile components {{from two different}} cave atmospheres. Sampling is performed by capturing a volume of cave atmosphere in a Tedlar bag or Suma canister for sample storage and transport back to the laboratory. Loading {{a portion of the}} sample on a multi-bed <b>sorption</b> <b>trap</b> allows for sample pre-concentration prior to separation and detection of components on a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph (GC×GC). Comparison of two Texas caves reveals the power of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) for volatile separation and detection, and to our knowledge marks the first use of GC×GC for the analysis of cave atmospheres. Analysis of the results revealed 138 and 146 chromatographic signals over an S/N threshold of 500 and direct comparison of the two samples revealed 50 identical chromatographic signals. This study is a first step toward demonstrating the ability of GC×GC to separate the complex volatiles and semi-volatiles in the cave atmosphere as a fingerprinting tool...|$|E
40|$|Washed sodium-aluminosilicate (NAS) solids at initial {{concentrations}} of 3. 55 and 5. 4 g/L sorb or uptake virtually no cesium over 288 hours, nor do any NAS solids generated during that time. These {{concentrations of}} solids {{are believed to}} conservatively bound current and near-term operations. Hence, the NAS solids should not have affected measurements of the cesium during the mass transfer tests and there is minimal risk of accumulating cesium during routine operations (and hence posing a gamma radiation exposure risk in maintenance). With respect to actinide uptake, it appears that NAS solids sorb minimal quantities of uranium - up to 58 mg U per kg NAS solid. The behavior with plutonium is less well understood. Additional study may be needed for radioactive operations relative to plutonium or other fissile component <b>sorption</b> or <b>trapping</b> by the solids. We recommend this testing be incorporated in the planned tests using samples from Tank 25 F and Tank 49 H to extend the duration to bound expected inventory time for solution...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper reports {{experimental}} measurements {{performed to}} test the ability of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) imaging to provide quantitative information about transport parameters in porous media such as the dispersivity α, the mixing front velocity u, and the retardation factor Rf associated with the <b>sorption</b> or <b>trapping</b> of the tracers in the pore structure. The flow experiments are performed in a homogeneous porous column placed between two vertical set of electrodes. Ionic and dyed tracers are injected {{from the bottom of}} the porous media over its full width. Under such condition, the mixing front is homogeneous in the transverse direction and shows an S-shape variation in the flow direction. The transport parameters are inferred from the variation of the concentration curves and are compared with data obtained from video analysis of the dyed tracer front. The variations of the transport parameters obtained from an inversion performed by the Gauss-Newton method applied on smoothness-constrained least-squares are studied in detail. While u and Rf show a relatively small dependence on the inversion procedure, α is strongly dependent on the choice of the inversion parameters. Comparison with the video observations allows for the optimization of the parameters; these parameters are found to be robust with respect to changes in the flow condition and conductivity contrast...|$|R
40|$|Most sample-enrichment {{procedures}} {{currently available}} rely on adsorption of the analytes of interest by a suitable adsorbent material. Although good performance {{can be obtained}} for many practical problems, {{in some cases the}} applicability of adsorptive sample preparation falls short, particularly for the enrichment of polar and/or high-molecular-weight compounds, especially in combination with thermal desorption. Because of the very strong retention of adsorbent materials, undesired effects such as incomplete desorption and artifact formation are observed. Polar solutes are easily adsorbed but readily undergo surface-catalyzed reactions and on desorption yield compounds different than those originally sampled. High-molecular-weight compounds cannot be desorbed because of extremely strong interactions with the adsorbent and their low volatility. To overcome some of these problems sample-preparation techniques based on polydimethylsiloxane sorption have been developed over the past 15 years. In contrast with adsorptive <b>trapping,</b> <b>sorption</b> is based on dissolution of the analytes in a liquid polymeric material. This is a much more inert means of solute retention which overcomes some of the limitations encountered when working with adsorbents. In this contribution, the basic principles of sorption, the different instrumentation used, and applications of the technique will be reviewed. The review covers the sorptive sample-preparation techniques, open-tubular trapping (OTT), solid-phase microextraction (SPME), gum-phase extraction (GPE), equilibrium gum-phase extraction (EGPE), and stir-bar-sorptive extraction (SBSE). Because of the nature of sorptive sample-preparation techniques, which perform particularly well in combination with thermal desorption, this review focuses strongly on gas chromatography as the means of chemical analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of Amchitka underground nuclear tests conducted in 2002 is verified and uncertainty in model input parameters, {{as well as}} predictions, has been reduced using newly collected data obtained by the summer 2004 field expedition of CRESP. Newly collected data that pertain to the groundwater model include magnetotelluric (MT) surveys conducted on the island to determine the subsurface salinity and porosity structure of the subsurface, and bathymetric surveys to determine the bathymetric maps of the areas offshore from the Long Shot and Cannikin Sites. Analysis and interpretation of the MT data yielded information on {{the location of the}} transition zone, and porosity profiles showing porosity values decaying with depth. These new data sets are used to verify the original model in terms of model parameters, model structure, and model output verification. In addition, by using the new data along with the existing data (chemistry and head data), the uncertainty in model input and output is decreased by conditioning on all the available data. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach is adapted for developing new input parameter distributions conditioned on prior knowledge and new data. The MCMC approach is a form of Bayesian conditioning that is constructed {{in such a way that}} it produces samples of the model parameters that eventually converge to a stationary posterior distribution. The Bayesian MCMC approach enhances probabilistic assessment. Instead of simply propagating uncertainty forward from input parameters into model predictions (i. e., traditional Monte Carlo approach), MCMC propagates uncertainty backward from data onto parameters, and then forward from parameters into predictions. Comparisons between new data and the original model, and conditioning on all available data using MCMC method, yield the following results and conclusions: (1) Model structure is verified at Long Shot and Cannikin where the high-resolution bathymetric data collected by CRESP yield profiles matching those used to construct the Long Shot and Cannikin model cross sections in 2002. (2) Distributions of model input parameters (recharge, conductivity, and recharge-conductivity ratio) used in 2002 for the three sites are verified where the new data indicate distributions with narrower ranges (smaller uncertainty) but within the range employed in the 2002 model. (3) As a conservative approach, distribution of fracture porosity used in 2002 was deliberately skewed toward lower values. New CRESP data indicate that the selected porosity range was overly conservative. In addition, the range of porosity values obtained from the analysis of the MT data is found to generally be about three orders of magnitude lower than range of values used in the 2002 model, though the values themselves are much larger from the MT data. (4) Distributions of the flow model output (head distribution, salinity distribution, groundwater fluxes) resulting from the 2002 model for the three sites are verified where the new model output after conditioning on the data lie within the range of the 2002 model output. (5) Cannikin model output at location of well UAe- 1 is not fully verified where the new model results for small salinity values are not fully enclosed by the uncertainty bounds of the original model output. (6) With the new porosities developed from the analysis of MT data, radionuclides require thousands of years to reach the seafloor. No breakthrough resulted for any of the three sites within the 2000 year model timeframe, despite ignoring all retardation mechanisms (<b>sorption,</b> radionuclide <b>trapping</b> in glass, matrix diffusion, and radioactive decay). (7) The no-breakthrough results verify the original model in the sense that this result lies within the uncertainty bounds of the 2002 model expressed as + 2 {sigma}{sub Q} and - 2 {sigma}{sub Q}. The lower bound, - 2 {sigma}{sub Q}, in the 2002 model gave negative values implying that the bound is essentially zero. The current results of no-breakthrough match this lower bound. (8) Significant uncertainty reduction is achieved for model input parameters (recharge, conductivity, and recharge-conductivity ratio) with the R/K ratio experiencing a very dramatic reduction. (9) Uncertainty in groundwater fluxes is also reduced due to the reduction of R/K uncertainty. (10) Groundwater velocities based on new data are orders of magnitude slower than the velocities produced by the 2002 model due to the higher porosity obtained from the analysis of the MT data. (11) Uncertainty reduction in radionuclide mass flux could not be assessed as the velocities are too small to produce radionuclide breakthrough within the model timeframe of 2, 000 years...|$|R
