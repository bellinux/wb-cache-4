5|$|At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, {{which was}} 70kg (155lb) lighter {{and had an}} engine {{producing}} 30 more horsepower. Mouton's rally ended when her engine caught on fire. On the first stage in Greece, <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> car on a hairpin turn 18km (11mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a repetition of the previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage and held on to it until her A2's engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later caught on fire, but {{she was able to}} continue in the event by following Mikkola's advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton's fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers' championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia's Röhrl and Alén to the drivers' title, Audi had lost the manufacturers' title to Lancia after the latter's triple win in Sanremo.|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} sighed. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes at Mr. Waddington {{in a manner}} which {{was meant to be}} languishing.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{round the}} young men, {{with a long}} sweep of her painted eyelashes, and flashed her yellow teeth at them. She spoke with a cockney accent, but with an {{affectation}} of refinement which made every word a feast of fun.|$|E
60|$|The yelling Ghost {{before him}} stands, See! <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes around, Now {{she lifts her}} bony hands, Now her {{footsteps}} shake the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "They notice nothing, these others," [...] he remarked, with {{a little}} wave of the hand. [...] "It is always the woman who counts. You are right, monsieur. She dances like a stick. She has good calves and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes. The canaille applaud. It is always like that. Your health, monsieur!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> would <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> {{big eyes}} and become {{in a way}} magnificent, so that Godfrey forgot her ugliness and the {{repulsion}} with which she inspired him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Guppy {{acknowledged}} the receipt by {{taking it out}} of his breast-pocket, putting it to his lips, and returning it to his pocket with a bow. Mr. Guppy's mother was so diverted that <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow.|$|E
6000|$|Was {{there ever}} {{anything}} so lucky as this? Pamela's situation was fast becoming the cook's situation. The bosom of the vigourous little woman {{began to show}} signs of tender agitation--distributed over a large surface. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes amorously. Benjulia puffed out another mouthful of smoke. [...] "Well," [...] he repeated, [...] "who rewards Pamela?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{there it}} is! She had burnt {{up a lot}} o' stuff, then took to bed with the child. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> up in all the quilts an' shawls an' dresses they was in the house; then laid down {{by the side of}} her, an' put her arm over her--an' froze--jes' like a mother--no judgment!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Mike {{is happy}} {{he no longer}} has to pay alimony since Susan is getting remarried. Susan drags Jackson aside {{to tell him how}} much she needs Mike's money, saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I can't marry you." [...] He points out that he'll be sent back to Canada and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes and says, [...] "It's Canada, not Iran. It's like America with free health insurance." [...] She {{promises}} to talk to Mike {{to see if they can}} [...] "work something out." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{gave the}} body a glance of satisfaction. She had {{performed}} her job, and now <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> down <b>her</b> sleeves, {{took off her}} apron, and put on her bonnet. Philip asked her how much he owed her.|$|R
50|$|The {{lady has}} braved the {{elements}} allowing {{a glimpse of}} her beautifully embroidered cotton nightgown of about 1905. <b>She</b> has <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> hair in strips of cotton the night before. This was a popular way to ensure curled hair.|$|R
60|$|A moment later, as the demoniacal {{chorus of}} yells, songs, incantations, shrieks, groans, and prayers swelled high, a farmer's wife {{on the left}} uttered a hoarse cry and {{stiffened}} and fell backward upon the ground. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> {{head from side to}} side. Her eyes turned in; her lips wore a maniac's laugh, and her troubled brow made her look like the death mask of a tortured murderer, the hell horror frozen on it.|$|E
60|$|Anything {{like the}} jocoseness of Mr. Guppy's mother just now, I think I never saw. She made no sound of laughter, but <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> head, and shook it, {{and put her}} {{handkerchief}} to her mouth, and appealed to Caddy with her elbow, and her hand, and her shoulder, and was so unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty she could marshal Caddy through the little folding-door into her bedroom adjoining.|$|E
6000|$|A snake's small eye blinks {{dull and}} shy, [...] And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head, [...] Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye, [...] 585 [...] And with {{somewhat}} of malice, {{and more of}} dread, [...] At Christabel she looked askance!-- [...] One moment--and the sight was fled! [...] But Christabel in dizzy trance [...] Stumbling on the unsteady ground [...] 590 [...] Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound; [...] And Geraldine again turned round, [...] And like a thing, that sought relief, [...] Full of wonder and full of grief, [...] <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> large bright eyes divine [...] 595 [...] Wildly on Sir Leoline.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> round <b>her</b> face, {{remained}} a moment looking deedily aslant at him; {{then with a}} slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet, and exclaiming abruptly [...] "I must mizzle!" [...] walked off quickly homeward. Jude followed and rejoined her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{talk about}} her. She used to be married to someone, and she {{divorced}} him. And then she was married to someone else, and he divorced her. And I'm certain her hair wasn't that colour two years ago, and I don't think a woman ought to make up like that, and her dress is all wrong for the country, and those pearls can't be genuine, and I hate the way <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes about, and pink doesn't suit her a bit. I think she's an awful woman, and I wish you wouldn't keep on talking about her." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{positively}} snorted with indignation; <b>she</b> had <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief into a ball, and nervously dabbed {{the palms}} of her hands with it. 'I followed you this afternoon, and I saw you go into that 'ouse with that low woman. What now? Eh?' She spoke with the greatest possible emphasis.|$|R
6000|$|A {{touch of}} {{amusement}} appeared on Miss Hazeltine's face. [...] "Very well," [...] said she, [...] "come {{out of this}} dreadfully cold place, and let us sit down on deck." [...] The barrister dolefully followed her. [...] "Now," [...] said she, making herself comfortable against {{the end of the}} house, [...] "go on. I will hear you out." [...] And then, seeing him stand before her with so much obvious disrelish to the task, she was suddenly overcome with laughter. Julia's laugh was a thing to ravish lovers; <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> mirthful descant with the freedom and the melody of a blackbird's song upon the river, and repeated by the echoes of the farther bank. It seemed a thing in its own place and a sound native to the open air. There was only one creature who heard it without joy, and that was her unfortunate admirer.|$|E
6000|$|Gabriel Nash {{introduced}} the new-comers to his companions; but the younger {{of the two}} ladies gave no sign of lending herself to this transaction. The girl was very white; she huddled there, silent and rigid, frightened to death, staring, expressionless. If Bridget Dormer had seen her at this moment she might have felt avenged for the discomfiture of her own spirit suffered at the Salon, the day before, under the challenging eyes of Maud Vavasour. It was plain at the present hour that Miss Vavasour would have run away had she not regarded the persons present as so many guards and keepers. Her appearance made Nick feel as if the little temple of art {{in which they were}} collected had been the waiting-room of a dentist. Sherringham had seen a great many nervous girls tremble before the same ordeal, and he liked to be kind to them, to say things that would help them to do themselves justice. The probability in a given case was almost overwhelmingly in favour of their having any other talent one could think of in a higher degree than the dramatic; but he could rarely refrain from some care that the occasion shouldn't be, even as against his conscience, too cruel. There were occasions indeed that could scarce be too cruel to punish properly certain examples of presumptuous ineptitude. He remembered what Mr. Nash had said about this blighted maiden, and perceived that though she might be inept she was now anything but presumptuous. Gabriel fell to talking with Nick Dormer while Peter addressed himself to Mrs. Rooth. There was no use as yet for any direct word to the girl, who was too scared even to hear. Mrs. Rooth, with her shawl fluttering about her, nestled against her daughter, putting out her hand to take one of Miriam's soothingly. She had pretty, silly, near-sighted eyes, a long thin nose, and an upper lip which projected over the under as an ornamental cornice rests on its support. [...] "So much depends--really everything!" [...] she said in answer to some sociable observation of Sherringham's. [...] "It's either this," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes expressively about the room, [...] "or it's--I don't know what!" ...|$|E
50|$|Room 702 and {{the clients}} {{requested}} Annie Duke for room service rather than Natalie Gulbis. Natalie {{had a hard}} time doing the room service and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes in front of Room 702.|$|E
6000|$|No further {{does she}} say, but {{lingering}} all the day, [...] Her high-borne turban'd head <b>she</b> wags, and <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> darkling eye, [...] And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.|$|R
50|$|From {{that day}} on, Fatima Besnaci-Lancou fused her anger {{and decided to}} write. She was {{determined}} to write {{the true story of}} harkis in contrary to what is being said; and her desire to have her children to know their mother's life story. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> out <b>her</b> first personal testimonial life story as a Daughter of Harki in 2003.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>her</b> {{knitting}} {{when she}} had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head. Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.|$|R
50|$|Her next tournament was in Ponte Vedra Beach, {{where she}} {{defeated}} Olga Govortsova in the final. Wozniacki then competed at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston. She {{advanced to the}} semifinals, where she met Vera Zvonareva. Wozniacki was forced to retire down 2-5, after <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> ankle while chasing down a short ball.|$|E

Her work is on sale at She is also a public speaker, coach and personal trainer, as well as becoming a prominent fitness model. As a youngster she competed for Croydon in the London Youth Games. She has also been on The BBC's A Question of Sport.In June 2015 Danvers appeared as a contestant on American TV show Bullseye. She reached the final stage, but failed to win when <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> buggy.|$|E
5000|$|Petkovic {{made her}} {{comeback}} in a Fed Cup match in April, losing to Samantha Stosur. She then {{played at the}} Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, beating Kristina Barrois in the first round. In her second round match against Victoria Azarenka, Petkovic was down 2-6 and 4-4 when <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> right ankle. She was forced out with what was later revealed to be torn ankle ligaments, which required surgery and kept her out for another four months, including the French Open, Wimbledon, and the 2012 London Olympics. She said of the injury: [...] "I knew immediately that it was bad because I heard everything crack. I tried to pull my foot up, and it just flopped there. The first thing I thought was: ‘Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Don’t cry.’ With 4,000 people watching. In Germany." [...] She attended weeks of rehabilitation to rebuild the muscles in her leg, working seven hours a day, five days a week.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, wait, Kallikrates," [...] said Ayesha, who, {{standing}} with the lamp raised above her head, flooding with its light her own rich beauty and the cold wonder of the death-clothed form upon the bier, resembled an inspired Sibyl rather than a woman, as <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> out <b>her</b> majestic sentences with a grandeur and a freedom of utterance which I am, alas! quite unable to reproduce.|$|R
60|$|She smoked contentedly. <b>She</b> had <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> {{cigarette}} {{herself with}} one hand, a feat beyond {{the powers of}} all but the very greatest. She was pleasantly tired after walking eighty-five times round the promenade deck. Soon {{she would go to}} bed and fall asleep the moment her head touched the pillow. But meanwhile she lingered here, for she felt that Billie had something to confide in her.|$|R

5000|$|Lawal was {{released}} from Strikeforce following comments he made on Twitter regarding Pat Lundvall after his hearing for his drug test. Lawal said, [...] "She asked if I did research for my training. I didn't get what she meant by the question, and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> eyes and asked, 'Do you speak English? Can you read?' I felt I was disrespected by the woman's comments. How {{are you going to}} ask a college educated, well traveled man if he can speak or read English? I'm speaking English {{right in front of you}} and I've been speaking English right in front of you for the past 15 minutes."After the release, Lawal issued an apology to Lundvall, stating, [...] "I was out of line for calling the woman the b-word and I was wrong for that. I was kind of mad about the comments, I was offended by the comments made towards me and I was out of line. I was too emotional. I apologize for that. With that being said, I still feel that I was offended, but I'm in the wrong for what I said." ...|$|E

60|$|Agatha said nothing, but a faint {{tinge of}} color crept into her cheeks, and Mrs. Hastings {{was glad to}} see it, for she had noticed that the girl was looking pale and haggard. The strain of the last few months that she had spent in England was {{beginning}} to tell on her. She had borne it courageously, but a reaction had set in, and the trip had been fatiguing. The Scarrowmania had plunged along, bows under, against fresh northwesterly gales most of the way across the Atlantic, and there is very little comfort on board a small, deeply-loaded steamer when <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> rails in, and lurches with thudding screw swung clear over big, steep-sided combers. Moreover, Agatha had scarcely slept during the few days and nights that she had spent in the train. It takes time to become accustomed to the atmosphere of a heated sleeper, and since she had landed she had been in a state of not unnatural nervous tension.|$|R
