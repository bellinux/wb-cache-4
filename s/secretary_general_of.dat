5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command.

5|$|The Arab Ba'ath Party {{merged with}} Akram al-Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party to {{establish}} the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party's leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which {{eventually led to the}} establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR's dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> the National Command of the Ba'ath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaq's position within the party was weakened {{to such an extent that}} he was forced to resign as the party's leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup d'état, which led to a schism within the Ba'ath Party. He escaped to Lebanon, but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party; during his tenure he held no de facto power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.|$|E

Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former <b>secretary</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> the Lebanese Communist Party and an ally of the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut. In the 2009 elections, the party again won a single seat, instead representing the West Bekaa district. It {{is a member of the}} March 14 Alliance parliamentary coalition.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E

5|$|By October 1971 Prince Souvanna {{had little}} {{alternative}} but to accept the Pathet Lao program {{as the basis for}} negotiations. The Pathet Lao agreed to the new negotiating effort and on 14 October, representatives of the party arrived in Vientiane. Two weeks later they were followed by Phoumi Vongvichit, <b>secretary</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> the Pathet Lao. Communist demands included: a cessation of the U.S. bombing of Lao territory; withdrawal of all U.S. advisors and military personnel; an election for a new National Assembly; the establishment of a coalition government; and compensation and resettlement for those Lao who had been forcibly relocated would be undertaken. The pace of negotiations in Laos, however, mirrored those in South Vietnam, the impetus of which was determined by the perceived military success of the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in {{a majority in the}} party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E
