40|$|There are {{competing}} demands for fresh water. Farms look {{to it as}} an irrigation source, cities rely on it for drinking water, and fisheries (and fishermen) depend on it for instream flow. When the United States Bureau of Reclamation (“Reclamation”) subsidizes the costs of providing fresh water for irrigation in agricultural production, such subsidization can result in tiered water pricing. With tiered pricing, farms pay the government less per unit than other water users. This tiered pricing can distort the water marketplace {{in a manner that}} encourages wasteful irrigation practices and leaves insufficient water instream for fisheries. The dispute over Reclamation irrigation subsidies may now be moving from the domestic to the international arena. The 1994 World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (“WTO Subsidies Agreement”) provides that one WTO member country may impose countervailing measures against another WTO member country that makes a “financial contribution” that is specific to “certain enterprises. ” The WTO <b>Subsidies</b> <b>Agreement</b> further provides that “government revenue... otherwise due [that] is forgone” can qualify as a “financial contribution” and that governments must be paid “adequate remuneration” for goods provided.

40|$|As {{far back}} as David Ricardo 2 ̆ 7 s {{shattering}} insight as to comparative advantage in 1817, agriculture has enjoyed special favor in trade. The unique place of farming was so well established {{by the time the}} 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (2 ̆ 2 GATT 2 ̆ 2) was negotiated that GATT 2 ̆ 7 s tight disciplines on government interference with free trade not only exempted government protections to growers, but in fact were drafted to be fully consistent with the agricultural policies of the major signatories. While it would be an exaggeration to argue that GATT 2 ̆ 7 s first half century was without impact on agricultural benefits, the sector at any rate took center stage during negotiations to create the World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2) because by the time these talks began in 1986, subsidy-induced overproduction had led to widespread displacement of efficient producers from their traditional markets. Many felt this result was far from realization of David Ricardo 2 ̆ 7 s compelling economic case for the smallest possible government intervention. While widely hailed for bringing agriculture, at last, under the GATT/WTO umbrella, 19952 ̆ 7 s Agreement on Agriculture (2 ̆ 2 Agreement on Agriculture 2 ̆ 2) more than lived up to the promise of Article 20 that 2 ̆ 2 substantial [...] . reductionsin support and protection resulting in fundamental reform is an ongoing process. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Both as to export subsidies [...] those contingent upon export performance and, thus, with the most direct impact on export prices and trade [...] and the remaining domestic subsidies, the Agreement on Agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s ambitions are so modest that many experts believed its generous exemptions and undefined terms rarely would permit successful reining in by dispute settlement panels of the nearly 1 billion a day developed nations provide to their farmers. Two decisions issued by WTO dispute settlement panels on September 8, 2004, belie that prediction. Brazil, an agricultural superpower in its own right, was a complainant in both cases. In the first case, a Panel found United States subsidies to upland cotton were sufficiently in excess of those granted by the UNITED STATES during the baseline 1992 marketing year to be actionable under the <b>Subsidies</b> <b>Agreement,</b> despite the protection of the 2 ̆ 2 Peace Clause 2 ̆ 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The Cotton Panel went on to find that these subsidies caused serious prejudice to Brazil 2 ̆ 7 s cotton growers within the meaning of the <b>Subsidies</b> <b>Agreement.</b> In the second case, which involved the EU 2 ̆ 7 s Common Agricultural Policy, a Panel held that the EU had exceeded its agreed commitments on sugar in both the amount of exports and the level of subsidies. This paper will analyze the major holdings of the Sugar and Cotton decisions from both a legal and an economic perspective, assess the WTO implications of those holdings on other crops and on Doha Round agriculture negotiations, and examine the effects on other United States exports of the failure of the United States to implement the decisions separate from Doha Round negotiations...|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} privately subsidized recycling schemes that are common {{in the developed countries}} and that may in certain circumstances harm the environment of developing countries {{as a result of the}} asymmetry in economic development and environmental protection between them and the developed countries where the products originate. This may happen, for instance, when such products are exported to developing countries and have a negative impact on the economic viability of collection and recycling of their own waste. Newly established and still struggling recycling plants, unsupported by private or governmental subsidies or other protective measures prevailing in the rich and more environmentally conscious countries, may be forced to close down. Alternatively, they may decide to abandon expensive collection of local waste, in favor of free or subsidized waste imported from developed countries. In both cases, collection and recycling activities in the importing countries are reduced, and sometimes eliminated. The objective of this article is to document and draw attention to this problem, that has not yet been discussed in the rich literature on trade 2 ̆ 6 environment, and to examine the question of what remedies, if any, may be offered under international trade law (in particular GATT/WTO rules) to affected countries. Would countries in situations as those described above be permitted to take measures against imports harming their recycling activities? Of particular interest in this regard, is how to relate to privately paid, but governmentally induced, subsidies under the WTO <b>Subsidies</b> <b>Agreement?</b> Such subsidies, while fulfilling most economic definitions of subsidies, appear to have escaped the attention of the Agreement’s drafters and may therefore be outside its scope. Importing member countries would therefore be precluded from taking countervailing measures against products enjoying such subsidies. These and other potential protective measures will be discussed in the article, in light of recent case law of the WTO, in particular in the matter of United States – Measures Treating Export Restraints as Subsidies. This discussion will demonstrate the formalistic nature of the existing WTO jurisprudence and show how a more purposive, teleological approach to interpretation of international trade rules could lead to a better solution to the problem at hand...|$|E
40|$|This article proposes several {{amendments}} to the Anti-Dumping (AD) Agreement and the chapter on Countervailing Duties (CVD) of the <b>Subsidies</b> <b>Agreement,</b> drawing {{from the experience of}} the State of Israel in AD and CVD administration over more than a decade. In particular, the Article argues for the need for international regulation of the institutional settings of such administration within Member States. To this end, provisions should be added to the relevant WTO agreements that relate to the nature and composition of the national administering authorities, with the guiding principle being to ensure independence of the authorities and objectivity, fairness and transparency of their investigations and determinations. International Law must try to guarantee that these authorities are immune to political pressures from interested parties. We suggest that the authority in these matters be transferred to independent, quasi-judicial bodies, as opposed to administrative agencies that are part of government ministries or controlled by them or by political organs. We argue, based on reason, as well as on evidence from several countries, that such bodies are more likely to produce balanced decisions, taking into account interests of both domestic industry and consumers, and also show that there are precedents within existing WTO law of such institutional regulation. We then proceeded to discuss amendments of the substantive law, particularly in relation to the definition of dumping. Here we propose granting clear priority to the establishment of normal value on the basis of actual sales by the foreign producer in his home market, and to restrict the use of the other options offered by the AD Agreement. To this end, we suggest, inter alia, to abolish or restrict the use of the methodology that allows sales made at prices below per unit (fixed and variable) costs of production to be treated as not being “in the ordinary course of trade” by reason of price and therefore disregarded in determining normal value. With respect to the assessment of AD and CV duties, we recommend to require compliance with the “Lesser Duty Rule”. We present statistical data from Israel, which shows the significant influence that the application of this Rule has had on the rate of AD duties in Israel. We further recommended the adoption of the Israeli methodology on how to apply the Rule, namely to generally base the calculation upon the price undercutting rate, and not on a target price. In {{view of the fact that}} anti-dumping and anti-subsidy procedures and measures are on the rise, and that more and more countries adopt such procedures based on the WTO Anti-Dumping and Subsidies Agreements, it is exceedingly important that these agreements are amended so as to minimize the damage to international trade caused by their use, while at the same time preserving them as a safeguard measure that will allow continued multilateral trade liberalization. This article suggests some ways in which this could be achieved...|$|E
