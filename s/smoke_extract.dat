The present study was designed to examine the effect of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> on gastric and colon cancer cell proliferation, which is important for tumor growth. Two different cell lines were used. One was gastric cancer cell line AGS, and the other was colon cancer cell line HT- 29. It was found that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> stimulated cell proliferation and c-myc expression in AGS cells. Furthermore, this proliferative action was partially blocked by the c-myc antisense. However, the extracts significantly inhibited HT- 29 cell proliferation and suppressed c-myc expression. In conclusion, cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> stimulated AGS cell proliferation, while inhibiting HT- 29 proliferation, which were partially mediated by a c-myc-related pathway. The former action may play a contributory role in the carcinogenic action of cigarette smoking in the stomach. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Cigarette smoke represents a source of oxidants and is considered an environmental hazard that causes pulmonary emphysema. Here, we show that caveolin- 1 activates ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) after oxidative stress by sequestering the ATM inhibitor, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A, into caveolar membranes. We demonstrate that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> promote stress-induced premature senescence in wild type but not caveolin- 1 null lung fibroblasts and that caveolin- 1 expression is required for activation of the ATM-p 53 -p 21 Waf 1 /Cip 1 pathway following stimulation with cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> in vitro. In vivo studies show that caveolin- 1 expression is necessary for cigarette smoking-induced senescence of lung fibroblasts and pulmonary emphysema.

Studies are warranted to understand the public health risks of ECs. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the genotoxicity and the mechanisms induced by EC aerosol extracts on human oral and lung epithelial cells. Cells were exposed to EC aerosol or mainstream <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> and DNA damage was measured using the primer anchored DNA damage detection assay (q-PADDA) and 8 -oxo-dG ELISA assay. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured using standard methods. mRNA and protein expression were evaluated by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. EC aerosol extracts induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner, but independently of nicotine concentration. Overall, EC aerosol extracts induced significantly less DNA damage than mainstream <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts,</b> as measured by q-PADDA. However, the levels of oxidative DNA damage, as indicated by the presence of 8 -oxo-dG, a highly mutagenic DNA lesion, were similar or slightly higher after exposure to EC aerosol compared to mainstream <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts.</b> Mechanistically, while exposure to EC extracts significantly increased ROS, it decreased TAC as well as the expression of 8 -oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG 1), an enzyme essential for the removal of oxidative DNA damage.

40|$|Abstract Background Cigarette smoke {{suppresses}} innate immunity, making smokers {{more susceptible}} to infection. The NLRP 3 inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that releases interleukin (IL) - 13 ̆b 2 and IL - 18. These cytokines are critical for a timely host response to pathogens. Whether cigarette smoke affects NLRP 3 protein levels, {{and its ability to}} form an inflammasome, is not known. Methods and results Using the human monocyte THP 1 cell line and C 57 BL/ 6 mice, we show that cigarette smoke decreases NLRP 3 levels in cells by increasing ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal processing. Half-life of NLRP 3 is shortened with the exposure to cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract.</b> Cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> reduces cellular NLRP 3 protein abundance in the presence of lipopolysaccharide, a known inducer of NLRP 3 protein, thereby decreasing the formation of NLRP 3 inflammasomes. The release of IL- 13 ̆b 2 and IL- 18 by inflammasome activation is also decreased with the exposure to cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> both in THP 1 cells and primary human peripheral blood macrophages. Conclusions Cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> decreased NLRP 3 protein abundance via increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal processing. The release of IL- 13 ̆b 2 and IL- 18 is also decreased with cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract.</b> Our findings may provide mechanistic insights on immunosuppression in smokers and unique opportunities to develop a strategy to modulate immune function...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Cigarette smoke causes {{injury to}} lung fibroblasts, partly {{by means of}} {{oxidative}} stress, and oxidative stress can lead to various lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Clusterin is a widely distributed protein with many functions, including cellular protection in response to oxidative stress. Objectives: To determine whether clusterin {{is involved in the}} defense of the lung against cigarette smoke, we investigated the effects of cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> on clusterin expression and its protective effect, if any, against oxidative stress. Methods: Fibroblasts were coincubated with conditioned medium and cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract,</b> and bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from nonsmokers, smokers, and ex-smokers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Measurements and Main Results: At concentrations of 2. 5 and 5. 0 %, cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> induced oxidative stress. It also markedly increased the expression of two clusterin isoforms (60 and 76 – 80 kD) and the 76 – 80 -kD isoform was secreted in the incubation medium. Coincubation of fibroblasts with conditioned medium significantly decreased the cellular oxidation caused by the cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract.</b> Immunohistochemical analysis of clusterin on bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from smokers and ex-smokers showed localization of clusterin mainly in the submucosa.

However, the mechanisms underlying the causal relationship between cigarette smoking and colorectal cancer remain to be investigated. Our previous study showed that cigarette smoke promotes the formation of inflammation-associated colonic adenoma in mice through an angiogenic pathway. Therefore, in the present study, we used the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, SW 1116, and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) to elucidate the possible mechanisms in vitro. Results showed that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> enhanced cell proliferation and the expression of 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LOX), vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 in SW 1116 cells.

30|$|Biomass smoke {{exposure}} is also implicated in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection through several mechanisms, including alterations in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and/or upregulation of host surface receptors on the respiratory epithelium [102, 103]. In an in vitro study, the phagosomal function of wood smoke particle exposed human alveolar macrophages was tested {{with respect to}} uptake of fluorescently-labelled beads, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [102]. Wood smoke exposed macrophages demonstrated reduced phagocytosis of fluorescent beads, S. pneumoniae and M. tuberculosis with a negative linear correlation between macrophage particulate content and phagocytosis [104]. Furthermore, oxidative stress is believed to upregulate expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), and platelet activating factor receptors (PAFR) allowing attachment and invasion of respiratory bacteria, including S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are also important bacterial pathogens in COPD [105 – 107]. Although airway ICAM- 1 and PAFR expression were markedly upregulated in tobacco smokers and COPD patients, further studies are warranted to demonstrate the effect of biomass smoke exposure on inducing the expression of these host surface receptors [108 – 110]. Recently, KC et al. developed a method to generate batches of biomass <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> that can be preserved for longer periods for use in multiple exposure experiments, thus minimizing inter-assay variation [103].

Sidestream tobacco smoke and advanced glycation end products are known cardiovascular risk factors and we aimed to determine the combined interaction between these two risk factors to promote cardiovascular diseases associated with diabetes. Methods Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in the presence of sidestream tobacco <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> (SHS) or nicotine and glycated albumin (AGE) or non-glycated albumin. After 3 days, endothelial cell viability and density were investigated. Platelets were also incubated with these compounds for up to 6 hours. Platelet aggregation and the surface expression of CD 41 and CD 62 P were examined. In some experiments, platelets were added to the endothelial cell culture to determine if an interaction between platelets and endothelial cells occurs that can alter the responses to SHS or AGE. Results In general, the endothelial cell culture conditions were reduced in the presence of AGE and SHS. Nicotine, did not play a role in this reduction. Platelet aggregation proceeded faster in the presence of AGE and SHS. Interestingly, with the combined culture of endothelial cells and platelets, the endothelial cell culture conditions were improved and the platelet functional changes were diminished in the presence of SHS and AGE, as compared with the individual incubations. Conclusions Our data suggests that diabetics that are exposed to SHS may have a higher likelihood for cardiovascular disease development through a diminished endothelial cell viability and an increased platelet activity, which are partially mediated by CD 41 and not CD 62 P. This study provides support for an increased cardiovascular risk for diabetic patients that are exposed to SHS.

We studied {{the effect of}} cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> (CSE) on endothelin receptor B (ETB) expression in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) and its role in endothelial dysfunction. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHETB receptor expression was measured by real time RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Cell contraction, intracellular Ca 2 +, F/G-actin, RhoA activity, myosin light chain phosphorylation, ET, NO, thromboxane (Tx) A 2 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by traction microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, phalloidin fluorescence, colorimetric assay, Western blot, elisa and DCFDA fluorescence respectively. KEY RESULTSCigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> dose-dependently increased ETB receptor expression in HPAECs after 24 h incubation. CSE-induced ETB expression was attenuated by bosentan, the ETB receptor antagonist BQ 788, the Rho kinase antagonist Y 27632 and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. A monoclonal antibody to ET- 1 prevented CSE-induced ETB receptor overexpression. Twenty-four hour exposure to ET- 1 dose-dependently increased ETB receptor expression, mimicking the effect of CSE. CSE-induced ETB receptor overexpression caused greater cell contraction; increased intracellular Ca 2 +; increased F/G-actin and RhoA activity; increased myosin light chain phosphorylation; augmented TxA 2 and ROS production; and decreased NO after acute ET- 1 (10 nM). These effects were attenuated by bosentan, BQ 788, Y 27632 and N-acetylcysteine.

We examined the effects of cigarette smoke on antimicrobial secretions of primary human nasal epithelial cells (PHNEC). Compared to non-CS exposed individuals, PHNEC from in-vivo cigarette smoke exposed individuals secreted less CCL 20, BD- 1, and SLPI apically, less BD- 1 and SLPI basolaterally, and more CCL 20 basolaterally. Cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> (CSE) exposure in vitro decreased the apical secretion of CCL 20 and beta defensin- 1 by PHNEC from non-CS exposed individuals. Exposing PHNEC from non-CS exposed to cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> also significantly decreased the levels of many mRNA transcripts that are involved in immune signaling. Our results show that in-vivo or in vitro exposure to cigarette smoke alters the secretion of key antimicrobial peptides from PHNEC, but that in-vivo CS exposure is a much more important modifier of antimicrobial peptide secretion. Based on the gene expression data, it appears that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>extract</b> disrupts multiple immune signaling pathways in PHNEC. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how cigarette smoke exposure alters the innate immune response and increases an individual’s susceptibility to pathogen infection...|$|E

Also, compared to LPG users, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by leukocytes (in both blood and sputum) and the systemic level of antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher and lower, respectively in women using biomass fuel [89]. A similar increase in systemic oxidative stress was reported in rats exposed to biomass smoke, as indicated by an increased plasma level of malondialdehyde and a reduced level of SOD [90]. Several in vitro studies reported depletion of antioxidants, such as ascorbate, urate and reduced glutathione in respiratory tract lining fluid when incubated with wood and animal dung <b>smoke</b> <b>extracts</b> [16, 91]. Therefore, biomass smoke exposure induces inflammation and oxidative stress mediated lung damage which potentially contributes to the development/progression of COPD.|$|R
