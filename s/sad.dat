40|$|Supra-arcade downflows (hereafter {{referred}} to as <b>SADs)</b> are low-emission, elongated, finger-like features usually observed in active-region coronae above post-eruption flare arcades. Observations exhibit downward moving <b>SADs</b> intertwined with bright upward moving spikes. Whereas <b>SADs</b> are dark voids, spikes are brighter, denser structures. Although <b>SADs</b> have been observed for decades, the mechanism of formation of <b>SADs</b> remains an open issue. In our three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities develop in the downstream region of a reconnecting current sheet. The instability results {{in the formation of}} low-density coherent structures that resemble <b>SADs,</b> and high-density structures that appear to be spike-like. Comparison between the simulation results and observations suggests that secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities in the exhaust of reconnecting current sheets provide a plausible mechanism for observed <b>SADs</b> and spikes...|$|R

5|$|In January 1942, the Hungarian {{army and}} {{gendarmerie}} undertook a major raid in southern Bačka, {{during which they}} massacred 2,550 Serbs, 743 Jews and 47 other people {{in places such as}} Bečej, Srbobran and Novi <b>Sad,</b> under the pretext that they were searching for Partisans. Other sources place the number of Serbs and Jews massacred in Novi <b>Sad</b> as being much lower, at around 879.

Over the period 4–24 January, massacres were carried out by the Hungarian 15th Light Division commanded by Major General József Grassy and units of the Royal Gendarmerie. The operations were ordered by Grassy, Lieutenant General Ferenc Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Colonel László Deák, and Royal Gendarmerie Captain Dr. Márton Zöldi. In addition to Serbs and Jews, members of other ethnicities were also victims: Roma people, a small number of Russian refugees who had fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, and some local Hungarians. In mid-1942, the Yugoslav government-in-exile reported that churches had been looted and destroyed, and that Serbian Orthodox holy days had been prohibited by the Hungarian administration. These reports stated that the a camp in Novi <b>Sad</b> held 13,000 Serb and Jewish men, women and children.|$|E

40|$|Coronal supra-arcade downflows (<b>SADs)</b> are {{observed}} as dark trails descending towards hot turbulent fan shaped regions. Due {{to the large}} temperature values, and gradients in these fan regions the thermal conduction should be very efficient. While several models have been proposed to explain the triggering {{and the evolution of}} <b>SADs,</b> none of these scenarios address a systematic consideration of thermal conduction. Thus, we accomplish this task numerically simulating the evolution of <b>SADs</b> within this framework. That is, <b>SADs</b> are conceived as voided (subdense) cavities formed by non-linear waves triggered by downflowing bursty localized reconnection events in a perturbed hot fan. We generate a properly turbulent fan, obtained by a stirring force that permits control of the energy and vorticity input in the medium where <b>SADs</b> develop. We include anisotropic thermal conduction and consider plasma properties consistent with observations. Our aim is to study if it is possible to prevent <b>SADs</b> to vanish by thermal diffusion. We find that this will be the case, depending on the turbulence parameters. In particular, if the magnetic field lines are able to envelope the voided cavities, thermally isolating them from the hot environment. Velocity shear perturbations that are able to generate instabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type help to produce magnetic islands, extending the life-time of <b>SADs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Context. Supra-arcade downflows (<b>SADs)</b> {{have been}} {{frequently}} observed during the gradual phase of solar flares near the limb. In coronal emission lines sensitive to flaring plasmas, they appear as tadpole-like dark voids against the diffuse fan-shaped "haze" above, flowing toward the well-defined flare arcade. Aims. We aim {{to investigate the}} evolution of SADs' thermal properties, and {{to shed light on}} the formation mechanism and physical processes of <b>SADs.</b> Methods. We carefully studied several selected <b>SADs</b> from two flare events and calculated their differential emission measures (DEMs) as well as DEM-weighted temperatures using data obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Results. Our analysis shows that <b>SADs</b> are associated with a substantial decrease in DEM above 4 MK, which is 1 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the surrounding haze as well as the region before or after the passage of <b>SADs,</b> but comparable to the quiet corona. There is no evidence for the presence of the SAD-associated hot plasma (> 20 MK) in the AIA data, and this decrease in DEM does not cause any significant change in the DEM distribution as well as the DEM-weighted temperature, which supports this idea that <b>SADs</b> are density depletion. This depression in DEM rapidly recovers {{in the wake of the}} <b>SADs</b> studied, generally within a few minutes, suggesting that they are discrete features. In addition, we found that <b>SADs</b> in one event are spatio-temporally associated with the successive formation of post-flare loops along the flare arcade...|$|R

50|$|<b>SADs</b> {{were first}} {{interpreted}} as cross sections of magnetic flux tubes, which comprise coronal loops, that retract down due to magnetic tension after being formed at the reconnection site. This interpretation was later revised {{to suggest that}} <b>SADs</b> are instead wakes behind much smaller retracting loops (SADLs), rather than cross sections of the flux tubes themselves.

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} can rapidly reconfigure {{the magnetic}} field of the corona, accelerating plasma through the site of reconnection. Ambiguities {{due to the nature}} of remote sensing have complicated the interpretation of observations of the inflowing and outflowing plasma in reconnecting regions. In particular, the interpretation of sunward moving density depletions above flare arcades (known as Supra Arcade Downflows - <b>SADs)</b> is still debated. Hinode/XRT has provided a wealth of observations for <b>SADs</b> and helped inform our current understanding of these structures. <b>SADs</b> have been interpreted as wakes behind newly reconnected and outflowing loops (Supra Arcade Downflowing Loops - SADLs). Models have shown the plausibility of this interpretation, though this interpretation has not yet been fully accepted. We present here observations of newly reconnected outflowing loops observed via in situ instruments in the magnetosphere. These observations, provided by five THEMIS spacecraft, show that around retracting loops (dipolarization fronts in this context) similar dynamic temperature and density structures are found as seen in <b>SADs.</b> We compare data from multiple <b>SADs</b> and dipolarization fronts to show that the observational signatures implied in the corona can be directly observed in similar plasma regimes in the magnetosphere, strongly favoring the interpretation of <b>SADs</b> as wakes behind retracting loops...|$|R

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the thermal structure of the region above the post-eruption arcade for a flare that occurred on 2011 October 22. During this event, a sheet of hot plasma is visible above the flare loops in the 131 Å bandpass of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Supra-arcade downflows (<b>SADs)</b> are observed traveling sunward through the post-eruption plasma sheet. We calculate differential emission measures using the AIA data and derive an emission measure weighted average temperature in the supra-arcade region. In areas where many <b>SADs</b> occur, the temperature of the supra-arcade plasma tends to increase, while in areas where no <b>SADs</b> are observed, the temperature tends to decrease. We calculate the plane-of-sky velocities in the supra-arcade plasma and use them to calculate the potential heating due to adiabatic compression and viscous heating. Ten of the 13 <b>SADs</b> studied have noticeable signatures in both the adiabatic and the viscous terms. The adiabatic heating due to compression of plasma in front of the <b>SADs</b> is on the order of 0. 1 - 0. 2 MK/s, which is similar in magnitude to the estimated conductive cooling rate. This result supports the notion that <b>SADs</b> contribute locally to the heating of plasma in the supra-arcade region. We also find that in the region without <b>SADs,</b> the plasma cools at a rate slower than the estimated conductive cooling, indicating additional heating mechanisms may act globally to keep the plasma temperature high.
