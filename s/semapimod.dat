5000|$|<b>Semapimod</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} to inhibit nitric oxide synthesis by inflammatory macrophages, via inhibition of the uptake of arginine which macrophages require for nitric oxide synthesis. Subsequently, {{it was found}} that suppression of nitric oxide synthesis occurred even at <b>semapimod</b> concentrations 10-fold less than required for inhibition of arginine uptake, suggesting that this molecule was a more general inhibitor of inflammatory responses. [...] Further work revealed that <b>semapimod</b> suppressed the translation efficiency of tumor necrosis factor production. [...] Specifically, <b>semapimod</b> was found to be an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase activation. Surprisingly, however, the primary mode of action in vivo is now thought to be via stimulation of the vagus nerve, thereby down-regulating inflammatory pathways via the recently discovered cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.|$|E

50|$|In a {{preliminary}} clinical trial of <b>semapimod</b> {{in patients with}} moderate to severe Crohn's disease, positive clinical changes were observed, including endoscopic improvement, positive responses in some patients not responding to infliximab, healing of fistulae, and indications for tapering of steroids; no significant adverse effects were observed.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{preclinical}} study in rats, <b>semapimod</b> {{was found to}} suppress cytokine-storm induction by the anticancer cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) without decreasing its anticancer properties, allow larger doses of IL-2 to be administered.

40|$|There is a {{substantial}} need for novel treatment strategies in Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the gut. In an earlier study, we reported clinical efficacy of a 2 -wk treatment with <b>semapimod</b> (CNI- 1493) in 12 patients with therapy resistant CD. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the cellular target underlying <b>semapimod</b> action. In vitro experiments with murine macrophages showed impaired MAPK signaling and decreased cytokine production due to <b>semapimod</b> treatment. In vitro kinase assays revealed c-Raf as a direct molecular target of <b>semapimod,</b> and <b>semapimod</b> did not affect b-Raf enzymatic activity. Immunohistochemistry performed on paired colon biopsies obtained from CD patients (n = 6) demonstrated increased expression of phospho-MEK, the substrate of Raf. Strikingly, phospho-MEK levels were significantly decreased in patients with a good clinical response to <b>semapimod,</b> but no decrease in phospho-MEK expression was observed in a clinically nonresponsive patient. In conclusion, this study identifies c-Raf as a molecular target of <b>semapimod</b> action and suggests that decreased c-Raf activity correlates with clinical benefit in CD. Our observations indicate that c-Raf inhibitors are prime candidates for the treatment of C...|$|E

Previous studies in a sepsis model showed that this cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can be activated pharmacologically by central administration of <b>semapimod,</b> an inhibitor of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. We therefore evaluated the effect of intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) <b>semapimod</b> on intestinal inflammation and post-operative ileus in mice. Mice underwent a laparotomy or intestinal manipulation 1 h after i. c. v. pre-treatment with <b>semapimod</b> (1 µg·kg(- 1)) or saline. Drugs were administered through a cannula placed in the left lateral ventricle 1 week prior to experimentation. Twenty-four hours after surgery, gastric emptying was measured using scintigraphy, {{and the degree of}} intestinal inflammation was assessed. Finally, activation of brain regions was assessed using quantitative immunohistochemistry for c-fos. Intestinal manipulation induced inflammation of the manipulated intestine and significantly delayed gastric emptying, 24 h after surgery in saline-treated animals. <b>Semapimod</b> significantly reduced this inflammation and improved gastric emptying. Vagotomy enhanced the inflammatory response induced by intestinal manipulation and abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of <b>semapimod.</b> <b>Semapimod</b> but not saline induced a significant increase in c-fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{pancreatitis}} and hyperamylasemia {{are frequent}} complications of an ERCP. <b>Semapimod</b> is a synthetic guanylhydrazone that inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, macrophage activation, {{and the production}} of several inflammatory cytokines. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated whether intravenous (IV) administration of <b>semapimod</b> given before an ERCP reduces the incidence of post-ERCP hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis. DESIGN: A single-center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. SETTING: An academic medical center. PATIENTS: Between 2001 and 2005, 242 patients who were undergoing a therapeutic ERCP at our institution were included. INTERVENTION: Patients received a single IV dose of <b>semapimod</b> or a placebo before an ERCP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis, as well as post-ERCP hyperamylasemia. RESULTS: The incidence of hyperamylasemia was significantly reduced (29. 8 % vs 18. 4 %; P =. 031). Moreover, <b>semapimod</b> administration significantly lowered the levels of amylase during the first 24 hours after the ERCP. The incidence of clinical pancreatitis was reduced by 40 %, without reaching statistical significance (14. 9 vs 9. 1 %; P =. 117). LIMITATIONS: A relatively small single-center study. One dose of <b>semapimod</b> was used. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of IV <b>semapimod</b> 1 hour before an ERCP is safe and exerts a biological effect, demonstrated by a statistically significant reduction of the incidence of hyperamylasemia and the levels of post-ERCP amylase. A protective effect for the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis could not be convincingly demonstrate...|$|E
40|$|Glioblastoma is {{the most}} {{malignant}} and lethal form of astrocytoma, with patients having a median survival time of approximately 15 months with current therapeutic modalities. It is therefore important to identify novel therapeutics. There is mounting evidence that microglia (specialized brain-resident macrophages) {{play a significant role}} in the development and progression of glioblastoma tumors. In this paper we show that microglia, in addition to stimulating glioblastoma cell invasion, also promote glioblastoma cell proliferation and resistance to ionizing radiation in vitro. We found that <b>semapimod,</b> a drug that selectively interferes with the function of macrophages and microglia, potently inhibits microglia-stimulated GL 261 invasion, without affecting serum-stimulated glioblastoma cell invasion. <b>Semapimod</b> also inhibits microglia-stimulated resistance of glioblastoma cells to radiation, but has no significant effect on microglia-stimulated glioblastoma cell proliferation. We also found that intracranially administered <b>semapimod</b> strongly increases the survival of GL 261 tumor-bearing animals in combination with radiation, but has no significant benefit in the absence of radiation. In conclusion, our observations indicate that <b>semapimod</b> sensitizes glioblastoma tumors to ionizing radiation by targeting microglia and/or infiltrating macrophages...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the limited efficacy and significant toxicity of current anti-inflammatory therapies, there is widespread interest in the development of novel drugs for this application. Progress in our understanding of inflammatory signaling pathways has identified novel targets, notably in pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases and T-cell receptor signaling. Recent observations have provided molecular insight into the mechanism of action of well-established anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids and azathioprine, and the anti-inflammatory small molecule <b>semapimod</b> (Cytokine PharmaSciences Inc). Data from these studies indicate that therapeutic agents which specifically target proximal signaling molecules might represent a powerful strategy for combating inflammatory disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to test whether inhibition of the proangiogenic inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α can modulate retinal hypoxia and preretinal neovascularization in a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). OIR was produced in TNF-α−/− and wild-type (WT) control C 57 B 6 neonatal mice by exposure to 75 % oxygen between postnatal days 7 and 12 (P 7 to P 12). Half of each WT litter was treated with the cytokine inhibitor <b>semapimod</b> (formerly known as CNI- 1493) (5 mg/kg) by daily intraperitoneal injection {{from the time of}} reintroduction to room air at P 12 until P 17. The extent of preretinal neovascularization and intraretinal revascularization was quantified by image analysis of retinal flat-mounts and retinal hypoxia correlated with vascularization by immunofluorescent localization of the hypoxia-sensitive drug pimonidazole (hypoxyprobe, HP). HP adducts were also characterized by Western analysis and quantified by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TNF-α−/− and WT mice showed a similar sensitivity to hyperoxia-induced retinal ischemia at P 12. At P 13 some delay in early reperfusion was evident in TNF-α−/− and WT mice treated with <b>semapimod.</b> However, at P 17 both these groups had significantly better vascular recovery with less ischemic/hypoxic retina and preretinal neovascularization compared to untreated retinopathy in WT mice. Immunohistochemistry showed deposition of HP in the avascular inner retina but not in areas underlying preretinal neovascularization, indicating that such aberrant vasculature can reduce retinal hypoxia. Inhibition of TNF-α significantly improves vascular recovery within ischemic tissue and reduces pathological neovascularization in OIR. HP provides a useful tool for mapping and quantifying tissue hypoxia in experimental ischemic retinopathy...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{is a neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} the selective loss of motor neurons. Stress activated protein kinases (SAPK) have been suggested {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of ALS. We studied the relevance of p 38 MAPK for motor neuron degeneration in the mutant SOD 1 mouse. Increased levels of phospho-p 38 MAPK were present in the motor neurons and microglia of the ventral spinal cord. The p 38 MAPK-inhibitor, SB 203580, completely inhibited mutant SOD 1 -induced apoptosis of motor neurons and blocked LPS-induced activation of microglia. <b>Semapimod,</b> a p 38 MAPK inhibitor suitable for clinical use, prolonged survival of mutant SOD 1 mice to a limited extent, but largely protected motor neurons and proximal axons from mutant SOD 1 -induced degeneration. Our data confirm the abnormal activation of p 38 MAPK in mutant SOD 1 mice and the involvement of p 38 MAPK in mutant SOD 1 -induced motor neuron death. We demonstrate the effect of p 38 MAPK inhibition on survival of mutant SOD 1 mice and reveal a dissociation between the effect on survival of motor neurons and that on survival of the animal, the latter likely depending on the integrity of the entire motor axon. status: publishe...|$|E
