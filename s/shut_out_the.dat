Clark's absence didn't distract the Hokies, who won, 277. After the win against Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech traveled to Boston to play Boston College. The Hokies <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Boston College Eagles, 170, boosting their national ranking to No. 10 in the coaches' poll {{on the basis of}} Tech's first 50 start since 1967.|$|E

Dick Jauron, who was then the Bears' head coach, {{recognized}} Urlacher's versatility as a middle and outside linebacker, and appointed him as the team's starting strongside linebacker. However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game, and lost his starting position to Rosevelt Colvin. Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Bears, 41–0.|$|E

In {{the first game of}} the Mets series, the Phillies lost 7–1 against Bartolo Colón; although Colón and A. J. Burnett (the Phillies' starter) were trade candidates, neither was traded. The next day Utley hit a grand slam and Hamels continued his dominance as the Phillies <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Mets 6–0, but the Mets routed the Phillies 11–2 in the series finale. The last game of the month opened a four-game series with the Nationals; the Phillies won 10–4 but Lee re-injured his elbow, probably ending his season.|$|E

5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, {{and that was not}} {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' offense {{in the second half of}} the game. The Hokies <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed in a half. Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's defense had nine tackles for loss, including five sacks of Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a sack, and a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score in the Sugar Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006 season, Favre {{suffered}} {{his first}} career shutout against the Chicago Bears.

On September 24, 2006, he became just the second quarterback in NFL history to record 400 touchdown passes (Dan Marino being the first). He connected with rookie wide receiver Greg Jennings on a 5-yard pass that Jennings turned into a 75-yard touchdown play during a win against the Detroit Lions. He also became the first player ever to complete 5,000 passes in his career. On December 31, 2006, the Packers played their last game of the season, winning 26–7 {{in the second game}} against the Chicago Bears. It was his 22nd career win versus the Bears, moving him to an all-time record of 22–8.|$|E

This time, Adrian Hubbard caused the Antonio Andrews fumble that was recovered by Brandon Ivory at the WKU 33-yard line.

5|$|The Canadiens {{reached the}} playoffs {{for the first time in}} 1913–14 when they tied the Toronto Blueshirts for the league lead with 26points.

The title earned the Canadiens their first berth in the Stanley Cup finals, where they faced the Portland Rosebuds of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). With the best-of-five series tied at two wins apiece, the deciding game was held at Westmount Arena in Montreal on March 30, 1916. Montreal's Goldie Prodgers scored the winning goal with less than four minutes to play, giving the Canadiens their first Stanley Cup championship.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{promoted}} deGrom to {{the major}} leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen {{was placed on the}} disabled list. The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, but the Yankees <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak, the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history.|$|E
