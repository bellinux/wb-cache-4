Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can operate all day in any weather conditions and the images acquired by SAR contain intensity and phase information, which are irreplaceable advantages in monitoring the <b>surface</b> <b>movement</b> of glaciers. Moreover, a variety of techniques like DInSAR and offset tracking, based on the information of SAR images, could be applied to measure the movement. Sangwang lake, a glacial lake in the Himalayas, has great potentially danger of outburst. Shie glacier is situated at the upstream of the Sangwang lake.

40|$|Abstract—The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) can be {{used for}} both {{precision}} approach and Differentially Corrected Positioning Service (DCPS) applications. Through its support of DCPS, the LAAS Ground Facility (LGF) is required to meet the integrity requirements of all other operations that could use the LAAS VHF Data Broadcast (VDB). Our previous work [1, 2, 3] demonstrated that the existing DCPS integrity requirements cannot be met by CAT I LAAS without changes to both the definition of DCPS integrity [4, 5] and the airborne receiver requirements [6]. One of the implications is that some future applications of LAAS that planned to use DCPS, such as airport <b>surface</b> <b>movement,</b> cannot be supported by DCPS with the CAT I LAAS architecture. However, if airport <b>surface</b> <b>movement</b> is defined as a separate operation, it could be supported by the existing LGF geometry screening that mitigates the anomalous ionospheric threat for CAT I precision approach. The only change needed would be to increase σ pr_air in airborne equipment to bound the higher multipath errors in the airport surface environment. Confirming this hypothesis requires a moreintensive study of the requirements of airport <b>surface</b> <b>movement</b> and {{is the subject of this}} paper. If LGF geometry screening itself cannot support airport <b>surface</b> <b>movement,</b> the results in this paper include additional aircraft geometry screening proposed in [2] to lower the Maximum Acceptable Error (MAE) to a usable level while maintaining useful availability.
