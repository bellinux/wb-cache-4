It is fibroelastic {{like those of the}} blue whale's artiodactyl relatives. The retracted penis curves in an S-shaped loop and stays inside the body. When erect, it peaks out of the genital slit. Blue whales also have a distal spiral valve as a spermatic tube. Cetaceans do not have <b>scrotums</b> like terrestrial mammalian males do. Mammalian <b>scrotums</b> lower ambient temperature to keep sperm viable, so cetaceans {{had to find a way}} to compensate. And they did. Blood in veins that go through fins and the fluke loses heat. When that blood is sent directly to the testes, the sperm are cooled below body temperature and remain viable. The females have a long vulva with two nipples on each side to nourish newborns. They go in heat any time of the year, but the most common is during the migration to warmer waters for mating season."-"Balaenoptera musculus", University of Wisconsin ...|$|R

5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, <b>scrotum,</b> joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the <b>scrotum</b> which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the <b>scrotum.</b> In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E

Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s <b>scrotum,</b> Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

Circle jerking {{may or may not}} involve physical contact with others in the groups. Masturbating other participants, or stimulating other participants' penises or <b>scrotums</b> often occurs. Non-penetrative sexual rubbing against another participant's body may also occur, such as frot, the rubbing of two (or more) penises against each other. Frot, which may jokingly be called 'sword-fighting', usually involves the competitive element of trying to make the other participant(s) ejaculate first.|$|R
25|$|The testes {{remain high}} in the abdomen until the 7th month of gestation, when they move from the abdomen through the {{inguinal}} canals into {{the two sides of}} the <b>scrotum.</b> It has been proposed that movement occurs in two phases, under control of somewhat different factors. The first phase, movement across the abdomen to the entrance of the inguinal canal appears controlled (or at least greatly influenced) by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The second phase, in which the testes move through the inguinal canal into the <b>scrotum,</b> is dependent on androgens (most importantly testosterone). In rodents, androgens induce the genitofemoral nerve to release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which produces rhythmic contractions of the gubernaculum, a ligament which connects the testis to the <b>scrotum,</b> but a similar mechanism has not been demonstrated in humans. Maldevelopment of the gubernaculum, or deficiency or insensitivity to either AMH or androgen can, therefore, prevent the testes from descending into the <b>scrotum.</b> Some evidence suggests there may even be an additional paracrine hormone, referred to as descendin, secreted by the testes.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a disease}} which always makes it first attack on the {{inferior}} part of the <b>scrotum</b> where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges... in no great length of time it pervades the skin, dartos and the membranes of the <b>scrotum,</b> and seizes the testicle, which it inlarges(sic), hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diagnostic}} dilemma in otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a retractile testis from a testis {{that will not}} descend spontaneously into the <b>scrotum.</b> Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended testes and {{do not need to}} be operated on. In normal males, as the cremaster muscle relaxes or contracts, the testis moves lower or higher ("retracts") in the <b>scrotum.</b> This cremasteric reflex is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile testis high in the <b>scrotum</b> can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though there are various maneuvers used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, soaping the examiner's fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.|$|E

40|$|As a {{tendency}} to use new technologies, gadgets such as laptop computers are becoming more popular among students, teachers, businessmen and office workers. Today laptops are a great tool for education and learning, work and personal multimedia.

40|$|Many vaginoplasty {{techniques}} {{have been introduced}} to improve the outcomes of sex reassignment surgery for male-to-female transsexuals. Some vaginoplasty patients still require additional skin grafts, making dilation mandatory to overcome shrinkage. We developed a new vaginoplasty method (called the “pudendal-groin flap”) that uses pudendal-groin flaps. One of this procedure’s advantages is that skin grafts are unnecessary, even for patients with small penises and <b>scrotums.</b> We introduce the procedure here and describe our evaluation of its utility. We retrospectively analyzed the cases of the 15 patients who underwent vaginoplasty using pudendal-groin flaps from May 2010 to January 2016 at our institution. We compared the complications {{as well as the}} functional and aesthetic outcomes with those of previous studies. The most common complication was bleeding, which occurred at the corpus spongiosum or while creating a new vaginal cavity. Bleeding can be reduced with more careful hemostasis and dissection. Aside from inadequate vaginal depth in one patient, the incidence of other complications, sexual intercourse, and aesthetic outcomes were acceptable. The pudendal- groin flap is thin and pliable and can create sufficient vaginal depth without skin grafts. The resulting scar is inconspicuous. Our findings suggest that vaginoplasty using the pudendal-groin flap method is feasible...|$|R
40|$|Background: Penile {{duplication}} (diphallus) is {{an extremely}} rare disorder. It is almost always associated with other malformations like double bladder, exstrophy of the cloacae, imperforate anus, duplication of the rectosigmoid and vertebral deformities. Meanwhile anal canal duplication, the most distal and least common duplication of the digestive tube and is a very rare congenital malformation. Case Presentation: A 21 days old Egyptian neonate is reported with complete penile duplication and two <b>scrotums</b> with each one carrying two palpable testes. Both penises have normal shaft with normally located meatus. Clear urine voids from both meati spontaneously. The child had also a fold of redundant skin about 4 × 5 cm at the anal region in which two separate anal openings are present. In rectal examination we found two normal anuses passing stool spontaneously. Ascending (voiding) cystourethrography revealed two penises with two separate meatuses and one bladder from which the two urethras go out separately. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) revealed two normal kidneys and ureters. Barium study revealed duplication of rectum and colon, otherwise normal GIT. Conclusion: In our review of the literature, we did not come across any other case of this variety of the penile duplication and congenital presence of two anuses. Unfortunately the patient expired before any surgical correction...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral plasma {{testosterone}} {{was determined}} by radioimmunoassay in 6 bulls with intact (I) and 6 bulls with experimentally shortened <b>scrotums</b> (SS) at biweekly intervals from 14 to 36 weeks of age. Blood samples were collected from an indwelling jugular catheter every hour dufing an 8 h period (0800 - 1600 h). When the hormonal profiles obtained from both groups during sexual development are compared, three time periods can be distinguished: 1) At 18 weeks of age, onset of testosterone secretion with peak values> 1 ng/ml was first seen in I bulls compared with 28 weeks in SS bulls. 2) From 28 - 3 2 weeks of age, testosterone showed high fluctuations in I bulls, whereas the 8 h profiles of SS bulls were characterized by low fluctuating values never falling below 1 ng/ml. 3) During the period of 32 - 36 weeks of age, mean minimum hormone concen-trations dropped to 6 ng/mI in both experimental groups. Histological examination of SS testes {{at the age of}} 15 months revealed atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium with no spermatozoa present. Results from this study indicate that episodic testosterone secretion observed in prepubertal bulls is a maturational process of Leydig cells which was delayed for about 2 months in SS bulls.
