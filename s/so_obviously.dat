5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> written with the {{expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} {{to use it}} on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know {{immediately}} and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E

5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> {{everyone}} was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The right- and left-cancellative {{elements}} of a monoid each in turn form a submonoid (i.e. obviously include the identity and not <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> are closed under the operation).

5000|$|... (From {{all this}} {{it is tempting}} to imagine the {{invention}} of the bow: the Mongol warrior, having just used rosin on his equipment, idly stroked his harp or lyre with a rosin-dusted finger and produced a brief continuous sound, which caused him to have an inspiration; whereupon he seized his bow, restrung it with horsehair, and <b>so</b> on. <b>Obviously,</b> the degree to which this fantasy is true will never be known.) ...|$|R

25|$|When I grew {{up there}} weren't many other guitarists... There was one other guitarist {{in my school}} who {{actually}} showed me the first chords that I learned and I went on from there.

25|$|Single combat is then {{proposed}} between Aeneas and Turnus, but Aeneas is <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> {{superior to}} Turnus that the Italians, urged on by Turnus's divine sister, Juturna, break the truce. Aeneas is injured, but {{returns to the}} battle. Turnus and Aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings, but when Aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of Latium (causing the queen of Latium to hang herself in despair), he forces Turnus into single combat once more. Turnus's strength deserts him {{as he tries to}} hurl a rock, and Aeneas's spear goes through his thigh. As Turnus is begging on his knees for his life, the epic ends with Aeneas first tempted to obey pleas to spare Turnus's life, but killing him in rage when he sees that Turnus is wearing his friend Pallas's belt over a shoulder as a trophy.|$|E
25|$|Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, {{and perhaps}} others) have {{returned}} to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G {{if and only if}} the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V {{to be able to give}} an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> analytic, and thus purely logical.|$|E
500|$|Pterosaur [...] "hair" [...] was <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> {{distinct}} from mammalian fur and other animal integuments, it required a new, separate name.

Kellner and colleagues in 2009. Research into the genetic code of American alligator embryos could suggest that pycnofibres, crocodile scutes and avian feathers are developmentally homologous, based {{on the construction of}} their beta-keratin.|$|E

5000|$|In some cases, false etymologies exist. For example, {{the term}} [...] "barney", {{has been used}} to mean an altercation or fight since the late 19th century, {{although}} without a clear derivation. In the 2001 feature film Ocean's Eleven, the explanation for the term is that it derives from Barney Rubble, the name of a cartoon character from the Flintstones television program many decades later in origin, and <b>so</b> an <b>obviously</b> incorrect explanation.|$|R

500|$|A 1990 {{book about}} {{abandoned}} churches in Wales {{refers to the}} ancient monuments {{in this part of}} Anglesey, and calls Capel Lligwy a [...] "medieval gesture of Christian power in a land <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> imbued with the spirit of a pagan past". [...] It notes that [...] "the wheel has turned full circle and Capel Lligwy today is just another ruined relic of a former age." [...] The authors describe the chapel as a [...] "simple, square building" [...] with a [...] "small and ruggedly austere south chapel", adding that the stone slabs over the vault are [...] "almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape." ...|$|E

This sketch was never published but it is referred to in detail, however, in unpublished correspondence dated 1927 from Dempwolff to Ray, <b>so</b> he <b>obviously</b> had copies passed on to others.|$|R
500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Walton {{became aware of}} a younger English {{composer}} whose fame was shortly to overtake his, Benjamin Britten.

[...] They remained on friendly terms {{for the rest of}} Britten's life; Walton admired many of Britten's works, and considered him a genius; Britten did not admire all of Walton's works but was grateful for his support at difficult times in his life.|$|E

The second track, [...] "Space Walk", is set to a recording of Ed White's 1965 space walk on the Gemini 4 mission. Franglen and Deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called Flight to the Moon (1969); the two were struck by how moving and emotive many of the tracks were. Deakin later said, [...] "'One small step' leaves me cold, because it was <b>so</b> <b>obviously</b> scripted. But the spacewalk… even after hearing it so many times, it's so vivid." ...|$|E
