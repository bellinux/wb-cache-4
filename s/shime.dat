He again scored waza-ari with a drop single sleeve morote seoi nage for awasete ippon with 30 seconds to spare. In the second round, An competed against Belarus' Dzmitry Shershan. It {{was a close}} fight, {{with much of the}} action based on newaza. However, neither of them were able to pin or use {{successful}} submission techniques. An managed to score a yuko with a drop seoi nage effort to send him through to the next round. He attempted to use <b>shime</b> waza on Shershan in the dying seconds for ippon, but ran out of time.|$|E
500|$|The sticks {{for playing}} taiko are called bachi, and {{are made in}} various sizes and from {{different}} kinds of wood such as white oak, bamboo, and Japanese magnolia. Bachi are also held {{in a number of}} different styles. In kumi-daiko, it is common for a player to hold their sticks in a relaxed manner between the V-shape of the index finger and thumb, which points to the player. There are other grips that allow performers to play much more technically difficult rhythms, such as the <b>shime</b> grip, which is similar to a matched grip: [...] the bachi are gripped at the back end, and the fulcrum rests between the performer's index finger and thumb, while the other fingers remain relaxed and slightly curled around the stick.|$|E

50|$|After {{retaining}} the title against Prasitsak Phaprom on the undercard of Manny Pacquiao vs. Chris Algieri, <b>Shiming</b> fought IBF flyweight champion Amnat Ruenroeng at the Cotai Arena in Macau on March 7, 2015. This marked the seventh straight fight <b>Shiming</b> would fight at the venue since turning professional. Like <b>Shiming,</b> Ruenroeng also fought at the Olympics, {{and lost to}} <b>Shiming</b> at the 2010 Asian Games. Ruenroeng shattered Shiming's dreams of becoming world champion and gifted him his first professional loss when he scored a unanimous decision win after 12 rounds and retained his title in the process. Roenroeng won the bout comfortably with all three judges scoring it (116-111 x3), despite being controversially knocked down in round 2 as he lost his balance. Each time <b>Shiming</b> tried {{to get on the}} inside, Ruenroeng used his jab and counterpunch to keep control of the fight. Following the loss, <b>Shiming</b> was ranked #7 by the IBF and WBO and #9 by the WBC.|$|R
50|$|On June 27, 2017 it was {{announced}} that <b>Shiming</b> would make a voluntary defence of his WBO title against Japanese underdog and WBO #7 Sho Kimura (14-1-2, 7 KOs) on July 28 at the Oriental Sports Center in Shanghai, China. <b>Shiming</b> parted ways with promoter Top Rank and decided to promote the fight himself. He decided not to train with his hall of fame trainer Freddie Roach. In a shocking upset, Kimura, who was behind on two scorecards at the start of round 11, knocked <b>Shiming</b> out to win the WBO flyweight title. Two judges had the fight 96-94, 97-93 for <b>Shiming,</b> whilst the third judge had it 96-94 for Kimura. <b>Shiming</b> used his movement throughout the fight which had Kimura chasing him trying to land shots. He landed a right hook then followed by a combination. <b>Shiming</b> dropped to the ground after a flurry of punches. He failed to get up, but referee didn't count him out, calling off the fight.|$|R

"Oh, he'll {{come around}} all right enough," [...] growled {{the man called}} <b>Shime.</b> He was running the automobile, and now Dave was able to place him as a fellow who worked around a livery stable and garage in Rockville. <b>Shime</b> was a {{drinking}} man, and his reputation was far from an enviable one.|$|E

50|$|After winning gold at the 2012 Summer Olympics, <b>Shiming</b> {{decided to}} turn professional. On 23 January 2013, he signed a {{contract}} with boxing promotion company Top Rank and was subsequently trained by Freddie Roach. <b>Shiming</b> debuted on 6 April 2013, beating Eleazar Valenzuela by unanimous decision. After a win over Jesus Ortega, <b>Shiming</b> fought on the undercard of Manny Pacquiao vs. Brandon Rios on 23 November 2013, beating Juan Tozcano.

60|$|That instant {{was long}} {{enough for him to}} locate the doorway, and beyond he made out a stretch of woodland, lit up by the lamps of the automobile. Between him and the doorway stood Merwell and Jasniff, with <b>Shime</b> and the doctor on the other side.|$|E
50|$|On November 5, 2016, in {{a rematch}} from November 2014, <b>Shiming</b> {{defeated}} Prasitsak Phaprom (39-1-2, 24 KOs) via a unanimous decision {{to win the}} vacant WBO flyweight title on the Vargas-Pacquiao undercard at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. <b>Shiming</b> consistently landed quick and effective combinations from the opening bell and used his footwork to avoid punches. A knockdown was recorded in round 2 after Phaprom's gloves touched the canvas after being hit with a hard right. The three judges at ringside scored the fight 120-107, 120-107 and 119-108 all in favour of <b>Shiming.</b>|$|R

50|$|For the semi-final, Barnes {{once again}} drew Chinese superstar Zou <b>Shiming,</b> who had {{defeated}} Barnes in the 2008 semi-finals before taking gold.

60|$|A {{little bit}} alarmed, Jasniff and Merwell {{set to work}} and {{released}} Dave from his bonds. In the meantime <b>Shime</b> had lit a lantern, {{and placed it on}} a rough table. Doctor Montgomery got out a medicine case, and began to mix up a potion in a glass.|$|E
60|$|The four rascals {{had been}} taken {{completely}} by surprise. As the lantern fell it went out, and in his endeavor {{to get to the}} doorway, <b>Shime</b> bumped into Jasniff. The doctor ran into the bench, and his glass of medicine went splashing into Merwell's face, eliciting another protest from that bully.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I say {{anything}} {{there will be}} a great hullabaloo, but it won't prove anything," [...] he reasoned. [...] "Merwell and Jasniff will deny everything, and so will <b>Shime,</b> and that fake doctor might take it into his head to sue me for slander. No, I'll fight my own battles, and see if I can't corner them on my own hook. But I'll tell Phil and Roger." ...|$|E

60|$|Several {{days had}} passed, {{and in that}} time Dave had learned many things.

And now from the military academy came word that Merwell and Jasniff had obtained leave of absence for a week.|$|E
