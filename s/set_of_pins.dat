2500|$|An {{elevator}} {{composed of}} a rotating rack of open frames (similar to an industrial toaster) catches the candlepins and hauls them towards {{the top of the}} machine, and then turns 90 degrees to bring the pins horizontally across, bringing the pins past ten conveyors each wide enough to hold pins in a lengthwise orientation. Unlike the pinspotters used for tenpins and duckpins, since candlepins have identical [...] "ends" [...] to them, the machine does not have to orient the candlepins in one particular direction. [...] The pins fall off the end of the conveyors into spotting tubes, mounted at their base onto the plate that forms {{the main part of the}} spotting table. As the sweep nears the forward end of its travel, and then begins its ascent to its resting position, the table drops to the metal plate pindeck at the end of the lanebed, and release a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins,</b> and then ascends to its own resting position, ready to be filled with pins once more.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program was to {{characterize}} Time Of Arrival Detectors (TOAD) pins response to shock loading with respect to risetime, amplitude, repeatability and consistency. TOAD pins were subjected to impacts of 35 to 420 kilobars amplitude and approximately 1 ms pulse width to investigate the timing spread <b>of</b> four <b>pins</b> and the voltage output profile <b>of</b> the individual <b>pins.</b> <b>Sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins</b> were also aged at 45 {degrees}, 60 {degrees}, and 80 {degrees}C for approximately nine weeks before shock testing at 315 kilobars impact stress. Four <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins</b> were heated to 50. 2 {degrees}C (125 {degrees}F) for approximately two hours and then impacted at either 50 or 315 kilobars. Also, four <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins</b> were aged at 60 {degrees}C for nine weeks and then heated to 50. 2 {degrees}C before shock testing at 50 and 315 kilobars impact stress, respectively. Particle velocity measurements at the contact point between the stainless steel targets and TOAD pins were made using a Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR) to monitor both the amplitude and profile of the shock waves...|$|R
40|$|Carding is {{the primary}} step in the {{processing}} of staple fiber in which a disorganized matt of fiber tufts and clumps is converted into an even web of individualized and partially aligned fibers. The fiber to be opened is conveyed by a pri-mary <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pinned</b> rollers past a secondary <b>set</b> <b>of</b> counter-acting <b>pins,</b> usually moving {{at a much lower}} relative speed. The secondary pinned surfaces are either rollers or flats and are called workers when in the form of rollers. The clearance between the pin sets is small, meaning that fiber tufts become caught in both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins</b> and the difference in speeds pulls the fiber clumps apart, individualizing and aligning the fibers. Fiber is fed into a card as a low-speed, high-density, entangled matt of fiber tufts and is conveyed through the card by a series of transfer rollers with progressively highe...|$|R
2500|$|Regular duckpin bowling {{is popular}} in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. [...] One popular {{pinspotter}} in this sport is the Sherman model, named after its inventor, Ken Sherman, which was produced from 1953-1973. It has continuously moving conveyor belts {{at the ends of}} the gutters beside the pin deck as required by the sport's ruling body, the National Duckpin Bowling Congress, that move fallen pins to the pit. [...] The Sherman's sweep device is located on the right side, vertical [...] "kickback" [...] panel of the lane and pivots 180 degrees (much like a fence gate) to clear pins. [...] The pin table always handles the pins by the neck. [...] A new rack of pins is created with a moving magazine that is shaped like a pin triangle. [...] When the magazine is loaded and the bowler is ready for a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins,</b> a lever pushes the magazine unit out to the pin table so it can take the pins out of the magazine and then set them down on the lane.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} the probability <b>of</b> informed trading (<b>PIN)</b> for nearly 80, 000 stock-quarters between 1993 and 2004 by using two methods to classify buyer-initiated and seller-initiated trades. The first method is the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm with adjustment for 5 -second delay in trade time. The second method is the Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara (2000) algorithm without time adjustment. The second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>PIN</b> estimates {{appears to be}} better than the first set, especially in the years since 2001. More importantly, the Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions show that, for the period between April 1993 and March 2005 inclusively, after excluding the January returns and controlling for beta, size, and book-to-market-equity ratio, monthly stock returns are significantly positively related to the second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>PIN</b> estimates, whereas this is not true for the first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> estimates.

50|$|Multiple-tune {{cylinders}} {{have more}} than one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins</b> intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins</b> into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically shifting the cylinder from one song or movement to the next.|$|E

50|$|The {{pin index}} safety system uses a face seal between the {{cylinder}} valve {{and the associated}} yoke clamp. There are two holes in specific positions on the cylinder valve body below the outlet port , in positions associated with the gas mixture, which prevent connection of the cylinder to a yoke or pressure regulator with a mis-matched <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins.</b> The holes accept pins 4 mm diameter by 6 mm long which are correctly aligned with the holes.|$|E
50|$|The first {{tumbler lock}} {{was found in}} the ruins of the Palace of Khorsabad in Iraq. Basic {{principles}} of the pin tumbler lock may date as far back as 4000 BC in Egypt; the lock consisted of a wooden post affixed to the door, and a horizontal bolt that slid into the post. The bolt had vertical openings into which a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>pins</b> fitted. These could be lifted, using a key, to a sufficient height to allow the bolt to move and unlock the door. This wooden lock was one of Egypt's major developments in domestic architecture during classical times.|$|E

Physically speaking, we thus rigorously obtain the critical behavior of the transverse and longitudinal correlation lengths of the corresponding d+ 1 -dimensional effective interface model in a non-mean-field regime.
