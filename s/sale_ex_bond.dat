By modestly marketing a product, the seller reduces <b>sales</b> <b>ex</b> ante but improves its quality image ex post, as buyers attribute any lackluster sales to insufficient marketing rather than low quality. The findings shed new light on classic marketing problems such as advertising scheduling and market selection. Key words: demarketing; observational learning; quality inferences...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To bond {{vocal fold}} flaps using a sutureless, nonthermal laser-assisted method {{combining}} visible light and photosensitizing dyes to produce collagen crosslinks. Study Design: In the ex vivo study, epithelial incisions {{were created in}} sheep vocal folds. The concentration of the Rose Bengal, and the laser fluence were varied and studied. The in vivo canine study evaluated {{the thickness of the}} basement membrane zone, density and distribution of collagen, elastin, and fibroblasts at time zero, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks. Methods: Ex Vivo: Rose Bengal at concentrations between 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % was applied to the free margins of the incision and irradiated with an Nd:YAG laser at fluences varying from 150 to 600 J/cm 2. The bonding was considered positive when the incision could withstand air at 2 pounds per square inch (psi) from a distance of 3 cm.

40|$|More {{than two}} decades have passed since the initial {{relaxation}} of domestic interest rate controls in Australia and just over one decade since the float of the Australian dollar. Interest rates and exchange rates now constitute {{two of the most}} important channels through which macroeconomic policy can affect the broader economy. It is widely recognized that expectations {{play a critical role in}} these mechanisms, affecting both the timing and speed with which interest and exchange rates transmit shocks through to real activity and prices. Over the longer run, the influence of these two asset prices extends to the efficient allocation of capital and resources. This paper builds on previous work undertaken at the Reserve Bank and the OECD to develop single-equation, behavioural models of these two variables. Consideration is paid to the role of inflation expectations in affecting their behaviour. In particular, a model of <b>ex</b> ante real <b>bond</b> yields is estimated using a measure of forward-looking inflationary expectations which has been constructed by recourse to a Markov switching technique. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1980 s major {{importance}} {{in the growth of}} franchising systems {{can be attributed to the}} advent of a new governance form due to multi unit franchising. In a multi unit agreement a franchisee is permitted the right to establish a mini chain of outlets within the franchise system. Three distinct types of multi unit franchising have been categorised by researchers, namely, master franchising (or sub franchising), area development and area representative (sequential multi unit franchising) agreements. This work tries to explain the situation and use of multi unit franchising in the German franchise sector which is quite young compared to the U. S. market. Premises to explain the use of this ownership strategy are based on agency theory and transaction cost theory. The hypotheses formulated suggest that behavioural uncertainty through the franchisee, because of shirking and free riding, should have a positive relationship with the tendency to the use of multi unit franchising. A likewise positive relationship should be established due to specific investments by the franchisee at start of the contract. However, environmental uncertainty, because of rapid changing markets, should reduce the tendency to the use of multi unit franchising. The study revealed that franchisors did not see a strong relationship between the use of multi unit franchising and its efficiency in mitigating moral hazard.

40|$|Bonds have {{recently}} been promoted as an alternative tool for controlling environmental damages, particularly in those instances when the innovative activities of a firm have uncertain future impacts [Costanza and Perrings (1990) ]. Under this mechanism, a firm would post a <b>bond</b> <b>ex</b> ante, forfeiting the bond if its activities caused harm to environmental resources. While the benefits of bonds have been developed, {{there has been little}} systematic effort to explore their limitations. The labor literature, on the other hand, has extensively studied the limits of bonds as a mechanism for preventing worker shirking. Using the insights found for this parallel problem, this paper explores the limits to environmental bonds, focusing on the problems of moral hazard, liquidity constraints, and legal restrictions. Each limit offers a challenge to the success of environmental bonds. We explore the use of bonds to resolve agricultural nonpoint source pollution problems as a motivating example. We also consider how other incentive schemes suggested by the labor literature might prove useful in the context of environmental management. Specifically, we consider the labor mechanisms of efficiency wages, increasing wage profiles, trust funds, and rank-order tournaments. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} <b>ex</b> vivo the <b>bond</b> {{strength and}} adaptation of fibre posts with oval and circular cross sections luted in oval canals with post spaces prepared using dedicated drills or ultrasonic tips. Methodology: Forty extracted premolars with oval canals were root filled, then randomly {{divided into four}} groups according to the post space preparation device and {{the shape of the}} luted fibre post: dedicated drill + round post, dedicated drill + oval post, ultrasonic tip + round post and ultrasonic tip + oval post. Posts were cemented with a self-adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem 2; 3 M ESPE). Samples were sectioned in 1 -mm-thick slices and observed under a microscope, and the area occupied by the post within the post space area was calculated. Bond strength was then measured using a push-out test, and the failure modes were evaluated with a stereomicroscope at 40 × magnification. Fibre post adaptation and push-out test results were evaluated by analysis of variance (P < 0. 05). Results: Fibre posts, both round and oval, were better adapted to the apical region of the post space (P = 0. 001). In oval canals, the bond strength was significantly higher in coronal regions, when the post space was prepared with a dedicated drill and an oval post was luted (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{two different}} game-theoretic models to explore properties of equilibria in multiple-object auctions and {{presents the results}} of an empirical test of one of them. The first chapter surveys the most important contributions to auction and bidding theory, discusses some questions which have not yet been answered satisfactorily and outlines some of the specific problems which must be addressed when studying multiple-object auctions as opposed to single-object auctions. Chapter two examines the existence and characterization of pure strategy Nash equilibria in multiple-object auction games in which buyers face a binding constraint on exposure. There are five major results. First, symmetric Nash equilibria exist if and only if there are two or less buyers and two or less objects. Second, a Nash equilibrium may not exist if the seller sets a positive reservation bid. Third, asymmetric solutions to symmetrically parametrized games typically involve "high-low" strategies: buyers submit positive bids only on some restricted subset of the objects. Fourth, Nash equilibria typically generate zero "profits" to the buyers. Fifth, when asymmetric solutions exist and the buyers are identical, these solutions are never unique. Chapter three examines the bundling decisions by a multiproduct monopolist with incomplete information about demand. Previously the bundling problem has been analyzed only in a world of perfect and complete information in which the monopolist uses a standard take-it-or-leave-it pricing scheme. The model in chapter three shows that tied-in <b>sales</b> are sometimes <b>ex</b> ante optimal under a reasonable set of assumptions about a world in which there are no production economies or diseconomies and no demand interdependencies. A number of additional results were obtained deriving general sufficient conditions for buyers to prefer bundling, as well as conditions under which bundling is optimal in terms of maximizing expected consumer plus producer surplus. Chapter four reports the results of an empirical examination of the predictions made in chapter three. Testable hypotheses were developed in that chapter which addressed questions about seller revenues, market efficiency, buyer behavior and distributional consequences of a monopolistic seller's bundling decision in multiple object auctions. The data provide strong support for these theoretically-based hypotheses. ...|$|R

O objetivo desta pesquisa foi determinar a resistência de união (RU) de um cimento resinoso autoadesivo à dentina radicular humana contaminada. Foram selecionados 20 dentes humanos unirradiculados, os quais tiveram suas coroas e terços apicais seccionados com um disco diamantado em baixa velocidade e sob refrigeração constante, resultando em segmentos de aproximadamente 8 mm. Os canais foram alargados com uma broca de preparo para pino número 2 em baixa rotação (Exacto, Angelus, Londrina, PR, Brasil).
