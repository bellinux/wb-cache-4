500|$|Each {{of these}} seven predicates state the Jain {{viewpoint}} of a multifaceted reality {{from the perspective}} of time, space, substance and mode. The phrase syāt declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance (dravya), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (bhāva), and negation with regard to other substance (dravya), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (bhāva). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance (dravya) – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it <b>simply</b> is <b>not.</b> In regard to place (kṣetra) – room, it simply is; terrace, it <b>simply</b> is <b>not.</b> In regard to time (kāla) – summer, it simply is; winter, it <b>simply</b> is <b>not.</b> In regard to being (bhāva) – brown, it simply is; white, it <b>simply</b> is <b>not.</b> And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended..|$|R

5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought {{is that it was}} <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> advantageous to be large until the appearance of the Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large.

But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E

For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E

The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E

5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long.

For some hospices this is <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E

5|$|In 1774, the {{government}} of Prince Edward Island passed the Quit Rent Act 1774 to force the proprietors to pay their dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> pay their quitrent. In 1781, {{the government}}, led by Governor Walter Patterson, compulsorily acquired {{approximately half of the}} island using a process known as escheat. That same year, the government held a public auction to sell off the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following a concerted effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested that Governor Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this success, it was clear the Blenheim was <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> going {{to work as a}} fighter. On several {{occasions}} the CH stations directed the fighters to a successful radar capture, only to have the target slowly pull away from the fighter. In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from RAF Kenley made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} {{and asked if they}} could improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E

By April, I./JG 1 had scored a number of kills, but at the cost of 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. The losses were mostly attributed to issues with the He 162 such as engine flame-outs or occasional structural failures, which can most probably be attributed to poor design and insufficient development time. On 24 April 1945, III./JG 1 was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> to react.

Prior to the development of industrialized chemical plants producing copious amounts of gunpowder, in the mid-19th centuries, armies <b>simply</b> could <b>not</b> expend large amounts of gunpowder for training. As a result, the average infantryman <b>simply</b> did <b>not</b> have extensive firearms training beyond simple maintenance and loading drills. The infantryman <b>simply</b> did <b>not</b> know how to aim his rifle at long distances—eyewitnesses report entire companies aiming their rifles at a 45 degree angle facing the sky and discharging their rifles at Bull Run (Guelzo p. 59). Such untrained soldiers could not be expected to engage an enemy much further than point blank range with any level of accuracy.|$|R

5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin did not have the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Excluding a few {{controversial}} claims, scientists {{agree that}} all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary.

There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's {{population}} fell precipitously {{through the}} first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma's population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was no running water or electricity, and gas only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult way to make a living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there was <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.|$|E
