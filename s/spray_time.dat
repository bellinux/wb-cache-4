30|$|The {{effect of}} Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> on the {{structure}} of InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) systems with Sb spray prior to the capping of a GaAs layer was determined by a Raman scattering study. The Raman spectra of the InAs/GaAs system show two phonon signal bands related to interface (IF) defects, located at the low-energy side of InAs QDs and GaAs cap layer main phonon peaks, respectively. The intensity ratio of the IF defect relative phonon signal to its corresponding main peak shows a significant decrease with the Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> increasing from 0 to 15  s, but increases for spray times larger than 15  s. In addition, the InAs QD phonon peaks appear to be resolved with improved symmetry for 15  s of <b>spray</b> <b>time.</b> Finally, the GaAs transverse optical (TO) phonon peak is seen to vary with Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time,</b> both in terms of the intensity and the peak position, in a similar manner to the other results. Taken together, these results suggest the InAs/GaAs QDs with a 15 -s Sb spray lead to a GaAs capping layer with less strain at the IF with the QDs and a lower density of crystalline defects.|$|E

30|$|The above {{results are}} also {{supported}} by the InAs QD phonon line signal. On the low-energy side, a main phonon peak marked by a circle centered at the frequency of 220  cm− 1 and a shake band marked by a square centered at 200  cm− 1 are observed [15]. These are the peaks of InAs QD and InAs QD IF phonon signals, respectively. Due to the nanoscale size of the InAs QDs, the phonon frequency {{is less than the}} corresponding bulk material [31], in keeping with previous results for nanostructures such as quantum dots, wires, and nanowires, where a downward frequency shift and line width broadening of the TO and LO phonon modes are observed. This change of phonon mode frequency and line width is considered to be the relaxation of the q[*]=[*] 0 selection rule in the Raman scattering due to quantum confinement [32, 33]. As {{can be seen from the}} spectra, the InAs QD phonon peak of sample 1 (no Sb spray) shows an obvious asymmetrical shape, which can be attributed to the strain caused by lattice mismatch and defects at the IF of QDs [31], and the stress was relived after Sb spray, just as seen in Figure  1 B. QDs show the asymmetrical dark contrast most likely related to the formation of graded GaAsSb immediately adjacent to the InAs QDs that provides strain relief for the dot/capping layer lattice mismatch. Therefore, the phonon peak asymmetry is improved with increasing Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> to 7.5 and 15  s. The LO and TO modes become increasingly resolved, with the InAs TO phonon signal as the main peak, and the LO signal giving a high-energy-side shoulder. The sample with the 15 -s Sb spray shows a clear shoulder with the main phonon signal, demonstrating there is less strain occurring at the QD/cap IF in this sample, since phonon signals of unstrained materials can be sufficiently separated in energy, meaning the Raman phonons should be well resolved [31]. With the Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> increased to 22.5  s, however, the InAs QD phonon peaks present broaden and decrease in intensity, with the peaks becoming less resolved. In addition, the corresponding QD IF peaks show a variation in intensity with the increase of Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time,</b> with a decrease in intensity for increasing Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> from 0 to 15  s but an increase when the Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> is increased to 22.5  s. The QD IF peaks show the weakest intensity for the sample with the 15 -s Sb spray treatment, demonstrating less strain and associated defects occurred under this treatment condition. It should be noted that the signal peaks banded as a shoulder at the high-frequency side of the GaAs LO phonon peak remain not identified; it may be the second-order phonon peak of the IF relative signal of Ga/Sb/In/As.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaterial {{consumption}} and {{dry film thickness}} are the two main indicators for identifying the efficiency of spray coating process. Using a proper spray condition, less material consumption could be obtained as per a given dry film thickness. This paper presents the influences of supplying- air pressure, <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> and nozzle size of spray gun on the weight of material used per shot and the dry film thickness obtained. A high- volume-low-pressure type spray gun was used to atomize and deliver a liquid solution of Teflon depositing on a flat work surface. The experimental results showed that low <b>spray</b> <b>time,</b> large nozzle size and low spray pressure {{were responsible for the}} increased material {{consumption and}} dry film thickness. The optimization was performed, where the material consumption was minimized and the dry film thickness was set within a specified standard.

Moreover, this paper demonstrates a determination of the coefficient of spray coating process (k) through a relationship between coating thickness and material consumption using data obtained from the experiment.

In conclusion, the optimal conditions in the spray coating process was determined to minimize material consumption whereas the developed spray coating model predicts the coating thickness related to the position of the spray gun.

30|$|From the spectra, {{we can see}} the phonon signal band of GaAs IF has a high-energy {{side shift}} and shows an obvious {{variation}} in the shake peak numbers and intensity with increasing Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time.</b> Especially, the InAs/GaAs QD systems with the 15 -s Sb spray clearly display a decrease in shake peak numbers and a strengthening in the Raman intensity of GaAs IF signal. The results are assumed to originate from the Sb intermixing in the GaAs matrix, with varied compositions, stresses, and defects being manifested in the GaAs IF signal. Due to the lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs, during the epitaxial growth, the strain will accumulate and result in the formation of lattice deformations or dislocations. These defects may be located in the InAs IF, inside the InAs QDs, or in the GaAs IF. Therefore, the up-shift, intensity, and peak number variations of the GaAs IF Raman signal can be explained in the following manner: during the Sb spray treatment, larger lattice constant GaAsSb is formed which results in reducing the QD/capping layer IF lattice mismatch. With the Sb <b>spray</b> <b>time</b> increased to 15 and 22.5  s, we can observe the obvious phonon signal for the Ga-Sb bonds located at the frequency of 230  cm− 1 [29, 30]. The presence of GaAsSb changes the stress distribution at the QD/cap IF, leading to a shift in the GaAs IF phonon line to higher energy. At a certain Sb spray treatment, the symmetry of the strain will achieve an optimum value, and the defects and dislocations will be reduced to a large degree. Furthermore, the uniformity of the GaAs IF In/Ga intermixing is enhanced. Therefore, the phonon signal peak of GaAs IF will be strengthened, as shown in the spectra; the 15 -s Sb spray treatment is just the case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cryogen {{spray cooling}} �CSC � is an {{effective}} technique to protect the epidermis during cutaneous laser therapies. Spraying a cryogen onto the skin surface creates a time-varying heat flux, effectively cooling the skin during and following the cryogen spurt. In previous studies mathematical models were developed to predict the human skin temperature profiles during the cryogen <b>spraying</b> <b>time.</b> However, no studies have accounted for the additional cooling due to residual cryogen left on the skin surface following the spurt termination. We formulate and solve an inverse heat conduction �IHC � problem to predict the time-varying surface heat flux both during and following a cryogen spurt. The IHC formulation uses measured temperature profiles from within a medium to estimate the surface heat flux. We implement a one-dimensional sequential function specification method �SFSM � to estimate the surface heat flux from internal temperatures measured within an in vitro model {{in response to a}} cryogen spurt. Solution accuracy and experimental errors are examined using simulated temperature data. Heat flux following spurt termination appears substantial; however, it is less than that during the <b>spraying</b> <b>time.</b> The estimated time-varying heat flux can subsequently be used in forward heat conduction models to estimate temperature profiles in skin during and following a cryogen spurt and predict appropriate timing for onset of the laser pulse. © 200...|$|R
