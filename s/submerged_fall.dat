25|$|Rainbow Falls was dammed in 1910 when Rainbow Dam was built. The {{reservoir}} {{behind the}} dam <b>submerged</b> Colter <b>Falls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Falls {{functioned as}} a natural outlet for Lake Victoria, until in 1954 the {{construction}} of Owen Falls Dam was completed, effectively extending Lake Victoria and <b>submerging</b> Ripon <b>Falls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{river traffic}} on the Columbia River was profoundly {{affected}} in 1935 by the building of Bonneville Dam in Multnomah County and by The Dalles Dam in 1957 in Wasco County (which <b>submerged</b> Celilo <b>Falls).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{began work}} on the dam in 1952 and {{completed}} it five years later. Slackwater created by the dam <b>submerged</b> Celilo <b>Falls,</b> the economic and cultural hub of Native Americans {{in the region and}} the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in North America. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as the rising waters rapidly silenced the <b>falls,</b> <b>submerged</b> fishing platforms, and consumed the village of Celilo. Ancient petroglyphs were also in the area being submerged. Approximately 40 petroglyph panels were removed with jackhammers before inundation and were placed in storage before being installed in Columbia Hills State Park in the 2000s.|$|R
50|$|Somewhat {{smaller than}} Lake Michigan, Lake Chippewa {{extended}} {{through the most}} of the Michigan Basin, north to the Straits of Mackinac, where there was a narrow channel which conveyed the lake's outflow over the now <b>submerged</b> Mackinac <b>Falls</b> to Lake Stanley. Its shoreline ranged from 10 - 30 mi out from the present day Lake Michigan shore.|$|R
25|$|The largest dam is the Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam, {{also known}} as the FirstEnergy Dam, on the border between Cuyahoga Falls and Akron. This 57-foot dam has for over 90 years <b>submerged</b> the <b>falls</b> for which the City of Cuyahoga Falls was named; more to the point of water quality, it has created a large {{stagnant}} pool with low dissolved oxygen.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, Charles Redvers Westlake, an English engineer, {{reported}} to the Colonial Government of Uganda recommending {{the construction of a}} hydroelectric dam at Owen Falls near the city of Jinja. This led to the establishment of the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB), with Westlake as its first chairman. The consultant engineer on the project was Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners. The dam was completed in 1954, <b>submerging</b> Ripon <b>Falls.</b> It supplies electricity to Uganda and parts of neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania. Maintenance and availability of the station declined seriously during the government of Idi Amin.|$|R
50|$|Artur von Casimir (4 September 1908 - 15 December 2005) was a German Oberst {{and former}} bomber pilot who flew for the Luftwaffe during World War II. Since 2004 he has {{received}} {{a great deal of}} publicity in Norway. One of the Heinkel He 111 he flew was recovered from Jonsvatnet lake near Trondheim in 2004, where it had been <b>submerged</b> since <b>falling</b> through the ice during the spring thaw in April 1940. He commanded Kampfgruppe 100 during the German invasion of Norway, and led the air raids on Namsos on 20 April 1940 (See Namsos Campaign). He assumed the position of Gruppenkommandeur over KGr. 100 on 16 February 1940.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, the {{construction}} of the Owen <b>Falls</b> Dam <b>submerged</b> the Ripon <b>Falls.</b> Most of the [...] "Flat Rocks" [...] that gave the area its name disappeared under water as well.

5000|$|Syncrossus hymenophysa, {{commonly}} known as the tiger loach, tiger botia or green tiger loach, is a species of freshwater fish in the loach family Botiidae. It is native to fast mountain streams and large rivers, over soft substrates and often near <b>submerged</b> boulders and <b>fallen</b> trees, in Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. [...] Unlike most loaches, S. hymenophysa is very aggressive, especially when food is added to the tank.|$|R
40|$|The canal {{represents}} a very characteristic and new habitat for freshwater hyphomycetes, It {{is a massive}} body of water with little fluctuation in the physico-chemical properties of water. The only variable characteristics {{appear to be the}} annual temporal changes, between 10 and 26 oC,and the biomass content of water. The gradual build up of substratum is observable because of the annual clearing during the closure of canal in January. A total of 67 species of freshwater hyphomycetes was observed in canal water during a study of two years using three possible techniques. These included water filtration, random collection of <b>submerged</b> <b>fallen</b> leaves and immersion of leaves of some known tree species as baits. Thirty-seven unknown species of hyphomycetes were recorded. About 13 species could not be placed in the known genera In addition to the undescribed species, Articulospora proliferata, Mycocentrospora iqbalii, sporidesmium ensiforme and Sympodiocladium frondosum are new records from this sub-tropical habitat in Pakistan. Some substrate preferences were observed by different species of canal water hyphomycetes on different bait leaves under a similar temperature regime. Some of these particular associations included Flagellospora penicillioides nad Lunulospora curvula on Dalbergia sissoo, F. lpenicillioides nad Triscelophorus monosporus on Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Clavaruopsis aquatica and Lunulospora curvula on Populus enramericana and dimorphospora foliicola nad T. marchalianum on salix babyloica. Three seasonal associations were observed using the Bruaun-Blanquet approach of community formation. Tetracladietum marchalianae was detected in February and March, characterized by very little substratum and low temperature. Flagello-Lunulosporetum curvulae was detected during April upto August, the period with the highest temperature, representing a true summer assemblage. Lunulosporetum curvulae was observed during September to December, representing a low temperature regime associated with leaf fall. The maximum number of species was detected in the Association Lunulosporetum curvulae. The Associations formed using different techniques in this habitat were almost similar. The association formed by water filtration, <b>submerged</b> <b>fallen</b> leaves and on bait leaves of Populus euramericana was Lunulosporetum curvulae. However, on bait leaves of Dalbergia sissoo, lthe Association Lunulo-Flagellosporetum penicillioides was formed. On bait leaves of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Salix babylonica, different associations namely, Flagellosporetum penicillioide and Tetracladietum marchalianae were formed resplectively. The colonization patternon different bait leaves imn the different associations indicated some typical early colonizers to be Articulospora proliferate, Lemonniera aquatca, L. centrosphaera, Tetracladium marchaliaunm and unknown species I. Among the typical late colonizers, anguillospora longissima, Anguillospora sp. A, Campylospora chaetocladia, Clavalriopsis aquatica, Pyramidospora casuarinae and Triscelophorus monosporus were recorded. A total of 98 species of freshwater hyphomycetes were observed in the Karakorum Range. Heliscus lugdunensis, Lemonniera aquatica nad Tricladium curvisporum were the most dominant species with a wide ecological amplitude, Thirty-three known and 65 unknown species were observed, out of which 17 species could not be placed anywhere in the known genera. The reason for such a large number of unknown species is that a majority of them were detected in artificial foam samples. The maximum number of species was always observed in the artificial foam in comparison to all other techniques. A greater number of species was detected using all possible techniques giving a true picture of the community at a given site. The longitudinal distribution of freshwater hyphomycetes was most influenced by the substrate materials. Near the glaciers, or at the origin of streams, only those species were present which commonly colonize woody substrata. The diversity of species was higher at sites with thick riparian vegetation. Water chemistry did not change much and did not influence the community. The spora in the lakes always reflected {{the presence or absence of}} substrata and the turbulance created in water. The species composition was always poor on the shore of lakes except in those where substratum was available and water was turbulant. The inlet streams to the lakes were always richer in species diversity in comparison to outlet streams indicating sedimentation of conidia...|$|R
50|$|Native burial grounds on Indian Island were moved, and {{the town}} of Kettle Falls was {{relocated}} to the present site of Kettle Falls, Washington. In addition to <b>submerging</b> the <b>falls,</b> Grand Coulee permanently blocked anadromous fish from traveling upriver, ending salmon and steelhead migration in the upper Columbia River Basin. As with the flooding of Priest Rapids, Celilo Falls, and Cascades Rapids downriver, the loss of Kettle Falls ended the traditional way of life for the native cultures that revolved around salmon fishing. Many native people moved out of the area, but others live today on the nearby Spokane and Colville Indian Reservations. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation filed a lawsuit against the United States government, which was settled in 1994 for $53 million, plus $15.25 million annually from 1996 onward.|$|R
5|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{commenced}} work on The Dalles Dam in 1952 {{and completed}} it five years later. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the <b>falls,</b> <b>submerged</b> fishing platforms, and consumed {{the village of}} Celilo, ending an age-old existence for those who lived there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on a bluff overlooking the former location of the falls.|$|R
5000|$|To the {{background}} of historical events, Szibériai garnizon explores existential themes. According to Chinezu, the text is important for showing the alienation of a prisoner, the man's transformation into [...] "anonymous digit", and the apathetic crowd into which he <b>submerges.</b> Characters <b>fall</b> into two main categories: those who conveniently forget their countries of birth {{for the duration of}} their ordeal, and those who miss them so much that they risk escaping and making the perilous journey across Asia. The one sustained effort against apathy is mounted by a militaristic and loyalist group of prisoners, who establish a Siberian branch of Turul Society. Markovits retells the dramatic failure of their honor system, and the ridiculousness of their cultural endeavors, with subdued irony (over what Chinezu calls his [...] "many acid pages"). Al. Simion also notes that, in their Siberian exile, the prisoners come to understand the fragility of their own Empire.|$|R
50|$|In 1860, Dayton {{voted to}} build at Union Falls a covered bridge, 112 ft long and 18 ft wide, {{connecting}} to Buxton. The span was blown up in 1921 by the Clark Power Company, an event filmed {{as part of}} a melodrama by the Pine Tree Moving Picture Corporation of Portland. The Great Fires of 1947 destroyed two-thirds of Dayton, including 27 homes, 4 barns and the town hall. In 1951, the Central Maine Power Company built a hydroelectric dam between Salmon Falls and Union <b>Falls,</b> <b>submerging</b> the scenic gorge. Once a community of dairy farms, Dayton is now primarily residential.|$|R
50|$|The highest {{source of}} the Lambourn is on the Maddle Road {{in the village of}} Upper Lambourn, near the Wiltshire and Oxfordshire borders. It emerges from a {{rainwater}} drain and occasionally flows down a channel between the road and pavement. In the village it runs underground in a pipe until re-emerging alongside the road opposite The Malt Shovel and along Malt Shovel Lane. At this point it is usually little more than a damp, muddy ditch, and remains so until halfway through Lynch Wood. Here it is fed by several springs, two of which are close to the Goose Green road, forming a short stream that runs ten feet downhill into the river. These springs quickly fill the channel and the river swells ten to twenty feet wide and over three feet deep, <b>submerging</b> several <b>fallen</b> trees. Although bourne until Great Shefford the river was not dry below Lynch Wood in 2007-08. However, it dried up in June-July 2009 and the riverbed remained dry until January 2010 due to 4-5 inches of snow melting in a thaw. It dried up again from the summer of 2010 until the spring of 2012, when increased rainfall filled the river, since when the adjacent roads in Upper Lambourn, Lambourn and Eastbury have been regularly flooded.|$|R
