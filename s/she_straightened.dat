60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> herself, and, passing {{behind the}} chair, stood leaning on it, facing me.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>straightened</b> herself, {{and there}} was a flash in her eyes, but Nasmyth raised one hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>straightened</b> up {{and gazed}} at him, taking one of his hands in her lithe fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not mistaken}} in the girl," [...] {{he said to}} his wife when they were alone. [...] "She has immense reserve force--I feel it. Wait until <b>she</b> <b>straightens</b> up and {{broadens}} out a little, you'll see! There's some half-savage power in her, magnetism, impelling quality. I predict a great future for her if--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The elder one <b>she</b> <b>straightens</b> {{herself a}} little, {{as though she}} didn't like my talk. 'He could not be as {{comfortable}} as he would be at Bonaventure, {{which is the most}} important thing. We will ask the doctor; and have you any right to place obstacles in the way of Mr. Ormesby's recovery?' says she, and that was enough for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't do any fancy stunts. <b>She</b> just <b>straightened</b> up {{and looked}} at me kind o' steady for a minute, and then came over to shake hands.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> it {{the next}} moment. “Now don’t scold, don’t you dare scold,” she cried with mock defiance.|$|E
60|$|Frona {{caught her}} breath for a moment. Then <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> out her arms to hold the man in {{challenge}} to the arms of Lucile.|$|E
60|$|And as I watched them--not {{thinking}} {{of playing the}} spy--I saw her face grow suddenly cold, and <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> herself up and pushed away her lover's arms.|$|E
50|$|Arzu Karabulut {{admits that}} she is a great fan of Lionel Messi. She said in a {{newspaper}} interview that <b>she</b> even <b>straightens</b> her curly hair for her admiration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Such an untidy man!" [...] <b>she</b> declared, <b>straightening</b> his tie. [...] "I am not at {{all sure}} that you deserve to have lady clients calling upon you. Were you late last night?" ...|$|R
40|$|To {{others it}} is just an old-fashioned garden, along the bus route, {{but to me it}} is a nostalgic symbol. Every time I pass, {{memories}} of another garden filter into consciousness. A garden bordered with iris plumes of varied hues and perfumed with art elusive fragrance appears. An old lady is bent over a bloom of exceptionally delicate shade. <b>She</b> <b>straightens</b> slowly saying, 2 ̆ 2 Lovely, isn 2 ̆ 7 t it, John? 2 ̆ 2 Her hands are gnarled and dirty, her dress black and shapeless, but her smile makes you overlook all else...|$|R
60|$|She {{grasped the}} balcony rail, and I think {{would have fallen}} but for my arm. Then <b>she</b> <b>straightened,</b> and only the quiver of her lip marked the effort.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>straightened</b> herself {{slowly and}} passed out of the room, while when she entered it again dressed for the drive Mr. Earle laid his hand upon her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "I?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>straightened</b> {{herself up}} in the seat, cast a curious glance into the dark corner, and then, letting herself down again, said: [...] "Oh dear, no!" ...|$|E
60|$|If men {{knew how}} women {{pass the time}} when they are alone they'd never marry. Laura Lean Jibbey, peanut brittle, a little almond cream on the neck muscles, dishes unwashed, half an hour's talk with the iceman, reading a package of old letters, a couple of pickles and two bottles of malt extract, one hour peeking {{through a hole in the}} window shade into the flat across the air-shaft--that's about all there is to it. Twenty minutes before time for him to come home from work <b>she</b> <b>straightens</b> up the house, fixes her rat so it won't show, and gets out a lot of sewing for a ten-minute bluff.|$|R
60|$|Mirrab's long {{strands of}} golden hair hung like a veil {{over her face}} and breast; <b>she</b> had <b>straightened</b> herself out somewhat, but her head was still bent. Her tottering reason was very slowly and {{gradually}} returning to her.|$|R
2500|$|While {{all this}} is going on, Beneatha's {{character}} and direction in life are being defined for us by two different men: Beneatha's wealthy and educated boyfriend George Murchison, and Joseph Asagai. Neither man is {{actively involved in the}} Youngers' financial ups and downs. George represents the [...] "fully assimilated black man" [...] who denies his African heritage with a [...] "smarter than thou" [...] attitude, which Beneatha finds disgusting, while dismissively mocking Walter's lack of money and education. Asagai patiently teaches Beneatha about her African heritage; he gives her thoughtfully useful gifts from Africa, while pointing out she is unwittingly assimilating herself into white ways. <b>She</b> <b>straightens</b> her hair, for example, which he characterizes as [...] "mutilation." ...|$|R
6000|$|After dinner <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> {{things up}} a little, and as she got into the wagon she said: [...] "Well, there, Mr. Rivers. You'll {{have to take care}} o' things now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jill laughed, but {{the fancy}} pleased her, and <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> herself {{out under the}} gay afghan, while she sang, in a plaintive voice, another little French song her father taught her:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad I didn't get my hat wet," [...] {{said the}} Girl breathlessly, as <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> {{it with a}} careful hand and {{wondered}} if she looked very blown and blowsy.|$|E
50|$|Another set of joyous {{sideways}} kick-jumps follows. At {{the sound}} of a sustained flute note and the musical hint of a solemn hymn, <b>she</b> <b>straightens</b> her body. Pressing her arms tightly to her sides, she performs a sequence of tiny steps with feet in parallel. Facing the audience, the dancer repeatedly traces a square pattern on the stage with the repetitive lateral movement. On one pass around the perimeter, she rocks an invisible infant in her arms. The ballet ends with the soloist's return to the fence, her back to the audience and face in profile. She plants her leg triumphantly on the upper rail, one arm outstretched, one upraised, in salutation to all she surveys. In a final definitive gesture, she brings her fist down to clasp a knee.|$|R
6000|$|The girl’s eyes flashed, and <b>she</b> slowly <b>straightened</b> herself. “It is {{fortunate}} {{for you that}} I can take your word, because I had formed my own conclusions,” she said. “Don’t suppose I should sit here talking to you if I had thought you were guilty. This, however, is quite between ourselves.” ...|$|R
60|$|Becky {{smiled as}} <b>she</b> spoke, and <b>straightened</b> her bent {{shoulders}} as if settling her burden for another trudge {{along the path}} of duty.|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{gave her}} a fierce hug; <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> herself up, and dashed the water from her eyes. [...] "Well, then," [...] she said, [...] "I'll see. But promise me one thing, mother." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when she}} stood {{with him on the}} steamer again, bound for the Cape, when the spring breeze gave life to her faded hair, <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> her {{shoulders}} and stood like a conqueror.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she is not}} married," [...] said Mrs. Temple, stooping {{over the}} jasmines. Then <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> and faced me, her voice shaken with earnestness. [...] "David, {{do you think that}} Nick still loves her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|From the {{corridor}} came the rattling of spurs, tramping of boots, and loud voices. Madeline detected Alfred's quick notes {{when he was}} annoyed: [...] "We'll rustle back home, then," [...] he said. The answer came, [...] "No!" [...] Madeline recognized Stewart's voice, and <b>she</b> quickly <b>straightened</b> up. [...] "I won't have them in here," [...] went on Alfred.|$|R
60|$|Her {{shoulders}} <b>straightened.</b> <b>She</b> {{shook her}} savage head, {{and she turned}} about and walked boldly back {{to the mouth of}} the cave of Bukawai, the unclean--of Bukawai, the witch-doctor.|$|R
50|$|At the school, Donna {{attends a}} history class that is taught by David Lindsay (Ross Ford) {{who is also}} the school’s psychologist. Although Donna does not reveal her secret to David, he {{believes}} that she is a good person who may have been caught up in a series of bad events and that <b>she</b> can <b>straighten</b> out her life with his help.|$|R
60|$|By-and-by {{the shower}} passed. <b>She</b> <b>straightened</b> up, brave and half-way smiling. She {{would have made}} a splendid wife, for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender. She took a gum-drop and began her story.|$|E
60|$|He rode off. Duncombe {{returned}} {{where the}} girl was standing. She was clutching at {{the branches of the}} shrub as though prostrate with fear, but at his return <b>she</b> <b>straightened</b> herself. How much had she heard he wondered.|$|E
6000|$|... "No wheels," [...] Tasso said calmly. <b>She</b> <b>straightened</b> up. [...] "No wheels, no parts, no relays. Not a claw. Not the Second Variety." [...] She {{folded her}} arms. [...] "You're {{going to have}} to be able to explain this." ...|$|E
5000|$|In flashbacks, she {{is shown}} {{sporting}} an afro, a hairstyle that, according to Archer, {{made her look}} [...] "like Angela Davis had a love child with Sweet Lou Dunbar." [...] <b>She</b> eventually <b>straightened</b> her hair and grew it long enough to wear it in a tied back flip hairstyle. In season seven, she began wearing a hair weave, which she does not like the others noticing.|$|R
5000|$|Harrods {{has been}} criticised by Guardian {{journalist}} Sali Hughes as [...] "deeply sexist" [...] for making female employees wear six kinds of makeup {{at all times}} without requiring this of male employees. They have also been criticised after reports came out claiming that Harrods staff told a black woman {{that she would not}} be employed unless <b>she</b> chemically <b>straightened</b> her hair, stating that her natural hair style was “unprofessional”.|$|R
60|$|Already {{her look}} of {{pleading}} had gone. <b>She</b> had <b>straightened</b> herself up, prouder and more disdainful than before. He dared to make conditions! he! the mercenary creature whom anyone could buy {{body and soul}} for money, who took payment for doing such work as would soil an honest man's hands! It was monstrous! impossible, unthinkable. She thought that her ears had deceived her or that mayhap he had misunderstood.|$|R
