25|$|On 19 December 1933, Elnadi flew in the {{international}} race between Cairo and Alexandria. Flying at speeds averaging 100 miles per hour, she steered her <b>single-engine</b> <b>plane</b> to the finish-line before {{any of the other}} competitors. As she missed flying over one of the two tents located at midpoint of the course, which was required as part of the competition, Elnadi was not declared the winner. She received a consolation prize of 200 Egyptian pounds and the congratulations of King Fuad for her attempt. Huda Sha'arawi, a feminist leader, also sent salutations for the inspiration Elnadi provided and then held a fundraising drive to buy Elnadi a plane of her own. Elnadi worked as the secretary general of the Egyptian Aviation Club and flew for about five years before she was injured in an accident which damaged her spine.|$|E

25|$|Atta and al-Shehhi both {{encountered}} {{some difficulty}} reentering the United States, on 10 January and 19 January, respectively. As neither had presented a student visa, {{both of them}} had to persuade INS inspectors that they should be admitted so that they could continue their flight training. Neither operative had any problem clearing customs. After returning to Florida from their trips, Atta and al-Shehhi visited Georgia, staying briefly in Norcross and Decatur, and renting a <b>single-engine</b> <b>plane</b> to fly with an instructor in Lawrenceville. By 19 February, Atta and al-Shehhi were in Virginia. They had rented a mailbox in Virginia Beach, cashed a check, and then promptly returned to Georgia, staying in Stone Mountain. In mid-March, Ziad Jarrah was in Georgia as well, staying in Decatur. At the end of the month, Jarrah left the United States again and visited Sengün in Germany for two weeks. In early April, Atta and al-Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach and closed the mailbox they had opened in February.|$|E
500|$|In {{financial}} difficulty {{following his}} divorce and career decline, Sinatra {{was forced to}} borrow $200,000 from Columbia to pay his back taxes after MCA refused to front the money. Rejected by Hollywood, he turned to Las Vegas and made his debut at the Desert Inn in September 1951, and also began singing at the Riverside Hotel in Reno, Nevada. Sinatra became one of Las Vegas's pioneer entertainers, [...] and a prominent figure on the Vegas scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s onwards, a period described by Rojek as the [...] "high-water mark" [...] of Sinatra's [...] "hedonism and self absorption". Rojek notes that the Rat Pack [...] "provided an outlet for gregarious banter and wisecracks", but argues that it was Sinatra's vehicle, possessing an [...] "unassailable command over the other performers". [...] Sinatra would fly to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in Van Heusen's <b>single-engine</b> <b>plane.</b> On October 4, 1953, Sinatra made his first performance at the Sands Hotel and Casino, after an invitation by the manager Jack Entratter, who had previously worked at the Copa in New York. Sinatra typically performed there three times a year, and later acquired {{a share in the}} hotel.|$|E

2500|$|Varney Speed Lines (named {{after one}} of its initial owners, Walter T. Varney, {{who was also a}} founder of United Airlines) was formed in 1934, {{operating}} airmail and passenger services in the American Southwest over a route originating from El Paso and extending through Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Vegas, New Mexico to Pueblo, Colorado. The airline commenced operations with the Lockheed Vega, a <b>single-engine</b> <b>plane</b> that carried four passengers. Following cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts by the Roosevelt administration in 1934, Robert F. Six learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as Chairman of the Board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines (later changed to [...] "Airlines") on July 8, 1937. Six relocated the airline's headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in Denver in October 1937. Six changed the name to [...] "Continental" [...] because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 March, Yorktown and {{the other}} {{carriers}} of her task group began to concentrate solely {{on the island of}} Okinawa and its surrounding islets. For two days, they pounded the island in softening-up strikes. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed ashore; and, for almost six weeks, she sent her planes to the island to provide direct support for the troops operating ashore. About every three days, she retired to the east to conduct fueling rendezvous or to rearm and re-provision. The only exception to that routine came on 7 April when it was discovered that a Japanese task force built around the elusive battleship [...] was steaming south for one last, desperate, offensive. Yorktown {{and the other}} carriers quickly launched strikes to attack that valued target. Air Group 9 aviators claimed several torpedo hits on Yamato just before the battleship exploded and sank. At least three [...] bomb hits on the light cruiser [...] sank it also. The pilots also made strafing runs on the escorting destroyers and claimed to have left one afire in a sinking condition. At the conclusion of that action, Yorktown and her planes resumed their support for the troops on Okinawa. On 11 April, she came under air attack again when a <b>single-engine</b> <b>plane</b> sped in on her. Yorktowns anti-aircraft gunners brought down the plane. Sporadic air attacks continued until her 11 May departure from the Ryūkyūs, but Yorktown sustained no additional damage and claimed only one further kill with her anti-aircraft battery. On 11 May, TG58.4 was detached to proceed to Ulithi for upkeep, rest, and relaxation.|$|E
