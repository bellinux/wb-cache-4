25|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes freedom {{from many of the}} normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E

PURPOSE: To {{examine the effects of}} a flame resistant synthetic material base layer on heat stress factors. METHODS: Ten recreationally active males (25 ± 6. 1 yrs, 80. 9 ± 8. 4 kg, 11. 1 ± 5. 3 % fat, 4. 4 ± 0. 6 L·min- 1 VO 2 max) completed two trials of intermittent (50 min walking, 10 min sitting) treadmill walking (2. 5 mph, 4 % grade) over 3 hours in a climate chamber (35 ⁰C, 30 % RH). Participants wore standard WLFF Nomex green pants, yellow shirt with either a 100 % cotton base layer (C) or a flame resistant synthetic material base layer (S), while carrying a 35 lb pack, hard hat, and gloves. Exercise was followed by a 30 minute rest period without pack, hard hat, gloves, or Nomex yellow shirt. Core (Tc) and skin (Tsk) temperature were measured continuously throughout the trial. Skin blood flow (SBF) and skin temperature (DTsk) was recorded via laser doppler for two minutes prior to walking, five minutes during each break, and three, five minute periods during the 30 minutes following exercise. Physiological strain index (PSI) was calculated. Water was scripted at 8 ml/kg/hr. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed using SPSS 22. 0. RESULTS: <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on Tc (p≤ 0. 001) and Tsk (p= 0. 003). No significant trialXtime interactions were found in Tc (p= 0. 077) and Tsk (p= 0. 086). SBF showed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time (p= 0. 001) and a trialXtime interaction (p= 0. 001). <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on DTsk (p= 0. 001). Comparisons for SBF and DTsk were made between peaks, nadirs, and the three post-exercise periods for C and S. <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on SBF peaks (p= 0. 001), nadirs (p= 0. 028), and posts (p= 0. 001). <b>Significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on DTsk peaks (p= 0. 019) and posts (p= 0. 001).

The failure to find significant effects of culture or sex on negative initiations suggests that the lack of cross-cultural peer interactions is not motivated by hostile intentions. The lack of cross-cultural interactions is discussed in terms of peer familiarity and communication skills.

Twenty healthy young men were recruited for this study. EMG data were collected for the rectus abdominis (RA), internal oblique (IO), erector spinae (ES), and multifidus (MF) muscles of the dominant side. During bridging, an experimental procedure was performed with two options: an intervention factor (with and without arm movement) and a bridging factor (on the floor and on a therapeutic ball). There were <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> the intervention factor in the IO and ES and for the bridging factor in the IO. The RA and IO showed significant interaction between the intervention and bridge factors. Furthermore, IO/RA ratio during bridging on the floor (without arm movement, 2. 05 ± 2. 61; with arm movement, 3. 24 ± 3. 42) and bridging on the ball (without arm movement: 2. 95 ± 3. 87; with arm movement: 5. 77 ± 4. 85) showed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for,</b> and significant interaction between the intervention and bridge factors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect ofperceived clothing deprivation on social participation of adolescents. A questionnaire was developed to measure perceived clothing deprivation and social participation. The sample was comprised of 338 high school students enrolled in ninth through twelfth grades at six high schools. Factor analysis generated two clothing deprivation factors: Inability to Buy and Clothing Deprivation Relative to Peers. Two social participation factors were also generated: Social Competence and Social Participation. Results indicated that clothing deprivation had a significant effect on social participation. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> both Inability to Buy and Clothing Deprivation Relative to Peers. Univariate F tests revealed <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> both clothing deprivation factors on both social participation factors. The beneficial effect of social participation on adoles-cent development has been generally accepted (Roff, Sells, & Golden, 1972). Poor social competence and poor peer relationships in children can contribute to later problems, such as juvenile delinquency, school dropout, and psychiat-ric problems (Cowen, Pedersen, Babigian, Izzo, & Trost, 1973). Therefore, it is important to facilitate opportunities for social participation within this age group. One possible barrier to social participation may be feelings of perceived clothing deprivation.

Four strategies, clarifying, questioning, summarizing, and predicting were trained through direct instruction and reciprocal teaching in reading and listening settings.

The dependent variables were the ability to apply the four strategies, general reading and listening comprehension performance, and knowledge of reading strategies.

Eighty-four {{males and}} sixty-six female {{subjects}} {{participated in a}} survey that assessed their attitude towards the intention to participate in high-risk sexual behaviour (i. e. sex without condom use) and the perception that participating in high risk sexual behaviour can lead adversely to HIV infection. All the subjects were randomly selected {{to fall into the}} age group ranges of 17 - 18, 19 - 20 and > 20. The output of the descriptive statistics revealed that there is a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> gender, however {{there was no significant difference}} in the effect of age on the intention to participate in high-risk sexual behaviour (without condom use) for males and females. The descriptive analysis also revealed that there is a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> age, and also the interaction between gender and age indicates a significant difference in the effect of age on the perception that the intention to participate in high risk sexual behaviour can lead to HIV-infection for males and females...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the effect of {{abdominal}} drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) on lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA), and erector spinae (ES) muscle activity during arm lifts in prone and standing positions. Twenty healthy subjects were recruited, and NoraxonTeleMyo 2400 T was used to collect electromyographic signals from the LT, SA, and ES muscles. A two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) used a significance level of. 05. If a significant interaction was found, pairwise comparisons were performed with a Bonferroni adjustment (. 05 / 4 =. 013). The results of the study were as follows: 1) In LT, no significant ADIM by position interaction was found (F 1, 19 =. 356, p=. 558). There was a <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> ADIM. LT muscle activity with ADIM was significantly greater compared with muscle activity without ADIM (F 1, 19 = 82. 863, p<. 001). There was also a <b>significant</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> position. LT muscle activity in the prone position was greater compared with muscle activity in the standing position (...|$|R
