40|$|In one of {{our earlier}} works, we {{proposed}} to approximate Pareto fronts to multiobjective optimization problems by two-sided approximations, one from inside and another from outside of the feasible objective set, called, respectively, lower <b>shell</b> and <b>upper</b> <b>shell.</b> We worked there {{under the assumption that}} for a given problem an <b>upper</b> <b>shell</b> exists. As it is not always the case, in this paper we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of <b>upper</b> <b>shells.</b> We also investigate how to constructively search infeasible sets to derive <b>upper</b> <b>shells.</b> We approach this issue by means of problem relaxations. We formally show that under certain conditions some subsets of lower shells to relaxed multiobjective optimization problems are <b>upper</b> <b>shells</b> in the respective unrelaxed problems. Results presented are illustrated by a numerical example representing a~small but real mechanical problem. Practical implications of the results are discussed.

40|$|A ceramic reusable, {{externally}} applied composite {{thermal protection}} system (TPS) is proposed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of CFD simulations of the compression process of a scroll compressor. The compressor geometry accounts for the final scroll gas pockets, two Intermediate Discharge Valves (IDVs), the central discharge zone and the <b>upper</b> <b>shell.</b> Â The numerical model uses a real gas equation of state to determine gas properties during the compression process and accounts for the motion of the orbiting scroll and IDVs using a mesh smoothing and remeshing algorithm. Â The IDVs are represented as a spring mass system with their movement controlled via the pressure difference around the valve. Â Appropriate pressure based boundary conditions are used at entry to the third gas pocket and at the exit of the <b>upper</b> <b>shell.</b> An initial analysis of the results has shown {{that it is possible to}} achieve time accurate results of the pressure field throughout the flow domain and also determine the impact of the IDVs on scroll performance. Â The results will also enable a more thorough analysis of the fluid flow and compression process inside the scroll in order to improve its performance...|$|R
