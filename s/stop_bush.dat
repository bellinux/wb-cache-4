2500|$|Soon {{after the}} inauguration of Bush as {{president}} in January 2001, many liberal academics became worried that he would begin packing the federal judiciary with conservative jurists. Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman wrote {{an article in the}} February 2001 edition of the liberal magazine The American Prospect that encouraged the use of the filibuster to <b>stop</b> <b>Bush</b> from placing any nominee on the Supreme Court during his first term. In addition, law professors Cass Sunstein (University of Chicago) and Laurence Tribe (Harvard), along with Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center, counseled Senate Democrats in April 2001 [...] "to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever." [...] Specifically, they said, [...] "there was no obligation to confirm someone just because they are scholarly or erudite." ...|$|E
5000|$|Darman was {{regarded}} as provocative and intelligent by Washington insiders, but was criticized by some economists for being too focused on the budget deficit and was sometimes blamed for convincing Bush to renege on his promise of [...] "Read my lips: No new taxes", which is widely believed to have contributed to Bush's defeat in the election of 1992. Darman had previously tried to <b>stop</b> <b>Bush</b> from making the promise during the 1988 campaign.|$|E
5000|$|There are differing {{accounts}} as to {{what happened}} next. From interviews in 1978 and a contemporary Dallas newspaper, Durham says the sheriff called farmer Jim Stephens and asked him to <b>stop</b> <b>Bush.</b> He found him and ordered him to stop, but Bush ran into a cornfield. Stephens followed, shooting and killing him. According to the same Dallas Morning News of July 13 and 14, [...] "armed white citizens" [...] hunted down Bush, killing the 60-year-old man in a cornfield south of town.|$|E

5000|$|The {{open letter}} {{was part of}} the {{discussion}} on protest tactics with regard to civil disobedience and possible confrontation with the police at APEC protests. According to a Green Left report of a <b>Stop</b> <b>Bush</b> Coalition meeting on 30 April [...] "members of the anarchist group Mutiny, the student-based Solidarity group and the International Socialist Organisation argued for, and won, a motion to remove the line 'Join the peaceful protest at APEC' from a poster advertising the rally." [...] The motion was opposed by members of Resistance, the Socialist Alliance and Socialist Alternative.|$|E
50|$|In one of {{his last}} public statements, Berrigan said,The American people are, more and more, making their voices heard against Bush and his warrior clones. Bush and his minions slip out of control, {{determined}} to go to war, determined to go it alone, determined to endanger the Palestinians further, determined to control Iraqi oil, determined to ravage further a suffering people and their shattered society. The American people can <b>stop</b> <b>Bush,</b> can yank his feet closer to the fire, can banish the war makers from Washington D.C., can turn this society around and restore it to faith and sanity.|$|E
5000|$|Bush: a loyal sheepdog {{who lived}} with Cleo in the music shop. Unfortunately due to his bushy hair-do, {{most of the time}} when Riff-Raff would break in to take Cleo out, Bush would end up running into various musical {{instruments}} trying to <b>stop</b> him. <b>Bush</b> was voiced by Danny Wells.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 110th Congress in January 2007, President Bush did not renominate Boyle, Myers, Haynes and Wallace in an attempt at reconciliation with the Democrats. [...] However, that did not <b>stop</b> many <b>Bush</b> judicial nominees from being blocked in committee by the new Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy. Among those stalled in committee until their nominations lapsed were appellate nominees Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad, Steve A. Matthews and Glen E. Conrad.|$|R
5000|$|After {{concerns}} from riders {{of constant}} overcrowding of the trains on the N Judah line, Muni debuted an express bus route called the NX Judah Express on June 13, 2011. [...] Starting {{off as a}} pilot program, the NX (stylized as Nx) was intended to relieve overcrowding during rush hours every ten minutes. It follows {{the western end of}} the N Judah route from Ocean Beach to 19th Avenue, then operates nonstop from there to the Financial District where it <b>stops</b> at <b>Bush</b> and Montgomery Streets.|$|R

40|$|Native {{plant species}} were {{recorded}} {{on a small}} mown remnant of Blue Gum High Forest in Observatory Park, Pennant Hills, in northwestern Sydney, in 1979 and 1988. In 1989 an area was set aside in the Park, in which mowing was <b>stopped</b> and <b>bush</b> regeneration commenced and is ongoing. Native species were recorded 5 times over the following 11 years, during which time the number of native species recorded rose from 47 to 126. The result demonstrates the potential for mown bushland sites containing native species to regenerate with appropriate treatment...|$|R
5000|$|On 10 June 2013 Myanma Airways flight UB309 from Mawlamyine, Myanmar {{carrying}} four {{crew members}} and 60 passengers swerved off the runway upon landing at Kawthaung. The plane {{came to a}} <b>stop</b> in <b>bushes</b> about 200 feet {{to the west of}} the runway, with smoke coming from the left side propeller housing and the propellers on both wings damaged. There were no injuries. It is possible the captain was too early in switching the nosewheel steering to the 'taxi' mode during the landing roll and lost directional control. A similar incident occurred in December 2011.|$|R

60|$|They {{started in}} another half-hour, and pushed {{on through the}} forest {{for a week or}} two. Then Ormsgill made a {{traverse}} which cost him several days to reach the vicinity of Nares' station. He <b>stopped</b> at a <b>bush</b> village, and was told there that the station was occupied by black soldiers from San Roque. When they heard it Ormsgill quietly looked at Nares.|$|R
60|$|Thirlwell nodded. The rivers {{were frozen}} and canoeing was <b>stopped,</b> while the <b>bush</b> was deep in fresh, loose snow. It {{would be a}} long and strenuous {{business}} to break a trail to the south, and in winter the mine was often cut off from the settlements. Provisions sometimes ran short, but Scott found it hard to refuse the starving Indians a share of his supplies.|$|R
50|$|AAC hosted {{multiple}} distinguished visitors. In 1989 President George <b>Bush</b> <b>stopped</b> at Elmendorf {{en route}} to Japan for the state funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito and addressed a crowd of over 7,000 in Hangar Five.

5000|$|On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler {{from the}} Falun Gong spiritual {{movement}} entered the US White House grounds {{as a reporter}} and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for Chinese President Hu Jintao.

CNN and BBC feeds of Hu's visit were interrupted by state censors in China, blacking out the protester's action.|$|R
50|$|After 9/11, the Bush {{administration}} decided upon {{a decisive}} military action {{to punish the}} government of Afghanistan, which harbored the leaders of al-Qaeda.

On September 14, Congress passed a resolution called the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing the president to use the military against those responsible for the attacks. On October 6, 2001 Bush authorized the invasion of Afghanistan.|$|R
60|$|Then the woman--for {{it was a}} woman--advanced slowly towards us, and as {{she came}} we {{saw that she was}} draped in graveclothes. Presently she lifted her head and the {{moonlight}} fell full upon her face. Now Montezuma groaned aloud and I groaned, for we saw that the face was the thin pale face of the princess Papantzin--Papantzin who had lain four days in the grave. On she came toward us, gliding like one who walks in her sleep, till she <b>stopped</b> before the <b>bush</b> in the shadow of which we stood. Now Papantzin, or the ghost of Papantzin, looked at us with blind eyes, that is with eyes that were open and yet did not seem to see.|$|R
5000|$|Ahead of the 2004 election, the State of Florida attempted, but {{ultimately}} canceled, a second voter purge described as [...] "botched." [...] In 2004, a lawsuit forced {{the state to}} make public a list of 47,000 potential felons on the voting rolls; the Miami Herald reported in July 2004 that more than 2,000 names were incorrectly listed, and due to a database flaw, almost all Hispanic felons were omitted from the list. Less than {{two weeks after the}} list became public, the state <b>stopped</b> the initiative; <b>Bush</b> stated at the time that [...] "Not including Hispanic felons that may be voters on the list...was an oversight and a mistake...And we accept responsibility and that's why we're pulling it back." ...|$|R

60|$|Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck stole up {{the hill}} toward the home of Reddy Fox. As they drew near, they crept from one bunch of grass to another and from <b>bush</b> to <b>bush,</b> <b>stopping</b> behind each to look and listen. They were not taking any chances. Johnny Chuck was not much afraid of Reddy Fox, for he had whipped him once, but {{he was afraid of}} old Granny Fox. Peter Rabbit was afraid of both. The nearer he got to the home of Reddy Fox, the more anxious and nervous he grew. You see, Reddy Fox had played so many tricks to try and catch Peter that Peter was not quite sure that this was not another trick. So he kept a sharp watch in every direction, ready to run at the least sign of danger.|$|R
50|$|Having boxed {{occasionally}} since 1984, Bush won {{his first}} title in the sport on February 3, 1994 by defeating Lynn Jackson via technical knockout in round ten in Virginia Beach for the USBA Southern Light Middleweight (-69.9 kg/154 lb) belt.

[...] Bush said that the methods used by the military are designed for interrogating [...] "lawful combatants captured on the battlefield", not the [...] "hardened terrorists" [...] normally questioned by the CIA. [...] "If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the Field Manual, we could lose vital information from senior al Qaida terrorists, and that could cost American lives", Bush said.|$|R
5000|$|The {{controversial}} {{incident was}} {{set in motion by}} John E. Sweeney, a New York Republican who was nicknamed [...] "Congressman Kick-Ass" [...] by President Bush for his work in Florida. [...] Sweeney defended his actions by arguing that his aim was not to stop the hand recount but to restore the process to public view. [...] Some Bush supporters did acknowledge they hoped the recount would end. [...] "We were trying to <b>stop</b> the recount; <b>Bush</b> had already won," [...] said Evilio Cepero, a reporter for WAQI, an influential Spanish talk radio station in Miami. [...] "We were urging people to come downtown and support and protest this injustice." [...] A Republican lawyer commented, [...] "People were pounding on the doors, but they had an absolute right to get in."
