40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{languages in}} a free algebra which has a binary associative operation called the <b>series</b> <b>product.</b> We define automata operating in these algebras and rational expressions, and we show that their expressive powers coincide (a Kleene theorem). We also show that this expressive power equals that of algebraic recognizability (a Myhill-Nerode theorem). This generalizes the work of Thatcher and Wright. The first equivalence continues to hold when conditions such as associativity and commutativity are imposed on the term operations, but recognizability is weaker {{when one of the}} term operations (other than the <b>series</b> <b>product)</b> is associative. We also consider languages which have a bound on the number of nested occurrences of certain designated term operations and get both the equivalences mentioned above. This generalizes our earlier work and answers a question left open therein. 1 Automata form one of the most commonly used computing device, from their histor [...] ...|$|R
