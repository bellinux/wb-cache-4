40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} of power system {{has become more}} difficult than earlier because power system are operated closer to the security limit, environmental constraints restrict the expansion of transmission network, the need for long distance power transfer has increased and fewer operator are engaged in the <b>supervision</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of power system. Voltage instability has become major concern in many power systems. The voltage levels of the system changes when there is change in load and the drop in the load voltage leads to an increased demand for the reactive power that, if not provided by the power system leads to a further decline in the bus voltage. This decline eventually leads to a progressive rapid decline of voltage at that location, which may have a cascading effect on neighboring regions that causes voltage collapse. In this paper, a FACTS controller such as Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is used to maintain the voltage within the limits. STATCOM will either supply the reactive power or extract the reactive power...|$|R

This paper presents a novel line stability index (NLSI) referred to a line initiated from the voltage quadratic equation at the sending and resaving end of a representation of a 2 -bus system. The line index in the interconnected system in which the value that is closed to one indicates that the line has reached its instability limit which could cause sudden voltage drop to the corresponding bus caused by the active and reactive load variation. The proposed index consider both active and reactive power to investigate the voltage stability because this index provides more precise results than those which consider only reactive power. To indicate the ability of proposed index, NEW ENGLAND 30 bus is utilized and simulation results show good conformity with the other stability index that proposed in literature.

30|$|Consequently, {{responsible}} authorities particularly municipalities and landfill operators nationwide are facing difficulty {{in dealing with}} staggering amount of MSW to dispose it in a sustainable way. In addition, the selection for ideal and feasible method in controlling the disposal of high quantities of MSW at economical costs that can avoid environmental damages are difficult to be decided due to various deliberations {{need to be made}} (Umar et al. 2010). Conventionally, landfilling of solid waste has been the most preferred method for solid waste disposal due to technical feasibility, ease of <b>operation,</b> minimum <b>supervisions</b> <b>and</b> low <b>operation</b> expenditure. In most countries, landfilling is the most acceptable means for eliminating MSW which favors to the technology exploitation and capital cost (Renou et al. 2008).While most of the landfills nowadays equipped with a level three sanitary systems, many developing countries are still struggling to equip state of the art facilities at the landfill. For example, there are 261 landfills in Malaysia whereby more than 80  % of them are being controlled tipping or open dumping practice. This {{is due to the fact}} that it obscures lower cost of <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> maintenance compared to the other established techniques (incineration and advanced landfill system) (Halim et al. 2010 a). Unfortunately, this practice has caused excessive generation of leachate whereby if it is not treated and safely disposed, landfill leachate could be a potential source of surface and ground water contamination, as it may percolate through soils and subsoils, causing pollution to receiving waters (Aziz et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{treatment}} of waste by incineration is considered an ultimate solution {{in order to get}} rid of waste properly by using the combustible properties of waste and transforming them into inert form and gaseous emission, with the main advantage of a huge reduction in mass and volume of treated waste, destruction of the dangerous components in waste, and obtaining green and clean energy from the exothermal reaction from the completed combustion process. In order to achieve the main goal of incineration, a good design, construction, <b>supervision,</b> <b>and</b> intensive <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> maintenance must be taken into account, especially for the small-scale incinerator. This research will deal with the green, innovative, and eco design and manufacturing technology of a 1 -ton per batch municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator. The concept design of the incinerator will focus on the design of the feeding process where only one batch of waste will be discharged into the combustion chamber at one time instead of the semi-feed process, as found in the conventional incinerator. This will ease the operation of the operator and reduce the operating cost. Moreover, the innovative design includes the redesign of combustion air injection into either the primary or secondary combustion chamber in order to achieve the 3 Ts of combustion (time, temperature. and turbulence). This design can eliminate the use of an auxiliary burner in the primary combustion chamber. Rethinking the innovative design of using recirculation hot flue gas for preheating of wet garbage in order to pre-dry the waste before combustion is also taken into account. The manufacturing process of the wall composition as well as other parts of the incinerator are also examined...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} into causes of LX accidents have identified inappropriate or inadequate human behaviour {{as the main}} source of the problem. Human factors play an important role for both the road and the rail. Violations of traffic regulations, disregard of warning signals, and trespassing by road vehicle drivers and pedestrians contribute to most of the fatalities. In terms of rail, staff with safety related responsibilities (i.e. manually operated LXs, warnings given by train drivers, <b>supervision,</b> <b>and</b> fall back <b>operations)</b> are particularly vulnerable to human errors. Therefore, design of new technological solutions intended to minimise the impact of human behaviour ought to be based on an analysis of human factors in the context of limiting safety risks at LXs. Such an approach is expected to produce a twofold benefit: it will help increase people’s awareness of risk at LXs and it will minimise the impact of intentional and unintentional hazardous human behaviour. The solution suggested {{at the end of this}} article will consider the highest operational risk at automatic LXs with warning devices and half barriers. This solution can be applied to other LX types.|$|R
