With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with our recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simple approach {{in assessing the}} amount of seismic mitigation of passive <b>seismic</b> <b>protection</b> of steel skeletal type structures. The amount of <b>seismic</b> <b>protection</b> is {{expressed in terms of}} reduction in the amplitudes of kinematical parameters associated to seismically induced oscillatory motion of the analyzed structures. The introduced parameter for assessing <b>seismic</b> <b>protection</b> is associated to the mitigation interval of steel skeletal structures equipped with passive protection. This interval is expressed in terms of natural vibration periods of the structure and is considered from the moment when the vibratory motion is initiated until the moment the motion reaches its steady state. During this time interval, a clear picture of vibratory motion is exhibited: length of the interval, number of vibratory cycles, amplitudes, their variation/decrease in time, the end of transitory motion {{and the beginning of the}} (short, nevertheless) pseudo – steady state motion. The paper proposes a time variable parameter that synthesizes all these features of the transitory motion. The length of this interval and its descending slope emphasize the effectiveness of <b>seismic</b> <b>protection.</b> The shorter the interval and the greater its descending slope, the more effective the associated <b>seismic</b> <b>protection.</b> Time history type analyses have been carried out on several sets of skeletal steel structures.

40|$|Abstract. On March 11, 2011, an {{earthquake}} and subsequent tsunamis off the Pacific coastline of Japan’s Tohoku region caused widespread devastation in Japan. As of June 10, 2016, {{it is reported}} that a total of 15, 894 people lost their lives and 2, 558 people are still unaccounted for. In Fukushima Prefecture, approximately 100, 000 people are still obliged to live away from their homes due to the earthquake and tsunami {{as well as the}} Fukushima Daiichi accident. On the day, the earthquake and tsunami caused severe damages to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) ’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (NPS). All the units in operation, namely Units 1 to 3, were automatically shut down on <b>seismic</b> reactor <b>protection</b> system trips but the earthquake led to the loss of all off-site electrical power supplies to that site. The subsequent tsunami inundated the site up to 4 to 5 m above its ground level and caused, in the end, the loss of core cooling function in Units 1 to 3, resulting in severe core damages and containment vessel failures in these three units. Hydrogen was released from the containment vessels, leading to explosions in the reactor buildings of Units 1, 3 and 4. Radioactive materials were released to the atmosphere and were deposited on the land and in the ocean. One of the most important lessons learned is an importance to prevent such large scale common cause failures due to extreme natural events. This leads to a conclusion that application of the defense-in-depth philosophy be enhanced because the defense-in-depth philosophy has been and continues to be an effective way to account for uncertainties associated with risks. From the human and organizational viewpoints, the final report from the Investigation Committee of the Government pointed out so-called “safety myth” that existed among nuclear operators including TEPCO as well as the government, that serious severe accidents could never occur in nuclear power plants in Japan. After the accident, the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) was established on September 19, 2012. The NRA very urgently developed and issued the new regulatory requirements on July 8, 2014, taking into the account the lessons learned from the accident. It is noted that the NRA issued the Statement of Nuclear Safety Culture on May 27, 2015 which clearly expressed the NRA’s commitment to break with the safety myth. This paper briefly presents the outline of the Fukushima Daiichi accident and summarizes the major lessons learned having been drawn and safety enhancements having been done in Japan for the purpose of giving inputs to the discussions to be taken place in the Special Invited Session “Fukushima, 5 years after”...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{settles in}} the {{framework}} of the dynamic modelling, seismic mitigation and permanent health monitoring of equipment in critical facilities. The main objective is to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness of innovative mitigation Technologies including: the passive isolation of a single equipment (equipment isolation systems); the passive isolation of a raised floor, on which a group of several equipment is anchored (isolated raised-floor systems); a non-conventional Tuned Mass Damper (TMD), realized by converting a large mass already present on the structure, e. g. the mass of an equipment, into a tuned mass, {{in order to reduce the}} structural response. The area of research is believed to have the potential for a wide application, since a still limited number of authors has addressed the theoretical and technical issues associated with the <b>seismic</b> design and <b>protection</b> of equipment. As a result, international seismic codes and standards also appear to be inadequate in this regard. Furthermore, the proposed technologies give the opportunity of addressing topics of significant scientific interest: the analysis of the dynamic interaction between an equipment and its supporting structure, generally neglected in current Literature and seismic codes; the definition of reduced-order generalized models, introduced for design purposes; the constitutive modelling of nonlinear hysteretic isolation systems; the dynamic analysis of non-proportionally damped systems and nonlinear hysteretic systems; the stochastic analysis of the dynamic response, given the probabilistic nature of the earthquake excitation; the proper definition of energy indices to assess, in a synthetic and effective way, the performance of the proposed mitigation technologies. A distinctive aspect of the work is eventually given by the use of shaking table tests on reduced scale models, for the sake of dynamic identification and seismic analysis.
