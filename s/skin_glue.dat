They discovered that the paint contained pigments such as vermilion (red mercury sulfide) and lead white (lead carbonate). These were mixed {{with a range of}} binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> or egg), and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies. Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted {{in the middle of the}} 7th century. It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of oil painting, possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries. The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India.|$|E
5000|$|Rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> is {{considered}} to be a major cause of cracking in oil paintings by most modern conservators. Because the glue is hygroscopic, it continually absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, causing the glue to swell and shrink as ambient humidity levels change. Over many humidity cycles, this repeated flexing causes the brittle oil paint to crack. Modern substitutes for rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> are available, such as Gamblin’s PVA size [...] and Golden Acrylics’ GAC100. These substitutes do not have the hygroscopic properties of rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue,</b> while still being very slightly hygroscopic, and should not cause the damage to oil paints that rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> does. However, these modern replacements do not stiffen and tighten the canvas as well as rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> does, so some artists still prefer to use rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue.</b>|$|E

50|$|Stapling is {{much faster}} than suturing by hand, and also more {{accurate}} and consistent. Staples are primarily used in bowel and lung surgery, because staple lines are more consistent and therefore less likely to leak blood, air or bowel contents. Still, several randomized controlled trials have shown {{no significant difference in}} bowel leakage after anastomoses performed either manually with suture by experienced surgeons, or after mechanical anastomoses with staples. In skin closure, dermal adhesives (<b>skin</b> <b>glues)</b> are also an increasingly common alternative.|$|R

50|$|Rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> is {{an animal}} glue created by {{prolonged}} boiling of animal connective tissue. Rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> {{can be bought}} in powder form or in larger chunks. Preparation involves using the correct proportion of water to glue to achieve the correct consistency and strength. It should be heated to {{just short of the}} boiling point. Too much heat results in a product with reduced adhesive qualities. Manufacturers of rabbit, and cow & horse hide glue recommend dissolving at 140 - 145 F.|$|E
50|$|Cyanoacrylate is {{the generic}} name for {{cyanoacrylate}} based fast-acting glues such as methyl-2-cyanoacrylate, ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (commonly sold under trade names like Superglue and Krazy <b>Glue)</b> and n-butyl-cyanoacrylate. <b>Skin</b> <b>glues</b> like Indermil and Histoacryl {{were the first}} medical grade tissue adhesives to be used, and these are composed of n-butyl cyanoacrylate. These worked well but had the disadvantage of having to be stored in the refrigerator, were exothermic so they stung the patient, and the bond was brittle. Nowadays, the longer chain polymer, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, is the preferred medical grade glue. It is available under various trade names, such as LiquiBand, SurgiSeal, FloraSeal, and Dermabond. These have the advantages of being more flexible, making a stronger bond, and being easier to use. The longer side chain types, for example octyl and butyl forms, also reduce tissue reaction.|$|R
40|$|Partial or {{complete}} dislodgement of intravascular catheters remains {{a significant problem}} in hospitals despite current securement methods. Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives (TA) are currently used to close skin wounds {{as an alternative to}} sutures. These adhesives have high mechanical strength and can remain in situ for several days. This study investigated in vitro use of TAs in securing intravascular catheters (IVC). We compared two adhesives for interaction with IVC material, comparing <b>skin</b> <b>glues</b> with current securement methods in terms of their ability to prevent IVC dislodgement and to inhibit microbial growth. Two TAs (Dermabond®, Ethicon Inc. and Histoacryl®, B. Braun) and three removal agents (Remove™, paraffin and acetone) were tested for interaction with IVC material by use of tensile testing. TAs were also compared against two polyurethane (standard and bordered) dressings (Tegaderm™ 1624 and 1633, 3 M Australia Pty Ltd) and an external stabilisation device (Statlock®, Bard Medical, Covington) against control (unsecured IVCs) for ability to prevent pull-out of 16 G peripheral IVCs from newborn fresh porcine skin. Agar media containing pH-sensitive dye was used to assess antimicrobial properties of TAs and polyurethane dressings to inhibit growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Neither TA weakened the IVCs (P > 0. 05). Of removal agents, only acetone was associated with a significant decrease in IVC strength (...|$|R

Since the brittle tiles could not flex with the underlying vehicle <b>skin,</b> they were <b>glued</b> to Nomex felt Strain Isolation Pads (SIPs) with RTV silicone adhesive, which were in turn glued to the orbiter skin. These isolated the tiles from the orbiter's structural deflections and expansions.|$|R
40|$|Fibrin glue {{has been}} widely used as an {{adhesive}} in plastic and reconstructive surgery. This article reviews {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of its use with skin grafts and tissue-engineered <b>skin</b> substitutes. Fibrin <b>glue</b> has been shown to improve the percentage of skin graft take, especially when associated with difficult grafting sites or sites associated with unavoidable movement. Evidence also suggests improved hemostasis and a protective effect resulting in reduced bacterial infection. Fibrin, associated with fibronectin, has been shown to support keratinocyte and fibroblast growth both in vitro and in vivo, and may enhance cellular motility in the wound. When used as a delivery system for cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts, fibrin glue may provide similar advantages to those proven with conventional <b>skin</b> grafts. Fibrin <b>glue</b> has also been shown to be a suitable delivery vehicle for exogenous growth factors that may in the future be used to accelerate wound healing. (Plast. Reconstr.

5000|$|Sizing is a {{term used}} for any {{substance}} which is applied to a surface before gilding {{in order to ensure}} adhesion of the thin gold leaf to the substrate. Egg whites have often been used as sizing; the Ancient Egyptians sometimes used blood.

50|$|Hot melt {{adhesive}} (HMA), {{also known}} as hot glue, {{is a form of}} thermoplastic adhesive that is commonly supplied in solid cylindrical sticks of various diameters, designed to be melted in an electric hot glue gun. The gun uses a continuous-duty heating element to melt the plastic glue, which the user pushes through the gun either with a mechanical trigger mechanism on the gun, or with direct finger pressure. The glue squeezed out of the heated nozzle is initially hot enough to burn and even blister <b>skin.</b> The <b>glue</b> is tacky when hot, and solidifies in a few seconds to one minute. Hot melt adhesives can also be applied by dipping or spraying.|$|R
50|$|Bags {{cut from}} larger {{materials}} are usually saddle-stitched {{with an extra}} strip folded over the seam and stitched (for <b>skin</b> bags) or <b>glued</b> (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where limbs and the head joined {{the body of the}} whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.|$|R
40|$|Load-bearing {{capacity}} of studs of timber-frame houses can be greatly improved if {{the contribution of}} wall-covering material and insulation is also taken into account (scheme C in figure 1). This principle is use to design a new construction principle for industrially produced dwellings [Moonen 1998]. In this paper the results are presented from experiments to prove the validity of this scheme. In total 16 wall elements with slimline studs and a very thin <b>skin</b> <b>glued</b> to the stud and insulation are tested under compression. The experiments are intended to investigate the minimum thickness of the skin to force the stud to buckle perpendicular to the wall plane. Therefore the slenderness of the studs and also {{the thickness of the}} skin is varied in the test specimen. The composition of the tested wall elements is predetermined by commercial available elements (figure 2 and table 1) because the dimensions of these panels suited well in the scope of the research. And by using ready-made panels we were able to concentrate on the structural behavior of the panels instead of production issues of glued surfaces. These panels are in the Netherlands common used as roof boarding with integrated insulation. The experiments confirmed the chosen scheme and indicated that a 3 mm (1 / 8 inch) skin is amply sufficient to support studs with a slenderness-ratio of 1 : 6 (width : height), forcing the stud to buckle across the strongest axis. The thin skin is also able to transfer 10 - 50 % of the load to the adjacent stud. The test-results have good prospects to develop new elements for timber frame houses. The elements to be developed will lead up to a reduction of structural materials and an improvement of thermal insulation and are expressly tailored to industrial production with improved working conditions...|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{oil painting}} as {{practiced by the}} Renaissance painter, <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> was used to coat the canvas. This is necessary because the linseed oil that forms the base of most oil paint contains linolenic acid that will destroy the canvas fibers over time. Though this did help to seal the canvas, they still had to cover it with another layer of a substance similar to paint {{in order to protect}} it. The primary purpose of Rabbit-skin glue is to stretch the canvas.|$|E

50|$|The {{excavations}} {{here are}} considered {{to be one of the}} most conspicuous Pre-Pottery Neolithic assemblages ever found in the Levant. The Find consisted of wooden artifacts, fragments of baskets and plaster assemblages. The objects found in the cave included: rope baskets, embroidered fabrics, nets, wooden arrow heads, bone and flint utensils, and decorated human skulls. Originally, these objects were thought be covered in asphalt form near construction projects, it was actually determined that the objects were covered in ancient glue, dated to around 8310-8110 B.C.E.. The glue was determined to be collagen based and believed to be from animal <b>skins.</b> The <b>glue</b> that coated the objects were believed to waterproof the objects or used as an adhesive. Glue similar to this was found in Egypt, but the glue found in Nahal Hemar are two times as old as the glue in Egypt.|$|R
40|$|Biomimetic dopamine-conjugated polyaspartamides as novel {{adhesive}} {{materials were}} synthesized and characterized. These modified polyaspartamides contain three different groups combined with dopamine (DOPA), i. e., γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), ethanolamine (EA) and octylamine (OA), which {{are referred to}} as PolyAspAm (DOPA/GABA), PolyAspAm(DOPA/EA) and PolyAspAm(DOPA/OA), respectively. These three water-swollen polymer glues show good adhesion (0. 1 ~ 0. 4 MPa) with various daily-life materials (aluminum foil, glass and paper) as well as some plastic substrates (PET and PMMA). Compared to the polymers with more hydrophilic groups (GABA and EA), the polymer glue with the hydrophobic alkyl group (OA) exhibited higher adhesive strength values on most substrates. In addition, when applied to biological porcine <b>skin,</b> these <b>glues</b> demonstrated adhesion of values of 15 ~ 20 kPa with EA- and OA-conjugated polymers.

5000|$|Traditional artists' canvas is {{made from}} linen, but less {{expensive}} cotton fabric has gained popularity. The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a [...] "stretcher" [...] or [...] "strainer". The {{difference between the two}} names is that stretchers are slightly adjustable, while strainers are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a [...] "size" [...] to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of animal glue (modern painters will use rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue)</b> as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a gesso, a mixture of glue and chalk.|$|E
50|$|The Ellises' {{interests}} and exploits became intertwined with his own, sometimes inspiring characters, situations or details in his paintings. Racheal's costumes often appear in Curtis paintings for example. Janie Ellis prepared {{many of the}} bonded plywood and masonite boards that Curtis painted on, making the base layer of gesso from a fine powder mixed with rabbit <b>skin</b> <b>glue</b> and cooked to the right consistency {{over a period of}} hours. The gesso was applied in alternating directions in forty thin layers and sanded to a smooth finish. Curtis sketched his compositions with a thin wash of pigment and worked up the surface gradually, in the manner of traditional painters. Most of his paintings are glazed to preserve the surface and to enhance the color of the pigments and quality of light. After 1960 his frames were made by Sandra Kempner, who sought out unusual materials to enhance the qualities of the paintings. In some cases she or Rachael and Janie Ellis found parts of furniture that became frames for Curtis' paintings.|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} flow control {{has picked up}} pace {{over the past decade}} or so, on the promise of {{real-time}} distributed control on turbulent scales being realizable in the near future. This promise is due to the micromachining technology that emerged in the 1980 s and developed at an amazing speed through the 1990 s. In lab experiments, so called micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) that incorporate the entire detection-decision-actuation process on a single chip, have been batch processed in large numbers and assembled into flexible <b>skins</b> for <b>gluing</b> onto body-fluid interfaces for drag reduction purposes. Control of fluid flows span a wide variety of specialities. In Part I of this tutorial, we focus on the problem of reducing drag in channel and pipe flows by stabilizing the parabolic equilibrium profile using boundary feedback control. The control strategics used for this problem include classical control, based on the Nyquist criteria, and various optimal control techniques (H 2, H-Infinity), as well as applications of Lyapunov stability theory...|$|R
