40|$|One of the {{potential}} environmental issues associated with dredging in the marine environment is the increase of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) by generation and dispersion of sediment plumes. This can be mitigated by source control or by the installation of containment barriers like silt screens. This article focusses on hanging silt screens and describes: 1. The decision process for deployment of hanging silt screens: Decisions on the necessity of environmental mitigation measures and subsequently on the viability of <b>silt</b> <b>screen</b> deployment should be made using a receptor-based approach. This starts with the identification of (ecological) receptors and related impact levels, understanding the local environment, checking compatibility with work methods and determining cost and schedule impacts. 2. Effectiveness of hanging silt screens: Local hydrodynamic and morphological circumstances determine the effectiveness of silt screens. Results of extensive numerical modeling tests (3 D and 2 DH) supported by hands-on experiences from dredging projects are {{used to describe the}} effect of hanging silt screens on the distribution of SSC in the water under different conditions. Results show that when deploying silt screens it is important to realise that silt screens are flexible curtains; they do not block the flow. Therefore suspended sediments generated at a dredging project will always pass the hanging screen vertically and/or horizontally. Silt screens can only reduce the distribution of SSC by settling if local hydrodynamic conditions are favourable. 3. Adaptive management strategies as an alternative for silt screens: When local conditions are not optimal for deployment of silt screens, alternative mitigation measure, such as adaptive monitoring strategies, can be used to manage SSC around dredging projects.

40|$|Dredging and {{reclamation}} {{works are}} known to generate significant amounts of turbidity. In most coastal zones around the world, the resulting clouds of suspended fine sediment bring along environmental risks. Dredging contractors take mitigating measures to prevent free spreading of turbidity, which is usually also demanded by their clients and the local authorities. One possibility is the application of hanging <b>silt</b> <b>screens,</b> which are flexible, virtually impermeable screens. They are intended to divert the sediment-laden current towards the opening between the screen's lower edge and the bottom, which is thought to result in rapid settling of the dredging spill. The effectiveness of hanging <b>silt</b> <b>screens</b> when subjected to cross flow is doubted by those parties experienced with their application, because sediment can still pass the screen by horizontal or vertical diversion (around the screen’s side edges and below the screen’s lower edge respectively). Hence this research aims to obtain insight into the most important processes determining transport of suspended sediment {{in the vicinity of}} hanging <b>silt</b> <b>screens</b> and to determine the effectiveness of hanging <b>silt</b> <b>screens</b> under varying circumstances. A large series of numerical simulations with varying flow velocity, screen height, screen width, settling velocity of the sediment, water depth and upstream sediment concentration profile is conducted. The process of vertical diversion is investigated in a 3 D modeling approach using large eddy simulation (LES). Performance of this numerical model is validated by means of laboratory experiments. The process of horizontal diversion is assessed with a two-dimensional horizontal (2 DH) modelling approach. It appears that the turbulent structures resulting from flow separation at the screen’s lower edge give rise to intense downstream mixing. This process prevents the screen from being effective when compared to a reference situation (without a screen) in terms of reducing the environmental threat posed by suspended fine sediment. The figure illustrates this finding. Furthermore, significant amounts of horizontal flow diversion occur when lateral restrictions are absent. This counteracts the intended use of <b>silt</b> <b>screens</b> as a vertical current deflector. Finally, flow contraction around the screen’s lower edge causes high near-bed flow velocities, which enhances erosion if erodible bed material is available. Efforts should be made to convince all parties involved in dredging practice of these findings, so that protection of the marine environment can make another step forward.

Contrary to popular belief that Semakau Landfill would be another dirty and smelly landfill, the care put into the design and operational work at the landfill has ensured that the site is clean, free of smell and scenic. During construction, <b>silt</b> <b>screens</b> were installed {{to ensure that the}} corals were not affected during the reclamation works.

50|$|In {{rural areas}} {{the first line}} of defense is to {{maintain}} land cover and prevent soil erosion in the first place. The second line of defense is to trap the material before it reaches the stream network (known as sediment control). In urban areas the defense is to keep land uncovered for as short a time as possible during construction, and to use <b>silt</b> <b>screens</b> to prevent the sediment from getting released in water bodies. During dredging the spill can be minimized but not eliminated completely through the way the dredger is designed and operated. If the material is deposited on land, efficient sedimentation basins can be constructed. If it is dumped in relatively deep water there will be a significant spill during dumping, but not thereafter, and the spill that does arise will have minimal impact if there are only fine-sediment bottoms nearby.|$|R
40|$|The ROD for {{the former}} Westinghouse plant in Sharon, Pennsylvania issued in February 2003 {{included}} the removal of approximately 4, 000 CY of PCB-contaminated sediment from several locations along the Shenango River to a cleanup goal of 1. 0 mg/kg. Delineation sampling indicated a maximum total PCB concentration of 385 mg/kg, although 97 % of the sediment samples were less than 50 mg/kg, and 88 % of the samples were less than 10 mg/kg. Remediation planning was complicated {{by the presence of}} a 12 MGD drinking water plant with a surface intake less than 150 feet from the remediation areas, along with an active 24 -inch cast iron water line crossing the river underneath the riverbed. Given the water depth and composition of the riverbed, as well as potential flow velocities during high flow periods, it was determined that the best means of protecting the water plant intake during the remediation would be to isolate the excavation areas using sheet piling, with placement of <b>silt</b> <b>screens</b> around the intake as well as downstream of the pile installation areas. In addition, a mobile laboratory was brought on site to provide rapid analysis of surface water samples at quantitation limits of 0. 05 ug/l, in order to provide reassurance to all interested parties that the water supply would not be impacted by the work. 	Remediation commenced in late summer 2004, and to date, more than 1, 600 surface water samples have been collected downstream of active work areas, including more than 680 samples collected directly from the water plant intake. PCBs have been detected in only one of the water samples collected from the intake (0. 07 ug/l), and only 19 other samples collected downstream of work areas were found to contain PCBs (up to 0. 54 ug/l).

40|$|The {{electrical}} energy {{requirements of the}} Maltese Islands are met in their entirety by two oil-fired electrical generation plants. In view of this complete dependence upon fossil fuels, investigations into the prospects of diversifying electrical generation by resorting to renewable energy technologies are particularly relevant. The archipelago has peculiar characteristics such as high population density, comparatively deep coastal waters and an economy based on tourism, manufacturing, marine-sector activities and services that make the integration of wind power generation projects challenging. Local government authorities commissioned the authors to assess the constraints related to wind farm development in a shallow water coastal area, known as is-Sikka l-Bajda, which could present a wind potential worth exploiting, and to recommend adequate mitigation measures to minimize any impacts and conflicts with stakeholders. These constraints include marine navigational aspects, fishing and aquaculture, tourism and other site-specific activities. Environmental constraints exist {{including the fact that}} the site is characterized by extensive seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows, that it is a priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive, and that the site itself is a reef - another priority habitat within the same directive. The proposed near-shore site is also in the vicinity of a protected coastal bird rafting and bird nesting site for the Yelkouan Shearwater species. Submarine noise generation - particularly during the construction phase - is also of concern in view of the regular sighting of marine mammals in Maltese coastal waters. In the site evaluation exercise, another secondary site in the Maltese Islands, located off the north Gozo coast, was also assessed. Mitigation measures specific to the Sikka l-Bajda site proposed by the authors include the deployment of <b>silt</b> curtains, bubble <b>screens</b> and unobtrusive turbine lighting devices and avoiding utilisation of the reef area closest to the protected bird colony. Such measures also relate to the choice of the array design to minimise visual impact and to the period of the year when wind plant construction and deployment should take place to minimize impact on avifaunal populations. By declaring the marine area contiguous to the proposed nearshore wind facility development as off-limits to fishing vessels, a de facto ‘No-take’ Marine Protected Area can also be effectively instituted. One also expects submerged components of the nearshore wind facility to be colonized within a brief period by a diverse fouling community and that the same components act as Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD’s), greatly enhancing fish populations in the area. In view of the current paucity in Mediterranean nearshore wind power facilities, the proposed project could potentially serve as a pilot project for the whole region, and also become a tourist attraction. peer-reviewe...|$|R
