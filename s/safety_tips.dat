40|$|Do {{hospitals}} experience <b>safety</b> <b>tipping</b> {{points as}} utilization increases and if so, {{what are the}} implications for hospital operations management? We argue that <b>safety</b> <b>tipping</b> points occur when managerial escalation policies are exhausted and workload variability buffers are depleted. Front-line clinical staff is forced to ration resources and, at the same time, becomes more error-prone as a result of elevated stress hormone levels. We confirm the existence of <b>safety</b> <b>tipping</b> points for in-hospital mortality using the discharge records of 82, 280 patients across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 256 clinical departments of 83 German hospitals. Focusing on survival during the first seven days following admission, we estimate a mortality tipping point at an occupancy level of 92. 5 %. Among the 17 % of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the tipping point during the first seven days of their hospital stay, high occupancy accounted for one in seven deaths. The existence of a <b>safety</b> <b>tipping</b> point has important implications for hospital management. First, flexible capacity expansion is more cost-effective for safety improvement than rigid capacity, as it will only be used when occupancy reaches the tipping point. In the context of our sample, flexible staffing saves more than 40 % of the cost of a fully staffed capacity expansion, while achieving the same reduction in mortality. Second, reducing the variability of demand by pooling capacity in hospital clusters can greatly increase safety in a hospital system, as it reduces the likelihood that a patient experiences occupancy levels beyond the tipping point. Pooling the capacity of nearby hospitals in our sample reduces the number of deaths due to high occupancy by 34 %...|$|R

500|$|On {{the day of}} Isabel {{moving through}} the state, President George W. Bush {{declared}} 18 counties and 14 independent cities as disaster areas, making residents and business-owners there eligible for federal funding. Additionally, funds were allocated {{for state and local}} governments in the 31 designated jurisdictions to pay 75% of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. Many other jurisdictions were added, based on subsequent damage reports, and by September 22, 99 jurisdictions were eligible for disaster assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided hurricane-related bulletins, including <b>safety</b> <b>tips</b> and the method for removing hazardous materials. By 12days after the passage of the hurricane, FEMA distributed more than 6.3million lbs. (2.9million kg) of ice and [...] of water to areas affected by Isabel. Disaster Recovery Centers, which contain information on the aftermath process, were opened in eight locations and received more than 1,850 inquiries. More than 350 FEMA inspectors visited homes to verify damages caused by Isabel, {{and by the end of}} September 2003 about 12,000 inspections were completed. In response to the power outages, FEMA installed 28 generators at disaster-affected critical public facilities to support life-sustaining community needs. By about four months after the hurricane, 93,139 individuals in the designated areas applied for disaster assistance, while 20,417people visited Disaster Recovery Centers throughout the state. The Small Business Administration approved more than 3,000 low-interest disaster loans from homes and businesses, with the value of the loans totaling $74million (2003USD; $87million 2008USD). The government provided $105million (2003USD; $123million 2008USD) for debris removal, emergency protective services, and permanent work, and approved about $25.9million (2003USD; $30.3million 2008USD) for life-sustaining needs such as water, ice, and generators at critical public facilities. Monetary assistance for temporary rental assistance and minimal home repairs totaled $32million (2003USD; $37million 2008USD), as well.|$|E

40|$|In Fall 2003, the Southern Rockies Ecosystem Project (SREP), in {{partnership}} with the Federal Highway Administration, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), and Colorado State University, initiated Linking Colorado’s Landscapes to identify and prioritize wildlife linkages in the state of Colorado. As the education and outreach component to Linking Colorado’s Landscapes, SREP launched “Colorado Wildlife on the Move,” a driver-awareness campaign. The goal of the campaign was to educate the motoring public in Colorado about the hazard of wildlife moving across roads and to improve driver awareness, thereby reducing the number of collisions with animals. To assess the magnitude of animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs) in the state of Colorado, SREP worked with CDOT to analyze data from 1993 to 2004, identifying where and when the most AVCs occurred. With the help of SREP, CDOT was also able to pull out species-specific AVC data. With this information, SREP designed a media campaign {{in partnership}} with CDOT, the Colorado State Patrol, Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association, and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. The campaign was based on data that identified November as the most dangerous month for drivers and wildlife due to the extremely high number of AVCs. A media event was then timed for the beginning of November to bring greater attention to this issue during this critical time. SREP developed two outreach tools for the event: a driver <b>safety</b> <b>tip</b> sheet and an awareness poster, featuring photographs from famed Colorado wildlife photographers. The campaign was a wild success: all five Denver TV stations were present and the story was aired 12 times on local TV over the next 36 hours. In addition, both local and national papers covered the story. Over the next two months, articles featuring information from the “Colorado Wildlife on the Move” campaign reached over three million people. To date, 58, 000 driver <b>safety</b> <b>tip</b> sheets and 500 posters have been distributed in welcome centers, national parks, and Enterprise Rent-A-Car offices in 85 cities and 175 locations. The tip sheets have already been reprinted three times to meet these needs. Because of the great success of this campaign and the obvious interest and need for additional <b>safety</b> <b>tip</b> sheets, SREP intends to continue its media events and tip sheet distribution on an ongoing basis. Press events will be held in November and June, the two most dangerous months for drivers and wildlife...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Motivated from a basic tip {{for safe}} driving, “Keeping Hands on the Wheel and Eyes on the Road”, this paper {{introduces}} a vision based system for driver activity analysis by observing 3 D movement of driver’s head and hands from multiview video. From {{the results of}} upper body and head pose tracking, semantic descriptions of driver activities are extracted in two steps: First, we determine basic activities of each upper body part (e. g. Two, one, or no hand is on the steering wheel; Head is looking left, straight, or right). Then these basic activities are combined in a fusion step to extract higher level of semantic description of driver activities (e. g. whether the driver is following the above <b>safety</b> <b>tip</b> or not). Our experimental evaluation with real-world street driving shows the promise of applying the proposed system for both post analysis of captured driving data {{as well as for}} real-time driver assistance.
