25|$|Moran's first {{boat was}} {{purchased}} in the 1940s; a 19-foot Chris-Craft. From that point, he was hooked. Boats and entertaining on them was Jim Moran's passion. In his lifetime, he owned more than 200, including models from Burger, Wellcraft Scarab, Hatteras, <b>Sea</b> <b>Ray,</b> Rybovich and multimillion-dollar motor yachts from Feadship. In 1983, he asked Feadship {{to design a}} boat {{large enough to be}} seaworthy for ocean cruising but elegant for entertaining business associates. Over the next 20+ years, Moran commissioned seven more vessels from the company, culminating in the 168' Gallant Lady in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, rural East Tennessee's economy {{relied heavily on}} {{subsistence}} agriculture. In the cities, however, manufacturing was {{the main source of}} prosperity and growth. By 2000, just over 1% of the region's population was employed in agriculture or related industries. As of the 2000 census, manufacturing accounted for roughly 20% of region's jobs, with the largest employers being the Tennessee Valley Authority (based in Knoxville with 12,893 full-time workers), Eastman Chemical in Kingsport (10,000 employees), <b>Sea</b> <b>Ray</b> in Knoxville (3,500 employees), Denso Manufacturing in Maryville and Athens (over 3,000 employees), and Pilot Flying J in Knoxville (with over 550 location nationwide). Health and education services accounted for another 20% of the region's jobs, with major employers being Bluecross-Blueshield of Tennessee (4,144 employees), the Baptist Hospital system in Knoxville (4,000 employees), and the Tennessee Department of Health in Chattanooga (4,000 employees). Tourism and recreational industries account for just under 10% of East Tennessee's workforce, the primary attractions being the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (9 million visitors per year), the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga (one million visitors per year), Zoo Knoxville (over 400,000 visitors per year), and historical sites such as the Museum of Appalachia and Rugby. [...] Other significant employers included the Chattanooga trucking firms U.S. Xpress (8,100 employees) and Covenant Transportation (5,000 employees), and the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge (4,750 employees). Mussel shoals in the upper Tennessee River valley, mainly above Knoxville, constitute the only important source of freshwater pearls in the United States.|$|E

50|$|In {{her book}} Off With Their Heads!: A Serio-Comic Tale Of Hollywood, screenwriter Frances Marion wrote that {{numerous}} people attempted to dissuade Ray from making the film because lengthy costume dramas were not box office draws at the time. Ray {{chose not to}} listen to the advice and, after failing to secure financial backing from a major studio, he put up $500,000 (approximately $ today) of his own money to finance the film. Ray began filming The Courtship of Miles Standish in January 1923 at his namesake studio on Sunset Boulevard. Production costs quickly rose as Ray spent money with abandon. In addition to the $65,000 (approximately $ today) 180-ton replica of the Mayflower that was set on a mechanism to simulate it being on rough <b>seas,</b> <b>Ray</b> also had full sized log cabins built solely for exterior shots. By the end of filming, Ray had invested all of his saving, nearly $2 million (approximately $ today), and borrowed additional funds at a 30% interest rate to finish the film. The film's final budget was estimated at $3 million (approximately $ today).|$|R

60|$|In this {{primitive}} and Homeric truce the week passed by; it consisted {{almost entirely of}} eating, drinking, smoking, talking, and occasionally singing. They wrote their records and cast loose their bottle. They never ascended to the ominous plateau; they had never stood there save for that single embarrassed minute when they had {{had no time to}} take stock of the seascape or the shape of the land. They did not even explore the island; for MacIan was partly concerned in prayer and Turnbull entirely concerned with tobacco; and both these forms of inspiration can be enjoyed by the secluded and even the sedentary. It was on a golden afternoon, the sun sinking over the <b>sea,</b> <b>rayed</b> like the very head of Apollo, when Turnbull tossed off the last half-pint from the emptied Wilkinsonian bottle, hurled the bottle into the sea with objectless energy, and went up to where his sword stood waiting for him on the hill. MacIan was already standing heavily by his with bent head and eyes reading the ground. He had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon. But Turnbull being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene. The consequence of which was that he nearly fell off the rock.|$|R
