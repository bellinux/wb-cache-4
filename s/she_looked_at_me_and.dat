People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled a}} little abstractedly. Then {{she turned to the}} table.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and,</b> {{with that}} {{extraordinary}} penetration {{which used to}} disconcert me, shook her head.|$|E
60|$|The smile left my mother's face. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> attentively.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first time}} I ever saw her, driving her geese {{down the hill}} on the day I came to Four Winds, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the same expression," [...] persisted Anne. [...] "I felt it, {{even in the midst}} of my admiration of her beauty. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> resentfully--she did, indeed, Captain Jim." ...|$|R
60|$|A little forced smile parted her lips. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> kindly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{saw that}} she was putting in a bit of the old drenched-irises stuff.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{paused and}} looked around. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> the pen slipped from my nerveless fingers. I rose to my feet.|$|E
60|$|The color deepened in my mother's face. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{spoke to}} me with a {{severity}} which was rare indeed in my experience of her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> politely, {{having said}} what she {{intended}} to say.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> undecidedly, {{not quite}} {{knowing how to}} take me.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> {{always did}} have the most {{wonderful}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> then away, and her {{beautiful}} blue intelligent eyes told me plainly {{that she did}} not, and that she felt baffled and worried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, isn't it? And {{so early}} in the voyage, too." [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> when I could not forbear a smile of {{appreciation}} she smiled back.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her. She was {{gazing at the}} Ghost. I {{followed}} her gaze, but could see nothing unusual. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I looked inquiry back.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} {{wondering}} how far I were in earnest.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so piteously that I {{was near}} to being unmanned.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a fixed intentness which I found peculiarly irritating.|$|R
6000|$|And in {{the pause}} I looked at her, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> dared to look. And my blood ran fire. By Odin, {{this was a}} woman! ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was brought}} into the parlour with many tokens of welcome, and there {{formally}} recognized my mother as a new and near relation. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> hesitated. I {{felt that}} I was paying the double penalty {{of being a}} young man, and of being perhaps a little too eager as well.|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} come out of a reverie. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> attentively as I put {{the letter}} away in my pocket-book.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, doubtfully, {{and then}} she shook her head.|$|R
60|$|She took up my {{hand and}} kissed it. This so {{surprised}} my spirits that I cried out like one hurt. The colour came strong in her face, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> nodded.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} fist at Mr. Bundercombe, {{who seemed to}} have become still smaller. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> at Reggie, who was {{standing}} with his mouth wide open. She fixed upon us as her audience.|$|E
60|$|The sub-mother {{looked out}} of the window, which opened upon {{little more than the}} once husband-sheltering apple-tree, and then, after a general glance around the room, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> for the first time {{addressed}} me.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her, {{astonished}} as she {{had been}} astonished when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} how <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> expectantly, yet timidly, almost fearfully. I kissed her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> laughing, and not {{answering}} this: {{it was just}} her mother's trick.|$|R
6000|$|... "And he {{left his}} bear!" [...] she exclaimed, in horror. [...] "What on earth am I {{to do with a}} bear?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> in spite of her {{annoyance}} and perplexity she could not help joining me when I laughed outright.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said thereto [...] With a pitying smile, [...] "And THIS is {{what has}} busied you [...] So long a while? O poor {{exhausted}} one, I see [...] You have worn you old and thin For naught! Those moils you fear for me [...] I find most pleasure in!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, madam," [...] he snapped. [...] "I {{agree with}} you." [...] She {{considered}} him with eyes that held a loathing and contempt unutterable. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> shrugged her shoulders as who would say: [...] "You see how I am used!" [...] Lastly she turned, {{and took her}} way across the lawn towards the house.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> pondering, weaving her webs about me, lulling doubt, and banishing fear.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling {{again through}} her tears, {{and shook her}} head a little.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{long and}} earnestly and I {{thought that she}} was {{softening}} toward me.|$|R
