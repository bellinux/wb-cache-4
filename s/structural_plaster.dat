5000|$|The building's {{design is}} {{centered}} around durability, ecology, and sustainability. The building {{is said to}} draw upon the physiology of the tardigrade, a creature known for its durability, for its structural strength. In addition, the walls are angled inward at 4 degrees to [...] "create a compressive structure with a low center of gravity further aiding in resistance to lateral turnover forces produced by strong earthquakes." [...] A variety of both standard and non-standard building materials were used including: Concrete, Insulating concrete forms, hardwall (a type of gypsum plaster) <b>structural</b> <b>plaster,</b> Stucco, Non-toxic waterproofing, acrylic, marine fiberglass, douglas fir, recycled wood, and birch veneer plywood.|$|E
40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>plaster</b> {{properties}} of the residence type buildings that were constructed during pre-republic and early republic periods in Demirci were investigated {{within the scope of}} this study. Samples taken from the existing structures were dried in laboratory conditions and made ready for micro-structure examination. Proper samples were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with the sensitivity of 5 nm and a magnification of 20. 000 times, and the optical microscope (magnification: 250 x). In the light of obtained results, it has been determined that the microstructure of the composite used in the Demirci county in the pre-Republican period and early republic period is similar to the resultant of mixes produced with the modern fiber added composite production technology. It is thought that this study will contribute {{to the study of the}} production of the related building materials to be improved in the future within the limits of the district...|$|E
40|$|Currently in {{the nuclear}} industry, surface {{contamination}} {{in the form of}} radioactive metal or metal oxide deposits is most commonly removed by chemical decontamination, electrochemical decontamination or physical attrition. Physical attrition techniques are generally used on <b>structural</b> materials (concrete, <b>plaster),</b> with (electro) chemical methods being used to decontaminate metallic or painted surfaces. The most common types of (electro) chemical decontamination are the use of simple mineral acids such as nitric acid or cerium (IV) oxidation (MEDOC). Use of both of these reagents frequently results in the dissolution of a layer of the substrate surface increasing the percentage of secondary waste which leads to burdens on downstream effluent treatment and waste management plants. In this context, both mineral acids and MEDOC can be indiscriminate in the surfaces attacked during deployment, e. g. attacking in transit through a pipe system to the site of contamination resulting in both diminished effect of the decontaminating reagent upon arrival at its target site and an increased secondary waste management requirement. This provides two main requirements for a more ideal decontamination reagent: Improved area specificity and a dissolution power equal to or greater than the previously mentioned current decontaminants. Photochemically promoted processes may provide such a decontamination technique. Photochemical reduction of metal ion valence states to aid in heavy metal deposition has already been extensively studied [I], with reductive manipulation also being achieved with uranium and plutonium simulants (Ce) [2]. Importantly photooxidation of a variety of metals, including neptunium [3], has also been achieved. Here we report on the potential application of this technology to metal dissolution...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{different}} materials that are used throughout this building. The main materials used in the building envelope consist of concrete, glass, granite and steel. The curtain wall facade of this building uses large glass panels, framed with black granite framing. While the glass used for the lower box is completely transparent, the curtain wall for the upper seven floors uses fritted glass {{with a series of}} light gray circles, each approximately the size of a CD. This creates a protective screen that hinders view out from the building, but provides privacy to its users while reducing heat gain, and maintaining a certain level of sophistication is its aesthetics at the same time. Each of the twelve hypostyle columns are made of reinforced concrete. The columns supporting the tower are Agilia Concrete, which is more enhanced in design effect and construction process compared to traditional concretes: it can be placed 50% faster than the traditional concrete, and form complex shapes that would have been impossible in previous years. Each colossal column spans spanning one meter in diameter and 19 meters high; each one was constructed in a single pour in order to achieve the highest quality and a sense of grace and elegance. A striking urban colonnade is created through this series of columns; asserting its presence on campus while setting distinct boundaries between the street, public space of the campus and the privacy of the pharmacy faculty. Self-compacting concrete is used as the structural support system {{throughout the rest of the}} structure. The pods were constructed as “steel baskets” suspended by steel rods. The shells of these pods are constructed of <b>structural</b> steel and <b>plaster</b> and silver reflective paint are used for the finishes of these pods.|$|R
