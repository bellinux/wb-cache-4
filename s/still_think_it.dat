500|$|The BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who {{has often}} been heavily {{influenced}} by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale's dislike of it ("It sounded a terrible idea and I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was," [...] he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass {{have appeared in the}} programme and its spinoffs. [...] Serials directly influenced include The Web of Fear, The Invasion, Spearhead from Space, The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The Seeds of Doom and Image of the Fendahl, as well as the 2007 [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former Doctor Who script editor and producer Derrick Sherwin admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|Thereafter, Sherman became {{president}} of the St. Louis Railroad, a streetcar company, a position he would hold for only a few months. Thus, he was living in border-state Missouri as the secession crisis came to a climax. While trying to hold himself aloof from controversy, he observed firsthand the efforts of Congressman Frank Blair, who later served under Sherman, to hold Missouri in the Union. In early April, he declined an offer from the Lincoln administration to take a position in the War Department as a prelude to his becoming Assistant Secretary of War. After the bombardment of Fort Sumter, Sherman hesitated about committing to military service and ridiculed Lincoln's call for 75,000 three-month volunteers to quell secession, reportedly saying: [...] "Why, you might as well attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with a squirt-gun." [...] However, in May, he offered himself for service in the regular army, and his brother (Senator John Sherman) and other connections maneuvered to get him a commission in the regular army. On June 3, he wrote that [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is to be a long war – very long – much longer than any Politician thinks." [...] He received a telegram summoning him to Washington on June 7.|$|E

500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E
2500|$|Most actors {{had contact}} before filming with the {{individuals}} {{they were to}} portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: [...] "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down {{a vast number of}} characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." [...] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the same}} program, Justin Tubb said [...] "I {{gave it to}} Jean (Shepard). And I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a Girl's song.

6000|$|... "Of course Christminster {{is a sort}} {{of fixed}} vision with him, which I suppose he'll never be cured of believing in. He <b>still</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> a great centre of high and fearless thought, instead of what it is, a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose {{characteristic}} is timid obsequiousness to tradition." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is true, Royce, but we {{want you}} to sign a {{confession}} as to just how that ring got in the inkwell. If you don't do that, the seminary authorities may <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was placed there by Miss Laning." ...|$|E

6000|$|Captain Carroll {{fell back}} a few steps and gazed {{at her with a}} troubled face. [...] "It is {{possible}} that you have misunderstood, Miss Saltonstall?" [...] he faltered.

Why can't you do something weird for a while? These songs are all about having fun, silly records that are to be enjoyed and not taken too seriously. Gwen Stefani ...|$|R
5000|$|Though {{mentioning}} {{the movie was}} [...] "probably too long", objecting in particular {{to some of the}} childhood material about Vlade and Dražen as well as to lesser extent to some of Vlade's travelogue before he gets to Croatia being included in the film, Alan Sepinwall of HitFix <b>still</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> [...] "did a nice job of telling the sad story of how politics tore apart that great Yugoslavian team, and the friendship between Divac and Petrovic".|$|R
50|$|The {{patient is}} put in restraints. He was hallucinating he was being {{attacked}} by bears and Adams says that points to clinical paranoia. Adams and Park argue about whether it's new or old paranoia when Chase interrupts to suggest it may just be a mental illness because all the tests are negative. Park <b>still</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it's</b> a brain infection, but Adams <b>thinks</b> <b>it's</b> autoimmune. House agrees with both Adams, orders treatment for GAD; steroids and immunoglobulin. Park follows House and tells him that she's not paranoid and it's not that her teammates don't like her, they just don't know her that well.|$|R

6000|$|... [1]In a {{subsequent}} stage of boyhood, when these exercises {{had ceased to}} be compulsory, like most youthful writers I wrote tragedies; under the inspiration {{not so much of}} Shakspeare as of Joanna Baillie, whose Constantine Paleologus in particular appeared to me one of the most glorious of human compositions. I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> one of the best dramas of the last two centuries.|$|E

'Only,' she said, {{turning to}} Gerald, 'I must say that, however man is {{lord of the}} beast and the fowl, I still don't think he has any right to violate the {{feelings}} of the inferior creation.

5000|$|During production, Rock Hudson openly {{complained about}} [...] "sex comedies" [...] such as A Very Special Favor: [...] "I {{think the public}} is weary. The cycle has been pushed {{about as far as}} it can go, and I think light comedy is on the wane. The {{boundaries}} have been extended almost to the limit, with producers trying to see how dirty it can get. A Very Special Favor was filthy. I thought it was filthy when I read the script, and I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> filthy." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Pellow {{told the}} Daily Record, [...] "We did everybody's {{head in the}} summer of 1994." [...] Nevertheless, Pellow said, [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a {{brilliant}} record. Its strength is its sheer simplicity. Any band would give their eye teeth to have a hit record like that. I'm very proud of it." [...] In 2013, the year that Reg Presley died, [...] "Love Is All Around" [...] was named as the number one song in VH1's The Ultimate Movie Soundtrack: Top 100.|$|R

I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a useless task, {{and it does not}} seem any duty of mine to be revenged upon Mr. Manston in any way.' She added more gravely, 'It is beneath my dignity as a woman to labour for this; I have felt it so all day.' ...|$|E
60|$|Although we have, in {{obedience}} to your commands of the 5th January, regularly laid before you our proceedings at large, and have occasionally addressed you upon such points as required your resolutions or orders for our guidance, we <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> necessary {{to collect and}} digest in a summary report those transactions {{in the management of}} the assigned revenue which have principally engaged our attention, and which, upon the proceeding, are too much intermixed with ordinary occurrences to be readily traced and understood.|$|E
5000|$|So-called conveniences like cable {{television}} and cellular phones are examined. For example, the miniaturization of data storage devices is both trumpeted and lampooned in the November 3, 2007, daily, with Janis {{unable to find}} the tiny disk that conveniently holds all her photographs. The loss of privacy that has come with the internet is also mourned: [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> creepy {{to go to a}} book or music web site and have it make suggestions of 'other titles you might enjoy,'" [...] admits Johnson.|$|R
50|$|As {{an ongoing}} gag of the show, {{one of the}} pair appears {{to be able to}} tell when the other has entered the room, and says their name, before turning round to see them (notably, in the episode Two Faced Dick, in which Dick and Sally swap bodies, Dick enters the room and Don <b>still</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is Sally, before turning round to find himself shocked). Another of the pair's running gags is that the conversations held between them are {{somewhat}} dramatic, and reminiscent of an old film noir 1930s crime drama.|$|R
5000|$|In a March 2007, article {{published}} in The New York Times titled [...] "No U-Turns", Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans {{in order to win}} elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks [...] "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can't <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> going to happen soon." ...|$|R
