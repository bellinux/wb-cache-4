5|$|Jackson {{was offered}} a {{scholarship}} with the AIS in 1996, {{when she was just}} 15, but her parents <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> this, as it required her to move from Albury to Canberra. The next year, she accepted a scholarship. The programme considers her one of its success stories. With Jackson leading a side composed of the best 16- to 17-year-old development players in the country, the Australian Institute of Sport WNBL team won the WNBL Championship.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} in the early 1980s of 610 undergraduate women {{asked if they had}} ever <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> sex, even though they fully intended to have sexual intercourse. The majority, 68.5% of these women answered 'no' when their intention was 'maybe'. The other 39.3% answered that when they have said 'no' really meant 'yes'. The explanations in support of their answers were that they were fearful of being considered promiscuous. Some claimed they were inhibited about sex. Others answered that they intended to manipulate the male because they were angry, wanted him to become more aroused or more aggressive.|$|E

2500|$|Rebecca [...] "Becky" [...] O'Donohue [...] (born July 13, 1980) is from Dobbs Ferry, New York. Her {{original}} audition was in Boston {{with her}} twin sister (who did not sing due to recent throat surgery). Simon Cowell praised her looks, but <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> her voice. She was let through to Hollywood by Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul.|$|E
2500|$|Jim McKellar, {{assistant}} {{general manager of the}} London Knights when Perry played for them, has said about Perry: [...] "He's a very personable guy who has a great sense of humour. He's also great with the fans. He was always very accommodating and never <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> anything we asked him to participate in. Whether it was a trip to the hospital or an autograph session, Corey was great. He was the ideal ambassador." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 {{the party}} {{confirmed}} {{its intention to}} maintain parliamentary independence from the Liberal Party. In 2007, leader Brendon Grylls stated that the party [...] "took a significant step and <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> a traditional coalition with the Liberal Party and will contest the (next, 2008) election as a stand-alone conservative party". Following the unexpected hung parliament produced by the election, the Nationals found themselves holding {{the balance of power}} in both houses of the Western Australian parliament, opting ultimately to support the Liberals without establishing with them a coalition of one political force.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{afterwards}} Sir Thomas {{went to his}} bed, {{and there}} by his bedside his wife sat {{for the rest of}} the evening. But he <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word <b>to</b> her of his sorrow.|$|R
6000|$|Kate was splendid, and {{it would}} have been clear for Milly now, had the further {{presumption}} been needed, that she had <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word <b>to</b> Mrs. Stringham. [...] "You mean you've been absurd?" ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> {{each other}} that evening. Argemone was called to the piano; and Lancelot took up the Sporting Magazine, and read himself to sleep till the party {{separated}} for the night.|$|R
2500|$|Singh {{does not}} readily throw {{himself into the}} {{spotlight}} due to an awareness of how the media likes to develop cults of personality: [...] "I didn't choose to be covered in the way I have been. I've <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> interviews far more often than I've said yes." [...] In 2001, when the CBC's The Fifth Estate aired a documentary profile of Singh, {{it was difficult to}} get his cooperation. Anna Maria Tremonti, the show's host, noted that [...] "Often, people clamour to get in front of a microphone. But Jaggi didn't clamour." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{three and}} a half years I dodged the war as much as I could - and I regret not having had the courage shown by the great Karl Liebknecht to say No and refuse to serve in the military. Of this I am ashamed. I used many means not to get shot and not to shoot [...] not once the worst means. But I would have used all means, all without exception, [...] had I been forced to do so: I wouldn't have <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> bribery or any other {{punishable}} acts. Many did just the same.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} his trip with Bosanquet to North America, Johnson {{was part of a}} private team that toured New Zealand and Australia under the {{leadership}} of Lord Hawke in the 1902–03 season. Four years later, in the 1906–07 season, he went back to New Zealand with a MCC side composed of amateur players that played 11 first-class matches in a three-month period. These were his only experiences of international cricket, though Foot writes, in his history of Somerset cricket: [...] "It's well known that he was invited to go to Australia with the Warner-Douglas team" [...] of 1911–12. But, he adds, [...] "he thought hard about it, tried in vain to revise his business schedules and <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> likely fame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Patience for the present!" [...] he answered. [...] "You {{will hear}} soon enough." [...] For the moment, I <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> him. The tone {{in which he}} had replied warned me that it would be useless.|$|R
60|$|As to Hugh, he {{had been}} fitted out in bourgeois clothes since he came, and had <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word as <b>to</b> uniform.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What I {{say to you}} now I have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> one--not <b>to</b> my wife or my brothers; only to you. It is all up with us, my friends. We {{have come}} to our last rally. The game is finished, and we must make {{provision}} accordingly.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Bridget Erin [...] "Beach" [...] Hennessy, {{portrayed by}} Kaley Cuoco, is the beautiful, ditzy oldest child. She is {{depicted}} as a stereotypical blonde, a popular bombshell who is preoccupied with her looks, teenaged boys, and little else. She sometimes displays intelligence or profundity, but these are initially few and far between, yet often poignant. Her favorite book is J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. After her father dies, she begins to steadily mature. Bridget initially felt guilty about Paul's death because the last words she ever spoke to him were [...] "I hate you" [...] after arguing with him earlier that morning, because he <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> her using the car. In season two, Bridget was revealed to have been conceived on a beach.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi's {{upbringing}} {{was hardly}} {{conducive to the}} raising of a healthy, well-balanced child. Overnight, he was treated as an emperor and unable to behave as a child. The adults in his life, except for his wet-nurse Wang Wen-Chao, were all strangers, remote, distant, and unable to discipline him. Wherever he went, grown men would kneel down in a ritual kowtow, averting their eyes until he passed. Soon the young Puyi discovered the absolute power he wielded over the eunuchs, and he frequently had them beaten for small transgressions. As an emperor, Puyi had his every whim catered to while no one ever <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> him, making him into a sadistic boy who loved to have his eunuchs flogged. The Anglo-French journalist Edward Behr wrote about Puyi's powers as emperor of China, which allowed him to fire his air-gun at anyone he liked: ...|$|E
60|$|LINA. Pray instead: dont cry. Why {{should you}} cry? Youre {{not the first}} I've <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{was angry}} at all this, for I saw then that he was making fun of me; and I <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> him, for {{he was not in}} the right frame of mind to listen to me. But I did not stop thinking.|$|R
60|$|I saw Castelroux that day, but I <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word <b>to</b> him of my affliction. He {{brought me}} news of Chatellerault. The Count {{was lying in}} a {{dangerous}} condition at the Auberge Royale, and might not be moved. The physician attending him all but despaired of his life.|$|R
60|$|He {{pressed a}} light kiss on her brow, and she <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more, ready <b>to</b> submit, like all strong souls, {{when she felt}} no valid reason for resistance.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should be}} indeed unworthy {{the name of}} Englishmen if we <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> that," [...] replied Harold, glancing at Disco, who nodded approval.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am dying, Polly; I know that, or I wouldn't {{have sent}} for ye. It {{was a good}} day for you when you <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> what I asked you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I love you, Wulf; I {{have always}} loved you. It {{is for your}} sake that I have <b>said</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> the suitors of my own race who have sought my hand. I will be a true wife and loving to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} Caleb came in, {{bringing}} his plate of apples, {{with an air of}} great importance and satisfaction. He had nearly forgotten his troubles. Soon after this, dinner was brought in, and Madam Rachel <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> the boys about malice. After dinner, they went out again to play.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Newcombe stood very doleful. And well he might; for if his lady-love {{went away}} in this fashion, {{there was good}} reason to suppose that he might never see her again. But Kate <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word <b>to</b> comfort him--for how could she in this company?--and began to talk rapidly about her preparations.|$|R
60|$|I <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> {{him just}} then. I thought {{it better to}} let nascent remorse and nascent admiration work out their own natural effects unimpeded. For I could see our enemy was {{beginning}} to feel some sting of remorse. Some men are below it. Sebastian thought himself above it. I felt sure he was mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was in this}} man's character, when he <b>said</b> <b>No,</b> <b>to</b> mean No. Mr. Mountjoy's hostess {{perceived}} that her crazy customer {{was not to be}} trifled with. She lowered her terms again with the headlong hurry of terror. [...] "You shall have it, Sir, at your own price," [...] said this entirely shameless and perfectly respectable woman.|$|E
60|$|I {{asked him}} if he had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs. Bentley Drummle. He <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> <b>To</b> avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I {{mentioned}} Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.|$|E
60|$|My aunt, said No in a strange, stifled voice, and {{suddenly}} {{turned her face}} from me. Was my father dead? No. My mother? No. Uncle George? My aunt trembled all over as she <b>said</b> <b>No</b> <b>to</b> that also, and bade me cease asking any more questions. She was not fit to bear them yet she said, and signed to the servant to lead {{me out of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|The days went by, and she {{received}} no sign. Was {{he going to}} ignore her, was he going <b>to</b> take <b>no</b> further notice of her secret? A dreary weight of anxiety and acrid bitterness settled on her. And yet Ursula knew she was only deceiving herself, {{and that he would}} proceed. She <b>said</b> <b>no</b> word <b>to</b> anybody.|$|R
60|$|Edmund <b>said</b> <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> either lady; {{but going}} quietly to another table, {{on which the}} supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part. She wished {{to be able to}} decline it; but the tears, which a variety of {{feelings}} created, made it easier to swallow than to speak.|$|R
6000|$|... [Looking at his watch.] Excuse me, my lady, but Mr. Fouldes <b>said</b> <b>no</b> one was <b>to</b> disturb him till ten o'clock. It's {{more than}} my place is worth to go to him at five minutes to.|$|R
