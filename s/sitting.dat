5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached <b>Sitting</b> Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told <b>Sitting</b> Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. <b>Sitting</b> Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered <b>Sitting</b> Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When <b>Sitting</b> Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of <b>Sitting</b> Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot <b>Sitting</b> Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sitting</b> Bull and {{his people}} stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, <b>Sitting</b> Bull and his men found it {{difficult}} to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. <b>Sitting</b> Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the police were}} {{managing}} the <b>Sitting</b> Bull incident. In 1876 the United States military led a campaign against the Sioux in Dakota; the Sioux's leader, <b>Sitting</b> Bull, concluded that the conflict was unwinnable, and chose to seek sanctuary in Canada. <b>Sitting</b> Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with the Sioux, in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part. The Sioux declined to return south, however, and the police had to deploy around 200 men to Fort Walsh to oversee the immigrant community. The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared {{some of their own}} supplies with the Sioux, who were not covered by Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of the newcomers to the United States, and <b>Sitting</b> Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.|$|E
