The wind wanes and the men witness arrows flying from the {{fingertips}} of Þorgerðr, each arrow killing {{a man of the}} Jomsviking fleet. The Jomsvikings tell Sigvaldi that although they are no longer fighting men alone, they will <b>still</b> <b>do</b> their best.|$|E
5|$|The SSEM {{represented}} negative numbers using two's complement, as most computers <b>still</b> <b>do.</b> In that representation, {{the value}} of the most significant bit denotes the sign of a number; positive numbers have a zero in that position and negative numbers a one. Thus the range of numbers that could be held in each 32-bit word was −231 to +231−1 (decimal: −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647).|$|E
5|$|The tree {{of heaven}} is a very rapidly growing tree, {{possibly}} the fastest growing tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per {{year for the first}} four years is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, <b>still</b> <b>do</b> so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen's {{supporters}}, {{known as}} the Red Army, {{are listed in the}} team squad list as wearing the number12 shirt. In 1999, a group of supporters founded the Red Ultras group with the express aim of improving the atmosphere at Pittodrie. However, it was decided that this particular group was to disband at the beginning of 2010.

5|$|Both {{houses of}} the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run-off system. Under the Constitution, should both houses not agree on a common candidate, then a joint {{committee}} is allowed to be established {{to agree on the}} matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess. However, if both houses <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet. Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>still</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, {{many of which are}} otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E

5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and <b>still</b> <b>do</b> in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{original}} cast from season two returned {{for the third}} season, including Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. The only permanent cast member not to return was Paul Schneider, who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider departed from the series {{at the end of}} season two. Jim O'Heir and Retta, who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle during the first two seasons, were considered members of the regular cast starting in season three, although they <b>still</b> <b>do</b> not appear in the opening credits. Adam Scott, who portrayed state auditor Ben Wyatt in the final two episodes of the second season, became a regular cast member starting in season three, and Rob Lowe, who appeared in the same two second-season episodes as state auditor Chris Traeger, also joined the cast in season three. Lowe was originally meant only to make a string of performances in seasons two and three and then depart the show, but he instead become a regular cast member starting with the third season, having signed a multi-year contract to remain on the show. After actor Charlie Sheen was fired from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors circulated that Rob Lowe would depart Parks and Recreation and replace Sheen, but they proved unfounded.|$|E
