In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was boosted by its safety record, {{in contrast to}} its primary competitor, China Airlines. In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational <b>Safety</b> <b>Audit)</b> certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification {{in the areas of}} Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services.|$|E

5|$|Waterfall Gully Road is {{meandering}} and in {{some parts}} quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists. After {{the death of a}} cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a <b>safety</b> <b>audit</b> being conducted by TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of {{the entire length of the}} road. As of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released for the future of the road, with the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.|$|E

5|$|Created in February 1972, Biman enjoyed an {{internal}} monopoly in the aviation industry of Bangladesh until 1996. In the decades following its founding, the airline expanded its fleet and destinations {{but it was}} adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement. At its peak, Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations, extending from New York City {{in the west to}} Tokyo in the east. The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007, when it was transformed into the country's largest public limited company by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh. Since becoming a public limited company in 2007, the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernise its fleet. The airline has made a deal with Boeing for ten new aircraft along with options for ten more. Biman Bangladesh Airlines is certified as safe to fly in Europe by the European Aviation Safety Agency and it also successfully passed the IATA Operational <b>Safety</b> <b>Audit</b> and since then, the airline has resumed flights to some of its previous destinations in Asia and Europe.|$|E

40|$|ABStrAct This article {{represents}} {{a call to}} understand school <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> as central to pro-cesses of institutional branding. It argues that reading <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> through a branding optic helps to draw out their uses in providing support for the aug-mentation of techno-security apparatuses on campuses and to contextualize them vis-à-vis increasing tendencies to govern universities in accordance with business models of management. While <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> are generally endorsed as necessary for helping university administrators {{ensure the safety of}} students, faculty and staff, the more critical reading provided here draws attention to their entanglement with administrative efforts to construct commoditized university narratives. This paper substantiates and extends research by scholars who make note of the ongoing con-figurations of educational institutions in accordance with intertwining military and corporate logics.

Water contaminated with listeria was also found on the floor of the packing plant and it was determined that the workers moving around the plant had spread it, as the contaminated water was also found on the cantaloupe conveyor belt.

40|$|Food safety {{technology}} can increase a company’s capacity {{to prevent a}} foodborne contamination. A food safety audit—a quality control tool in which an auditor observes whether a plant’s processing practices and technologies are compatible with good food safety practices—can indicate how effectively food {{safety technology}} is being used. Fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and other major customers of meat and poultry processing plants conduct their own audits or hire auditors to assess the soundness of a plant’s processing operation. Meat and poultry plants can also audit themselves {{as a way to}} help maintain process control. In this report, we document the extent of food <b>safety</b> <b>audits</b> in meat and poultry processing plants. We also examine the associations between the use of audits and plant size, firm structure, and food safety technology use. Results show that larger plants, plants subject to food <b>safety</b> <b>audits,</b> and plants that are part of a multiplant firm use more food safety technology than other plants. Plants subject to both plant-hired and customer-hired audits had greater technology use than single (plant- or customer-hired) audit plants.
