25|$|During {{pregnancy}} in the human, hormones such as relaxin remodel this ligamentous capsule {{allowing the}} pelvic bones {{to be more}} flexible for delivery. The gap of the <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis,</b> normally is 4–5mm but during pregnancy {{there will be an}} increase of at least 2–3mm, therefore, it is considered that a total width of up to 9mm between the two bones is normal for a pregnant woman. The <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> separates to some degree during childbirth. In some women this separation can become a diastasis of the <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis.</b> The diastasis could be the result of a rapid birth, or a forceps delivery, or may be a prenatal condition. A diastasis of the <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> is a cause of pelvic girdle pain (PGP). Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.|$|E
25|$|In the newborn, the <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> is 9–10mm in width, {{with thick}} {{cartilaginous}} end-plates. By mid-adolescence the adult size is achieved. During adulthood the end-plates decrease in width to a thinner layer. Degeneration of the <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> accompanies aging and postpartum. Women {{have a greater}} thickness of this pubic disc which allows more mobility of the pelvic bones, hence providing a greater diameter of pelvic cavity during childbirth.|$|E

50|$|Complications can ensue. If {{surgical}} retractors are not placed carefully {{under the}} edges of the incision, they can damage the femoral nerve or other nerves in the area. If during wound closure, tendons are sewn directly to the pubic <b>symphysis,</b> osteitis <b>pubis</b> or osteomyelitis can result.|$|R
25|$|Metabolic diseases, such as renal osteodystrophy, produce widening, while {{ochronosis}} {{results in}} calcific deposits in the symphysis. Inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, result in bony fusion of the <b>symphysis.</b> Osteitis <b>pubis,</b> {{the most common}} inflammatory disease in this area, is treated with anti-inflammatory medication and rest. Degenerative joint disease of the symphysis, which can cause groin pain, results from instability or from abnormal pelvic mechanics.|$|R
25|$|The main {{motions of}} the <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> are superior/inferior glide and separation/compression. The {{functions}} of the joint are to absorb shock during walking and allow delivery of a baby.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the pelvis}} shows the skinny regions {{function}} as arches, transferring {{the weight of}} the upright trunk from the sacrum to the hips. The <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> connects these two weight-bearing arches, and the ligaments that surround this pelvic region maintain the mechanical integrity.|$|E
25|$|Pelvic girdle pain. Hormones and enzymes work {{together}} to produce ligamentous relaxation and widening of the <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> during the last trimester of pregnancy. Most girdle pain occurs before birthing, and is known as diastasis of the pubic symphysis. Predisposing factors for girdle pain include maternal obesity.|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{intervention}} - such as wedge resection of the <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis</b> - {{is sometimes}} attempted in severe cases, but its success rate is not high, and the surgery itself {{may lead to}} later pelvic problems.|$|R
40|$|Osteomyelitis of the <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis</b> {{is a rare}} condition. There {{have been}} various reports in the {{literature}} of inflammation and osteomyelitis as well as septic arthritis of pubic symphysis. However, {{due to the fact that}} these conditions are rare and that the usual presenting symptoms are very nonspecific, osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis is often misdiagnosed, thus delaying definitive treatment. We present a case that to our knowledge is the first case in literature of osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis in a 17 -year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which was initially misdiagnosed and progressed to bilateral adductor abscesses. A high suspicion of such condition should be considered in a JIA patient who presents with symphysis or thigh pain...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{described}} that MRI {{is a good}} examination {{to assess}} damage in chronic athletic pubalgia (AP). However, to our knowledge, no studies focus on systematic correlation of precise tendon or parietal lesion in MRI with surgery and histological assessment. Therefore, we performed a case-control study to determine if MRI can precisely assess Adductor longus (AL) tendinopathy and parietal lesion, compared with surgery and histology. MRI can determine if AP comes from <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis,</b> musculotendinous or inguinal orifice structures. Eighteen consecutive patients were enrolled from November  2011 to April  2013 for chronic AP. To constitute a control group, we also enrolled 18  asymptomatic men. All MRI were reviewed in consensus by 2  skeletal radiologists for pubic symphysis, musculotendinous, abdominal wall assessment and compared to surgery and histology findings. Regarding <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis,</b> we found 4  symmetric bone marrow oedema (14 %), 2  secondary cleft (7 %) and 2  superior ligaments lesions (7 %). For AL tendon, we mainly found 13  asymmetric bone marrow oedema (46 %), 15  hyperaemia (54 %). Regarding abdominal wall, the deep inguinal orifice size {{in the group of}} symptomatic athletes and the control group was respectively 27. 3 ± 6. 4 mm and 23. 8 ± 6. 3 mm. The correlation between MRI and surgery/histology was low: 20 % for the AL tendon and 9 % for the abdominal wall. If we chose the criteria "affected versus unaffected", this correlation became higher: 100 % for AL tendon and 73 % for the abdominal wall. MRI chronic athletic pubalgia concerns preferentially AL tendinopathy and deep inguinal canal dehiscence with high correlation to surgery/histology when only considering the item "affected versus unaffected" despite low correlation when we try to precisely grade these lesions.

25|$|In {{later stages}} of {{pregnancy}} the fetus's head aligns inside the pelvis. Also joints of bones soften {{due to the}} effect of pregnancy hormones. These factors may cause pelvic joint pain (<b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> dysfunction or SPD). As the end of pregnancy approaches, the ligaments of the sacroiliac joint loosen, letting the pelvis outlet widen somewhat; this is easily noticeable in the cow.|$|E
25|$|The pubic {{symphysis}} or <b>symphysis</b> <b>pubis</b> is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting {{the superior}} rami {{of the left}} and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth.|$|E

The pelvic cysts are uncommon and only a few cases are described in the literature. The following is a report of a rare case of a pelvic epidermoid cyst. A seventy year old multiparus lady presented with progressive swelling in the abdomen. Clinical examination confirmed a large mass in the abdomin. The ultrasound showed a giant 35 cm abdomino-pelvic echogene mass, extending from the <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis</b> to the epigastric region, displacing the liver, spleen and the urinary bladder. The computed tomography showed similar finding (figure 1). A giant ovarian cyst was diagnosed. Median laparotomy was performed and a 30 cm retroperitoneal cyst was found.

40|$|Introduction: Pelvic {{relaxation}} and cystocele {{is a common}} problem in middle to old age women. Transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) is a noninvasive, available routine procedure in many situations. We evaluated whether TAS can predict pelvic relaxation or not. "nMaterials and Methods: In a cross sectional case- control study one hundred women 30 years or older were enrolled into the study. An expert female urologist examined the cases {{for the presence of}} signs and the grading of pelvic relaxation. A single radiologist blinded to pelvic exam results performed TAS. In the full bladder state the following criteria were recorded: 1. Bladder outlet funneling at rest and valsalva 2. Bladder base position in relation to the superior edge of the <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis</b> 3. Bladder wall thickness 4. Pelvicaliceal system stasis 5. Post voiding residual urine (PVR). "nResults: Bladder outlet funneling can predict pelvic relaxation (Se, 91. 3 %), both at rest and after valsalva. If the bladder base descent is seen below the superior edge of the pubis with the cut off point of 5 mm,it can predict pelvic relaxation. "nConclusion: TAS {{can be used as a}} safe and available modality to predict pelvic relaxatio...|$|R

40|$|Diagnosis of osteitis pubis {{is based}} on {{clinical}} history, chronic pain, and tenderness in the pubic symphysis. Typical imaging findings include abnormal isotope uptake in bone scanning, irregular periosteal changes in pelvic radi-ographs, and abnormal MRI results. 4, 8 Bone marrow edema, tendon lesions, and fluid in symphysis are typical MRI signs in osteitis pubis. 9, 13, 18 Although the clinical entity of osteitis pubis {{is related to the}} severity of bone marrow edema in the <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis,</b> 18 a recent study with asymptomatic soccer players suggested that some of these MRI changes are not always correlated with clinical symptoms. 9 Treatment of osteitis pubis is always aimed toward its specific origin and pathologic characteristics. First-line management includes rest, muscle strengthening and stretching exercises, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory analgesics, local anesthetics, and corticosteroids. In resistant cases, surgery is required. 4, 8 Various invasive and operative approaches for osteitis pubis have been proposed depending on the suspected origin of injury. These include tenotomies of muscle tendons close to the pubic bone, 1, 20 drilling of the pubic bone, 12 or arthrodesis of the pubic symphysis in the cases of instability. 21 The results of operative treatment ar...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To assess bladder and rectum doses in {{relation}} to body mass index of patients undergoing high dose rate brachytherapy {{for the treatment of}} carcinoma of the cervix. Methods: The cohort consists of fifty subjects with carcinoma of the uterine cervix presented with grade II and III. Patient’s height and weight was measured before the insertion of applicator in situ. Body mass index (BMI) of the patient was calculated in accordance to World Health Organization definition (weight in Kg/ height in m 2). Adequacy of position and orientation of the applicator was confirmed with the help of orthogonal X-ray images and the same were transferred to the treatment planning system (TPS) to generate treatment plan. Prescription doses were optimized to Point A and to reference lines placed at 0. 5 cm apart from the surface of ovoids. The following dose reference points were identified on orthogonal x-ray images for analysis using the rectal marker and Foleys bulb inflated with radio opaque dye Rectal points at the level of femoral heads (RL) and <b>pubis</b> <b>symphysis</b> (RLP), Anorectum Junction (AR Jn) point and Rectosigmoid (RS) point and Bladder point (BL). Pearson regression analysis was used to analyze data from TPS. Results: The mean BMI was 22. 7 kg/m 2 and average age was 49. 9 years. Analysis showed that RL point dose and BMI were inversely correlated with a coefficient - 0. 45 (p = 0. 001). The trend continued along the rectal tube in cranio-caudal direction, as RLP and AR Jn points showed inversion co-efficiency with increase in BMI,- 0. 48 (p < 0. 01) and - 0. 51 (p < 0. 01) respectively. Bladder point showed weak positive correlation to BMI, 0. 12 (p = 0. 38). Conclusion: Significant rectal dose reduction is observed with increase in BMI. Bladder dose did not show statistically significant correlation with BMI. Based on the findings, BMI constitutes a confounding factor in the treatment of carcinoma of cervix. </p...|$|R
