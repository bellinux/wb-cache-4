5|$|The promotional {{video for}} the song was filmed in December 1967, for the Central Office of Information in London. The video was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> Britain, and {{was meant to be}} {{distributed}} in the US and Canada. The video features Barrett (shown with an acoustic guitar for the first time) and the group miming to the song in a more conventional stage setting, with psychedelic projections in the background. The original audio to the promo is lost, and most versions use the BBC recording from late 1967, consequently causing sync issues most evident as Barrett sings the opening verse. The original film was considered to be lost, until it was re-discovered in the Manchester Arts Lab in 1999. Barrett and Waters first watched the promo video during the second week of December 1967.|$|E
25|$|The first {{interviews}} for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, MalcolmX spoke about Elijah Muhammad, {{the leader of}} the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's reminders that the book was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> MalcolmX. After several meetings, Haley asked MalcolmX to tell him something about his mother. That question drew MalcolmX into recounting his life story.|$|E

Haley reminded him that the book was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> MalcolmX, not Muhammad or the Nation of Islam, a comment which angered MalcolmX. Haley eventually shifted {{the focus of the}} interviews toward the life of his subject when he asked MalcolmX about his mother: ...|$|E

500|$|... "Lady Bouvier's Lover" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The episode {{was inspired by the}} fact that The Simpsons has many elderly characters, which the writers felt was unique for network television, so they sought to highlight those characters. Originally, the episode was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> Misery. One of the ideas was that Grampa would get injured on Mr. Burns's property and get stuck there, leading Grampa to think that Mr. Burns would kill him when he was discovered there. However, this idea was cut out in production because the script was over 85 pages long.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the premise}} of the episode was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> [...] "the horrifying aspects of over-eating". However, since an earlier episode, [...] "Hungry", had dealt with similar themes, the writing staff decided to take the conceit in a {{different}} direction and examine the [...] "corporate evil that populates the cigarette industry". The episode's writers, Steven Maeda and Greg Walker, were both admitted fans of The Insider, a 1999 film that examines the tobacco industry, and so the two decided to create an episode with a similar feel. Marc Shapiro, in his book All Things: The Official Guide to the X-Files Volume 6, noted that the episode was [...] "literally, torn from the headlines"—a rare occurrence for an X-Files episode.|$|E
500|$|The Ice Warriors were a {{well-known}} villain {{of the original}} Doctor Who series. They appeared alongside the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in The Ice Warriors (1967) and The Seeds of Death (1969) and returned in the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) stories The Curse of Peladon (1972) and The Monster of Peladon (1974). Showrunner Steven Moffat had originally been hesitant {{to bring back the}} Ice Warriors, worrying that they were seen as [...] "the default condition for what people thought of as rubbish Doctor Who monsters— things that moved very, very slowly and spoke in a way that meant you couldn't hear a word they said." [...] Writer Mark Gatiss, however, was a fan of the Ice Warriors' stories and had been campaigning to bring them back. In a phone conversation with Moffat that was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> their show Sherlock, Gatiss pitched new and [...] "very clever ideas" [...] {{of what to do with}} the Ice Warriors, and Moffat agreed. What sold Moffat were the submarine setting and seeing what the Ice Warriors looked like underneath their suits. Gatiss felt that the Ice Warriors had a lot of gaps in their timeline and had not been featured in a while, which allowed a lot of room to explore them.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the season}} 3, episode 4: [...] "Sistering" [...] {{of the popular}} British sitcom Peep Show, {{character}} Mark Corrigan plays Blitzkrieg for 5 hours straight during his week off from work.

500|$|Dan Casey at Nerdist {{found the}} adage [...] "third {{time is the}} charm" [...] {{to apply to the}} episode, feeling that [...] "Rather than {{trying to figure out where}} it fits within Marvel’s grander {{on-screen}} universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is focusing its energy on developing the eponymous agents and giving us more backstory", and though he felt that [...] "The show still needs to figure out its balance of seriousness and humor", he concluded that the [...] "show just keeps getting better." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek felt that [...] "There's a distinct feeling of treading water", finding the episodic plot to be [...] "fairly by-the-numbers for a show that's <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> the fantastic", and he was disappointed in [...] "Graviton's non-appearance appearance", referring to the lack of Hall's comics' alter-ego. Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode's opening sequence, but criticized the character Skye and the focus the episode put on her rather than Coulson. He also spoke unfavorably of Quinn, noting that Hall would likely return as a villain himself in the future, but [...] "until then, S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to up its adversarial game". Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt [...] "the plot’s twists and turns clicked, even though it’s kind of embarrassing when the commercials are more engrossing than the show." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Linda Perry. Aguilera recorded the song at two studios: The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood. Prior to the collaboration with Aguilera, Perry {{had written the}} song and originally wished to keep the [...] "personal" [...] record for her own singing career. Perry initially previewed the song for Pink during the recording sessions of Pink's second studio album Missundaztood (2001), on which Perry is a producer. However, after hearing Aguilera sing the song at Perry's house to [...] "break the ice", Perry was very impressed and allowed Aguilera to include the track on her then upcoming record Stripped, effectively deciding not to pursue a solo career. The choice resulted in a feud between Pink against Aguilera and Perry, with the former commenting that it was [...] "annoying" [...] for the latter to collaborate with artists [...] " [...] didn't like". Perry later revealed to ASCAP, [...] "When Christina came {{over to my house}} to start working, she asked me to play some songs to break the ice. [...] I had a long conversation with my manager about it. We both decided to hear Christina sing it. We demoed the song with her singing it, and I was like, 'Wow'. That rough vocal is what is out there on radio. It was that vocal that got her the song". Perry's wife Sara Gilbert confirmed on her show The Talk that the final version was [...] "just a demo." [...] Gilbert also revealed that Aguilera wanted to rerecord the song because she didn't like the initial vocals. Perry denied the request because the song is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> imperfection and being vulnerable.|$|E

5000|$|Veteran {{documentary}} cameraman Peter Smokler {{worked as}} cinematographer on the film.

[...] With Smokler behind the camera, the film was shot not as a feature film, but as a documentary, without a script or traditional shooting schedule. So much footage was filmed (over 100 hours) that it eventually required three editors to complete the film.|$|R

"The UN climate {{talks are}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> {{building}} trust – that's been under threat for {{years because of}} the US backward position on climate action – these revelations will only crack that trust further," [...] said Meena Raman, of Third World Network. [...] "Fighting climate change is a global struggle, and these revelations clearly show that the US government {{is more interested in}} crassly protecting a few vested interests," [...] said Brandon Wu of ActionAid. Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, called the spying by the US [...] "insane and disgusting".|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers criticised {{the film}} for its {{excessive}} length. Duane Byrge in The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "at {{two hours and}} 34 minutes, we, seemingly, also endure his agony", while Kyle Smith in the New York Post wrote that [...] "It's <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> a Kafkaesque experience. Instead, it is a Kafkaesque experience". Other critics noted {{the length of the}} film without criticism: Roger Ebert said that [...] "it is a long night and a long film, but not a slow one" [...] while Philip Kennicott said [...] "it's long, but it's also very real and worth every minute".|$|E
2500|$|Another viewer offered, [...] “I {{always thought}} {{painting}} was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> hopes, dreams, the imagination.

[...] Every painting is, according to you, an evil, cunning, greedy “Anglo-American.” Shame on you for choosing to make a statement (a very limited statement) about your “political correctness” instead of really looking at the art for what it says about the appeal of the West to our collective imagination.

2500|$|In {{another book}} called Rebels All, the authors sought {{to define the}} main goals of Post-War {{conservatism}} in the United States. They wrote: [...] "isn't conservatism <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> maintaining standards, upholding civility, and frowning on rebellion?" [...] In addition, looking back at how it has evolved from after World War II to modern times, it seems undeniable that conservatism holds the capacity to defend diverging beliefs such as free-market libertarianism, religious traditionalism while valuing the aggressively suggested by the anti-communist mind. Modern Conservatism, a highly complex concept, finds {{its roots in the}} works of post-World War II thinkers and philosophers whose differing opinions about how to promote similar goals reflect the subjectivity of this political inclination.|$|E
2500|$|Some Christian Punks also do {{not agree}} with or are very {{critical}} of organized religion. They say that real Christianity is not just a religion because it's not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> rituals and rules; attacking these notions of legalism is a common theme in Christian punk lyrics, especially with older Christian punk bands, such as Nobody Special, Ninety Pound Wuss, Scaterd Few, and One Bad Pig. They believe true Christianity is a relationship with Jesus Christ, not necessarily a religion. Many Christian Punks are against religion like other Punks, yet they are strongly in support of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, separate from rules and tradition. This idea gave rise to Christian punk's term [...] "JCHC", meaning [...] "Jesus Christ Hard Core", which draws its name from an Officer Negative song of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Perone's {{assessment}} of the album's composition indicates a remove from [...] "just about anything else {{that was going on}} in 1966 pop music". Composer Philip Glass observed: [...] "Listening to it today, it is, perhaps, easier to see why {{it was one of the}} defining moments of its time... its willingness to abandon formula in favor of structural innovation, the introduction of classical elements in the arrangements, production concepts in terms of overall sound which were novel at the time-all these elements give Pet Sounds a freshness that, 30 years later, is immediately there for the listener." [...] Strauss writes that with Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys became the first major rock group [...] "to look music trends firmly in the eye and declare that rock really didn't matter. Rock is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about,</b> you know, fucking, and Brian Wilson was recording a song ('I Know There's an Answer') that was originally entitled 'Get Rid of Your Libido'." [...] Sommer said that the Beach Boys became the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format: [...] "Of course, others had done it for a song or two, but no one had said, 'This will be a complete album that can not be performed by four or five guys plugged into amps.... Once the Beach Boys let that cat out of the bag, the whole ship of rock sailed to new ports.'" ...|$|E
