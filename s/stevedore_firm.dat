2500|$|The 1999 Act's reforms mean {{a number}} of old cases would be decided {{differently}} today. In Beswick v Beswick while the House of Lords held that Mrs Beswick could specifically enforce a promise of her nephew to her deceased husband to pay her £5 weekly in her capacity as administratrix of the will, the 1999 Act would also allow her to claim as a third party. In Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd {{it would have been}} possible for a <b>stevedore</b> <b>firm</b> to claim the benefit of a limitation clause in a contract between a carrier and the owner of a damaged drum of chemicals. Lord Denning dissented, arguing for abolition of the rule, and Lord Reid gave an opinion that if a bill of lading expressly conferred the benefit of a limitation on the stevedores, the stevedores give authority to the carrier to do that, and [...] "difficulties about consideration moving from the stevedore were overcome" [...] then the stevedores could benefit. In The Eurymedon, Lord Reid's inventive solution was applied where some stevedores similarly wanted the benefit of an exclusion clause after dropping a drilling machine, the consideration being found as the stevedores performing their pre-existing contractual duty {{for the benefit of the}} third party (the drilling machine owner). Now none of this considerably technical analysis is required, given that any contract purporting to confer a benefit on a third party may in principle be enforced by the third party.|$|E
50|$|The SCPA {{owns and}} {{operates}} 21 container cranes that are rented with Authority operators by the hour to contract <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firms</b> for the loading and unloading of container vessels. The SCPA's operator loads or unloads the cargo to or from the ship. The private <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firm</b> moves the cargo from or to the SCPA's container marshalling yards. In the marshalling yards, SCPA personnel operate container moving equipment to facilitate the receipt/storage or delivery of containerized cargo.|$|R
5000|$|Export breakbulk cargo {{is placed}} in SCPA-owned transit sheds or open storage areas with SCPA equipment, {{including}} material handling equipment (primarily lift trucks) and mobile or gantry cranes. Export cargo remains in the transit shed or open storage area until it is loaded aboard a vessel by a contracting <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firm.</b> The shipper (freight forwarder) designates the line and vessel to which the cargo is consigned prior to receipt by the SCPA [...] Import breakbulk cargo is discharged from vessels by the contracting <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firm</b> and placed in an SCPA transit shed or open storage area. The cargo remains on SCPA facilities until instructions are received from the importer’s agent (customs house broker), who orders the necessary trucks or rail cars. When the rail car or truck arrives, it is loaded with the designated cargo by SCPA personnel.|$|R
25|$|The {{proximity}} to Paradip Port comes {{as an added}} advantage. OSL Group, {{one of the leading}} <b>stevedore</b> <b>firms</b> of the country is headquartered in Cuttack. Cuttack, being the largest business hub of the state is the nodal point of trade and transport. It also has the largest wholesale commodities market of the state at Malgodown and Chhatra Bazaar catering the whole state.|$|R
25|$|As {{the start}} of the 20th century loomed, the ILA had {{approximately}} 50,000 members, almost all on the Great Lakes. By 1905, membership had doubled to 100,000, half of which were scattered {{throughout the rest of the}} country. ILA leaders focused on eliminating independent <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firms</b> and securing closed shop contracts. Keefe bargained with employers, guaranteeing uninterrupted work in return for badly needed improvements in working conditions and wage increases.|$|R
2500|$|Longshoremen on the West Coast ports {{had either}} been unorganized or {{represented}} by company unions since {{the years immediately}} after World War I, when the shipping companies and <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firms</b> had imposed the open shop {{after a series of}} failed strikes. Longshoremen in San Francisco, then the major port on the coast, were required to go through a hiring hall operated by a company union, known as the [...] "blue book" [...] system for the color of the membership book.|$|R
40|$|Between around 1885 and 1920 the {{handling}} of mineral bulk cargo in the port of Rotterdam was mechanised {{by a series of}} innovations. During this process, the identity of the main innovators shifted from the local government and integrated or integrating trading and transport firms to stand-alone service providers, the so-called <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firms.</b> In order to understand this pattern, a framework of the functional sources of innovation is related to insights into the relation between innovation and integration. The issue of the appropriability of the gains of innovation, the need for co-ordination, and the levels of risk and uncertainty are the keywords in these general explanations of the identity of innovators and integration patterns in innovation. The conclusion is that the effects of appropriability {{on the one hand and}} risk and uncertainty on the other can very well explain the innovation patterns in the Rotterdam case when they are considered in an integrative manner. ...|$|R
50|$|Under the post-1996 Howard Liberal Government, {{increasing}} pressure {{was brought to}} bear on industrial relations reforms, aiming to reduce the industrial power of Australian trade unions. This included the introduction of Australian Workplace Agreements — individual contractual agreements on pay and conditions between an employee and employer — and the reduction of minimum conditions contained in Industrial awards. One of the first targets of the conservative Government was to undermine the power of the Maritime Union of Australia, through breaking its closed shop on waterfront labour. The 1998 Australian waterfront dispute resulted with <b>stevedoring</b> <b>firm,</b> Patrick Corporation under CEO Chris Corrigan, attempting to sack its entire waterfront workforce of 1400 people through company restructuring. The Australian Council of Trade Unions condemned the sacking as a gross act of collusion between Patrick, the Government, and the National Farmers Federation, and with the threat of legal action against the Government and Patrick Corporation, a settlement was negotiated to allow some reform with the MUA retaining its effective closed shop.|$|R
5000|$|Isaac Heffron {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales in either 1853 or 1858. He immigrated to United States in 1860 and settled in Galveston, Texas. Beginning in 1881, {{he worked as a}} <b>stevedore</b> for the <b>firm</b> Munn, Fry, and Company. He {{remained}} with the firm until 1885, by which point it had been renamed Fry and Heffron. [...] As Heffron’s career developed, he completed increasingly large construction projects and received substantial contracts from the City of Galveston, including one {{for the construction of a}} railroad, including a trestle bridge, connecting Galveston to La Porte, Texas.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, anti-Indian riots were {{sparked by}} a labour {{issue at the}} Yangon port. After Indian workers at the port went on strike, the British <b>firm</b> <b>Stevedores</b> tried to break the strike by hiring Burmese workers. Realizing they'd lose their jobs, the Indian workers {{returned}} to work, and Stevedores then laid off the recently hired Burmese workers. The Burmese workers blamed Indian workers for their loss of jobs, and a riot broke out. At the port, at least 200 Indian workers were massacred and dumped into the river. Another 2,000 were injured. Authorities fired upon armed rioters who refused {{to lay down their}} weapons, under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The riots rapidly spread throughout Burma, targeting Indians and Muslims.|$|R
2500|$|Then the Wobblies {{through their}} {{newspaper}} the Industrial Worker {{made the call}} for a citywide strike on May 1, 1923 (the historic May Day of international socialism). They called the announcement to “free the class prisoners” which is the IWW term {{for those who had}} been convicted and jailed under the criminal syndicalism act. On the same day, IWW leaders persuaded approximately 450 of 2,200 men to strike at refinery construction jobs two miles north of the harbor, and it seemed likely that the dispute would spread beyond the water front. Employers therefore decided to take immediate action both to prevent this and to move ships more rapidly. [...] Negotiations with the longshoremen, however, foundered on their demand for their own hiring hall and the abandonment of the Sea Service Bureau, or [...] "Fink Hall," [...] controlled by the <b>stevedoring</b> and shipping <b>firms.</b> Some 1,200 longshoremen voted to remain out until the employers met this basic request.|$|R
50|$|Gereau {{was born}} December 20, 1893 in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, then Danish West Indies, and died May 24, 1994 in Christiansted, St. Croix. His father was Mederic Gereau, a boat captain and steam engine {{mechanic}} {{from the island}} of Guadeloupe, French West Indies. His mother was Diana Beale of the island of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. Mederic Gereau broke up {{with his wife and}} relocated to the Dominican Republic where some of his relatives had previously moved. Mederic Gereau did steam engine maintenance for the Dominican sugar centrals eventually dying there. Although mostly Black, Adolph Gereau was adopted at the age of 11 in 1905 by a white family resident in Charlotte Amalie, the Ffrenches. Marie Leonides Galiber Ffrench and her husband Gustav Augustus Ffrench operated a commercial warehouse and <b>stevedoring</b> contracting <b>firm.</b> Ffrenches second wife was Esther Levy-Maduro who, though a Catholic herself, was of an illustrious Sephardic Jewish family. The Gereau and Ffrench families have been in communication since that time. One of Gereau's foster brothers, Leopold Adelbert Augustus Ffrench, moved to Mexico and a grandson Leonardo I. Ffrench serving in the diplomatic corps eventually became the Director General of the Institute for Mexicans Abroad of the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores. Adolph Gereau's wife was Annetta Brewster Gereau of Black, Asian Indian and White descent, a seamstress and herbalist active in the Episcopal Church. Her sister Louise Brewster Siebenhoven was grandmother of Michael S. Fields at one point President of Oracle USA.The Gereaus had three children Iva Liston Gereau, Edith Mercedes Gereau and Gustave Adolph Gereau.|$|R
