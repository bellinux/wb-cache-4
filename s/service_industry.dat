40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} empirically the relationship between demand fluctuations and productivity of <b>service</b> <b>industries.</b> Specifically, by using unique establishment-level data on <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> in Japan, this paper estimates production functions for six narrowly defined personal-service industries. In almost all the examined <b>service</b> <b>industries,</b> statistically and economically significant negative effects of demand variation on establishment-level productivity are found.

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> in Canada has been {{lower than that}} of good industries over the last four decades, with noticeable exceptions such as for railways and telecommunication carriers. <b>Service</b> <b>industries</b> were less economically (and technically) efficient in that they generated less output value (quantity) per hour worked (level and growth) or per combined unit of labour and capital (multifactor productivity growth) than good industries. The relative output price of services declined slightly over time compared with goods. At the disaggregated level, changing relative output prices were substantial and proved to be an important factor explaining the relative satisfactory economic {{performance of}} many <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> despite their low technical performance. Nevertheless, the output share of <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> increased over that period, sustained, mainly, by the growing recourse of all firms to outsourcing of <b>services.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Industries,</b> Real Value Analysis, Canada,...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this {{analysis}} suggest that employment in <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> acts as a double-edged sword on earnings inequality. On the one hand, we find that {{as the percentage of}} total civilian employment in <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> rises, the inequality in earnings among individuals increases. On the other hand, as the concentration of employment in <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> rises, the inequality in earnings among individuals intact husband-wife families is found to decrease. The {{results of this}} analysis suggests that the latter is largely the result of <b>service</b> <b>industries</b> providing jobs that enable both husband and wife to work outside the home.
