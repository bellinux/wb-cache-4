Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him {{that it is a}} surprise party for Michael.|$|E

Romney <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> in which any partner could veto {{one of these}} {{potential}} opportunities, and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years. The firm's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start Staples Inc., after founder Thomas G. Stemberg convinced Romney of the market size for office supplies and Romney convinced others; Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, AVEN members {{participated in}} the first asexual entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the San Francisco Pride Parade. In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an asexual flag and how to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> to create one, and {{contacting}} as many asexual communities as possible, a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Public Act51 of 1951 amended and {{clarified}} {{the current}} system of jurisdiction over roads in the state. The existing tri-level system was maintained, splitting road jurisdiction between the state, counties and cities, as well as subdividing each level into several classifications. Further legislation redefined the exact distribution, but Act51 <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source, currently the Michigan Transportation Fund. Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased. Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition, they were increased during the following decade to deal with increasing traffic. The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{accompanied}} Richard on the Third Crusade, {{and was one}} of {{the principals}} involved in raising Richard's ransom after the king was captured in Germany on his return from the Holy Land. As a reward for his faithful service, Walter was selected to become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193. He also served as Richard's justiciar until 1198, in which role he was responsible for raising the money Richard needed to prosecute his wars in France. Walter <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> that was the precursor for the modern justices of the peace, based on selecting four knights in each hundred to administer justice. He also revived his predecessor's dispute over setting up a church to rival Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, which was only settled when the pope ordered him to abandon the plan. Following Richard's death in 1199, Walter helped assure the elevation of Richard's brother John to the throne. Walter also served John as a diplomat, undertaking several missions to France.|$|E

25|$|The new {{economic}} system required an accepted vehicle for investment, trade, and payments. Unlike national economies, however, {{the international economy}} lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. In the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard, but the architects of Bretton Woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. Instead, they <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of fixed exchange rates managed {{by a series of}} newly created international institutions using the U.S. dollar (which was a gold standard currency for central banks) as a reserve currency.|$|E
25|$|COR {{was founded}} in November 1952. Before that, {{it was hard to}} get legitimately kosher meat in Toronto because there was no regulation. The Canadian Jewish Congress was asked to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> to ensure {{legitimacy}} of the kosher status of meat in Toronto. In 1954, a Rabbinical Board called the “Vaad Hakashruth of the Canadian Jewish Congress of the Central Region” was established. It then consisted of 12 Rabbis, having grown to 26 members as of 2017. In June 1956, the name of the Vaad Hakashruth was changed to the Council of Orthodox Rabbis, the source of the abbreviation COR. In the early 1960s, COR successfully appealed to Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker to have Shechita legally approved by the federal government and protected by Canadian law. For many years, Rabbi Gedalia Felder was the chairman of the Vaad Hakashruth, and in 2006, his son Rabbi Yacov Felder became the vice chairman, and eventually the chairman.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as its}} {{responsibility}} for organising the annual Co-operative Congresses, the Co-operative Union had a wider responsibility for promoting co-operation throughout the UK and worldwide. During the First World War, the Movement began to feel hostility from the Government: requests to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of rationing to prevent private traders from hoarding goods and selling them at inflated prices were initially ignored and then, when sugar rationing was finally introduced, the Union was refused {{a seat on the}} commission set up to control it although co-operatives were the largest wholesalers and retailers of sugar in the UK. A motion was put forward to the 1917 Congress to abandon the principle of political neutrality and when it was passed The National Co-operative Representation Committee was formed. Its purpose was to represent the views of the Co-operative Movement in Parliament and it was soon renamed the Co-operative Party, funded by individual societies within the Movement.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} against Article 23 laws as {{drafted by the}} HK government has been given by John Kamm, who argues that the mechanism for banning organizations would {{have the effect of}} requiring that Mainland China be more repressive outside of Hong Kong. His argument is that since 1997, Mainland China has not had the legal concept of banning an organization on national security grounds, and that political repression in the PRC takes the form of government criminal charges against individual acts. He argues that the HK government's draft of Article 23 law requires the PRC to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of banning organizations on national security grounds and this would greatly hurt members of politically sensitive organizations who are not leaders. He points out that the PRC currently typically imprisons only the leadership of an organization, and merely harasses lower-level members because their behavior does not {{rise to the level of}} criminal charges. By passing Article 23 law, Hong Kong will require the PRC to develop the legal mechanisms to punish all members of a banned political organization, a power it now only has with respect to religious organizations such as Falun gong and students who were involved in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. For example, Macau, which has implemented the Article 23, identical to the article proposed for Hong Kong, in June 2009 refused transit to mainland China by a Tiananmen student leader Wu'er Kaixi.|$|E
