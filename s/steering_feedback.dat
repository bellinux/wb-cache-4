50|$|One of Porsches primary {{objectives}} {{with the}} new model was to improve fuel economy as well as increase performance. In order to meet these objectives, Porsche introduced {{a number of new}} technologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduction of electromechanical power steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but some enthusiasts feel that the precise <b>steering</b> <b>feedback</b> for which the 911 is famous is reduced {{with the new}} system. The cars also feature an engine stop/start system which turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a coasting system which allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways.
