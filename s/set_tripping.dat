50|$|The torque {{switching}} is {{not only}} used for torque seating in the end position, but it also serves as overload protection over the whole travel and protects the valve against excessive torque. If excessive torque acts upon the closing element in an intermediate position, e.g. due to a trapped object, the torque switching will trip when reaching the <b>set</b> <b>tripping</b> torque. In this situation the end position is not signalled by the limit switch. The controls can therefore distinguish between normal operation torque switch tripping {{in one of the}} end positions and switching off in an intermediate position due to excessive torque.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} an operation command, the actuator moves the valve in direction OPEN or CLOSE. When reaching the end position, an automatic switch-off procedure is started. Two fundamentally different switch-off mechanisms can be used. The controls switch off the actuator {{as soon as}} the <b>set</b> <b>tripping</b> point has been reached. This is called limit seating. However, there are valve types for which the closing element has to be moved in the end position at a defined force or a defined torque to ensure that the valve seals tightly. This is called torque seating. The controls are programmed as to ensure that the actuator is switched off when exceeding the set torque limit. The end position is signalled by a limit switch.|$|E

In Figueira da Foz and Sines, sardine was the target species. In Sesimbra and Setúbal, focused most of their effort at horse-mackerel and demersal fish species.

50|$|Wiley Post {{became famous}} after his record <b>setting</b> <b>trip</b> {{around the world}} on June 23, 1931. In his aircraft, a Lockheed Vega nicknamed “Winnie Mae,” he managed to travel around the world in eight days 15 hours and 51 minutes. He {{accomplished}} this with the help of Harold Gatty, who served as his navigator and copilot. Two years later he set out to beat his previous record by flying around the world by himself. He wanted to prove that one man could accomplish the same trip without a copilot. In order to accomplish this, he equipped the Winnie Mae with a Sperry gyroscope autopilot and a radio direction finder. Although he experienced some problems with the autopilot, he completed the trip in seven days, 18 hours and 49 minutes. The use of the autopilot and radio direction finder is credited for making the task of navigating the aircraft much easier and more efficient. The use of an autopilot reduced the physical and mental demands on Post as he flew around the world.|$|R

40|$|Singapore {{is known}} for its {{successful}} implementation of land transport management measures in the form of car-use restraining schemes and car-ownership control policy. This paper presents a study that examines how these management measures have affected the travel characteristics of car owners in Singapore. This is achieved by analyzing the changes in passenger car travel characteristics from 1990 to 2005. In 1990 and again in 2005, a vehicle-based travel diary survey was conducted to determine the travel characteristics of car owners. For each participating car owner, the details of all trips made over an average period of 4 weeks were collected. The 1990 survey covered 115 cars and generated 11, 638 <b>sets</b> of <b>trip</b> data, while the 2005 survey involved 108 cars that produced 11, 336 <b>sets</b> of <b>trip</b> data. These data were processed to provide information of travel characteristics in travel speed, travel distance, travel duration, trip purpose, passenger occupancy level, time that travel was made, and the choice of road class. Comparisons of the car travel characteristics in 1990 and 2005 were made to identify major trends of changes. An attempt is also made to relate these changes to the land transport management measures and policies implemented during the 15 -year study period...|$|R

On 8 May, White ordered the Marines to pull their artillery guns inside the defensive perimeter, so they could better defend their position {{from the top of}} the -high hill feature. The Marines spent the entire evening of 8 May taking the first howitzer completely apart in order to take it up the hill. That night, enemy soldiers <b>set</b> off <b>trip</b> flares and again the Nung soldiers threw grenades in response. On 9 May, Captain Chris Silva flew to Ngok Tavak to discuss the reliability of his troops with his Australian counterpart, but was prevented from returning to Khâm Đức due to poor weather. On that day, the second howitzer was dragged into the garrison, so the Nungs and Marines both guarded the perimeter of Ngok Tavak. Infantry protection was provided by the 1st and 2nd Nung platoons, which held the eastern side of the garrison, while the suspect Montagnard CIDG soldiers guarded the eastern entrance. Overlooking them were some Marines of Battery D, 2nd Battalion.|$|R
