5|$|Staff {{available}} for employment include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of <b>staff</b> <b>can</b> cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down, crime, and unhappy visitors. If visitors become unhappy, thugs {{may come to}} vandalise the park by committing offences such as popping balloons, stealing food, and beating up entertainers. Occasionally, wages {{and the price of}} goods must be negotiated; failure to reach an agreement results in staff strikes or loss of shipment.|$|E

5|$|The FSU {{campus is}} served by eight bus routes of the Seminole Express Bus Service. The Seminole Express Bus Service {{provides}} transportation to, around, and from campus to the surrounding Tallahassee areas for Faculty, Staff, Students and Visitors. All students, faculty and <b>staff</b> <b>can</b> also ride any StarMetro bus throughout the City of Tallahassee for free by swiping a valid FSUCard. FSU also provides other campus services, including Spirit Shuttle (during football games), Nole Cab, S.A.F.E. Connection, and Night Nole nighttime service.|$|E
5|$|Theme Park offers {{three levels}} of simulation: the higher {{difficulties}} requiring more management of aspects such as logistics. For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On sandbox, the game does not involve those aspects. The player can switch mode at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: {{at the end of}} each year, the player is judged on that year's performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and <b>staff</b> <b>can</b> be moved by the player. Cash awards may be earned for doing well, and trophies may be awarded for achievements such as having the longest roller coaster.|$|E
30|$|Our {{research}} results contain {{the following three}} parts: First, our system can successfully track user’s movement. And consequently, most of the measurement results, which was originally performed by subject with the assistant of medical <b>staffs,</b> <b>can</b> now be recorded automatically under the help of volunteer. Therefore our system is able to release medical staffs’ burden. Second, our system can measure and visualize user’s body temperature automatically. In addition, through our graphical interface, helpers and medical <b>staffs</b> <b>can</b> acknowledge auxiliary information of subject’s body condition more easily than the conventional way. Third, our system provides a user-friendly multimodal interface for elders, such as the virtual buttons with webcam-based gesture recognizer, etc.|$|R
50|$|In larger schools, {{there is}} usually {{sufficient}} flexibility in staffing to allow students a free choice and <b>staffing</b> <b>can</b> then be adjusted accordingly. Large schools have the additional advantage that they can offer {{a wider range of}} subjects including those that only small numbers of students select.|$|R
50|$|In the Northwest Coast, talking sticks are {{carved wooden}} <b>staffs,</b> which <b>can</b> either bear a single crest {{at the top}} or be fully carved with heraldic clan crests of the chief or {{hereditary}} political spokesman. The <b>staffs</b> <b>can</b> include shell inlay. The staffs resemble small totem poles and are still used ceremonially today. At gatherings, especially potlatches, a chief or his designated speaker holds the talking stick and publicly announces message. The speaker thumps the stick {{on the ground for}} emphasis. A feather {{has been used as a}} stand-in for the talking stick.|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when <b>staff</b> <b>can</b> go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} comes {{equipped with a}} staff after {{the initial stages of}} the game, which functions as both a weapon, and a tool for exploration and puzzle-solving. Combat is mainly melee-orientated, with players locking-on to an enemy upon moving in close. Once in combat, an enemy's health is displayed as a heart icon above them, with players able to strafe and roll around a target to dodge attack, while using the staff to either block incoming strikes, or attack an enemy. As a tool, the <b>staff</b> <b>can</b> be used to open containers, operate mechanisms, or lift up stones to uncover hidden caves and boulders to find items. As the player progress in the story, the <b>staff</b> <b>can</b> be upgraded with powers that can help in combat or assist in solving puzzles and exploring locations, including the ability to fire projectiles at enemies or trigger switches, and a special jump ability to reach places that are inaccessible through normal methods. However, using such powers requires magical energy, which the player can recover by retrieving special crystals from the environment. Along with the staff, the player can also has a sidekick that joins them after a certain stage of the story, who can help by finding them items and using certain abilities to open up new areas. Such abilities, referred to as tricks, require the player to feed them with special mushrooms, with each one constituting one trick that can be performed, with the sidekick able to perform a maximum of six tricks when fully fed before needing more mushrooms. The game's inventory system focuses on three areas - items, staff powers, and tricks - with the player able to use three scanner systems in the game - a mini-map of a region (provided a map has been purchased first), a scanner to give information on objects in that are approached, and a fuel cell radar.|$|E

Outside, Affection Section is a petting zoo featuring goats, sheep, and other domesticated animals.|$|E
25|$|The staff sling has {{a similar}} or {{superior}} range to the shepherd's sling, and can be as accurate in practiced hands. It is generally suited for heavier missiles and siege situations as <b>staff</b> slings <b>can</b> achieve very steep trajectories for slinging over obstacles such as castle walls. The <b>staff</b> itself <b>can</b> become a close combat weapon in a melee. The <b>staff</b> sling <b>can</b> throw heavy projectiles a much greater distance and at a higher arc than a hand sling. Staff slings were in use well into the age of gunpowder as grenade launchers, and were used in ship-to-ship combat to throw incendiaries.|$|R
