5|$|This is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> action {{imposed on}} Indonesia during the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997, {{when it was}} forced by the IMF to close 16 banks at the same time, prompting a bank run.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E
5|$|The Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French colonies that later pledged allegiance to the pro-German Vichy government. The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5000|$|History {{records the}} horrendous {{aftermath}} of the lovers' catastrophe, events in <b>starkest</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conciliatory tone expressed by Shakespeare's Lords Montague and Capulet on the last page of that play.

5000|$|Several {{contemporary}} issues surface {{multiple times}} in Gibbes' writing: child neglect, lack of female education, acquisitiveness, gambling, and personal vanity. Many of her heroines, particularly Sophia 'Goldborne' - a somewhat onomastic name - are <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> materialistic, indulgent {{culture of the}} time, as discussed above; {{and yet at the}} same time, appear to relish female materialism. One can see in this scene in which Gibbes creates a vivid picture of extravagance, this slightly awe-filled distaste at both the foolishness and the power involved in materialism, ...|$|R

5|$|This is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stance {{taken by}} his predecessor, Clinton, whose {{approach}} {{and response to}} India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
500|$|Design firm Sarofsky {{once again}} {{worked on the}} film's main-on-end title {{sequence}}, having done the same for Winter Soldier. The sequence used [...] "muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey" [...] colors, which were <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sequences for Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the later created by Method Design) which were [...] "a minimalist graphic approach, reducing <b>the</b> key players <b>to</b> silhouettes and paring <b>the</b> palette down <b>to</b> three colors" [...] and [...] "vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes <b>to</b> life, enticing <b>the</b> viewer <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> fray", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted {{one of the challenges}} for Civil Wars sequence was [...] "to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence" [...] given the number of characters in the film.|$|R

5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal {{with the realities of}} postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Empire's {{successful}} navigation {{of these}} crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil {{emerged as a}} hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as {{freedom of the press}} and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E
40|$|Sustainability is {{currently}} the term dominating environmental policy. Its extensive political diffusion is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent <b>to</b> which there is agreement over its meaning. Its ability to motivate is not in question, but a certain scepticism surrounds its ideological content. Since ideological terms have no objective basis, it is therefore important {{for the purposes of}} environmental policy to establish whether such scepticism is justified...|$|R
5000|$|Lever Brothers {{operated}} {{from the}} Belgian Congo beginning in 1911. In response to civil unrest by the Congolese, the company [...] "demanded more troops, more police and more brutality. When the railway lines around the Congo River rapids were rebuilt between 1923 and 1932 the regime mobilised 68,000 forced labourers of which 7,700 died". Due to their {{involvement with the}} Belgian Congo, there was a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> Leverhulmes are remembered at home in England.|$|R
40|$|Emirati {{students}} at public universities {{have a wide}} demographic of faculty members teaching them courses in their second language, English.

5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship {{for the first}} time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
2500|$|Scaddan's many {{reforms were}} {{achieved}} despite constant obstruction from the Legislative Council. [...] The government won {{only a third}} of all divisions in the Legislative Council, and this is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> treatment of <b>the</b> Wilson governments before and after Scaddan's government, who never lost a single bill in the upper house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{series was}} {{created as a}} <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> X-Men: <b>The</b> Animated Series. The Series Bible was written by Robert N. Skir and Marty Isenberg (albeit uncredited), who meant <b>to</b> take <b>The</b> X-Men back <b>to</b> their roots as high school {{students}} learning to control their superpowers, as when the comics termed them [...] "The Strangest Teens Of All". Whereas the Fox series reflected the then-current role of X-Men as freedom fighters battling persecution and bigotry against mutantkind, X-Men: Evolution used the theme of mutant powers {{as a metaphor for}} the struggles of adolescence.|$|R
50|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit I in Germany {{is also known}} as the unemployment insurance. The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> FUTA in <b>the</b> US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer.|$|R
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows {{a photograph of a}} trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through {{the building of a}} new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5000|$|Mahdavy's {{usage of}} the term is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> term was {{originally}} used by Marxists. Lenin wrote in 1916: For that reason the term “rentier state” (Rentnerstaat), or usurer state, is coming into common use in the economic literature that deals with imperialism. The world has become divided into a handful of usurer states and {{a vast majority of}} debtor states. (...) According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Soviet Encyclopedia, a rentier state enriches itself by exporting capital to other states, primarily those that are economically underdeveloped and dependent. [...] This is better known in English as Rentier capitalism.|$|R
50|$|It is self-evident that Zum Schluß, whose {{text and}} music are in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> all of <b>the</b> other waltzes in both Op. 52 and Op. 65, is a {{personal}} statement by Brahms, who throughout the troubled relationships in his life (sich Jammer und Glück wechseln in liebender Brust) found solace in music (Linderung kommt einzig, ihr Musen, von euch).|$|R
2500|$|... 1997 – The first {{installment}} of the Fallout series, a video game series set in an alternate earth post-apocalyptic world, is released by Black Isle Studios/Interplay. Both the visual style and many Inseries references deal with the atomic age optimism towards nuclear power and <b>the</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> it creates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post-apocalyptic wasteland.|$|R
5|$|In <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Middle Ages, when Latin {{scholars}} focused {{almost entirely}} on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de' Niccoli (1364–1437) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.|$|E
5|$|John Service, {{while under}} Stilwell's command, {{served as a}} {{diplomatic}} observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking. Over the next three months, he sent {{a series of reports}} to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang. This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies, and this position ruined both careers.|$|E
5|$|The matchup of closers, Mariano Rivera and Brad Lidge, {{also drew}} attention. Rivera and Lidge {{were the only}} closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason, whereas closers on other postseason teams blew 11 saves in the 24 postseason games before the World Series in 2009. Both had {{performed}} well during the postseason, but Lidge had posted a 7.21 ERA during the 2009 regular season, in contrast to Rivera's 1.76. Lidge's 2009 numbers were in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous season (41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games). As a result, USA Today gave the Yankees the edge, noting that Lidge had blown two saves against the Yankees during their regular season series earlier that year.|$|E
40|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of the Roman Emperor Nero (37 - 68 A. D.) several impostors showed up in the Eastern Roman Empire. They were {{received}} with happiness and jubilation by the general population [...] a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> impression he has left, and the reputation he holds nowadays.

5000|$|Lilly's fun-loving, cheeky {{personality}} is in <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Dot's and <b>the</b> two often wind {{each other up}} with their obvious personality differences. She once even tries to persuade Dot that Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) has amorous intentions towards her, which has Dot {{in a bit of}} a fluster.
