40|$|The road {{widening}} {{carried out}} along National Highway- 40, a <b>strategic</b> <b>road</b> <b>corridor</b> of north-eastern India, {{to ease the}} traffic snarls for geopolitical developments in the region. The newly exposed in situ soil slopes along National Highway- 40 {{are on the verge}} of shear instability, and slope failures occur due to heavy earth cuttings. As a consequence, the road corridor witnesses several geotechnical failures during rainy seasons. The blasting activities initiated and propagated the soil creeps and falls resulting road blockades. Even a small rain shower is enough to undercut and uproot trees and transport boulders and surrounding earth materials up to the corridor. Besides, landslides are also prone to damage demographic areas and settling house units, thus invites for preventive measures towards hill slope management as these slopes make the highway corridor unsafe to the commuters. Therefore, the present study is aimed to investigate the stability of the hill cut soil slopes and to suggest possible stabilisation measures. The study also highlighted that steep soil slopes with high moisture content are prone to landslides mainly due to infiltration, and water flows on the slopes during high and prolonged rainfall. The highly plastic soils rich in silt and clay size particles with high moisture content cause soil/debris slide and flow. The numerical modelling of slopes using Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) codes (version 4. 0) indicates failures in excavated high angle cut slopes. The re-excavation and benching of unstable slopes with geonets or bionets or jute matting to promote vegetation growth were suggested as stabilisation measures by field investigation, laboratory studies and numerical analysis of slopes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study of a <b>road</b> <b>corridor</b> in the {{historical}} city of Lucca (Tuscany, Italy) following {{the transfer of the}} city hospital to a new location, which took place in May 2014. Lucca is surrounded by a ring road and the <b>road</b> <b>corridor</b> study was related to alleviating the problems actually experienced by ambulances travelling from the urban ring road to the new hospital. The <b>corridor</b> <b>road</b> length is about 1. 5 km (i. e. 0. 93 miles), and there are seven different intersections along the corridor, spanning from signalized to two-way stop controlled and roundabouts. SIDRA INTERSECTION 6. 0 (NETWORK version) was used to analyze the two scenarios; namely, the “present situation ” and the “design situation ” to verify the effectiveness of some proposed local changes and intersection improvements. The analyses indicated that “Level of Service D ” (the target value required in the urban field) could be achieved for the “design situation ” while “Level of Service F ” was indicated for the “present situation”. The analysis results strongly supported the design proposal of improving the west <b>road</b> <b>corridor</b> for accessing the new hospital of Lucca. This is particularly important considering that ambulances are the most crucial users of the <b>road</b> <b>corridor.</b> The analyses also showed that significant improvements could be made to traffic performance in the <b>road</b> <b>corridor</b> in general, including environmental benefits in terms of reduced fuel consumption and emissions. This study has been possible thanks to SIDRA INTERSECTION 6. 0 (NETWORK version) that showed its capability of modelling both single intersections and the <b>road</b> <b>corridor...</b>|$|R

40|$|Complex road projects, {{particularly}} near sensitive locations, {{often have}} substantial effects on humans and theenvironment caused by construction, production processes {{and the use}} phase. Before a road alignment isdetermined, several <b>road</b> <b>corridors</b> are identified and evaluated during early planning stages. Oftentimes thisevaluation focuses on impacts of the finished road whereas construction and production processes frequently areignored, risking viable corridors to be discarded before having been sufficiently evaluated. Existing IT-systemsenables modeling of relevant aspects such as <b>road</b> <b>corridors,</b> noise, pollution, production and construction, butthere is often a lack of interoperability between these systems. Interoperability problems can be faced withExtract Transform Load (ETL) tools but {{this has not been}} adequately examined regarding infrastructure projects. Our study presents a novel method for evaluating <b>road</b> <b>corridors</b> that includes production aspects, which arevisualized and analyzed in 3 D. By using ETL technology to handle interoperability problems, existing tools forroad corridor planning, production planning and 3 D visualization are used to demonstrate the method.
