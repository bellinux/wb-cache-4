The Doctor <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Ben will become an Admiral and that Polly will look after Ben, but it is unclear {{if this is a}} {{prediction}} or simply wishing them well. In the audio story The Five Companions, an older Polly tells the Fifth Doctor that she and Ben are still together.|$|E

In The Sarah Jane Adventures story Death of the Doctor (2010), Sarah Jane mentions that Polly is now working at an orphanage in India with Ben.|$|E
25|$|Paneb {{was accused}} of many charges of sexual assault and adultery, though there are many ambiguities in the text which make {{the exact nature of}} the charges unclear. The charges are special in that they are alleged by his son Aapehty to the door-keepers, who are the people who stand {{at the door of the}} tomb at work-sites, but also serve various other functions, {{including}} possible legal functions. Though Černý <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the door-keepers might have served the role of bailiffs, A.G. McDowell, a prominent Egyptologist in the study of Deir el-Medina, speculates that the door-keepers' legal function was small, and that Aapehty only testified to them because they stood in a public part of the worksite.|$|E

500|$|Kettner's Book of the Table of 1877, {{describing}} Francatelli as [...] "a type of all {{the great}} French cooks", asserted that he [...] "gives a most elaborate recipe for aspic jelly; and he is so satisfied with it that, having to prepare a cold supper for 300 people, he works it up {{in every one of}} his 56 dishes which are neither sweet nor hot. The book further argues that [...] "this is the result of science—this the height of art. It produces, with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies, an aspic jelly without aspic, that, exhausted in the effort, it can proceed no further, and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> here at last, in this supreme sauce, we have a sure resting-place—the true blessedness—the ewigkeit." ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin Lyon observes, [...] "The plot {{revolves}} around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke." [...] While noting that the device is [...] "striking", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely [...] "warped" [...] individuals. She suggests that [...] "Neal and Berti... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other." [...] Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his own violent acts are simply part {{of some kind of}} [...] "elaborate fiction". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, [...] "It was like a book... a book!" ...|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower had {{supported}} nuclear testing after World War II. In 1947, he rejected arguments by Stafford L. Warren, the Manhattan Project's chief physician, concerning the detrimental {{health effects of}} atmospheric testing, agreeing instead with James Bryant Conant, a chemist and participant in the Manhattan Project, who was skeptical of Warren's then-theoretical claims. Warren's arguments were lent credence {{in the scientific community}} and public by the Castle Bravo test of 1954. Eisenhower, as president, first explicitly expressed interest in a comprehensive test ban that year, arguing before the National Security Council, [...] "We could put [...] on the spot if we accepted a moratorium... Everybody <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we're skunks, saber-rattlers and warmongers. We ought not miss any chance to make clear our peaceful objectives." [...] Then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had responded skeptically to the limited arms-control suggestion of Nehru, whose proposal for a test ban was discarded by the National Security Council for being [...] "not practical." [...] Harold Stassen, Eisenhower's special assistant for disarmament, argued that the US should prioritize a test ban as a first step towards comprehensive arms control, conditional on the Soviet Union accepting on-site inspections, over full disarmament. Stassen's suggestion was dismissed by others in the administration over fears that the Soviet Union would be able to conduct secret tests. On the advice of Dulles, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Lewis Strauss, and Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, Eisenhower rejected the idea of considering a test ban outside general disarmament efforts. During the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections, Eisenhower fended off challenger Adlai Stevenson, who ran in large part on support for a test ban.|$|E

2500|$|Colin Brown, in {{response}} to criticisms from Staines that the media are too cosy with politicians, said: [...] "We would love to go into print with things that we hear and believe to be true, but cannot prove, but the libel laws are such that we cannot put things into newspapers that he [...] <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he {{can get away with}} on the internet.

2500|$|... "Y is almighty" [...] {{means that}} Y {{is not just}} more {{powerful}} than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully. In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, Anselm of Canterbury <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> almightiness {{is one of the}} things that make God count as omnipotent.|$|E
2500|$|Winship {{proceeded}} {{to declare war}} against the Nationalists, in response to which Jaime Benítez Rexach, {{a student at the}} University of Chicago at the time, wrote a letter to President Roosevelt which in part read as follows: [...] "The point I am to make is that the Governor (Winship) himself through his military approach to things has helped keep Puerto Rico in an unnecessary state of turmoil. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and that everybody else should keep out. As a matter of fact he has played the Nationalist game and they have played his.|$|E

2500|$|Many critics seem {{to agree}} with H.E. Rollins that Shakespeare's Sonnets [...] "provide direct {{evidence}} concerning Shakespeare's private life". Even Horace Furness <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "absurdities" [...] found in the grammar of the couplet in Sonnet 4 may have used as tactics of emphasizing {{a message to the}} reader and addressee. He says that they pose questions that [...] "are more easily asked than answered". There was even a scholar who posed the idea that the sonnets are divided into [...] "two groups: all those which suggest moral irregularities are 'dramatic'; the rest are written in Shakespeare's own person". There is no doubt that Shakespeare has one major if not many messages that he is sending to the world through his sonnets. Sonnet four is a prime example.|$|E
2500|$|A Burning Man {{spokeswoman}} {{replied that}} the policies are not new, {{were written by}} a {{former head of the}} EFF, were used when suing to block pornographic videos and ultimately arose from participant concerns: [...] "We’re proud that Black Rock City (a private event held on public land) is widely acknowledged as a bastion of creative freedom. ut that protection [...] does necessitate the acceptance of some general terms of engagement when it comes to cameras... EFF <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> anyone attending any event somehow has an absolute right to take photographs, and then to do whatever they want with those images without any effective restriction or manner of enforcement. While we believe that such rights do make sense for any of us taking pictures in purely public spaces, this is not true in the private space of Burning Man – if it were it would mean that Burning Man couldn’t protect participant privacy or prevent commercialization of imagery." ...|$|E
