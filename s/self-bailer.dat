50|$|The cockpit {{includes}} a double bottom (or false floor) which extends through {{almost to the}} bow, with deep, <b>self-bailer</b> equipped footwells {{each side of the}} centreline; a detachable foredeck was developed but has not been a feature of production boats. While the production deck, which extends well forward of the forestay fitting, would lend itself very well to incorporation of a spinnaker chute, none was ever fitted by the manufacturers, spinnaker stowage relying instead on an elasticated pocket or 'turtle' before the mast, under which the spinnaker could readily be stuffed.|$|E
50|$|The B14 is {{designed}} {{with a low}} center of gravity for added stability and an open transom, to help the boat to drain itself quickly and without need of a <b>self-bailer.</b> The mast is set far back in the boat {{to make room for}} the large asymmetric spinnaker.The boat has a fast handicap, with a Portsmouth Yardstick of 870, designed with racing in mind. For this reason it is highly suitable for more experienced sailors. The boat does not have a trapeze, but instead makes use of wide wings.|$|E
50|$|Elvstr√∏m {{was also}} noted as a {{developer}} of sails and sailing equipment. One {{of his most}} successful innovations was {{a new type of}} <b>self-bailer.</b> The design is still in production under the Andersen brand and has been widely copied. The new features were a wedge shaped venturi that closes automatically if the boat grounds or hits an obstruction, and a flap that acts as a non return valve to minimise water coming in if the boat is stationary or moving too slowly for the device to work. Previous automatic bailers would be damaged or destroyed if they met an obstruction, and would let considerable amounts of water in if the boat was moving too slowly.|$|E

5000|$|Andersen-style <b>self-bailers</b> {{are also}} useful for {{engine-driven}} and sailing dinghies. These slot-shaped [...] project {{into the stream}} below the hull and open when submerged and moving rapidly using the venturi effect. The downside of this solution {{is that if the}} boat is beached in sand, it can clog the <b>self-bailers</b> until the boat is inverted and the sand removed. These devices do not replace a hand-bailer as they are only useful if the vessel is moving.|$|R
50|$|Major {{changes to}} the National Swallow Class Rules in the 1970s enabled the move to grp construction, the {{addition}} of <b>self-bailers</b> (4) and, in 2010, the modernisation of the fore and aft rig, with a higher aspect ratio mainsail and lower footed jib. The latest rule change for 2014 is to allow electric bilge pumps.|$|R
50|$|The hull is a {{hard chine}} design with a slight curve to the bottom section, and a bulb keel. Stars were {{originally}} rigged with a large, low-aspect-ratio gunter mainsail and jib, which {{was replaced by a}} short bermuda rig in 1921, before the current tall bermuda sail plan was adopted in 1930. In 1965, fiberglass replaced wood as the primary hull material. Other changes to the strict design rules for the Star class, include adding flexible spars, an innovative circular-track boom vang, and <b>self-bailers.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{the past}} century, Lake Cochichewick has been North Andover's main supply of {{drinking}} water and public access to the lake was forbidden. In May 2002, however, the town began issuing boating permits: Certain watercraft are allowed and must be designed to be manually propelled, by oars or paddles. Rowing shells, johnboats, dinghies, rowboats, canoes and kayaks are acceptable {{as long as the}} occupants are isolated from contact with the lake. Boats must not have any thru-holes (e.g. <b>self-bailers)</b> that would allow contact between the occupants and the lake water. Electric motors are acceptable as an alternate form of propulsion. The maximum length of a motorized craft is 15 feet. Inflatable boats, windsurfers and seaplanes are not allowed. No domestic animals are allowed to be in boats, on the ice, or in the water at any time.|$|R
