30|$|Since {{the data}} stem from {{administrative}} processes, wages are right-censored at the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contribution</b> assessment <b>ceiling.</b> For male workers, {{the share of}} censored wages varies between 9 % and 14 % annually, for women censoring affects less than 5 % of the observations. Right-censoring will, however, only marginally affect our analysis, since we mainly focus on median wages and on young workers receiving starting wages. For calculating wage premia in the analysis below, we impute wages above the censoring threshold according to Gartner (2005). In line with Dustmann et al. (2009), we further impose the restriction that the daily wage observation is at least 20  Deutschmark (in 1995 DM). In addition, we correct for a structural break of the wage variable from 1983 to 1984, when bonus payments {{have been included in}} the data. Thereby, we follow the approach by Dustmann et al. (2009) that extends the solution suggested by Fitzenberger (1999). Lastly, we adjust wages to inflation.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{will examine}} the causes behind the higher level of {{compliance}} with <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> in comparison with other tax categories {{in the case of}} Slovenia. The results of econometric models suggest that the activities of the Tax Administration of the Republic of Slovenia, which were more stringently performed in the area of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> in the most recent period, are an important - but not the only factor - behind the higher level of compliance in connection with <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions.</b> At the same time, the decrease in tax compliance with other taxes (income tax, corporate income tax, and VAT) did not essentially influence the higher level of compliance with <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions.</b> The more consistent treatment of unpaid <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> as a criminal offence and the higher public awareness about the importance of paying <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> in the latest period are recognized as important factors which simultaneously constitute the main difference between <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> and other taxes. The higher level of public awareness about the benefits that result from public services financed with taxes is recognized as a possible way to more optimally collect taxes in Slovenia...|$|R
30|$|Whereas {{the wage}} {{information}} {{included in the}} LIAB is highly reliable, there are two shortcomings of the data crucial to our investigation: Firstly, the data set includes daily wages only and no detailed information on working hours. As a consequence, we have to exclude part-time workers. Secondly, wages are top-coded at the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>ceiling,</b> which affects 16.2 per cent of our male and 6.0 per cent of our female observations. To deal with this second issue, we apply the standard single imputation procedure proposed by Gartner ([2005]) and impute top-coded wages. In a first step, we estimate yearly Tobit models for each combination of sex and competition (e.g., females working for plants facing strong competition), where the regressand is the log daily gross wage and the regressors are those included in the subsequent analysis. In a second step, for every observation with a top-coded wage, a random value is drawn from a normal distribution left-truncated at the respective <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>ceiling,</b> with the predicted log wage as mean and the standard deviation as estimated from the Tobit models 4.|$|E
3000|$|A {{shortcoming}} of the LIAB is that daily {{gross wages}} are censored at the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>ceiling,</b> viz. € 172.60 in West Germany and € 149.59 in East Germany in 2007. This affects 23.7  per cent of West German and 7.6  per cent of East German observations. Obviously, using the wage data without any correction {{may result in}} misleading estimates. To {{deal with the problem}} of censored wages, we impute wages above these thresholds. 6 Assuming that daily gross wages follow a log-normal distribution, which seems to be a plausible approximation, we apply the single-imputation procedure proposed by Gartner (2005). In a first step, we estimate Tobit models for each combination of gender and leadership regime (e.g., for females employed in owner-run plants) separately for our East German and West German samples, where the dependent variable is the log daily gross wage and the regressors are those included in the further analysis. In a second step, for every censored observation a random value is drawn from a normal distribution left-truncated at the respective <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>ceiling</b> with predicted log wage as mean and standard deviation as estimated from the Tobit models. 7 [...]...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between high <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> {{and the local}} labour market performance has been and still is intensively discussed in the political arena. Various reform concepts suggested by members of politics and associations are going around. Some measures to restrict the increase in <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> have been implemented over the past years. To evaluate the different reform approaches, the causal {{relationship between}} <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> and employment is of significant importance. The question at the crux of this issue is what effects a change/reduction in the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contribution</b> rates has on firstly, labour supply and demand alone, and then, when taking into consideration circular-flow effects, on the employment level in {{the economy as a}} whole. The analyses of supply and demand show that by reducing <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> ceteris paribus additional manpower can be motivated to take up employment, and that companies would be prepared to hire additional workers. This is also true at macroeconomic level. Without counter-financing, the circular-flow model predicts a permanent increase in labour demand, and thus in employment, by 150, 000 to 160, 000 people {{in the case of a}} linear reduction in <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> by one percentage point. Considerably lower or even slightly negative employment effects result from counter-financing with direct or indirect taxes or a combination thereof. If the reduction in <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions</b> is carried out in an asymmetrical way, for example by means of a tax-free allowance, this results in considerably higher labour market effects than with a linear reduction with an identical volume of financial relief. In order to really be able to realise the additional employment opportunities of low-skilled and low-wage workers provided by an asymmetrical reduction in <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>contributions,</b> it would also be important when developing supporting wage policies, for tax increases which also affect low-income groups not to result in a disproportionately large increase in the lower wage groups. This concluding finding shows again the importance of a close co-operation between fiscal policy and collective bargaining policy.
