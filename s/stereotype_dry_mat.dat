The remainder is spent drinking/preening (about 8 %) and in bouts o f alertness, social behaviour and flying (about 2 % each). The average flight distance o f the geese between roosts, roost and feeding site and between feeding sites is 5. 1 km, the average flight velocity is 43. 8 km/h. A White-fronted Goose (m ean weight 2. 4 kg) requires about 1500 g fresh weight (300 g dry matter) and a Bean Goose (m ean weight 3. 5 kg) about 1950 g fresh weight (390 g <b>dry</b> <b>mat</b> ter) o f grass daily respectively. A gooseday (g d) is therefore a variable quantity, depending on the species. The feeding intensity measured in goosedays per hectare (gd/ha) only has validity for a specific goose species. The disturbance o f geese promotes activities with a high energy consumption and reduces all activities that save energy.

Periphyton is an important primary producer and important food resource in the Everglades. Periphyton is also involved in marl soil formation and nutrient cycling. Although periphyton is {{an important component of the}} Everglades landscape, little is known about periphyton structural-functional variation between hydroperiods. ^ For this study diatoms, as well as fresh algae slides of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae were identified and enumerated.

Short and long hydroperiod periphyton mats have the same algal species, it is the distribution and abundance that varies between hydroperiods. Long hydroperiod mats have greater diatom abundance while short hydroperiod mats have greater relative filamentous cyanobacterial abundance. ^ Long hydroperiod mats had greater net primary production (npp) than short hydroperiod mats.

40|$|Recently, {{unidirectional}} rigid gluten biocomposites {{have received}} attention because the glassy gluten matrix has comparable properties as an epoxy resin. This research proposes some possibilities to facilitate such biocomposites. The dry method is modiﬁed by using water exposed ﬁbers rather than dry ones. The wet method uses an ethanol solution to suspend and partly dissolve original or milled gluten particles, {{in which the}} ﬁbers are subsequently immersed. <b>Drying</b> impregnated ﬁber <b>mats</b> obtained via either the modiﬁed dry or wet method leads to prepregs of which stacks were compression molded into composites {{without the need for}} any further solvents or plasticizers. Gluten composites made by the wet method give much higher moduli and strengths compared to when using either of the dry methods. Using aqueous ethanol helps to dissolve part of the gluten (the gliadin fraction) and is believed to lead to a good wetting of the matrix between the ﬁbers. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The Dakelh {{engaged in}} {{extensive}} {{trade with the}} coast along trails known as [...] "Grease Trails". The items exported consisted primarily of hides, <b>dried</b> meat, and <b>mats</b> of <b>dried</b> berries. Imports consisted of various marine products, {{the most important of}} which was [...] "grease", the oil extracted from eulachons (also known as [...] "candlefish") by allowing them to rot, adding boiling water, and skimming off the oil. This oil is extremely nutritious and, unlike many other fats, contains desirable fatty acids. Other important imports were smoked eulachons and dried red laver seaweed. [...] "Grease" [...] and smoked eulachons are still {{considered by many to be}} delicacies and are prized gifts from visitors from the west. The route by which Sir Alexander MacKenzie and his party reached the Pacific Ocean in 1793 in the first crossing of North America by land was, from the Fraser River westward, a grease trail. Other examples include the Cheslatta Trail and the Nyan Wheti.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A five level {{four factors}} central {{composite}} rotatable design under response surface methodology {{was used to}} optimize process conditions of the foam <b>mat</b> <b>drying</b> process i. e. egg albumen (0 %- 12 %), methyl cellulose (0. 1 %- 0. 5 %), drying bed thickness (3 - 7 mm) and drying temperature (55 - 75 °C) to develop grape bar with final moisture content of 14 %± 1 % (dry-base). Contour and response graphs were generated {{and the effect of}} foaming parameters on the quality parameters namely drying time, color change, texture, non-enzymatic browning, total sugars (%), titratable acidity (%), protein (%) and overall acceptability (%) were studied. Significant regression models were established with the coefficient of determination, R 2 (≥ 0. 90). Optimization of process for grape bar was performed to result minimum drying time, color change, cutting force, non enzymatic browning and maximum overall acceptability and optimized process conditions were 5. 51 % egg albumen, 0. 31 % methyl cellulose, 4 mm drying bed thickness and 60 °C drying temperature with desirability 0. 74...|$|R
