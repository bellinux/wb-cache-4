5|$|Carey also {{requested}} that the Sounders have their own marching band, {{the first of its}} kind in MLS. This led to the creation of the <b>Sound</b> <b>Wave,</b> a 53-member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion. The band plays music from multiple genres, such as Latin, rock and pop, and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field. The March to the Match, in which fans march from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field before each home match, has been accompanied by the <b>Sound</b> <b>Wave.</b>|$|E
5|$|Consonants and vowel {{segments}} {{combine to}} form syllables, {{which in turn}} combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the <b>sound</b> <b>wave),</b> and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
50|$|Nonlinear {{acoustics}} (NLA) is {{a branch}} of physics and acoustics dealing with <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> of sufficiently large amplitudes. Large amplitudes require using full systems of governing equations of fluid dynamics (for <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in liquids and gases) and elasticity (for <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in solids). These equations are generally nonlinear, and their traditional linearization is no longer possible. The solutions of these equations show that, due {{to the effects of}} nonlinearity, <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> are being distorted as they travel.|$|R
50|$|The Phonodeik {{is a sound}} {{recording}} apparatus invented by Dayton Miller in 1908. The Phonodeik converts <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> into visual images. The name was suggested by Edward W. Morley. Before electronic oscilloscopes, this device was used for analyzing <b>sounds</b> <b>waves.</b> The Phonodeik can be modified to project <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> on a screen for public demonstration.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{expanding}} the regular chorus, O'Neill created the <b>Sound</b> <b>Waves</b> in 2008. The <b>Sound</b> <b>Waves</b> are a specialized group of singers. Within four years the group expanded from 9 to 15 singers. The <b>Sound</b> <b>Waves</b> {{have been asked}} to perform at the North Shore Music Theater, Boston University, and other local venues. The <b>Sound</b> <b>Waves</b> perform at almost all school holiday assemblies and have even been on local radio and television. The group often does charity events to raise money for various charity organizations such as HEART and sells CDs every year of their music.|$|R
25|$|Sir Isaac Newton {{computed}} {{the speed}} of sound in air as , which is too low by about 15%,. Newton's analysis was good save for neglecting the (then unknown) effect of rapidly-fluctuating temperature in a <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> (in modern terms, <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> compression and expansion of air is an adiabatic process, not an isothermal process). This error was later rectified by Laplace.|$|E
25|$|The {{medium in}} which a <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> is {{travelling}} does not always respond adiabatically, {{and as a result}} the speed of sound can vary with frequency.|$|E
25|$|Motion of {{the medium}} itself. If the medium is moving, this {{movement}} may increase or decrease the absolute speed of the <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> depending on {{the direction of the}} movement. For example, sound moving through wind will have its speed of propagation increased by the speed of the wind if the sound and wind are moving in the same direction. If the sound and wind are moving in opposite directions, the speed of the <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> will be decreased by the speed of the wind.|$|E

50|$|A lung flute is {{a medical}} device used to clear mucus from {{congested}} lungs with low-frequency <b>sound</b> <b>waves.</b> The device consists of a mouthpiece and a plastic reed which vibrates within a chamber to create <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in the chest cavity. These <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> vibrate and break up mucus deposits in the lungs, allowing cilia to more easily move these deposits from the lungs to the throat.|$|R
25|$|To {{direct a}} siren’s sound and to {{maximize}} its power output, a siren is often {{fitted with a}} horn, which transforms the high-pressure <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in the siren to lower-pressure <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in the open air.|$|R
25|$|However, {{in order}} to {{understand}} the sound more fully, a complex wave such as this is usually separated into its component parts, which are a combination of various <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> frequencies (and noise).|$|E
25|$|In signal processing, {{sampling}} is {{the reduction}} of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. A common example is the conversion of a <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal).|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{applies only}} when the <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> is a small perturbation on the ambient condition, and the certain other noted conditions are fulfilled, as noted below. Calculated values for cair {{have been found to}} vary slightly from experimentally determined values.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} several possible physics demonstrations of <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> using Visual Analyser (VA). The suggested demonstrations {{are suitable for}} physics classroom during teaching and learning process in the subtopic of <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> at secondary and tertiary education levels. VA is a freeware which offers alternative solution with the functions of {{more than just an}} oscilloscope. By integrating the VA and easily available material, specific physics concept can be demonstrated. We suggest five physics demonstrations for <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> by assembling pipes, speakers, and microphones with VA-installed computer. These physics demonstration aims for the concept of resonance, interference, standing wave and others related to the <b>sound</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Discovered by {{an unknown}} person, this species {{has the ability to}} {{resonate}} <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> that are equal or greater than the <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> on cellphones. The sound evokes terrible memories in the target, making them commit suicide.|$|R
50|$|Mufflers are {{a series}} of {{concentric}} or eccentric pipes inside the expansion chamber cavity. These pipes allow sound to travel into them and cause the <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> to bounce off the closed, flat, ends of the pipe. This reverses the direction of the <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> making them collide with oncoming <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> and cancel each other out. This design is usually very free-flowing but does not offer as much sound reduction as a muffler.|$|R
25|$|The energy {{carried by}} an {{oscillating}} <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> converts {{back and forth}} between the potential energy of the extra compression (in case of longitudinal waves) or lateral displacement strain (in case of transverse waves) of the matter, and the kinetic energy of the displacement velocity of particles of the medium.|$|E
25|$|The {{feedback}} is compressible and {{depends on the}} speed of sound. This action may be called intermediate field, quasi-compressible feedback. A well known example is the hole tone (described below) where the feedback distance of a compressible (<b>sound)</b> <b>wave</b> is very small {{as compared to the}} wavelength of the sound.|$|E
25|$|Examples of wave-like {{phenomena}} are sound waves, light, water {{waves and}} periodic electrical signals in a conductor. A <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> is a variation in air pressure, while in light and other electromagnetic radiation {{the strength of}} the electric and the magnetic field vary. Water waves are variations in the height of a body of water. In a crystal lattice vibration, atomic positions vary.|$|E
50|$|The word {{acoustic}} {{comes from}} the Greek akoustikos meaning hearing, as with hearing of <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in air. Acoustic telegraphy devices were electromechanical and made musical or buzzing or humming <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in air for a few feet. But the primary function of these devices was not to generate <b>sound</b> <b>waves,</b> but rather to generate alternating electrical currents at selected audio frequencies in wires which transmitted telegraphic messages electrically over long distances.|$|R
50|$|Systems {{typically}} use a transducer which generates <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> in the ultrasonic range, above 18 kHz, {{by turning}} electrical energy into sound, then upon receiving the echo turn the <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> into electrical energy {{which can be}} measured and displayed.|$|R

25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the incident <b>sound</b> <b>wave,</b> unlike other microphone types that require the <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|E
25|$|The ANS {{synthesizer}} is a photoelectronic {{musical instrument}} created by Russian engineer Evgeny Murzin from 1937 to 1957. The technological {{basis of his}} invention was the method of graphical sound recording used in cinematography (developed in Russia concurrently with USA), which {{made it possible to}} obtain a visible image of a <b>sound</b> <b>wave,</b> as well as to realize the opposite goalsynthesizing a sound from an artificially drawn sound spectrogram.|$|E
25|$|For {{context of}} comparison, in {{supersonic}} flows, additional increased expansion may {{be achieved through}} an expansion fan, {{also known as a}} Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan. Moreover, the accompanying expansion wave may approach and eventually collide and recombine with the shock wave, which is a process of destructive interference. Thus the sonic boom associated with the passage of a supersonic aircraft is a type of <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> produced by constructive interference.|$|E
50|$|Research {{suggests}} that harmonin {{plays a role}} in the development and maintenance of hairlike projections called stereocilia. Stereocilia line the inner ear and bend in response to <b>sound</b> <b>waves.</b> This bending motion is critical for converting <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> to nerve impulses, an essential process for normal hearing. In the inner ear, protein complexes organized by harmonin probably act as connectors that link stereocilia into a bundle. This protein complex likely helps regulate the transmission of <b>sound</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|R

The idea was that the design would be independent and not have to be plugged into any audio equipment. This was achieved by absorbing <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> into a microphone. Another factor was to get a “do it yourself” -feeling of the design and therefore it was chosen to be constructed using for example, old hard-drives. The result was a relatively large and bulky designed laser projector that can draw <b>sound</b> <b>waves</b> on a wall...|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of whistle {{phenomena}} in which heat plays a role. The temperature in a <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> varies, but since it is so small normally it is common to neglect its effects. When amplification can occur a small variation can grow and have important influence on the sound field created. The most well known thermal whistle is the Rijke tube. Peter Rijke placed a heated a gauze material inside a vertical tube.|$|E
25|$|When the sun warms the Earth's surface, {{there is}} a {{negative}} temperature gradient in atmosphere. The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The <b>sound</b> <b>wave</b> front travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient.|$|E
25|$|In {{analyzing}} this tube, Rayleigh {{noted that}} if heat {{had been added}} {{at the point of}} highest density in the <b>sound</b> <b>wave,</b> and subtracted at the point of lowest density, the vibration would be encouraged. Another thermal effect is called the Taconis oscillation. If a stainless steel tube has one side at room temperature and the other side in contact with liquid helium, spontaneous acoustic oscillations are observed. Again, the Sondhauss tube is not a true whistle.|$|E

The yrthak swoops from the air, blasts {{the ground with the}} <b>sound</b> <b>waves,</b> and then the resulting explosion causes piercing damage to those nearby. In addition, the yrthak can also snatch up prey in its mouth and drop it. The lance is said to have magical abilities, and this is the primary reason the dangerous creature is hunted at all.|$|R
