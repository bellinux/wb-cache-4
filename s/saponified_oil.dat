40|$|Abstract. The {{applicability}} of a surfactant derived from coconut <b>oil</b> (<b>saponified</b> coconut <b>oil</b> – SCO) to remove diesel oil from contaminated soil was investigated. This surfactant was applied in aqueous solutions {{and in a}} microemulsion precursory solution (surfactant/cosurfactant/water). Bench-scale tests were carried out using both column and batch setups with artificially contaminated soil. Parameters tested, that have influence in microemulsion formation, include: cosurfactant nature, cosurfactant/surfactant ratio (C/S), and {{presence or absence of}} an electrolyte in the aqueous phase (NaCl). Upon construction of pseudoternary phase diagrams it was observed that increasing C/S ratio and presence of electrolyte cause a reduction in the microemulsion region. Five washing solutions were tested: distilled water, distilled water with 0. 5 wt. % NaCl, surfactant solution (0. 5 wt. % SCO – above critical micelle concentration- CMC), and a microemulsion precursory solution with and without NaCl in its aqueous phase. It was observed that the formation of diesel-in-oil microemulsion makes easy the removal of contaminants from the used soil.

The main purpose of using saponified SO was {{to improve the quality of}} PHA constituents (e. g. copolymer of hydroxyl-unit) such as hydroxybutyrates (HBs), hydroxyvalerates (HVs) and hydroxyhexanoates (HHs). Typically, SO mainly contains long-chain-fatty-acid (LCFA) with unsaturated fatty acid (C 14 : 1 â€“ C 18 : 3) and therefore, the selected PHA-producer would be developed during unbalanced growth (feast-famine condition). Operation of the fed-batch for almost 6 months under aerobic dynamic conditions (with various operating conditions) has increased the PHA production up to 33 % of dried cell weight. It was also shown that sludge subjected to aerobic condition in mixed cultures could accumulate high amount of PHA by manipulating the cycle length (HRT study). The high specific PHA storage rate (qpfeast = 0. 5 C-mol/C-mol. h) as well as the high sludge PHA contents achieved by mixed cultures make this saponified SO competitive with those based on the other vegetable oil (e. g. corn oil, soy oil, etc. ...|$|R

Increased height and sharpness of tan δmax⁡ peak for all binary blends reveal an increase in chain mobility in the PVC matrix and high miscibility within the system. The PVC-PHA miscibility is possibly due to the presence of specific interactions between chlorines of PVC with the C=O group of PHA as evidenced by spectroscopic analyses.

In this study, mcl-PHA were produced by Pseudomonas putida PGA 1 using oleic acid (OA) and <b>saponified</b> palm kernel <b>oil</b> (SPKO) as carbon source in shake flasks and fed-batch fermentations. From thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the mcl-PHA derived from oleic acid (PHAOA) showed a drastic decomposition at temperature above 183 ºC, while mcl-PHA derived from <b>saponified</b> palm kernel <b>oil</b> (PHASPKO) above 196 ºC. Therefore thermal {{degradation of the}} PHAOA was carried out at temperatures of 160 °C, 170 °C and 180 °C; whereas thermal degradation for the PHASPKO was performed at temperatures of 160 °C, 170 °C, 180 ˚C and 190 °C, respectively. Changes in the polymer structures and properties before and after thermal treatments were studied by TGA, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), Gas Chromatography (GC), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, 400 -MHz Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR) Spectroscopy, and end group analysis. Acid values obtained from end group analysis showed that mcl-PHA heat-treated at higher temperatures had higher concentration of terminal carboxylic acids and lower {{number average molecular weight}} (Mn). Based on GC, FTIR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopic analyses on the thermal degradation products, it is suggested that the thermal degradation mechanism of mcl-PHA involved random α-chain scission via hydrolytic ester bond cleavage, producing a mixture of lower molecular weight oligomeric hydroxyacids. Heating above 180 ˚C in the acidic environment would lead to the dehydration of some hydroxyl terminal groups to produce alkenoic acids. These low molecular weight oligoesters possess functional terminals and could be used as natural-based plasticizers in PVC compounds. While the common PVC plasticizers, particularly phthalates, are known to be detrimental to the environment and human health, the mcl-PHA and its oligoesters have the potential to be alternative eco-friendly plasticizers for PVC. On this premise, a series of solution-cast blends of poly(vinyl chloride) -poly(3 -hydroxyalkanoates) (PVC-PHA) were prepared to assess whether mcl-PHA and its oligoesters could be acted as compatible plasticizers for PVC. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), FTIR, 1 H-NMR, DSC and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) were conducted to study the microstructure, film morphology, miscibility and viscoelastic properties of the PVC-PHA blends. SEM micrographs of PVC/PHA films showed that plasticization of PVC involved the PHA penetrated in some of the porous structures of PVC, and interfused with PVC polymer segments. Both FTIR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopic analyses suggested the PVC-PHA miscibility was possibly due to the specific interactions between the ester C=O group of PHA with the αH and local dipoles of chlorines of PVC. TGA study was used to investigate the thermal stability and thermo-dynamic parameters of the plasticized PVC films. Both measurements of DSC and DMA gave consistent results of a single Tg for the blends, indicating that mcl-PHA was highly miscible with PVC.

Growth of this microorganism on ammonium exhibited substrate inhibition kinetics {{which can be}} described using Andrews model with the substrate inhibition constant, K = 1. 2 g L- 1. Concentration of SPKO in the aqueous medium should be at 10 g L- 1 or less, as higher concentrations can significantly reduced the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KA, biomass growth and PHA(MCL) production. Uptake of SPKO by the organism follows a zero-order kinetics, indicating a mass transfer limitation of the free fatty acids by the P putida PGA 1 cells. In batch and fed-batch fermentations, PHA(MCL) accumulation is encouraged under ammonium-limited condition with SPKO as the sole carbon and energy source. The amount of PHAMCL accumulated and its specific production rate, PHA were influenced by the residual ammonium concentration level in the culture medium. It was observed that in both fermentation modes, when the residual ammonium becomes exhausted (< 0. 05 g L- 1), the PHA(MCL) accumulation and q(PHA) were significantly reduced.

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of both sheep diet structure (pasture vs. pasture supplemented with food concentrate and hay), and saponified fat supplement (sunflower oil) in the diet, on the fatty acids (FA) profile in the cheese fat (cottage cheese and pressed cheese). 68 Tzurcana sheep were divided into 4 homogeneous groups (17 sheep/group) which were subsequently randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 diets tested: P: grazing with no supplement, PC: grazing and supplementing the diet with 400 g concentrate/day; PCF: PC ratio supplemented with 0. 5 kg meadow hay; PCFG: PCF ratio supplemented with 80 g/day saponified fat (4 % of DM-saponified sunflower oil). Since no significant differences were found regarding milk’s fatty acid profile, between the PC and PCF sheep lots, the milk provided by the two groups was processed and analyzed as control sample. Supplementing grazing sheep diet with concentrate or concentrate plus meadow hay, even if it resulted in increased milk production it had a negative effect on nutritional quality of cheese fat obtained by processing milk. Thus, as compared with the control group where the diet was made up only of pasture, in the case of fat in dairy products there has been a significant increase of saturated fatty acids (SFA) share and a decreased content in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). PUFA concentrations and especially C 18 : 2 cis- 9, trans- 11 (rumenic acid) and C 18 : 3 n- 3 (α-linolenic acid) (ALA) increased significantly in cheese fat when sheep diet-which contained concentrate and hay- was supplemented with <b>saponified</b> fats (sunflower <b>oil).</b> Cheese’s physico-chemical and organoleptic properties were not affected significantly by the diet structure and the fatty acid profile of their fat, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are {{perceived}} to be a suitable alternative to petrochemical plastics because they have similar material properties, are environmentally degradable, and are produced from renewable resources. In this study, the in situ degradation of medium-chain-length PHA (PHA(MCL)) films in tropical forest and mangrove soils was assessed. The PHAMCL was produced by Pseudomonas putida PGA 1 using <b>saponified</b> palm kernel <b>oil</b> (SPKO) as the carbon source. After 112 d of burial, there was 16. 7 reduction in gross weight of the films buried in acidic forest soil (FS), 3. 0 in the ones buried in alkaline forest soil by the side of a stream (FSst) and 4. 5 in those buried in mangrove soil (MS). There was a slight decrease in molecular weight for the films buried in FS but not for the films buried in FSst and in MS. However, no changes were observed for the melting temperature, glass transition temperature, monomer compositions, structure, and functional group analyses of the films from any of the burial sites during the test period. This means that the integral properties of the films were maintained during that period and degradation was by surface erosion. Scanning electron microscopy of the films from the three sites revealed holes on the film surfaces which could be attributed to attack by microorganisms and bigger organisms such as detritivores. For comparison purposes, films of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a short-chain-length PHA, and polyethylene (PE) were buried together with the PHA(MCL), films in all three sites. The PHB films disintegrated completely in MS and lost 73. 5 of their initial weight in FSst, but only 4. 6 in FS suggesting that water movement {{played a major role in}} breaking up the brittle PHB films. The PE films did not register any weight loss in any of the test sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{biocompatibility}} {{and potential}} osteoconductive properties of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) in bone was investigated using the rabbit mandible as the animal model. The PHA {{was produced by}} a bacteria Pseudomonas putida using <b>saponified</b> palm kernel <b>oil</b> (SPKO) as carbon source. Twelve New Zealand white rabbits weighing between 2. 5 kg to 3. 5 kg were used. Twenty four of full thickness critical size (15 mm × 10 mm) defects were created in rabbit mandibles bilaterally. In each rabbit, the PHA sheet of size 19 mm × 27 mm was wrapped over the defect on one side. The remaining defects were left empty as controls. The rabbits were sacrificed at time intervals between 3 to 12 weeks and the defects together with the surrounding tissues were retrieved and prepared for histological analysis using the Exakt Cutting System. The rabbits remained in good health with minimal infection {{throughout the course of}} this study. Host tissue response to PHA, {{the quantity and quality of}} new bone regeneration were evaluated. Results showed no adverse host tissue response. The comparison of average mean new bone volume between PHA and control groups were done at 3 -, 6 -, 9 - and 12 -week healing intervals. It was found that the average mean new bone volume of the PHA treatment and the controls increased as the time intervals increased but at different amounts. The average mean new bone volume for PHA groups were 3. 17 ± 0. 58 % at 12 -weeks, 1. 41 ± 0. 38 % at 9 -weeks, 1. 40 ± 0. 72 % at 6 -weeks and 0. 90 ± 0. 10 % at 3 -weeks. These values were compare to the control groups - 1. 70 ± 0. 65 % at 12 -weeks, 0. 67 ± 0. 24 % at 9 -weeks, 0. 10 ± 0. 18 % at 6 -weeks and 0. 30 ± 0. 15 % at 3 -weeks and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Apart from that, there were physical changes observed in the implanted PHA and this may suggest a possibility of biodegradation that had taken place. These findings predicted that PHA is biocompatible in bone and has osteoconductive properties...|$|R
