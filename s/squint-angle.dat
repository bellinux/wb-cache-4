40|$|In nine {{adult cats}} with surgically induced esotropia (<b>squint-angle</b> ranging between 8 degrees and 32 degrees), {{the extent of}} {{binocular}} and monocular visual fields was behaviourally assessed by the food-perimetry method. Results indicate that: (1) The extention of both the nasal and the temporal hemifield of the esotropic eye is narrowed. (2) Field losses are largest in the cats with severe esotropia (> 15 degrees); yet the relationship between rate of impairment scored in each animal and individual angles of squint is not linear. (3) In the cats with severe esotropia, the visual field of the non-deviated eye is also narrowed. (4) We suggest that field deficits reflect a stop in the developmental expansion of the immature visual field {{as a consequence of}} ocular misalignment...|$|E
40|$|In recess-resect surgery, {{the dosage}} {{depends on the}} {{preoperative}} angle of squint and on the ratio between <b>squint-angle</b> reduction and dosage that the surgeon has found in previous surgery. Recommendations pertaining to this ratio vary widely among authors. Some say a recession does more than a resection, while others believe the opposite is true. Finally, most find a lower ratio at smaller preoperative angles of squint. We investigated the matter, using our {{modified version of the}} Robinson computer model of eye movements. We calculated the amounts of surgery needed to reduce 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degree angles of squint to zero. The increase of the ratio at large angles of squint was indeed predicted by the model. The decrease at small angles of squint, however, was not predicted by the model. We found it impossible to model the decrease of the ratio at small preoperative angles of squint. The ratios for recess and resect surgery were approximately similar. We present an inventory of the possible causes of the discrepancies. In addition, we calculated the effects of Faden surgery and found that the predictions of the computer model correspond closely to reality...|$|E
40|$|Conventional SAR {{processing}} techniques generally {{assume that}} targets have a stationary behavior during the SAR integration. However, SAR sensors operating at lower frequencies, like L- and P-band, {{have a wide}} antenna characteristic in azimuth; i. e. during {{the formation of the}} synthetic aperture, multiple <b>squint-angles</b> are integrated to build the full-resolution SAR image. In this paper, a fully polarimetric sub-aperture analysis method is introduced. Using deconvolution, synthesized SAR images are decomposed into subaperture data sets, which correspond to the scene responses under different azimuthal look-angles. A statistical analysis of the polarimetric parameters permits to clearly discriminate media showing a non-stationary behavior during the SAR integration. Finally, a method is proposed, which eliminates the influence of azimuthal backscattering variations in conventional polarimetric SAR data analysis. 1...|$|R
