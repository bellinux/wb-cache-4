40|$|The {{stability}} of planets in the alpha-Centauri AB stellar {{system has been}} studied extensively. However, most studies either focus on the orbital plane of the binary or consider <b>inclined</b> circular <b>orbits.</b> Here, we numerically investigate the {{stability of}} a possible planet in the alpha-Centauri AB binary system for S-type orbits in an arbitrary spatial configuration. In particular, we focus on <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits</b> and explore the stability for different eccentricities and orientation angles. We show that large stable and regular regions are present for very eccentric and <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits,</b> corresponding to libration in the Lidov-Kozai resonance. We additionally show that these extreme orbits can survive {{over the age of}} the system, despite the effect of tides. Our results remain qualitatively the same for any compact binary system.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method {{to be able to}} decide whether the planets of CoRoT- 7 are moving on {{mutually}} <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits</b> in the order of i > 10 degrees. The extrasolar system CoRoT- 7 is very special with respect to the closeness of the planets to the host star, which results in a fast dynamical development. It would therefore be possible to determine the inclination of the innermost planet CoRoT- 7 b with respect to the observer after an observation of at least three years from space with the satellite CoRoT with sufficient precision. Different inclinations would cause different duration of the transit times of a planet in front of the star and would therefore give us a better knowledge of the architecture of this system. With the aid of numerical integrations and analytical estimations we checked how <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits</b> of additional planets would change the transit duration of CoRoT- 7 b. After 3 years of observations when an additional planet would be on a <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit</b> with respect to CoRoT- 7 b (I_mutual > 10 degrees) an increase of the order of minutes could be observed for the transit duration.

40|$|It is conjectured that Triton was {{captured}} from a heliocentric orbit {{as the result}} of a collision with what was then one of Neptune's regular satellites. The immediate post-capture orbit was highly eccentric. Dissipation due to tides raised by Neptune in Triton caused Triton's orbit to evolve to its present state in less than one billion years. For much of this time Triton was almost entirely molten. While its orbit was evolving, Triton cannibalized most of the regular satellites of Neptune and also perturbed Nereid, thus accounting for that satellite's highly eccentric and <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit.</b> The only regular satellites of Neptune that survived were those that formed well within 5 Neptune radii, and they move on <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits</b> {{as the result of}} chaotic perturbations forced by Triton...|$|R
