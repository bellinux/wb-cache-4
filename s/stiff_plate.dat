How the bushings fail, and how this failure can be prevented has been analyzed. Two used 196 kV bushings made by General Electric were chosen for seismic testing at the iSTAR laboratory located at Portland State University in Portland, OR. The multiple objectives that brought about these tests were: {{to determine how the}} bushings failed due to gasket extrusion at the porcelain-flange connection and to verify that the failure was due to pure tipping and not sliding, to determine the damping introduced when the bushing was supported by a flexible plate with a welded support structure and excited at large amplitudes, determine the natural frequency of the assembly, and {{to determine the effects of}} added mass to the top of the bushing. To meet the objectives, the bushings were tested using two different test set-ups: a stiff mounted setup, and a flexible mounted setup. For both test set-ups, the bushings were first mounted inside a turret to simulate an electrical transformer, and the turret was mounted to a flexible or <b>stiff</b> <b>plate,</b> depending on the test. The flexible or <b>stiff</b> <b>plate</b> tests were bolted to a one-direction shake table.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the spontaneous formation of patterns of aligned buckles {{in a thin}} film of gold deposited {{on the surface of}} an elastomer [poly(dimethylsiloxane), PDMS]. The surface of the elastomer is patterned photochemically into areas differing in stiffness and coefficient of thermal expansion. The gold is deposited while the surface of the patterned elastomer is warm (T ~ 100 °C). On cooling, shrinkage in the elastomer places the gold film under compressive stress. The buckles relieve this compressive stress. The distribution of stresses and buckle patterns is described during the pre- and postbuckling regimes using solutions from calculations describing a model comprising a thin <b>stiff</b> <b>plate</b> resting on a thick elastic foundation. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Composite {{laminate}} plates {{designed to}} have two statically stable configurations have {{been the focus of}} recent research, with a particular emphasis on morphing applications. In this article, we consider how external vibration energy can be used to assist with the actuation between stable states. This is of interest in the case when surface bonded macro-fiber composites (MFC) actuators are employed as the actuation system. Typically, these type of actuators have been found to require considerably high voltage inputs to achieve significant levels of actuation authority. Therefore, assisting the actuation process will allow lower vol-tages and/or <b>stiffer</b> <b>plates</b> to be actuated. Two bi-stable plates with different thickness, [04 904]T and [02 902]T, are tested. The results show a significant reduction in the force required to change state for the case where dynamic excitation provided by an MFC actuator is used to assist the process. This strategy demonstrates the potential of dynamically assisting actuation as a mechanism for morphing of bi-stable composites.

40|$|Two {{possible}} soundboard shapes for {{a concert}} harp were modeled and their lowest natural frequencies compared in order to evaluate the claim that a harp with a bulbous extension has richer sound in the lower notes than one with a simple trapezoidal shape. Two models for the soundboards were evaluated, the first using a <b>stiff</b> <b>plate</b> approximation and the second using a membrane approximation. The lowest modes and frequencies generated by the two models agreed fairly well, and the simpler membrane model {{was used for the}} remainder of the analysis. The natural frequencies of an actual harp were determined by impulse response and the frequency spectrum was compared with the modeled frequencies for soundboard and strings. It was determined that many of the important frequencies in the region under 250 Hz could be attributed to the strings.

40|$|A {{broadband}} low-frequency plate silencer {{is realized}} experimentally using sandwich plates. The silencer {{consists of an}} expansion chamber with two side-branch cavities, each covered by a light but extremely <b>stiff</b> <b>plate.</b> The requirement for high bending stiffness and low density of the plate is satisfied with a sandwich construction by adhering two high-rigidity thin sheets with a relatively thick and light foam core. A test rig is built with a square duct of 100 mm in dimension, and each cavity is 100 mm deep and 500 mm long. Three types of sandwich plates with different mechanical properties are tested. The plate having the highest bending stiffness and lowest density results in a measured stopband from 133 to 274 Hz in which the transmission loss is higher than 10 dB over the whole frequency band. Comparisons between the three sandwich plates partly confirm the theoretical findings {{on the effect of}} plate properties on the silencer performance. It is also shown that the mathematical model based on homogeneous plates can provide satisfactory prediction on the performance of a sandwich plate silencer in the low-frequency range of interest.

40|$|When {{a segment}} of a rigid duct is {{replaced}} by a plate backed by a hard-walled cavity, grazing incident sound waves induce plate vibration, hence sound reflection. Based on this mechanism, a broadband plate silencer, which works effectively from low-to-medium frequencies have been developed recently. A typical plate silencer consists of an expansion chamber with two side-branch cavities covered by light but extremely <b>stiff</b> <b>plates.</b> Such a configuration is two-dimensional in nature. In this paper, numerical study is extended to three-dimensional configurations to investigate the potential improvement in sound reflection. Finite element simulation shows that the three-dimensional configurations perform better than the corresponding two-dimensional design, especially in the relatively high frequency region. Further analysis shows that the three-dimensional design gives better plate response at higher axial modes than the simple two-dimensional design. Sound absorption mechanism is also introduced to the plate silencer by adding two dissipative chambers on the two lateral sides of a two-cavity wave reflector, hence a hybrid silencer. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed hybrid silencer is able to achieve a good moderate bandwidth with much reduced total length in comparison with pure absorption design. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} a severe noise problem (Eek) that arises during the {{engagement}} of a dry friction clutch in a vehicle with manual transmission. Measurements have shown that near the full engagement the pressure plate suddenly starts vibrating (rigid body wobbling mode) with a frequency close to the first natural frequency of the rotational sub-system. This self-excited vibration problem exhibits typical signs of a dynamic instability associated with a constant friction coefficient. The transient event results in the generation of high transient noise levels and often consumers will change clutches prematurely {{in an effort to}} eliminate this noise. Our work focuses on developing a linearized lumped-parameter model of the clutch. The effect of key parameters on the system stability is examined by calculating complex eigensolutions. Results of this analytical study are in agreement with experimental observations. It is seen that the instability of the rigid body wobbling mode is controlled by the friction forces. This mode may, however, be also affected by the first bending mode of the pressure <b>plate.</b> Therefore, a <b>stiffer</b> <b>plate</b> could lead to a design with a reduced tendency to Eek...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} components of a flapping-wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV), the design of an energy-efficient flapping-wing has been a research interest recently. Research on insect flight from different perspectives has been carried out, mainly with regard to wing morphol-ogy, flapping kinematics, and unsteady aerody-namics. However, the link between the wing morphology and kinematics with passive pitch-ing has been neglected in flapping-wing design. To address this, a model based on a quasi-steady aerodynamic model and the passive pitching mo-tion was made. To simplify the model and make optimization more feasible, the wing is mod-eled as a <b>stiff</b> <b>plate</b> with uniform mass distri-bution and a torsional spring at the wing root. An optimization is conducted with the objec-tive of minimizing power consumption for hov-ering flight using the six most influential wing morphological and kinematic parameters as de-sign variables.

Compared to traditional artifi-cial wings with straight leading edges as pitch-ing axis, wings with a part of wing area in front of the pitching axis and smaller aspect ratio are able to perform more energy-efficient hovering flights.

Like many tissues, neovascular networks have been shown in vitro to be highly sensitive to mechanical conditions; however, the effects of matrix deformations on neovascular network formation and remodeling in engineered tissue regeneration in vivo have not been evaluated. We quantified the effects of early and delayed functional loading on neovascular growth in a rat model of large bone defect regeneration using compliant fixation plates that were unlocked to allow transfer of ambulatory loads to the defect either {{at the time of}} implantation (early), or after 4  wk of stiff fixation (delayed). Neovascular growth and bone regeneration were quantitatively evaluated 3  wk after the onset of loading by contrast-enhanced microcomputed tomography and histology. The initial vascular response to bone injury featured robust angiogenesis and collateral vessel formation, increasing parameters such as vascular volume and connectivity while decreasing degree of anisotropy. Application of early mechanical loading significantly inhibited vascular invasion into the defect by 66 % and reduced bone formation by 75 % in comparison to <b>stiff</b> <b>plate</b> controls. In contrast, delaying the onset of loading by 4  wk significantly enhanced bone formation by 20 % and stimulated vascular remodeling by increasing the number of large vessels and decreasing the number of small vessels.

40|$|When a {{sound is}} {{traveling}} from one room to another through a wall, it changes character. In {{most cases the}} wanted change {{is to reduce the}} level of the sound and, different walls do that differently well. A measure of how much the sound is lowered in level is the so-called reduction index, which is dependent on the material properties and geometry of the separating structure, (i. e. the wall). The aim of this work has been to investigate the possibility to construct a computer model for calculating the reduction index of a structure. The finite element method has been used to investigate the vibrations in a structure cased by air-borne sound waves. The vibrations propagate through the structure leading to a radiation of sound on the opposite side. The difference in sound pressure level {{on both sides of the}} structure determines the value of the reduction index for specific structure. When a 2 D finite element model was developed, a parameter study was performed where the material properties of the structure was changed in a controlled manner. Conclusions of the results from the parameter study was drawn, both to get a confirmation of the model and the influence material properties have on the reduction index. The results from the model agreed well with earlier calculation methods for double walls. Therefore, the model is expected to deliver good results also for more complex structures. The parameter study show some interesting results when looking at two differently stiff plates coupled to each by air and studs. At some frequencies the reduction index is dependent of in which direction the sound is traveling through the structure. If the sound hits the stiffer plate first, a higher reduction index can be seen than if the sound hits the softer plate and is radiated from the <b>stiff</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E

40|$|A plate {{silencer}} {{consists of}} an expansion chamber with two side-branch cavities covered by light but extremely <b>stiff</b> <b>plates.</b> It works effectively with a wide stopband from low-to-medium frequencies only if the <b>plate</b> is extremely <b>stiff,</b> to ensure a strong reflection of acoustic wave to the upstream in the duct. However, a plate with a slightly weak bending stiffness will result in non-uniform transmission loss (TL) spectra with narrowed stopband. In this study, a hybrid silencer is proposed by introducing micro-perforations into the plate to elicit the sound absorption in order {{to compensate for the}} deficiency in the passband caused by the insufficient sound reflection in a certain frequency range due to weaker plate stiffness. A theoretical model, capable of dealing with the strong coupling between the vibrating micro-perforated plate and sound fields inside the cavity and the duct, is developed. Through proper balancing between the sound absorption and reflection, the proposed hybrid silencer provides a more flattened and uniform TL and a widened stopband by more than 20 % while relaxing the harsh requirement on the bending stiffness of the plate. Theoretical predictions are validated by experimental data, with phenomenon explained through numerical analyses. Department of Mechanical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: X. N.

40|$|Most {{cochlear}} models used {{to describe}} the basilar membrane vibration along the cochlea are concerned with macromechanics, and often assume that the organ of Corti moves as a single unit, ignoring the individual motion of different components. New experimental technologies provide the opportunity to measure the dynamic behaviour of different components within the organ of Corti, but only for certain types of excitation. It is thus still difficult to directly measure every aspect of cochlear dynamics, particularly for acoustic excitation of the fully active cochlea. The present work studies the dynamic response of a model of the cross-section of the cochlea, at the microscopic level, using the finite element method. The elastic components are modelled with plate elements and the perilymph and endolymph are modelled with inviscid fluid elements. The individual motion of each component within the organ of Corti is calculated with dynamic pressure loading on the basilar membrane and the motions of the experimentally accessible parts are compared with measurements. The reticular lamina moves as a <b>stiff</b> <b>plate,</b> without much bending, and is pivoting around a point close to the region of the inner hair cells, as observed experimentally. The basilar membrane shows a slightly asymmetric mode shape, with maximum displacement occurring between the second-row and the third-row of the outer hair cells. The dynamics responses is also calculated, and compared with experiments, when driven by the outer hair cells. The receptance of the basilar membrane motion and of the deflection of the hair bundles of the outer hair cells is thus obtained, when driven either acoustically or electrically. In this way, the fully active linear response of the basilar membrane to acoustic excitation can be predicted by using a linear superposition of the calculated receptances and a defined gain function for the outer hair cell feedbac...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{cause of}} sound radiation from a submarine {{in the low}} frequency range is fluctuating forces at the propeller. The forces arise from {{the operation of the}} propeller in a non-uniform wake and are transmitted from the propeller to the submarine hull through both the shaft and the fluid. The sound radiated from the submarine is due to the combination of sound radiation caused by hull and propeller vibrations as well as dipole sound radiation from the propeller. To improve the stealth of a submarine, the radiated sound power can be reduced using passive and active noise and vibration control mechanisms. In this thesis, dynamic models of a submarine hull and propeller/shafting system are developed. To reduce the radiated sound fields, passive control is introduced using a hydraulic vibration attenuation device known as a resonance changer, which is implemented in the propeller/shafting system. Active control techniques are implemented using either tuned actuators or a control moment. To initially obtain the structural and acoustic responses of a submarine hull, an analytical model and fully coupled finite element/boundary element model are developed, for a simplified physical model of the hull. The submerged body under axial excitation is modelled as a ring-stiffened cylindrical shell with finite rigid end closures and separated by bulkheads into a number of compartments. Lumped masses are located at each end to maintain a condition of neutral buoyancy. In the low frequency range, only the axial hull modes in accordion motion and axial vibration of the propeller/shafting system are examined, which gives rise to an axisymmetric case. The frequency responses, axial and radial responses of the cylinder and the radiated sound pressure from both the analytical and computational models are compared. A dynamic model of the propeller/shafting system developed computationally and including the resonance changer is then coupled to the FE/BE model of the hull which is subject to both structural excitation from the propeller/shafting system and acoustic excitation from the propeller. The influence of tailcone properties on the structural and acoustic responses of the submarine are investigated. Passive control is implemented to attenuate the hull responses using a resonance changer. It is demonstrated that the performance of the resonance changer is negatively influenced at frequencies above the fundamental axial resonance of the hull by the effect of forces transmitted through the fluid. When the resonance changer is optimised to minimise excitation of the hull via the propeller shaft, the increased axial movement of the propeller results in an additional sound field that excites the submarine hull in a similar manner to the fluid forces that arise directly from the hydrodynamic mechanism. Cost functions that represent the submarine radiated sound power are developed, where the virtual stiffness, damping and mass of the resonance changer were chosen as design parameters. The minima of the cost functions are found by applying gradient based optimisation techniques. The adjoint operator is employed to calculate the sensitivity of the cost function to the design parameters. The influence of sound radiation due to propeller vibration on the optimisation of the resonance changer is investigated. The influence of the reduction in amplitude for higher harmonics of the blade passing frequency on the control performance is also examined. Different active control strategies are investigated, in which active control is applied to the propeller/shafting system and/or to the submarine hull. Active vibration control and discrete structural acoustic sensing based on the far field radiated sound power were considered {{in the development of the}} cost functions. In addition, the performance of a of a combined passive and active control system is investigated. Significant reduction of radiated sound power is achieved when an active control system using tuned actuators is combined with a resonance changer. The structural responses of a model scale, free flooded submarine tailcone are investigated computationally and experimentally. The tailcone is represented by a thin-walled conical shell attached to a <b>stiff</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>stiff</b> <b>plate</b> represents the pressure hull end plate of the submarine and is subject to axial excitation correlated to propeller forces.

These materials comprise soft matrix and stiff layers. The overlapping stiff scales are embedded in a soft tissue such that the composite material can provide protection while also undergoing large deformations when subjected to a penetrating loading (such as a bullet, knife, or a powerful animal bite). Moreover, the layered materials hold a great potential for a large variety of applications including noise reduction [2] and actuation [3]. Here, we analyze the influence of microstructure parameters {{on the performance of}} the composites. We derive an analytical solution for the multilayered -structure accounting for large deformations. The solution predicts the mechanical response of the media {{as a function of the}} layer inclination angle, constituent volume fractions and properties [1]. To capture the effects of localized deformation (e. g., in case of penetrating loading), we develop a finite element numerical model of the structure and loading conditions. Physical prototypes of the composites are fabricated by 3 D printing. The prototypes are subjected to mechanical loadings and the local deformation mechanics of the layered structure are measured using digital image correlation. The measured mechanical response, macroscopic as well as local, is found to be in good agreement with the simulations as well as with analytical predictions. Moreover, the results provide a detailed picture of the composite deformation mechanisms, which consist of matrix shear, <b>stiff</b> <b>plate</b> rotation and bending, depending on the microstructural parameters and loadings.

Existing analysing methods of mechanical connections between CLT elements can be simplified hand calculations or advanced FEM analyses which can be time consuming and difficult to modulate properly. The CLT slabs are often connected both with wall to wall and wall to floor connections allowing the system of connectors to operate in three-dimensions. A theoretical model for handling three-dimensional analyses between elastic connections and stiff slabs is described. The theory is implemented in Excel where a program is created to rationally analyse connections between CLT-structures. An eight story high CLT building is analysed and the results reveals that the theory has a false assumption that the plates only could rotate in plane. The assumption causes a false locking of the connections that’s results in compulsive forces that makes {{the results from the}} program hard to construe. Absolute three-dimensional movement is necessary for the theory to be more accurate. The theory enables a real three-dimensional system of <b>stiff</b> <b>plates</b> connected with mechanical connections to be analysed in a three-dimensional manner where the geometry of the plates and the properties and orienting of the mechanical connections are considered.

The actual process of data entry and analysis is a fast and different layouts and changes of these are easy to modulate.

Additionally, the marking may even be applied directly to the surface of the item itself - provided of course it can still meet the requirements described below.|$|R

This compactness result {{is based on a}} div-curl lemma for fourth-order equations. On the other hand, using an intermediate stream function we deduce from the plates case a similar result for high-viscosity Stokes equations in dimension two, so that the nature of the Stokes equation is preserved in the homogenization process. Finally, we show that the L (1) -boundedness assumption cannot be relaxed. Indeed, {{in the case of the}} Stokes equation the concentration of one very rigid strip on a line induces the appearance of second gradient terms in the limit problem, which violates the compactness result obtained under the L (1) -boundedness condition...|$|R
5000|$|Systematic {{selection}} for applications requiring multiple criteria is more complex. For example, a rod {{which should be}} stiff and light requires a material with high Young's modulus and low density. If the rod will be pulled in tension, the specific modulus, or modulus divided by density , will determine the best material. But because a plate's bending stiffness scales as its thickness cubed, the best material for a <b>stiff</b> and light <b>plate</b> {{is determined by the}} cube root of stiffness divided by density [...] For a stiff beam in bending the material index is [...]|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} 2 -dimensional (2 D) {{cell culture}} is an invaluable tool in, amongst others, cell biology and experimental pharmacology. However, cells cultured in 2 D, {{on the top}} of <b>stiff</b> plastic <b>plates</b> lose their phenotypical characteristics and fail in recreating the physiological environment found in vivo. This is a fundamental requirement when the goal of the study is to get a rigorous predictive response of human drug action and safety. Recent approaches in the field of renal cell biology are focused on the generation of 3 D cell culture models due to the more bona fide features that they exhibit {{and the fact that they}} are more closely related to the observed physiological conditions, and better predict in vivo drug handling. In this review, we describe the currently available 3 D in vitro models of the kidney, and some future directions for studying renal drug handling, disease modeling and kidney regeneration...|$|R
