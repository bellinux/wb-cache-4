5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{production of}} its new airliner, Boeing doubled {{the size of the}} Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5billion to provide space for two new assembly lines. New production methodologies were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage <b>subassemblies</b> 180 degrees, giving workers access to upper body sections. Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993. By the start of production, the program had amassed 118 firm orders, with options for 95 more from 10 airlines. Total investment in the program was estimated at over US$4billion from Boeing, with an additional US$2billion from suppliers.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1975, {{the four}} European partners, {{now known as}} the European Participation Group, signed up for 348 {{aircraft}} at the Paris Air Show. This was split among the European Participation Air Forces (EPAF) as 116 for Belgium, 58 for Denmark, 102 for the Netherlands, and 72 for Norway. Two European production lines, one in the Netherlands at Fokker's Schiphol-Oost facility and the other at SABCA's Gosselies plant in Belgium, would produce 184 and 164 units respectively. Norway's Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk and Denmark's Terma A/S also manufactured parts and <b>subassemblies</b> for EPAF aircraft. European co-production was officially launched on 1 July 1977 at the Fokker factory. Beginning in November 1977, Fokker-produced components were sent to Fort Worth for fuselage assembly, then shipped back to Europe for final assembly of EPAF aircraft at the Belgian plant on 15 February 1978; deliveries to the Belgian Air Force began in January 1979. The first Royal Netherlands Air Force aircraft was delivered in June 1979. In 1980, the first aircraft were delivered to the Royal Norwegian Air Force by SABCA and to the Royal Danish Air Force by Fokker.|$|E
40|$|A {{question}} is posed {{on how a}} particular <b>subassembly</b> sequence is generated in randomized assembly. An extended design of mechanical conformational switches [16] is proposed, which can encode several <b>subassembly</b> sequences. A particular <b>subassembly</b> sequence is generated due to conformational changes of parts during one-dimensional randomized assembly. The optimal <b>subassembly</b> sequence that maximizes the yield of a desired assembly can be found via genetic search over a space of parameterized conformational switch designs, rather than a space of <b>subassembly</b> sequences. The resulting switch design encodes the optimal <b>subassembly</b> sequence so that the desired assemblies are put together only in the optimal sequence. The results of genetic search and rate equation analyses reveal that the optimal <b>subassembly</b> sequence depends on the initial concentration of parts and the defect probabilities during randomized assembly. The results indicate that abundant parts and parts with high defect [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 This paper {{presents}} an efficient approach for determining disassembly motion plans of a <b>subassembly</b> {{in the free}} space within its parent <b>subassembly.</b> We propose a two-step approach to generating motion plans. First, all possible paths within free space of the parent <b>subassembly</b> are generated using a partial medial axis. This {{is followed by a}} graph search for an optimal global path. Second, a collision free motion is planned using the global path and the geometry of the moving <b>subassembly.</b> In this paper, we focus on the first problem, i. e.,generation of a partial medial axis for disassembly motion planning. We present a method to determine a partial medial axis (PMA) by generating Critical Points (CPs) and connecting them based on geometry of the parent <b>subassembly.</b> The PMA gives us all possible paths to disassemble <b>subassembly</b> out of its parent <b>subassembly.</b> The connectivity between segments of the PMAis represented {{in the form of a}} graph which is augmented with geometric information from the PMA. An optimal path is found by using graph search techniques on the augmented graph. A method called the two-disks motion planning strategy is proposed to plan the disassembly motion along the generated path. This method is discussed in detail in our companion paper [19]. 2 ̆...|$|R

5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two <b>subassemblies,</b> a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Subassembly</b> has an {{important}} role in aircraft manufacturing. There are different shop orders at different periods, so <b>subassembly</b> system need to adjust production capacity through reallocation of resources. Based on graphic ant colony algorithm(GACA), an optimal resource allocation method was proposed on aircraft <b>subassembly</b> system. In the method, first, a Petri Net(PN) model was used to describe the logic of tasks and resources in system. Next, to support solving process of GACA, structure graph for ant routing was designed by PN model. Then according to features of aircraft <b>subassembly,</b> solving rules and procedures of GACA are discussed in detail, which can obtain an optimal resource allocation scheme by requirement of production capacity adjustment. In addition, an example on flaperon assembly was introduced and the result demonstrated the functionality of the method...|$|R

Existing analyses of the response of the adjacent <b>subassembly</b> duct to mechanical loads are reviewed and summarized, and major uncertainties are identified. Additional analyses of the response of the adjacent <b>subassembly</b> to certain thermal loads are presented in two parts. In the first part, the effect of an external heat flux on duct melting and thermal stresses is considered. The external heat fluxes required to produce duct melting or excessive thermal stresses are compared with the heat fluxes that might be expected from the molten fuel deposited on the duct wall. In the second part, a thermal-hydraulic study is performed to investigate the effect of the external heat flux on the coolant temperature distribution in the adjacent <b>subassembly.</b> Both normal <b>subassembly</b> geometry and distorted <b>subassembly</b> geometry are considered. A detailed model of the coolant region formed by the heated duct wall and the displaced fuel pins is also analyzed to determine whether there are severe temperature gradients...|$|R

The first Avenger built at the plant was test flown in November 1942, less than eight months after the facility had started being converted to military purposes. A total of 7,800 Avengers were constructed at the plant in Ewing, including the plane George H. W. Bush was flying on September 2, 1944, when he was shot down over the Pacific Ocean by Japanese anti-aircraft fire. In September 1945, the Navy turned almost all of the plants it had acquired during the war over to the Surplus Property Administration; portions of the Ewing plant were one of the limited number of exceptions. After the war ended, the plant was converted to return to production of auto components.|$|E
40|$|To {{respond to}} the {{challenge}} of agile manufacturing, companies are striving to provide a large variety of products at low cost. Product modularity has become an important issue. It allows to produce different products through combination of standard components. One of the characteristics of modular products is that they share the same assembly structure for many assembly operations. The special structure of modular products provides challenges and opportunities for operational design of assembly lines. In this paper, an approach for design of assembly lines for modular products is proposed. This approach divides the assembly line into two <b>subassembly</b> lines: a <b>subassembly</b> line for basic assembly operations and a <b>subassembly</b> line for variant assembly operations. The design of the <b>subassembly</b> line for basic operations {{can be viewed as a}} single product assembly line balancing problem and be solved by existing line balancing methods. The <b>subassembly</b> line for the variant operations is designed as a two-station flowshop line and is balanced by a two-machine flowshop scheduling method.

2500|$|On December 16, 2003, Boeing {{announced}} that the 787 would be assembled in its factory in Everett, Washington. Instead of conventionally building the aircraft from the ground up, final assembly employed 800 to 1,200 people to join completed <b>subassemblies</b> and to integrate systems. Boeing assigned global subcontractors to do more assembly work, delivering completed <b>subassemblies</b> to Boeing for final assembly.

Subcontractors had early difficulties procuring needed parts and finishing <b>subassemblies</b> on schedule, leaving remaining assembly work for Boeing to complete as [...] "traveled work". In 2010, Boeing considered in-house construction of the 787-9 tail; the tail of the 787-8 is made by Alenia.
