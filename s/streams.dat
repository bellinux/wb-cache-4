5|$|The Riverina is drained by {{the large}} Murray-Darling Basin. Rivers and <b>streams</b> in the Riverina {{generally}} flow east to west.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines <b>streaming</b> media both as {{a technological}} innovation and cultural practice that co-configures audience and industry. Strategies and tactics provide a theoretical framework for understanding <b>streaming</b> media. <b>Streaming</b> is theorized as a tactic; wherein audiences momentarily buck against the strategic logic of media conglomerates and copyright regimes. However, <b>streaming,</b> concomitantly, is an audience tactic and a strategic logic of an emergent <b>streaming</b> industry. This results in the blurring between first and third party and sanctioned and unsanctioned <b>streaming.</b> In this dissertation, I parse out what are the nascent <b>streaming</b> logics within this burgeoning industry and how they constitutively shape and re-shape audiences and traditional broadcasting logics. Five typologies of <b>streaming</b> serve as conceptual tools for deepening our understanding of <b>streaming</b> media and technology. The first is <b>streaming</b> as a recent technological advancement, divided into software and hardware categories. The second conceptual framework is a typology of <b>streaming</b> that divides <b>streaming</b> into first and third party sanctioned and unsanctioned <b>streaming.</b> The third is <b>streaming</b> as an emergent industry. The fourth is <b>streaming</b> as a discourse, and the final typology divides <b>streaming</b> based on geography as transnational <b>streaming,</b> national <b>streaming,</b> and diasporic <b>streaming.</b> All of these classifications {{lay the groundwork for}} the further conceptualization of this important and emergent socio-technical practice...|$|R
50|$|A losing <b>stream,</b> disappearing <b>stream</b> or {{influent}} <b>stream,</b> is a <b>stream</b> or {{river that}} loses water as it flows downstream. The water infiltrates {{into the ground}} recharging the local groundwater, because the water table is below {{the bottom of the}} <b>stream</b> channel. This is the opposite of a more common gaining <b>stream</b> (or effluent <b>stream)</b> which increases in water volume farther down <b>stream</b> as it gains water from the local aquifer.|$|R

5|$|Associated with jet <b>streams</b> is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet <b>streams.</b> The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along <b>streams,</b> small dams were put together to create more pools in the <b>streams,</b> and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
30|$|The mean <b>stream</b> {{length is}} a {{property}} {{related to the}} drainage networks and its associated surfaces. The mean <b>stream</b> lengths were calculated using the formula of total <b>stream</b> length of order divided by total number of <b>stream</b> segments of order. The mean <b>stream</b> length is higher in less <b>stream</b> order, and lesser in high <b>stream</b> order is due to variations in slope and topography. The mean <b>stream</b> length is 1622  km in the study area. The mean <b>stream</b> length {{is directly related to}} mean annual runoff; therefore, the highest mean <b>stream</b> length has relatively high mean annual rainfall runoff and relatively low mean annual rainfall runoff in less mean <b>stream</b> length. In the present study, mean <b>stream</b> length is indicating the high mean annual rainfall runoff.|$|R
