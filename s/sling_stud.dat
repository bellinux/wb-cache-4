CSG also replaced most flat headed screws to hex headed screws, the butt stock recoil pads are solid instead of the ventilated on the CSG launchers, no <b>sling</b> <b>studs</b> or swivels were installed initially on the CSG launchers.

5000|$|In 2002, {{catering}} to long range varmint and target shooters, Remington introduced the 5-R [...] "Mil-Spec" [...] as a small-quantity production run stainless steel rifle, matched to a non-adjustable H-S Precision stock with an aluminum bedding block with two forward <b>sling</b> swivel <b>studs.</b> The [...] "Mil-Spec" [...] refers {{solely to the}} 5-R rifling profile designed by Boots Obermeyer and used in the single broach-cut barrels he produces {{for use in the}} M24, M40, and other sniper rifle systems. The contour of the hammer-forged production Remington barrel is much thinner than that used in the M24 and M40 rifle systems.|$|R
50|$|Mossberg also markets a less {{expensive}} shotgun under the Maverick Arms name, the Mossberg Maverick 88, in blued finish with synthetic stocks, and in appearance is virtually identical to the 500 model. Maverick and Mossberg shotguns share many interchangeable parts but Maverick shotguns differ in some ways, such as lacking <b>sling</b> swivel <b>studs</b> and having cross-bolt safeties instead of tang safeties, which makes the trigger group non interchangeable with the model 500 shotgun. The one piece forearm can be replaced with OEM or after market parts {{with the addition of}} an action slide tube, as the factory forearm has the action bars pinned into place. The Maverick series also does not come drilled and tapped for rail mounts like the 500 models. There are two basic models of the 88, the 88 field and the 88 security, with a cartridge capacity of 6 or 8 shots, and they cannot have their magazines easily extended without machining. The factory warranty on Maverick shotguns are limited to one year.|$|R
