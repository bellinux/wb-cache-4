5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better <b>surface</b> <b>quality</b> through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>quality</b> {{measures}} the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface. Increasing the <b>surface</b> <b>quality</b> reduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in images, and helps increase coherence, collimation, and reduce unwanted divergence in beams. For plane mirrors, {{this is often}} {{described in terms of}} flatness, while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The <b>surface</b> <b>quality</b> is typically measured with items like interferometers or optical flats, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (λ). A normal household-mirror made with float glass may have flatness tolerances as low as 9--14λ per inch, equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers from perfect flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12 nm).|$|E

Previous studies have extensively examined the stimulus parameters for effective vection induction. However, the effects of <b>surface</b> <b>qualities</b> on vection induction have not been studied at all despite their importance in realistic perception of a scene. As {{a first step toward}} understanding the effects of <b>surface</b> <b>qualities</b> on vection, we investigated <b>surface</b> <b>qualities</b> derived from light-reflecting properties of nine material categories commonly encountered in daily life: bark, ceramic, fabric, fur, glass, leather, metal, stone and wood. To relate vection strength with low-level visual features and with subjective impression of materials, we analyzed spatial frequency and participants’ ratings of adjective pairs that describe impressions of material categories. Although the nine material categories were perceived differently, there was no main effect of material condition on vection strength. However, multiple regression analyses revealed that vection was partially explained by both spatial frequency and principal components extracted from the subjective impression. These results indicate that although the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>qualities</b> of materials on vection is small, both low-level image-based and perceptual-level processing of <b>surface</b> <b>qualities</b> may influence vection...|$|R

25|$|Mirrors can be {{manufactured}} {{to a wide}} range of engineering tolerances, including reflectivity, <b>surface</b> <b>quality,</b> surface roughness, or transmissivity, depending on the desired application. These tolerances can range from low, such as found in a normal household-mirror, to extremely high, like those used in lasers or telescopes. Increasing the tolerances allows better and more precise imaging or beam transmission over longer distances. In imaging systems this can help reduce anomalies (artifacts), distortion or blur, but at a much higher cost. Where viewing distances are relatively close or high precision is not a concern, lower tolerances can be used to make effective mirrors at affordable costs.|$|E
25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing <b>surface</b> <b>quality</b> was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gas-assisted {{injection}} molding (GAIM) provides many more advantages than conventional {{injection molding}} (CIM), but its applications {{are limited to}} the <b>surface</b> visual <b>quality</b> problem. ABS plate parts designed with gas channels having five different types of cross-section but with the same section area were gas-assisted injection molded. Furthermore, various plate thickness parts designed with semicircular gas channel of different radii were also molded. <b>Surface</b> visual <b>quality</b> of GAIM parts was investigated by gloss and chromatics measurements. Effects of processing parameters and geometrical factors, introduced by part thickness, shape, and associated dimensions of gas channels on glossy difference and chromatic aberration of GAIM parts were studied. Influence of mold with etching treatment on <b>surface</b> visual <b>quality</b> was also examined. Basically, {{it was found that}} glossy difference is very sensitive to the degree of crystallinity whereas gas channel residual skin melt thickness plays a dominant factor for chromatic aberration. The <b>surface</b> visual <b>quality</b> shows a strong dependence on processing conditions. In general, gas channel design of semicircular cross section (shape A) provides better surface effect than the other designs in visual quality.

6000|$|Round {{the long}} table, at their dinner-hour, what {{a variety of}} type among the men! And yet a likeness, a sort of quickness and sensibility, common to them all. A few are a little méfiant of these newcomers, with the méfiance of {{individual}} character, not of class distrustfulness, nor of that defensive expressionless we cultivate in England. The French soldier has {{a touch of the}} child in him--if we leave out the Parisians; a child who knows more than you do perhaps; a child who has lived many lives before this life; a wise child, who jumps to your moods and shows you his [...] "sore fingers" [...] readily when he feels that you want to see them. He has none of the perverse and grudging attitude towards his own ailments that we English foster. He is perhaps a little inclined to pet them, treating them with an odd mixture of stoic gaiety and gloomy indulgence. It is like all the rest of him; he feels everything so much quicker than we do--he is so much more impressionable. The variety of type is more marked physically than in our country. Here is a tall Savoyard cavalryman, with a maimed hand and a fair moustache brushed up at the ends, big and strong, with grey eyes, and a sort of sage self-reliance; only twenty-six, but might be forty. Here is a real Latin, who was buried by an explosion at Verdun; handsome, with dark hair and a round head, and colour in his cheeks; an ironical critic of everything, a Socialist, a mocker, a fine, strong fellow with a clear brain, who attracts women. Here are two peasants from the Central South, both with bad sciatica, slower in look, with a mournful, rather monkeyish expression in their eyes, as if puzzled by their sufferings. Here is a true Frenchman, a Territorial, from Roanne, riddled with rheumatism, quick and gay, and suffering, touchy and affectionate, not tall, brown-faced, brown-eyed, rather fair, with clean jaw and features, and eyes with a soul in them, looking a little up; forty-eight--the oldest of them all--they call him Grandpère. And here is a printer from Lyon with shell-shock; medium-coloured, short and roundish and neat, full of humanity and high standards and domestic affection, and so polite, with eyes a little like a dog's. And here another with shell-shock and brown-green eyes, from the [...] "invaded countries"; méfiant, truly, this one, but with a heart when you get at it; neat, and brooding, quick as a cat, nervous, and wanting his own way. But they are all so varied. If there are qualities common to all they are impressionability and capacity for affection. This is not the impression left on one by a crowd of Englishmen. Behind the politeness and civilised bearing of the French I used to think there was a little of the tiger. In a sense perhaps there is, {{but that is not the}} foundation of their character--far from it! Underneath the tiger, again, there is a man civilised for centuries. Most certainly the politeness of the French is no <b>surface</b> <b>quality,</b> it is a polish welling up from a naturally affectionate heart, a naturally quick apprehension of the moods and feelings of others; it is the outcome of a culture so old that, underneath all differences, it binds together all those types and strains of blood--the Savoyard, and the Southerner, the Latin of the Centre, the man from the North, the Breton, the Gascon, the Basque, the Auvergnat, even to some extent the Norman, and the Parisian--in a sort of warm and bone-deep kinship. They have all, as it were, sat for centuries under a wall with the afternoon sun warming them through and through, as I so often saw the old town gossips sitting of an afternoon. The sun of France has made them alike; a light and happy sun, not too southern, but just southern enough.|$|E
