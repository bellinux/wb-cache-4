50|$|The i3 is {{available}} in three trim levels, Mega World, the standard model in the US, Giga World and the top-of-the-line Tera World. The base Mega World comes standard with 19-inch forged aluminum wheels, BMW Navigation, BMW ConnectedDrive with eCall, the BMW i Remote, an alarm, 7.4 kW on-board charger and LED headlights, DRLs and tail lights. The interior is donned in bright, lightweight Sensatec and sustainable cloth, which is made from recycled materials. It also features a leather trimmed steering wheel and grained dash trim. The next level Giga World has all {{the features of the}} Mega with the addition of Giga-specific 19-inch wheels and an interior wrapped in leather and wool cloth. A universal garage door opener is included for easy access to the i3's BMW i Charging Station. It also has Comfort Access, and satellite radio. The Tera World adds unique 19-inch wheels, luxury full leather, olive leaf-tanned interior with textile accents and contrasting stitching, and anthracite floors mats.Available for every trim is the technology and driving assist and the parking assist packages. The driving assist package includes the wide-screen Navigation Professional with advanced real-time traffic and the new touch pad, BMW Assist with Enhanced Bluetooth and USB with BMW Apps, Online Information <b>services,</b> <b>Deceleration</b> Assistant, ACC Stop & Go, Speed Limit info, BMW ConnectedDrive services, Forward Collision Warning, Pedestrian Protection and City Collision Mitigation.

30|$|The {{average in}} <b>service</b> <b>deceleration</b> {{achieved}} with manual driving during braking of the Metrocars has been measured at 0.5  m/s 2 by previous work, {{well below the}} full service braking figure of around 1.3  m/s 2 [43]. For ATO, the London Underground Central Line {{can be used as}} a point of comparison. This uses a target deceleration of 0.75  m/s 2 when running above ground and 1.15  m/s 2 in underground sections. The full service maximum here is also around 1.3  m/s 2, and this provides an illustration of the differences in deceleration levels for manual driving and ATO referred to above. However, when the Central line ATO system was first introduced, there were significant issues with low wheel/rail adhesion levels on above-ground sections, with wheel slide under braking resulting in unacceptable levels of wheel flats and station overruns. Low adhesion conditions on the line are most commonly reported during autumn, typically due a combination of light rain and fallen leaves on the rails. When these conditions are present, the ATO target deceleration is reduced to 0.55  m/s 2, in addition to other mitigation measures such as railhead treatment [44].|$|E
40|$|Transport {{climate change}} impacts {{have become a}} {{worldwide}} concern. The use of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) could contribute to a more effective use of resources in toll road networks. Management of toll plazas {{is central to the}} reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as it is there that bottlenecks and congestion occur. This study focuses on management strategies aimed at reducing climate change impacts of toll plazas by managing toll collection systems. These strategies are based on the use of different collection system technologies – Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) and Open Road Tolling (ORT) – and on queue management. The carbon footprint of various toll plazas is determined by a proposed integrated methodology which estimates the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions of the different operational stages at toll plazas (<b>deceleration,</b> <b>service</b> time, acceleration, and queuing) for the different toll collection systems. To validate the methodology, two main-line toll plazas of a Spanish toll highway were evaluated. The findings reveal that the application of new technologies to toll collection systems is an effective management strategy from an environmental point of view. The case studies revealed that ORT systems lead to savings of up to 70 % of CO 2 emissions at toll plazas, while ETC systems save 20 % comparing to the manual ones. Furthermore, queue management can offer a 16 % emissions savings when queue time is reduced by 116 seconds. The integrated methodology provides an efficient environmental management tool for toll plazas. The use of new technologies is the future of the decarbonization of toll plazas...|$|R
