50|$|The World Energy Network {{research}} {{program of the}} Japanese New Sunshine Project was divided into 3 phases during the period 1993 to 2002, its goal was to study the distribution of liquid hydrogen with hydrogen tankers based on the LNG carrier technology of <b>self-supporting</b> <b>tank</b> designs such as the prismatic and spherical tank. Further research on maritime transport of hydrogen {{was done in the}} development for safe utilization and infrastructure of hydrogen project (2003-2007).|$|E
5000|$|A {{portable}} {{water tank}} {{is a temporary}} collapsible tank designed for the reserve storage of water in firefighting, emergency relief, and military applications. These tanks can be either supported or unsupported. The supported tanks have a steel or aluminum frame and {{range in size from}} 600 to 5000 US gallons or larger by custom design. Portable water tanks are also unsupported such as <b>self-supporting</b> <b>tanks</b> (onion tanks), blivets and pillow or bladder tanks and are available in sizes ranging from 100 gal up to 80,000 gal.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{the use of the}} two {{different}} membrane types instead of the self-supporting storage systems. This is most likely because prismatic membrane tanks utilize the hull shape more efficiently and thus have less void space between the cargo-tanks and ballast tanks. As a result of this, Moss-type design compared to a membrane design of equal capacity will be far more expensive to transit the Suez Canal. However, <b>self-supporting</b> <b>tanks</b> are more robust and have greater resistance to sloshing forces, and will possibly be considered in the future for offshore storage where bad weather will be a significant factor.|$|R
