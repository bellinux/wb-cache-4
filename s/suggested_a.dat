5|$|A recent {{published}} observation {{during the}} 1997 solar eclipse by Wang et al. <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> possible gravitational shielding effect, which generated debate. Later in 2002, Yang and Wang published detailed data analysis, which {{suggested that the}} phenomenon still remains unexplained.|$|E
5|$|For another {{distance}} debate see Polaris#Distance, {{also with}} a different measurement from Hipparcus, although this time it <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> farther distance.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{repeatedly}} <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> German-Polish alliance {{against the}} Soviet Union, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious {{time to prepare}} for potential war with Germany or with the Soviet Union.|$|E

50|$|These {{questions}} <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> possible {{synthesis of}} immanence and transcendence, {{and they also}} <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> actualization of nonhierarchical community in social life.|$|R
5000|$|That {{research}} did not <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> immediate {{need for}} additional legislation, and neither did it <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> {{need to change the}} threshold for the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports.|$|R
5|$|On the {{macroeconomic}} scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and Leonard Waverman <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> {{causal link}} between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth. Few dispute {{the existence of}} a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal.|$|E
5|$|The Aegean prehistorians felt so {{confident}} about their calculations that they rejected early radiocarbon dates in the 1970s for LMI/LCI Thera, as radiocarbon <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> date about {{a century earlier}} than the traditional dates.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} remained unilaterally firm {{in perceptions}} which <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> left turn direction to him.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to establish the lifestyle of Perspicaris. Its large eyes and other parts would <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> swimming animal, yet it lacks claws, which seems to <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> bottom feeder.|$|R
50|$|In children, a {{posterior}} fat pad sign <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> condylar {{fracture of}} the humerus. In adults it <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> radial head fracture. The fat pad sign only occurs after an intra-articular fracture.|$|R
50|$|The strong breed predilection <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> genetic {{basis to}} the disease. Despite some {{similarities}} in breed prevalence, {{there is no}} evidence to <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> link between equine shivers and equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM).|$|R
5|$|A Parliamentary {{debate and}} motion to censure the Labour {{government}} on this {{was set for}} 8 October, but before this MacDonald called Hastings {{into his office and}} <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> way to solve the problem. Hastings would accept all the blame and resign as Attorney General, and in exchange MacDonald {{and the rest of the}} cabinet would speak for Hastings at the resulting by-election. Hastings refused the general suggestion, but planned to make a speech at the upcoming debate explaining his actions.|$|E
5|$|A feigned retreat by the Picts {{drew the}} Northumbrians into an ambush at Dun Nechtain near the lake of Linn Garan. The battle site {{has long been}} {{thought to have been}} near the present-day village of Dunnichen in Angus. Recent research, however, has <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> more northerly {{location}} near Dunachton, on the shores of Loch Insh in Badenoch and Strathspey.|$|E
5|$|After {{dinner on}} 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green until about 11pm, when the prince <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> game of baccarat. Although the Wilsons {{did not have}} a suitably-sized table, Stanley Wilson improvised, putting two card tables {{alongside}} the smoking room table—all of which were of differing sizes—and covered them with a tapestry cloth. Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming. Sitting next to the last-named was Stanley Wilson, who was on Levett's left.|$|E
5000|$|Lettering made to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> aesthetic, such as modernism, {{the natural}} world, or another genre of lettering. Examples {{of the latter}} include use of stencil or {{embossing}} tape fonts to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> industrial aesthetic.|$|R
50|$|A {{hypothesis}} is <b>a</b> <b>suggested</b> explanation of <b>a</b> phenomenon, or alternately <b>a</b> reasoned proposal <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> possible correlation between or among {{a set of}} phenomena.|$|R
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the chemical literature is now only of historical significance. Indeed, some further computational results have been reported, which vary from <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> preference for meta radical-anion protonation to <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> mixture of ortho and meta protonation.|$|R
5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two species were roughly the same size. A review of their morphology and habitat, however, <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> closer relationship to the modern pygmy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> link between children's {{consumption}} of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Always a loner, {{he spent}} hours playing with toy trains, preferring {{to cross the}} street rather than speak to anyone. He {{attended}} Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> referral to a child psychologist, but his father would have none of it.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} indicators for utility efficiency.

5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or too nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> mechanistic scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall {{built around}} the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the {{security}} of the cathedral and its outlying buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E
30|$|A lag {{length of}} {{two for the}} first period is also {{suggested}} by the AIC criterion (Akaike, 1973), while the Schwarz criterion (Schwarz, 1978) <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> lag length of one. For the second period, all three criteria coincide and <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> lag length of one.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a double}} review for All About Jazz, Clifford Allen observes that [...] "Where Morris' music can <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> somber Mark Rothko-like atmosphere, {{even in its}} most lickety-split moments, the music of Rob Brown <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> urbane fauvism not unlike the {{paintings}} of Bob Thompson." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{historian}} JK Wallenberg (in 1931) <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> Anglo-Saxon root, tynan, to enclose, {{followed by}} the Anglo-Saxon word [...] "Hamm", a land drained by dykes. Another historian, Eilert Ekwall (in 1936), <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> early owner named Teona, whose name is found in Teonanhyll in Berkshire.|$|R
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked {{their way into the}} {{interior}} of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E
5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a separation from the mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E
50|$|This {{portion of}} the phrase <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> person should arrive to vote early in the day. Most {{democratic}} electoral processes involve polling booths, which are open for a mandated period of time. Voting early would <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> particular enthusiasm for voting not necessarily shared by other electors.|$|R
50|$|Townsend often {{embroidered}} flowers which {{exhibited a}} surprising deepness for needlework. Her floral designs <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> influence from the William Morris and the Royal School of Art Needlework.
