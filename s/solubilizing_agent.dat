Dendrimers with hydrophobic core and hydrophilic periphery have shown to exhibit micelle-like behavior and have container properties in solution. The use of dendrimers as unimolecular micelles was proposed by Newkome in 1985. This analogy highlighted the utility of dendrimers as solubilizing agents. The majority of drugs available in pharmaceutical industry are hydrophobic in nature and this property in particular creates major formulation problems. This drawback of drugs can be ameliorated by dendrimeric scaffolding, which can be used to encapsulate as well as to solubilize the drugs because of the capability of such scaffolds to participate in extensive hydrogen bonding with water.

30|$|Traditionally, {{to enhance}} the {{solubility}} of poorly soluble compounds by conventional formulation approaches in most cases, drug formulation is developed with an aim to create a supersaturated solution when it comes into contact with an aqueous environment. This often requires use of <b>solubilizing</b> <b>agents</b> and precipitation inhibitors. Some of the other popular formulations approaches for achieving this solubilization are the lipid-based formulations called self-emulsifying and self-micro emulsifying drug delivery systems. These systems enhance solubility and hence oral bioavailability of lipophilic drugs, presenting the drug in solubilized form in vivo. This phenomenon avoids dissolution, which can be the rate limiting step in drug absorption for sparingly soluble drugs. It also avoids addition of <b>solubilizing</b> <b>agents</b> or precipitation inhibitors reducing excipient exposures. Some other technologies used to improve drug solubility and bioavailability includes the production of high energy or rapid dissolving solid state formulations using drug particle engineering.

Starting inoculum size differences from 10 (2) to 10 (5) yeast cells per ml resulted in approximately a fourfold effect on the MIC of both drugs, but other significant differences were not observed with variations in synthetic medium composition, pH, buffering reagent, or incubation temperature.

40|$|The {{objectives}} were 1) {{to design a}} continuous dissolution Caco- 2 system to predict the dissolution-absorption relationships for fast and slow dissolving formulations of piroxicam, metoprolol tartrate, and ranitidine HCl, and compare the predicted relationships with observed relationships from clinical studies; 2) to estimate the effect of croscarmellose sodium on ranitidine dissolution-absorption relationships; and 3) to estimate the effect of <b>solubilizing</b> <b>agents</b> on piroxicam dissolution-absorption relationships. A continuous dissolution/Caco- 2 system was constructed from a dissolution apparatus and a diffusion cell, such that drug dissolution and permeation across a Caco- 2 monolayer would occur sequentially and simultaneously. The continuous system generally matched observed dissolution-absorption relationships from clinical studies. For example, the system successfully predicted the slow metoprolol and slow ranitidiine formulations to be permeation-rate-limited. The system predicted the slow piroxicam formulation to be dissolution-rate-limited, and the fast piroxicam formulation to be permeation-rate-limited, in spite of piroxicam’s high permeability and low solubility. Additionally, the system indicated croscarmellose sodium enhanced ranitidine permeability and predicted <b>solubilizing</b> <b>agents</b> to not modulate permeability.
