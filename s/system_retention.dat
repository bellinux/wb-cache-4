50|$|To control {{non-point source}} pollution, many {{different}} approaches can be undertaken in both {{urban and suburban}} areas. Buffer strips provide a barrier of grass in between impervious paving material like parking lots and roads, and the closest body of water. This allows the soil to absorb any pollution before it enters the local aquatic <b>system.</b> <b>Retention</b> ponds can be built in drainage areas to create an aquatic buffer between runoff pollution and the aquatic environment. Runoff and storm water drain into the retention pond allowing for the contaminants to settle out and become trapped in the pond. The use of porous pavement allows for rain and storm water to drain into the ground beneath the pavement, {{reducing the amount of}} runoff that drains directly into the water body. Restoration methods such as constructing wetlands are also used to slow runoff as well as absorb contamination.|$|E
50|$|Bangladesh {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} exposed to severe flooding. Dhaka was particularly {{hit by the}} floods of 1970, 1974, 1980, 1987, 1988, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2007 and 2009, some of which {{such as the ones}} in 1988 and 1998 were catastrophic with flood levels of up to 4.5m in parts of the city. During the 1998 flood about 56 percent of the city was inundated, including most of the eastern and 23 percent of the western parts of the city. During non-catastrophic floods some streets are inundated for up to 60 cm for several days. Flooding in Dhaka is caused by high rainfall in the city and/or by flooding from the surrounding rivers and canals. The western and most densely settled part of Dhaka is protected from river flooding by raised roads and an encircling embankment built after the 1988 flood. The eastern part of the city where most of the expansion takes place consists of low-lying floodplains that are submerged during the monsoon season. When high rainfall coincides with a high water level in the river, stormwater cannot be naturally evacuated through the drainage <b>system.</b> <b>Retention</b> areas are supposed to mitigate flooding and pumping stations have been set up to evacuate floodwater. However, encroachment of natural runoff detention areas, lack of maintenance of storm sewers and pumps, and a lack of co-ordination among responsible organisations hamper efforts at flood management. Four organisations are in charge of various aspects of stormwater management in Dhaka: The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is in charge of operating regulators and gates in the embankment; DWASA {{is in charge of the}} larger open drainage canals and pipes; Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) operates smaller underground and surface drains; and the Capital Development Authority (RAJUK) constructs underground roadside drainage lines during the construction of new roads. Stormwater pumping stations of various sizes are operated by BWDB, DWASA and the Dkaha City Corporation. After the catastrophic 1998 flood caused by high river levels, it turned out that there was neither an operating policy nor person assigned to operate an important regulator, the Rampura Regulator. Many gates that were supposed to be closed to keep the water from the rising rivers out had not been closed. Furthermore, in 2002 it was noted that the existing earthen embankment was unstable and cracking in large sections. Also, construction of embankments through low-lying areas without providing adequate drainage facilities had caused internal flooding.|$|E

The aims of this study were to use a three-stage continuous-culture system (CCS) to investigate how environmental factors affect bacterial attachment to Caco- 2 cells and modulation of cytokine expression by gut microorganisms, including a probiotic Bifidobacterium longum strain, DD 2004. The CCS simulated environmental conditions in the proximal large intestine (vessel 1 [V 1]) and distal colon (V 2 and V 3) at two different <b>system</b> <b>retention</b> times (R) within the range of normal colonic transits (20 and 60 h). The model was inoculated with human fecal material, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to characterize microbial populations and to assess bacterial attachment to Caco- 2 cells. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was employed to measure cytokine gene expression following challenge with bacteria from different components of the CCS in the presence and absence of B. longum. At an R of 60 h, bacterial adherence increased from V 1 to V 3, but this trend was reversed at an R of 20 h.

Special for Pekalongan, it {{has a population of}} 273, 900 people with an area of 4, 525 hectares, but 1, 920 hectares is inundated by tidal flood. Tidal flood occurs because the sea level is higher than its land. This case has begun 10 years ago and continues to evolve to this day. The cause of the tidal flood is sea level rise, land subsidence and land use changed.

CA practices were introduced in fields with Vertisols in a randomized complete block design on permanent 5 · 19 m plots. Three treatments were evaluated: (1) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of three tillage operations and removal of crop residues, (2) terwah (TER) that was similar to CT except that contour furrows were included at 1. 5 m intervals, and (3) derdero+ (DER+), which consists of permanent raised beds with a furrow and bed <b>system,</b> <b>retention</b> of 30 % of standing crop residues and zero tillage {{on the top of the}} bed. All ploughing as well as the maintenance of the furrows of the permanent raised beds was done using a local ard plough called maresha. Results from monitoring over 3 yr showed that soil loss and runoff were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in CT followed by TER and DER+. Average soil losses of 5. 2, 20. 1 and 24. 2 t ⁄ ha were recorded from DER+, TER and CT, respectively. Runoff was 46. 3, 76. 3 and 98. 1 mm from DER+, TER and CT, respectively.

40|$|On May 6, 2010, NASA {{launched}} {{the first successful}} integrated flight test, Pad Abort- 1, of the Orion Project from the White Sands Missile Range in Las Cruces, New Mexico. This test demonstrated the ability to perform an emergency pad abort of a full-scale 4. 8 m diameter, 8200 kg crew capsule. During development of the critical separation mechanisms for this flight test, various challenges were overcome related to environments definition, installation complications, separation joint retraction speed, thruster ordnance development issues, load path validation and significant design loads increases. The Launch Abort <b>System</b> <b>retention</b> and release (LAS R&R) mechanism consisted of 6 discrete structural connections between the LAS and the crew module (CM) simulator, each of which had a preloaded tension tie, Superbolt torque-nut and frangible nut. During the flight test, the frangible nuts were pyrotechnically split, permitting the CM to separate from the LAS. The LAS separation event was the driving case in the shock environment for many co-located hardware items. During development testing, {{it was necessary to}} measure the source shock during the separation event so the predicted shock environment could be validated and used for certification testing of multiple hardware items. The Lockheed Martin test team measured the source separation shock due to the LAS R&R function, which dramatically decreased the predicted environment by 90 % at 100 Hz. During development testing a hydraulic tensioner was used to preload the joint; however, the joint relaxation with the tensioner proved unsatisfactory so the design was modified to include a Superbolt torque-nut. The observed preload creep during lab testing was 4 % after 30 days, with 2. 5 % occurring in the first 24 hours. The conversion of strain energy (preload) to kinetic energy (retraction) was measured to be 50 - 75 %. Design features and careful monitoring of multiple strain gauges on each tension tie allowed a pure tensile load to be applied after stacking at the launch pad. Following installation, preload in each joint was monitored for 24 hours. Due to unforeseen complications and the influence of temperature on the portable data acquisition system, the team encountered difficulty in tracking the joint relaxation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to reveal the effects of various {{operational}} parameters on the ozonation kinetics of the histamine- 2 blocker drug ranitidine (RAN) in aqueous solutions and to detect and identify possible transformation products (TPs) of RAN produced during the ozonation experiments. The influence of the solution’s pH value, the initial concentrations of the oxidant and analyte, the matrix effect and the organic matter presence on RAN’s removal were evaluated. Results indicated high reactivity of RAN with molecular aqueous ozone. Initial ozone concentration and pH were proven major process parameters. Alkaline pH values and increased ozone initial concentrations promoted degradation kinetics and overall mineralization. Although RAN mineralization at neutral and acidic pH was restricted (maximum 22 %), it increased at pH 10. Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) acts as an antagonistic agent to RAN degradation, limiting its % removal. The effect of inorganic ions in the matrix did not seem to affect RAN ozonation. Eleven (11) TPs were identified and structurally elucidated, using Reversed Phase (RP) and HILIC LC-Q-ToF-MS. Most of the TPs (P- 304, P- 315 b, P- 299 b, P- 333, P- 283) are generated by the attack of ozone at the double bond or the adjacent secondary amine, with the abstraction of NO 2 moiety, forming TPs with an aldehyde group and an imine C=N bond. Oxidized derivatives with a carboxylic group (P- 315 a, P- 331 a, P- 331 b, P- 299 a) are also formed. Ranitidine S-oxide was identified as an ozonation product (P- 330) and its structure was confirmed through the analysis of a reference standard. P- 214, was also produced during ozonation, through the C-N bond rupture adjacent to the NO 2 moiety.
