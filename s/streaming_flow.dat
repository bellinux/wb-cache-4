In 1973, simple {{harmonic}} (SH) {{stationary waves}} in an artery, observed during a radiologist’s rapid injection of radiopaque x-ray “dye” (arteriographic standing waves), at turbulent arterial flow rates, contradicted chaos, initiated research into transition to turbulence (Hamilton 1980). The SH {{high and low}} pressure bands suggested that SH standing wave sound accompanied the periodic fluid shear waves that develop in compliant-walled arteries (G Hamilton 1980, and 2015).2. In wind and water flow, SH waves arise on flat sand surfaces in transition and grow in amplitude in turbulence; photographs show sand particles ejected vertically from troughs and deposited at shallow angles on the following crests of SH sand waves; “.... instead of finding chaos and disorder, the observer never fails to be amazed at a simplicity of form, an exactitude of repetition and a geometric order...” (Bagnold 1941; G Hamilton 2015). 3. In water flow in glass cylinders, SH waves of tiny glass beads begin accumulating in transition along the tube base, persisting and growing in turbulence; Thomas related the glass bead waves to Bagnold’s SH sand waves (Thomas 1964), believing the underlying physics was the same. The SH glass bead waves slide slowly along the shiny glass cylinder; Bagnold’s stationary sand waves cannot slide on sand (Hamilton 2015). If, as with Bagnold’s sand waves, the glass bead waves were stationary, they would resemble the SH particle waves in a glass tube in the Kundt’s tube standing wave sound experiment.4. SH edge tones (and notes of a flute) appear during transition, persisting and growing in amplitude at turbulent flow rates (Sondhaus 1854; Krüger 1920). 5. As SH sound triggered turbulence in laminar cylinder water flow, the now turbulent efflux jet would split into 2, 3, or more similar jets (Tyndall 1867). In water flow, a cylinder’s turbulent column shows 2. 3, or more similar transverse flow sectors, each sector displaying a centripetal <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> from the BL, flanked {{by a pair of}} counter-rotating vortices (Hof 2004; Fitzgerald 2004). Logic suggests Tyndall’s turbulent flow divisions are the Hof cylinder sectors (Hamilton 2015). 6. Turbulence in tubes with triangular or rectangular cross sections also revealed organizes transverse flow divisions - a transverse centripetal <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> arising from the BL of each mid-wall, flanked by a pair of counter-rotating vortices (J Nikuradse 1931). 7.

In recent years the Yellow River has experienced significant changes in its hydrological regime, including an increased number of zero-flow days. These changes have serious implications for water security and basin management. We investigated changes in <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> regime of four headwater catchments since the 1950 s. The rank-based non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to detect trends in annual <b>stream</b> <b>flow.</b> The results showed no significant trend for the period 1956 to 2000. However, change-point analysis showed that a significant change in annual <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> occurred around 1990, and hence the stream-flow data can be divided into two periods: 1956 - 1990 and 1991 - 2000. There was a considerable difference in average annual <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> between the two periods, with a maximum reduction of 51 %. Wet-season rainfall appears to be the main factor responsible for the decreasing trend in annual <b>stream</b> <b>flow.</b> Reductions in annual <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> were associated with decreased interannual variability in <b>stream</b> <b>flow.</b> Seasonal <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> distribution changed from bimodal to unimodal between the two periods, with winter <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> showing a greater reduction than other seasons.

40|$|In the weakly {{inviscid}} regime parametrically driven surface gravity-capillary waves generate oscillatory viscous boundary layers {{along the}} container {{walls and the}} free surface. Through nonlinear rectification these generate Reynolds stresses which drive a <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> in the nominally inviscid bulk; this flow in turn advects the waves responsible for the boundary layers. The resulting system is described by amplitude equations coupled to a Navier-Stokes-like equation for the bulk <b>streaming</b> <b>flow,</b> with boundary conditions obtained by matching to the boundary layers, and represents a novel type of pattern-forming system. The coupling to the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> is responsible for various types of drift instabilities of standing waves, and in appropriate regimes {{can lead to the}} presence of relaxations oscillations. These are present because in the nearly inviscid regime the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> decays much more slowly than the waves.

In the first the domain is an elliptically distorted cylinder while in the second it is an almost square rectangle. In both cases the forced symmetry breaking results in a nonlinear competition between two nearly degenerate oscillatory modes. This interaction destabilizes standing waves at small amplitudes and amplifies the role played by the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow.</b> In both systems the coupling to the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> triggered by these instabilities leads to slow drifts along slow manifolds of fixed points or periodic orbits of the fast system, and generates behavior that resembles bursting in excitable systems.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that, in a {{sufficiently}} deep gas-solid fluidized bed of Geldart A particles, gas streaming may occur allowing gas to bypass {{a large portion of}} the particle bed. Since this is a newly observed phenomenon in fluidized beds, there is uncertainty and lack of information about the various aspects of the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow.</b> The objective of the current project is to investigate the streaming phenomenon with a combination of experimentation and modeling. In the experimental part, pressure fluctuations as a measure of the fluidized bed hydrodynamics were used to study the influence of different parameters on the behavior of a deep fluidized bed. Pressure fluctuations have been measured at 8 axial locations from 4 to 150 cm above the gas distributor for bed depths and gas velocities ranging from 0. 4 to 1. 6 m and 0. 04 to 0. 20 m/s (equal to 10 to 50 times minimum fluidization velocity), respectively. Two particle size distributions with Sauter mean diameters of 48 µm and 84 µm and two distributor plates with differing percentage open area were also tested for each bed depth and gas velocity. Analysis of pressure fluctuations in the time and frequency domains, in combination with visual observations revealed that <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> emerges gradually at bed depths greater than 1 m. Increased gas velocity and fines content act to delay the onset of streaming, but can not completely eliminate it over the range of velocities examined. The two different distributor designs had no measurable effect on the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow.</b> The results of this study are provided in the first section of the present report. In order to further investigate the nature of <b>streaming</b> <b>flow,</b> several cases of forced streams and jetting flows were designed and conducted, in addition to the natural <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> in deep beds. Results indicated that the natural streaming most closely resembles the imposed stream which not only the imposed stream, but additional gas added through the distributor. The case of jet flows with no additional gas resembles the severe streaming that might happen in very deep beds with the existence of completely non-fluidized regions. Application of supporting jets in addition to the main gas flow could enhance the fluidization quality to some extent, however, not enough to provide a normal fluidization. Wavelet analysis of the pressure fluctuations showed that in deep fluidized beds, bubbling activity with the typical dominant frequency coexist with the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow,</b> with a minor contribution. Wavelet findings suggested that the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> can be considered to form by increasing the relative importance of one available stream of bubble activity with increasing bed depth. The results of this study are provided in the second section of this report. Further study of the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> was undertaken with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of the deep fluidized bed. CFD simulation of fine Geldart A particles has met with challenges in the open literature and various modifications have been proposed to be able to model fluidized beds of these particles. In the present work, the commercial CFD codes FLUENT and MFIX were initially tested for the modeling of deep fluidized bed of Geldart A particles. However, simulation results did not show any sign of <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> in the fluidized bed. Subsequently, the commercial CFD code BARRACUDATM that has been claimed by the developers to be appropriate for this purpose, was tested. Due to the lack of data on the performance of this code, a simple case of modeling a freely bubbling fluidized bed of Geldart A particles was attempted first. For this purpose, four different simulation cases, which included three different numerical grid sizes and two drag models with a realistic particle size distribution were designed and tested. The simulated bed expansion, bubble size distribution, rise velocity and solid fraction were compared with commonly accepted correlations and experimental data from the literature. The results showed a promising predictive capability of the code without the need for modifying the drag model or other constitutive relations of the model. The third section of the report presents the simulation results of this study. The BARRACUDA code was then used for simulating the deep fluidized bed of Geldart A particles. However, similar to the previous CFD codes tested, instead of <b>streaming</b> <b>flow,</b> bubbling fluidization was predicted. Therefore, a phenomenological model was developed to better understand the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow.</b> According to the model results, the stream represents a zone of much lower pressure drop compared to other parts of the bed, which can be a possible reason for the formation and stability of the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> inside the fluidized bed. The model results showed that increasing the bed depth enhances the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow,</b> while increasing the gas velocity improves the uniformity of the bed and decreases the streaming severity. <b>Streaming</b> <b>flow</b> was found to be less severe for larger particle sizes. All of these trends are in conformity with the experimental results. These findings provide the content of the fourth and final section of this report...|$|E

In the nearly inviscid regime, the waves couple to a <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> driven in oscillatory viscous boundary layers. In a cylindrical container, the <b>streaming</b> <b>flow</b> couples to the spatial {{phase of the}} waves, but in a distorted cylinder, it couples to their amplitudes as well. This coupling may destabilize pure standing oscillations, and lead to complex time-dependent dynamics at onset. Among the new dynamical behavior that results are relaxation oscillations involving abrupt transitions between standing and quasiperiodic oscillations, and exhibiting ‘canards’. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

To simulate the <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> of the ungauged zone, we built a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model for the entire catchment area covering the upstream gauged area and ungauged zone, and then calibrated the SWAT model using the data in the gauged area. To verify the results, we built two hydrodynamic scenarios (the original and adjusted scenarios) for Poyang Lake using the Delft 3 D model. In the original scenario, the upstream boundary condition is the observed <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> from the upstream gauged area, while, in the adjusted scenario, it is the sum of the observed <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> from the gauged area and the simulated <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> from the ungauged zone.
