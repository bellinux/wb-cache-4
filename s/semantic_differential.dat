A simple scoring system, which allowed comparisons between results from each country, was needed to examine concepts under investigation. Aims and objectives This paper describes how, after trialling a range of methods, <b>semantic</b> <b>differentials</b> (SD) {{were found to be}} easy for the subjects to use. They translated well into other languages and provided scores which were easy to analyse and compare. Results <b>Semantic</b> <b>differentials</b> are based on a series of line scores using adjectives and their antonyms for a set of characteristics. They are a particularly useful method for fieldwork analysis, as they can be done by hand with no computer support. Conclusions <b>Semantic</b> <b>differentials</b> were found to be useful for cross-cultural, quantitative studies of this kind. I discuss SDs, how they work, their trialling, reliability and validity and their usefulness in cross-cultural research...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study was}} to determine whether students, acting in the role of journalists, attributed greater credibility to uniformed or non-uniformed spokespersons and whether a difference in attribution could be measured when the topic being briefed was more specifically related to the military mission. Seventy undergraduate journalism students were randomly assigned to four groups and exposed to one of four videotaped press briefings. Two briefings announced the outbreak of hostilities involving U. S. forces or award of a major construction contract. Each of the announcements was delivered by a uniformed military public affairs officer or by a spokesperson in civilian business suit. Following the briefings, students evaluated the source using <b>semantic</b> <b>differentials</b> first developed by Berlo, Lemert and Mertz (1969) and prepared questions exactly as they would ask them following the spokesperson's prepared statement. The <b>semantic</b> <b>differentials</b> were analyzed using ANOVA. The follow-on questions were coded using methodology similar to that used by Einsiedel (1974) and evaluated using the "Coefficient of Imbalance" proposed by Janis and Fadner (1949). This second method was employed to determine whether data obtained and analyzed using the Coefficient of Imbalance would validate results obtained through the use of more traditional <b>semantic</b> <b>differentials.</b> Neither method resulted in findings which would suggest a statistically significant difference in the credibility attributed to the defense source by the student-journalists in any of the four treatments.

50|$|Heise works {{extensively}} with Charles E. Osgood's <b>semantic</b> <b>differential</b> {{for measuring}} affective associations of words (connotative meanings). His dissertation included <b>semantic</b> <b>differential</b> measurements for 1,000 frequent English words, {{and he and}} his students compiled four more lexicons in the United States since then, each containing affective measurements for 1,250 or more English words. Heise used the affective measurements to begin quantitative studies of impression formation while at the University of Wisconsin. The impression formation research seeks empirically based equations for predicting how various kinds of events influence individuals' feelings about people, behaviors, and settings. This research employs structural equation modeling and path analysis (statistics), as discussed by Heise in his book Causal Analysis. In 1978 Heise reported research results regarding affective meanings and impression formation in Computer-Assisted Analysis of Social Action. An account of similar work over the prior century was provided in his 2010 book Surveying Cultures.|$|E

50|$|Good quality {{measures}} need to {{have high}} satisfaction loadings, good reliability, and low error variances. In an empirical study comparing commonly used satisfaction measures {{it was found that}} two multi-item <b>semantic</b> <b>differential</b> scales performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian service consumption contexts. A study by Wirtz & Lee (2003), found that a six-item 7-point <b>semantic</b> <b>differential</b> scale (for example, Oliver and Swan 1983), which is a six-item 7-point bipolar scale, consistently performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian services. It loaded most highly on satisfaction, had the highest item reliability, and had by far the lowest error variance across both studies. In the study, the six items asked respondents’ evaluation of their most recent experience with ATM services and ice cream restaurant, along seven points within these six items: “pleased me to displeased me”, “contented with to disgusted with”, “very satisfied with to very dissatisfied with”, “did a good job for me to did a poor job for me”, “wise choice to poor choice” and “happy with to unhappy with”. A <b>semantic</b> <b>differential</b> (4 items) scale (e.g., Eroglu and Machleit 1990), which is a four-item 7-point bipolar scale, was the second best performing measure, which was again consistent across both contexts. In the study, respondents were asked to evaluate their experience with both products, along seven points within these four items: “satisfied to dissatisfied”, “favorable to unfavorable”, “pleasant to unpleasant” and “I like it very much to I didn’t like it at all”. The third best scale was single-item percentage measure, a one-item 7-point bipolar scale (e.g., Westbrook 1980). Again, the respondents were asked to evaluate their experience on both ATM services and ice cream restaurants, along seven points within “delighted to terrible”.|$|E
