The development of honeypots as decoys designed to detect, investigate, and counterattack unauthorized {{use of information}} systems has produced an "arms race" between honeypots (computers designed solely to receive cyber attacks) and anti-honeypot technology. To test {{the current state of}} this race, we performed experiments in which we ran a small group of honeypots, using the low-interaction honeypot software Honeyd, on a network outside campus firewall protection. For 15 weeks, we ran different configurations of ports and <b>service</b> <b>scripts,</b> and simulated operating systems to check which configurations were most useful as a research honeypot and which were most useful as decoys to protect other network users. We analyzed results in order to improve the results for both purposes in subsequent weeks. We did find promising configurations for both purposes; however, good configurations for one purpose were not necessarily good for the other. We also tested the limits of Honeyd software and identified aspects of it that need to be improved. We also identified the most common attacks, most common ports used by attackers, and degree of success of decoy <b>service</b> <b>scripts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{research}} has highlighted that dysfunctional customer behaviour is commonplace in service exchange interactions. However, most {{research has}} focused on what forms of dysfunctional behaviours that are prevalent in a face-to-face context. Instead of focusing on traditional face-to-face interactions, this thesis will address and consider dysfunctional customer behaviour in a live chat support context. Moreover, the reason why certain behaviours are perceived as dysfunctional in an online context will also be discussed from a role discrepancy perspective. Methodology: The methodological approach relies on a qualitative case study of the online casino company LeoVegas. The research is carried out by conducting ten semi-structured interviews with the firm's live chat customer-contact employees. The interviews were conducted via the video chat application Skype. Findings: The findings highlight five customer behaviour categories that the respondents perceived as dysfunctional. The employees thought these behaviours violated the rules and norms of the <b>service</b> <b>script.</b> However, the data implied role discrepancies between the employees and customers, where the customers and the employees had different views of the <b>service</b> <b>script.</b> The reason for these discrepancies were due to customer ignorance of reading the terms and conditions, which the employees and LeoVegas recognized as the <b>service</b> <b>script.</b> This resulted in customer violations of the service scripts which the employees perceived as dysfunctional customer behaviour. Originality/Contribution:The thesis contributes with five employee perceived categories of dysfunctional customer behaviour in a relative unstudied online support context.  A theoretical contribution of the study is the introduction of a new perception of dysfunctional customer behaviour, with the researchers arguing that dysfunctional customer behaviour is not about customers violating the <b>service</b> <b>script</b> but rather that there is a role discrepancy between the customers and the employees. This leads to an important managerial implication, that managers need to ensure role congruence between employees and customers so that role discrepancy may be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The next {{generation}} of scripting languages for creating value-added services in converged networks will be based upon XML. Industry fora like Parlay, JAIN and OSA have developed open standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable service creation in converged Next Generation Networks (NGN). While services can be developed in traditional programming languages (e. g. Java or C++) using these APIs, XML-based scripting languages offer some advantages. While not as flexible or powerful as a programming language, scripting languages are typically easier to learn, and are language and platform independent. In this paper we describe the architecture and framework (creation, deployment and execution) of XML-based <b>service</b> <b>scripts</b> in NGN. We focus on the Service Control Markup Language (SCML) being developed by the JAIN forum for call control scripts that is {{closely tied to the}} JAIN Java Call Control (JCC) API. SCML is intended {{to be part of a}} family of NGN <b>service</b> <b>scripting</b> languages that include facilities for user interaction, mobility, and other open NGN API functions. We compare SCML to the Call Processing Language (CPL) defined by the IETF and note that SCML offers several advantages. We also briefly compare it to the requirements that are being developed by the W 3 C Voice Browser working group. I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>scripts</b> are {{predetermined}} {{guides for}} employees to follow when delivering service to customers. Some services require employees to strictly follow a script, whereas others use scripts more flexibly, if at all. Extant research regarding <b>service</b> <b>scripts</b> {{in the domain}} of service operations has mainly addressed the topic from more of a process view as a control mechanism for the encounter but minimal research has examined customer perceptions of scripted service. The authors examine a pivotal first question, which is if customers can detect different approaches to script use. To answer the question, the authors conducted a video experiment of face‐to‐face service encounters in the hospitality industry. The results indicate that customers can detect degrees of script use across both standardized and customized encounter types. This work serves as initial empirical evidence that customers are indeed capable of detecting subtleties in scripting approaches in different service situations and supports that script level is an important service design construct for research. Furthermore, the authors highlight the use of a video experiment as an innovative methodology for assessing customer perceptions of intangible aspects to services in a realistic setting. One implication {{of this study is that}} managers need to assess the impact that different script levels have on customer perceptions of various service performance measures. Managers should also consider the effect script detection has on customer perceptions of the service experience and service brand to assure their script approach aligns with the organization’s service strategy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{elicitation}} and consequences of customer embarrassment in service interactions. As customer embarrassment potentially induces negative future intentions (e. g. switch intentions) and negative word-of-mouth intentions, {{it is necessary for}} management to understand its antecedents and provide prevention/recovery strategies. Following a role theory perspective, we identify three potential elements for embarrassment: a vague <b>service</b> <b>script,</b> mishap from the target customer and his/her realization of the mishap, and the presence of fellow customers. We further propose that the source of flagging (of consumer’s mishap), the number of fellow customers, and the familiarity among the fellow customers will contribute to the elicitation of embarrassment. Further, we proposed that embarrassed consumers {{are more likely to be}} less satisfied and are more likely to initiate negative future intentions. Adopting an experimental design, we test the proposed hypothesis and provide results, managerial implications and discussions for future extension...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} the Brazilian Law on the Inclusion of People with Disabilities, in 2015, has brought a series of {{implications}} for marketing researchers, since it concerns the rights to include people with disabilities {{in public and private}} consumption spaces, such as shopping malls. Despite the growth of these consumer spaces in Brazil, several failures in service encounters are frequent, especially when consumers are visually impaired. Therefore, this study aims to understand the consequences of service encounters failures in shopping malls for the consumer with visual disabilities. To reach this goal, we used a qualitative approach of phenomenological nature. Data were collected through direct and naturalistic observations and conduct of nine face-to-face interviews with visually impaired consumers. Through content analysis of the results, we concluded that there is a diversity of failures occurred in service encounters, such as excessive piety of sellers to consumers, contempt and the sudden change in the <b>service</b> <b>script.</b> For this reason, the consequences of service encounter failure were from the verbal confrontation and the withdrawal of the transaction to the word-of-mouth and negative expressions of frustration in virtual social networks. This article also presents managerial and academic contributions for marketing researchers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Customers {{in hotels}} and {{restaurants}} can quickly discern when an employee is following a <b>service</b> <b>script.</b> The customer’s reaction to that script depends {{in part on the}} nature of the service transaction, but also on how authentically the employee behaves within the script. A study of 2, 407 U. S. hospitality customers found that many customers (almost half of the sample) focus on the treatment aspect of scripts—that is, how they are treated by the employee—and have a generally negative view of scripted services. However, about one-third of the sample considered the task-completion aspect of scripts. These respondents agreed that scripts are valuable for ensuring that all aspects of a task are completed correctly. Certain encounters are well suited to strict scripting (such as reservations and check-in), because their task-related aspects are critical to quality. Other encounters, such as concierge service and fine-dining interactions, might benefit from more flexible scripts, since customers are more focused on how they are treated during such service interactions. The respondents were uniformly negative when they detect what is known as “surface acting,” which occurs when employees are clearly just going through the motions of a script. In contrast, positive results occurred with “deep acting,” in which employees are (or seem to be) sincere in their service interaction. However, only a substantial minority of respondents reported perceiving sincere script delivery by employees. Given the importance of scripts in ensuring that service tasks are completed correctly, the study’s implications for hospitality managers include strategies of assessing the balance between task and treatment, determining which tasks are appropriate for flexible scripts, training employees in “deep acting,” and gaining employees’ buy-in by having them assist with script design...|$|E

40|$|SDM is {{a process}} model, based on service {{marketing}} components, to position a service while concurrently being a service delivery management tool improving serviceen counter processes. Added to a <b>service</b> <b>script,</b> SDM can increase customer satisfaction, quality perception, voice levels and repurchase intentions in a general service encounter scenario as well as during episodes which include a failure. Addressing mishaps requires particular attention, since Consumer Complaint Behaviour research shows that most customers prefer to switch suppliers, rather than offer constructive feedback. This means that many service failures go unnoticed, with {{a large proportion of}} customers defecting. Since most services are performed in real time by service personnel, consistent quality output is a challenge. Therefore, occasional service failures are inevitable. Present research recognises this by offering suggestions, but does not present an integrated framework like SDM, using the presence of a customer during a service encounter as an unique opportunity to resolve issues on the spot. An elicitation process is used as a first step, attempting to improve voice and minimising lost feedback. Step two is a specific service recovery process, adapted to the failure type. SDM processes can also lead to a general increase of satisfaction and quality perception, {{regardless of whether or not}} there was a service failure. With satisfaction generally being regarded as an actual repurchase behaviour indicator, this may lead to increased sales turnover, while a higher quality perception may lead to a larger price premium tolerance and therefore higher profits. Higher service quality perceptions can also be used as a marketing positioning tool to differentiate a service from competitors. Data collected supported all hypotheses put forward in this thesis, showing statistically significant improvements on all key variables, including a satisfaction rating increase of 24 percent when SDM was applied. In academic terms, the process model tested did not only link separate literature streams, but offered an integrated, proactive tool which is capable of operating in real time. Traditionally, academic models and their processes analyse results after an episode concludes, while SDM allows a provider to positively influence or manage satisfaction levels during the service delivery...|$|E
