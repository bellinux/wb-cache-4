Iterative bilateral filtering is used to reduce speckle noise and suppress irrelevant image details, which can significantly alleviate oversegmentation of watersheds. Since edges are well preserved by bilateral filtering, the watershed algorithm is capable of precisely locating object boundaries. Final segmentation is accomplished by applying an iterative region merging on the watershed regions by taking into account local boundary strengths <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> <b>statistics.</b> The efficiency of the proposed method has been demonstrated on the segmentation of SAR sea ice images. In comparison with traditional watershed algorithm, our method achieves better performance in identifying filament structures such as leads...|$|R

The level of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> ten-sion in recent months, however, does deserve closer attention. A penchant for democratic political negotiation and compromise, if not consensus, is currently absent in government and opposition leaders. This paper focuses on the ingredients that explain this democratic deficit.

Exact integration of multi-dimensional boundary <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> <b>statistics</b> is achieved through a global formulation.
