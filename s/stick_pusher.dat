2500|$|The {{aircraft}} model's {{potential to}} enter a deep stall was highlighted in the crash of Trident 1C G-ARPY on 3 June 1966 near Felthorpe in Norfolk during a test flight, {{with the loss of}} all four pilots on board. In this accident, the crew had deliberately switched off the stick shaker and <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> as required by the stall test schedule, and the probable cause was determined to be the crew's failure to take timely positive recovery action to counter an impending stall. The Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP), an experimental, voluntary, anonymous and informal system of reporting hazardous air events introduced within BEA in the late 1960s (and later adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority and NASA), brought to light two near-accidents, the [...] "Orly" [...] and [...] "Naples" [...] incidents: these involved flight crew error in the first case and suspicion of the Trident's control layout in the second.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{designers}} who install stick pushers recognise {{that there is}} the risk that a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> may activate erroneously when not required to do so. The designer must make provision for the flight crew to deal with unwanted activation of a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher.</b> In some aircraft equipped with stick pushers, the <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> can be overpowered by the pilot. In other aircraft, the <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> system can be manually disabled by the pilot.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> is a {{mechanical}} device that prevents the pilot from stalling an aircraft. It pushes the elevator control forward as the stall is approached, causing {{a reduction in}} the angle of attack. In generic terms, a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> is known as a stall identification device or stall identification system.|$|E
50|$|Stick pushers {{should not}} be {{confused}} with stick shakers. A stick shaker is a stall warning device whereas a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> is a stall avoidance device.|$|E
50|$|A <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> is {{a device}} {{installed}} in some fixed-wing aircraft {{to prevent the}} aircraft from entering an aerodynamic stall. Some large fixed-wing aircraft display poor post-stall handling characteristics or are vulnerable to deep stall. To prevent such an aircraft approaching the stall the aircraft designer may install a hydraulic or electro-mechanical device that pushes forward on the elevator control system whenever the aircraft’s angle of attack reaches the pre-determined value, and then ceases to push when the angle of attack falls sufficiently. A system for this purpose {{is known as a}} <b>stick</b> <b>pusher.</b>|$|E

50|$|Following the {{clearance}} for final approach, landing gear and flaps (5 degrees) were extended. The {{flight data recorder}} (FDR) indicated the airspeed had slowed to 145 kn. The captain then called for the flaps to be increased to 15 degrees. The airspeed continued to slow to 135 kn. Six seconds later, the aircraft's stick shaker activated, warning of an impending stall as the speed continued to slow to 131 kn. The captain responded by abruptly pulling back on the control column, followed by increasing thrust to 75% power, instead of lowering the nose and applying full power, which was the proper stall recovery technique. That improper action pitched the nose up even further, increasing both the g-load and the stall speed. The <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> activated ("The Q400 <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> applies an airplane-nose-down control column input to decrease the wing angle-of-attack AOA after an aerodynamic stall"), but the captain overrode the <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> and continued pulling back on the control column. The first officer retracted the flaps without consulting the captain, making recovery even more difficult.|$|E
50|$|In larger {{aircraft}} (especially in T-tailed jets {{that might}} be vulnerable to deep stall), some stall protection systems also include a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> system to automatically push forward on the elevator control, thus reducing the aircraft's angle of attack and preventing the stall. Both systems have to be tested and armed before takeoff and remain armed during flight.|$|E

50|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 21 April 1964 and was {{exhibited at}} the May 1964 Hanover Air Show. A second prototype was flown on 19 October 1964. After a year of certification flight testing, the first prototype crashed on 12 May 1965, due to a design fault with the T-tail. Hamburger Flugzeugbau's chief test pilot perished in the crash. As {{a result of the}} accident, modifications were made to improve the aircraft's stall performance, including a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After {{the captain}} reacted inappropriately to the stick shaker stall warning, the <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> activated. As designed, it pushed the nose down when it sensed a stall was imminent, but the captain again reacted {{improperly}} and overrode that additional safety device by pulling back {{again on the}} control column, causing the plane to stall and crash.

50|$|Angle {{of attack}} sensors on the {{aircraft}} can also detect when {{the angle of}} attack approaches the attitude known to result in pitch-up and activate devices like the stick shaker to warn the pilot, and the <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> which overpowers the pilot and forces {{the nose of the}} aircraft down to a safer angle of attack. Twist or washout built into the wingtips can also alleviate pitch-up. In effect, the angle of attack at the wingtip becomes smaller than elsewhere on the wing, meaning that the inboard portions of the wing will stall first.|$|E
5000|$|Small to medium-size aircraft, usually {{limited to}} {{propeller}} driven, feature a mechanical system whereby the yoke is connected {{directly to the}} control surfaces with cables and rods.

In more modern aircraft, inputs may first be sent to a fly-by-wire system, which then sends a corresponding signal to actuators attached to the control surfaces. Yokes may feature a stick shaker, which is designed to help indicate the onset of stall, or even a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher,</b> which assists in stall recovery.|$|E

50|$|The Dassault Falcon 20 is a French {{business}} jet, {{often considered}} to be an easy to fly and relatively visually appealing aircraft. The favourable flight qualities of the aircraft meant that {{there was no need to}} incorporate a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> or stall-barrier systems in order to achieve its predictable stall behaviour. The flight controls of the Falcon 20 are hydraulically-powered, augmenting the mechanical pushrods between the cockpit controls and the flight control surfaces. In the event of complete hydraulic failure, the aircraft can be practically flown without any augmentation. The controls incorporate an artificial feel system, optimising the sensations perceivable to the operating pilot to be smooth, predictable, and precise. On the Falcon 200, the cockpit is heavily modernised, being more comparable with the newer Falcon 50 and Falcon 200 than the original Falcon 20.|$|E
5000|$|The F-104 series {{all had a}} {{very high}} wing loading (made even higher when {{carrying}} external stores). The high angle of attack area of flight was protected by a stick shaker system to warn the pilot of an approaching stall, and if this was ignored, a <b>stick</b> <b>pusher</b> system would pitch the aircraft's nose down to a safer angle of attack; this was often overridden by the pilot despite flight manual warnings against this practice. At extremely high angles of attack the F-104 was known to [...] "pitch-up" [...] and enter a spin, from which in most cases {{it was impossible to}} recover. Unlike the twin-engined McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II for example, the F-104 with its single engine lacked the safety margin {{in the case of an}} engine failure, and had a poor glide ratio without thrust.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} shift lever also has another plane of operation, for manual mode, with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions. This plane is selected {{by moving the}} stick away from the driver (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in left-hand drive cars, the <b>stick</b> is <b>pushed</b> to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a manual gearbox, albeit only under a sequential shift pattern.|$|R
50|$|The graphs {{obtained}} from the recorded parameters show that, when the stick was pulled back, the elevator was immediately set in pitch-up position, but that the airplane’s response time was very slow compared to the usual time, the nose lifting off late while the acceleration was continuing. Such a situation {{at the beginning of}} the climb-out indicates either a limitation in the elevator’s operation or an airplane with a center of gravity that is too far forward.Checks on the wreckage did not reveal any evidence that would support the theory that there was a malfunction of the airplane’s elevator system. The calculations made on the basis of airplane performance during take-off gave a center of gravity value of 14%, that is to say a forward balance that would require a stabilizer setting of 7 ¾.The eight previous take-offs were also analyzed. These show that during the previous take-off from Cotonou (flight No 8) the pitch-up control input had immediately been followed by an increase in the airplane’s angle of attack. The previous day, on flight No 2, the rotation had been performed spontaneously at a speed of around one hundred knots, without any elevator input, and there had then been some <b>stick</b> <b>push</b> so as to control the rotation.|$|R

In the kinds with an auger, an internal weight rotates, producing an overall circular motion. Some tops can be thrown, while firmly grasping a string that had been tightly wound around the stem, and the centrifugal force generated by the unwinding motion of the string will set them spinning upon touching ground.|$|R
