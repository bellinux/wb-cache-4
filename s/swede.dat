5|$|Whether {{the above}} details are {{accurate}} or not, {{it is clear}} that Svein, Olaf the <b>Swede</b> and Eirik had ample reason to oppose Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf had taken control of Viken in south Norway, an area long under Danish overlordship. Olaf and Svein had been in England together, but Olaf had made peace while Svein kept campaigning. Svein was on friendly terms with Olaf the <b>Swede</b> and connected to him by marriage, so the two were natural allies. Finally, Jarl Eirik had been driven from his patrimony by Olaf Tryggvason, as arguably had his father, Jarl Hakon, whom he may have wished to avenge.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the most {{detailed}} account of the division, describing it as threefold. Olaf the <b>Swede</b> received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, his son in law, to hold as a vassal. Svein Forkbeard gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland {{and a part of}} Trondheim. Other sources are less specific.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{grammatical}} constructions of be-and get-passives and their usage by <b>Swedes</b> writing in English. The investigation {{is based on}} findings from four different corpora, two of which were compiled {{for the purpose of}} this study. The first one, SWENC (the Swedish English Newspaper Corpus), contains texts from online newspapers and a corporate newsletter written by <b>Swedes</b> in English. The second, BESC (Blogs in English by <b>Swedes</b> Corpus), contains material collected from blogs written in English by <b>Swedes.</b> The results from these corpora are compared with results from the press sub-corpora of the native English Frown (American English) and F-LOB corpora (British English). The results show that <b>Swedes</b> writing in English use passive constructions to a similar extent as native English speakers do within the news genre. Furthermore, <b>Swedes</b> writing in English use significantly more be-passive constructions within the news genre than the more informal blog genre. Lastly, the study shows that <b>Swedes</b> writing in English use get-passives, and that they are considerably more common in the informal language used in blogs than the more formal language used in online newspapers. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1937, Astrid (then {{known as}} W.U.T.A.) {{was sold to}} <b>Swede</b> J. Jeppson and renamed Astrid.

Astrid was used on trade routes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea until 1975. Astrid then sailed under a Lebanese flag. She was allegedly used for drug smuggling, and was being shadowed in the English Channel by HM Customs and Excise when she mysteriously caught fire.

40|$|Who {{are those}} <b>Swedes?</b> The {{stereotype}} {{vision of the}} <b>Swedes</b> in the Polish language and folk culture  The aim of the article is a rationalization of the <b>Swedes</b> {{in the day to}} day Polish language and folk culture, including the historical and cultural background. The sources from which the material was taken are: dictionaries of the Polish language, dialect dictionaries and mixed folk genres, etc. From the collected material it can be concluded that the <b>Swedes</b> are seen, from one point of view, as Godless invaders from a cold, northern country that had devastated Poland. This way of describing the <b>Swedes</b> is comparable to the characterisation of other foreign invaders, such as Tatars and Turks...|$|R
50|$|When the <b>Swedes</b> and King Olof {{heard of}} the Danish failure, they decided to win the {{reputation}} that the <b>Swedes</b> could do what the Danes could not {{and to make the}} Curonians pay tribute again. Consequently, the <b>Swedes</b> gathered an enormous army and attacked Curland. The first town they attacked was called Seeburg. It had 7,000 armed men, but the town was pillaged, ravaged, and burnt by the <b>Swedes.</b> The <b>Swedes</b> sent back their ships and started out on a five-day expedition into the hinterland. They reached the town of Apulia (modern Apuole, where arrows and other traces of this battle were discovered by Birger Nerman) which had as many as 15,000 armed men.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and <b>Swede</b> Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it came very close to being completed.|$|E

5|$|The Blond Bombers {{is a name}} used {{by several}} tag teams in {{professional}} wrestling. The first team to use the name was the combination of Rip Hawk and <b>Swede</b> Hanson.

5|$|Nothing can {{be gleaned}} from the {{contemporary}} skaldic poems on {{the causes of the}} battle. Adam of Bremen states that Olaf Tryggvason's Danish wife, Thyri, egged him on to make war against Denmark. When Olaf heard that Svein Forkbeard and Olaf the <b>Swede</b> had formed an alliance, he was angered and decided the time had come for an attack. Ágrip and Historia Norwegie have a similar account. Thyri was the sister of Svein Forkbeard, and when Olaf Tryggvason married her, Svein refused to pay her promised dowry. Angered, Olaf launched an expedition to attack Denmark, but he was too impatient to wait for a fleet to assemble from all of Norway, and he set sail for the south with only 11 ships, expecting the rest to follow. When that hope was not realized, he set out for Wendland (Pomerania) to seek allies and on the way was ambushed by Svein and his allies. These accounts are contradicted by a contemporary verse of Halldórr the Unchristian which states that Olaf Tryggvason was travelling from the south {{when he came to the}} battle.|$|E
