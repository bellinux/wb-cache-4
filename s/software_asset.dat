40|$|Abstract In most {{companies}} two factors {{play a crucial}} role: managing the knowledge that is necessary for doing business and managing the hardware and software infrastructure that supports the business processes. Usually, business processes and infrastructure are not optimally aligned. We investigate how principles from knowledge management {{can be applied to}} enable the creation, consolidation, conservation and continuous actualization of knowledge about valuable software systems (&quot;software assets&quot;) {{that are part of the}} infrastructure. Our point of departure is a generic framework for knowledge creation proposed by Von Krogh, Ichijo and Nonaka. We investigate the explicit and tacit knowledge about <b>software</b> <b>assets</b> that may exist in an organization and specialize the framework to obtain a strategy for creating new knowledge about these <b>software</b> <b>assets.</b> By applying this strategy, one can optimize the quality and the flexibility of the <b>software</b> <b>assets</b> while reducing costs...|$|R

This revised standard is designed to allow the implementation of SAM processes to be [...] "accomplished in multiple staged increments or tiers." [...] Part 1 of the standard details SAM processes including control environment, planning and implementation, inventory, verification and compliance, operations management and life cycle.In 2003, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) began working with the SAM industry to develop a standard of best practices for <b>software</b> <b>asset</b> management programs. Standard ISO/IEC 19770-1:2006, Information technology - <b>software</b> <b>asset</b> management - Part 1, was published by the ISO and IEC in May 2006.|$|E
