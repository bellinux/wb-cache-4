40|$|The Sphereprint is {{introduced}} {{as a means}} to characterize hemispherical conformability, even when buckling occurs, in a variety of flexible materials such as papers, textiles, nonwovens, films, membranes and biological tissues. Conformability is defined here as the ability to fit a doubly curved surface without folding. Applications of conformability range from the fit of a wound dressing, artificial skin, or wearable electronics around a protuberance such as a knee or elbow to geosynthetics used as reinforcements. Conformability of flexible materials is quantified by two dimensionless quantities derived from the Sphereprint. The Sphereprint ratio summarizes how much of the specimen conforms to a hemisphere under symmetric radial loading. The Coefficient of Expansion approximates the average stretching of the specimen during deformation, accounting for hysteresis. Both quantities are reproducible and robust, even though a given material folds differently each time it conforms. For demonstration purposes, an implementation of the Sphereprint test methodology was performed on a collection of cellulosic fibrous assemblies. For this example, the Sphereprint ratio ranked the fabrics according to intuition from least to most conformable in the sequence: paper towel, plain weave, satin weave, and <b>single</b> <b>knit</b> jersey. The Coefficient of Expansion distinguished the <b>single</b> <b>knit</b> jersey from the bark weave fabric, despite them having similar Sphereprint ratios and, as expected, the bark weave stretched less than the <b>single</b> <b>knit</b> jersey did during conformance. This work lays the foundation for engineers to quickly and quantitatively compare the conformance of existing and new flexible materials, no matter their construction...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{knitting}} technology with advanced fibres such as glass, carbon and aramid, to produce near-net-shape fabrics has {{in recent years}} received increasing interest from the composite materials community. Knitted fabrics have the potential of being used in engineering structures with complex shapes {{in conjunction with a}} suitable liquid moulding technique, such as Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM), due to their excellent drapeability and manufacturability. During previous studies in textile reinforced composites, an intimate relationship between the fabric architecture and the damage development has been demonstrated. In this work, the quasi-static tensile loading deformation behaviour and the relation between the fabric architecture and damage development have been studied for a weft knitted glass fabric. Tensile properties have been examined and the failure mechanisms have been identified experimentally by analysing the damage process in-situ with a camera and by studying fracture surfaces using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The acoustic emission technique was used to support the microscopic analysis. The work has investigated the tensile properties and failure mechanisms of three knitted fabric reinforced composite laminates reinforced with a Milano weft knitted glass fabric. The three composites were (i) a single layer of fabric reinforcing epoxy resin, (ii) a <b>single</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric layer sandwiched between 0 ° glass fibre unidirectional plies (again with the glass reinforcing epoxy resin), and (iii) the same knitted glass fabric but this time used as the reinforcement in commercially produced high fibre volume fraction composites (using the RTM technique). The variation of mechanical properties with angle (from wale to course) has been measured for the single layer of the fabric reinforcing epoxy resin by orientating the wale direction of the fabric at different angles. Mechanical properties have been measured for each angular orientation and comparisons were made between them, especially with regard to the planes of final failure. The single layer composites failed as soon as the first damage was initiated. Hence, to investigate damage accumulation, a novel technique was employed to manufacture a sandwich laminate, which consisted in placing a <b>single</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric layer between 0 ° glass fibre unidirectional plies. The success of this method is that the accumulation of damage in the knitted architecture was allowed to be studied and some characteristics of crack initiation and crack propagation could be related to the fabric geometry and structure. Experiments on these model transparent materials have been complemented by tests on two types of commercial knitted fabric composite manufactured by the RTM process. Characterization of these materials under tensile loading has been carried out for monotonic and cyclic loading and the results have been compared with those found for the single layer and the sandwich model material. Various failure mechanisms such as cracking at loop cross-over points, resin matrix cracking, fibre bundle debonding and tensile fracture of fibre bundles in failed specimens were observed.

40|$|Currently, {{conductive}} yarn can be knitted into fabrics to endow {{the traditional}} textile product with special attributes, such as shielding electromagnetic waves, detecting and transferring electrical signals, replacing {{fingers in the}} operation of touch-screen panels, etc. Research on the electrical properties of conductive knitted fabrics can {{contribute to the development of}} such functional textiles. A few studies have been conducted, and it has been found that the variation of the knitted structure can impact the properties of a conductive knitted fabric. Among the properties of conductive fabrics, the resistance value is an important index to decide the performance of electrical functions. Several researchers have conducted practical experiments and theoretical analyses to predict the resistance of plain weft knitted structure. However, in addition to the plain weft knitted structure, the float structure is another important basic knitted structure. Therefore, a geometric model incorporated with a simplified resistive network is proposed for the calculation of the electrical resistance of conductive knitted fabrics with float stitches and will be studied in this paper.
