The compliant constant-force mechanism is a slider mechanism incorporating large-deflection beams, which outputs nearconstant-force across the range of its designed deflection. The equation of motion is successfully validated with empirical data. The dynamic model is cast for one out of 28 possible configurations of compliant constant-force <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism, identified by type synthesis techniques (Howell, 2001). The author derived the dynamic model through Lagrange’s Equation for the selected configuration of compliant constant-force <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism.

5000|$|An in-line <b>crank</b> <b>slider</b> is {{oriented}} {{in a way}} {{in which}} the pivot point of the crank is coincident with the axis of the linear movement. The follower arm, which is the link that connects the crank arm to the slider, connects to a pin in the center of sliding object. This pin is considered to be on the linear movement axis. Therefore, to be considered an in-line <b>crank</b> <b>slider,</b> the pivot point of the crank arm must be in-line with this pin point. The stroke (...) of an in-line <b>crank</b> <b>slider</b> is defined as the maximum linear distance the slider may travel between the two extreme points of its motion. With an in-line <b>crank</b> <b>slider,</b> the motion of the crank and follower links is symmetric about the sliding axis. This means that the crank angle required to execute a forward stroke is equivalent to the angle required to perform a reverse stroke. For this reason, the in-line slider-crank mechanism produces balanced motion. This balanced motion implies other ideas as well. Assuming the crank arm is driven at a constant velocity, {{the time it takes to}} perform a forward stroke is equal to the time it takes to perform a reverse stroke.|$|R

The hexapod structure {{is designed to}} move in an alternating tripod gait driven by two piezoelectric actuators connected by sliding plates to two sets of three legs. We present results of both the kinematic and static analyses of the driving mechanism that essentially consists of three <b>slider</b> <b>cranks</b> in series.

The machine must simulate a person jumping on the trampoline to test the life of JumpSport’s fitness trampolines and kids’ trampolines. Partway through the design process, the objectives were altered and this senior project team was tasked with merging with another Cal Poly senior project group to create an all-inclusive test machine to accommodate both full-trampoline testing and individual bungee cord testing. The final design is centered on a <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> linkage driven by a servomotor. A load cell is bolted {{to the end of}} the <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> for force measurements. An impactor subassembly is in turn bolted to the load cell. The impactor acts as the interface between the power system and the trampoline mat and is designed with running shoes attached to more closely mimic a person jumping. The linkage is supported by a gantry spanning the width of the supporting base plate. The base is mounted on leveling casters for transportation purposes. Some linkage and structure components are adjustable to account for varying strokes. This report documents the Phase 1 design process including conceptual designs, research and analysis, the final design, the manufacturing process, and testing. This report focuses heavily on the processes leading up to choosing the <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> linkage as the final design, and the analysis focuses on the impactor.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the kinematic and dynamic analysis of <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism. The <b>slider</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism is simulated in ADAMS software {{to observe the}} response of the slider block and the reaction forces at joint R 2 (joint between crank shaft and connecting rod). The dynamic analysis has been performed by applying moment of 4. 2 Nm at joint R 1 (the revolute joint between connecting shaft and connecting plate). The applied moment is removed by imposing rotational motion at joint R 1 with angular velocity of 6 rad/sec to perform dynamic analysis. These simulations were performed with different time steps and durations. The friction was assumed to be negligible during these simulations. As a result of this work, the longitudinal response of the slider block is observed with applied moment as well as slider block response along with reaction forces at joint R 2 is investigated in case of imposed rotational motion. presents a multibody dynamics approach that uses a simulation of crank-slider mechanism in ADAMS software [5].

A <b>crank</b> <b>slider</b> mechanism is used to illustrate our approach. The proposed method allows us to analyze the dynamic behavior of the mechanism in a simple and rapid way. This tool allowed us to show that for a mechanism with general inertia characteristics, the PD controller does not yield an acceptable behavior, i. e., a non zero steady state error, and {{it is necessary to}} have a PID controller to eliminate this error. Then the <b>crank</b> <b>slider</b> mechanism is redesigned by applying a negative mass distribution approach to obtain a statically balanced mechanism, which exhibits a simpler dynamic behavior. We showed that in this case the PD controller is sufficient to eliminate the steady error. Hence, the mechanical design of parallel robots can be improved in order to simplify the control strategy. This goal presents the main advantage of the proposed approach.

40|$|The {{premise of}} this work is the {{observation}} that real-life mechanical systems limit the use of high order integration formulas due to the presence in the associated models of friction and contact/impact elements. High-order numerical integration methods are impractical in these cases, and producing a numerical solution relies {{on the use of}} low order integration formulas. The latter methods are generally robust and expeditious; their major drawback is the fact that they usually require small integration step-sizes in order to meet a user prescribed accuracy. This paper looks at several low order numerical integration methods that draw on both the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT) formulas and Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) method, in an effort to assess their behavior. The first objective is to briefly indicate the theoretical results available in the literature regarding the stability and convergence properties of these low order methods when applied in the context of multibody dynamics simulation (MBS). The second objective is to perform a set of numerical experiments to compare these integration formulas in terms of several metrics: (a) efficiency, (b) energy preservation, and (c) velocity constraint drift.
