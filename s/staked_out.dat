25|$|FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, {{reportedly}} {{frustrated with}} the lack of progress from Oklahoma authorities, assigned agent R.H. Colvin to the Underhill case.

Agents at the scene called for reinforcements but, by the time they arrived, the newlyweds had left to celebrate their honeymoon. A few days later, police raided a farm near Konawa where they knew Underhill was staying. However, Underhill had passed them earlier on the highway and was able to escape before police realized their mistake.|$|E

25|$|According to Kavaja, one of {{his major}} {{assignments}} from the CIA was to assassinate Josip Broz Tito, president of Yugoslavia. Tito traveled to Brazil and Kavaja followed, but the chance to kill the leader was foiled when Tito stayed indoors for his entire stay. Kavaja followed Tito from Brazil to Chile, Mexico, and the United States. Upon arrival in America, he and his companions had to be especially careful because he was wanted by the FBI, which did not always share sources with the CIA. Kavaja claimed that in 1971, he <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> Camp David (near Thurmont, Maryland), disguised as a Maryland State Trooper, in order to kill Tito, who was visiting United States President Richard Nixon. Once again, he was foiled when Tito stayed indoors.|$|E
25|$|The {{class of}} 1951 {{subsequently}} returned the statue to the college, where she remained for over 20 years, until students staged a high-profile heist in 1977. In June 1977 the statue {{was displayed at}} the 25th reunion {{of the class of}} 1952 in order to raise donations for the college. The class required that the statue be placed on display, however, so she was mounted behind plexiglass in Converse Hall. In the early hours of October 13, three masked students entered the hall, tied up the switchboard operator, and pried the statue loose. At the last minute the students enlisted Prince Albert Grimaldi (then a student at the college) so they could claim diplomatic immunity if necessary. They were apprehended less than a month later, when campus police, having learned of their plan to fly the statue over a football game, <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> the local airports.|$|E
25|$|In early March 1919 men {{started to}} {{takeover}} Leverhulme's farms on Lewis. They drove off the farmers' livestock, demolished boundary walls, and <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> six-acre plots: {{by the summer}} sixteen out of the twenty-two farms on the island had been affected. Expecting Leverhulme's approval, the raiders were taken aback when he voiced his complete condemnation of their actions {{and asked them to}} withdraw from his land. Some left, but others erected shelters for their families on the stolen plots. Leverhulme was evidently not willing to prosecute ex-servicemen who were trying to secure homes for their families, and it seems unlikely that, under the circumstances, legal action would have succeeded. Instead, he toured Lewis trying to persuade them that their future lay with him and not in the crofting system. They were, however, extremely reluctant to abandon old ways and most of them continued to espouse the crofting way of life.|$|E

5000|$|Nine-wicket croquet, {{sometimes}} called [...] "backyard croquet", is played mainly in Canada and the United States, {{and is the}} game most recreational players in those countries call simply [...] "croquet". In this version of croquet there are nine wickets, two stakes, and up to six balls. The course is arranged in a double-diamond pattern, with one stake {{at each end of}} the course. Players start at one stake, navigate one side of the double diamond, hit the turning stake, then navigate the opposite side of the double diamond and hit the starting stake to end. If playing individually (Cutthroat), the first player to <b>stake</b> <b>out</b> is the winner. In partnership play, all members of a team must <b>stake</b> <b>out,</b> and a player might choose to avoid <b>staking</b> <b>out</b> (becoming a Rover) in order to help a lagging teammate.|$|R
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the redevelopment plan, Marshall Heights residents began to demand in August 1949 that the freeze on improvements be lifted. City officials refused, arguing that with half of all homes in the neighborhood facing condemnation for safety reasons, redevelopment was the only option. The city also argued that it would be too expensive to build water and sewer lines along the existing street plan, and that residents would be unable to afford the hookup and frontage fees. In September 1949, District engineers <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> sewer, water, and natural gas lines along two streets in Marshall Heights to demonstrate the difficulties in construction and prove how costly the effect would be to residents. From this example, the city claimed that laying water and sewer lines in Marshall Heights would cost $1.2 million more than in any other neighborhood, and said that razing all the homes in the area, realigning streets around hills, regrading streets, and filling in valleys was the only feasible and cost-effective option.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} attack from other European colonial powers {{prompted}} {{the directors of}} the Dutch West India Company to formulate a plan to protect the entrance to the Hudson River. In 1624, 30 families were sponsord by Dutch West India Company moving from Nut Island to Manhattan Island, where a citadel to contain Fort Amsterdam was being laid out by Cryn Frederickz van Lobbrecht at the direction of Willem Verhulst. By the end of 1625, the site had been <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> directly south of Bowling Green {{on the site of the}} present U.S. Custom House. The Mohawk-Mahican War in the Hudson Valley led the company to relocate even more settlers to the vicinity of the new Fort Amsterdam. In the end, colonizing was a prohibitively expensive undertaking, only partly subsidized by the fur trade. This led to a scaling back of the original plans. By 1628, a smaller fort was constructed with walls containing a mixture of clay and sand.|$|E
25|$|In March 1978, Gacy lured a 26-year-old named Jeffrey Rignall {{into his}} car. Upon {{entering}} the car, {{the young man}} was chloroformed and driven to the house on Summerdale, where he was raped, tortured with various instruments including lit candles and whips, and repeatedly chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall was then driven to Lincoln Park, where he was dumped, unconscious but alive. Eventually he managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment. Rignall was later informed the chloroform had permanently damaged his liver. Police were again informed of the assault, but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the chloroform haze of that night, Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, the Kennedy Expressway and particular side streets. He <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> the exit on the Expressway where he knew he had been driven untilâ€”in Aprilâ€”he saw Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, which Rignall and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale. Police issued an arrest warrant, and Gacy was arrested on July 15. He was facing an impending trial for a battery charge for the Rignall incident when he was arrested in December for the murders.|$|E

Though most Canadians were content to look to Parliament for protection of civil liberties, Diefenbaker called for a Bill of Rights, calling it [...] "the only way to stop the march {{on the part of the}} government towards arbitrary power". He objected to the great powers used by the Mackenzie King government to attempt to root out Soviet spies after the war, such as imprisonment without trial, and complained about the government's proclivity for letting its wartime powers become permanent.|$|E
500|$|Starved and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia were {{developed}} for FX {{under the auspices}} of FX president John Landgraf, who sought to expand the network's viewership by providing a wider variety of programming. The shows were the network's first attempts at sitcoms following the short-lived 2003 series Lucky. FX at the time was known primarily for its edgy dramatic series. Bruce Lefkowitz, then executive vice president of Fox Cable Entertainment, outlined the strategy: [...] "We kind of <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> a unique space in dramas that are very different from everybody elseâ€™s, so the next natural evolution is to do something in the comedy space." [...] The network ordered seven episodes of each series.|$|E
500|$|On 20 June 1945, Lie {{returned}} to Norway. At the national {{convention of the}} Labour Party that same year, he was elected party secretary. While Gerhardsen became chairman and prime minister, and gradually assumed his role as [...] "Father of the Nation" [...] ("Landsfaderen"), [...] Lie maintained party discipline and <b>staked</b> <b>out</b> the political strategy in the background. From his position {{at the head of}} the party he helped orchestrate the predominant position the party was to hold in the following years, with absolute parliamentary majorities won in the 1945, 1949, 1953 and 1957 elections. During the reconstruction of the post-war years, he helped lead the party onto a more moderate path. Private versus public ownership of industry now became a practical, rather than an ideological question. The policy proved highly successful; the country experienced unprecedented growth, as well as improved conditions for the working class, during his tenure.|$|E
