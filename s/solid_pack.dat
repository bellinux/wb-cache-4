40|$|A {{series of}} reaction-sintered SiC was {{fabricated}} from preforms with varying volume fractions of two resin-coated SiC particles {{of different sizes}} (63 and 18 µm). The electrical resistivity and mechanical strength were eventually optimized at the small par-ticle volume fraction of 0. 3 ~ 0. 4, {{at which point the}} porosity of the preform was minimized. This study experimentally proves that additional processes after the formation of the preform, such as silicon infiltration and reaction sintering, do not apparently alter the optimum volume fraction of the preform packing, predicted by an existing analytical model based on <b>solid</b> <b>packing.</b> Thus, the volume fraction of particles of different sizes can be determined practically through the <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> model to fabricate RSSCs with optimal properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{random packing}} of {{equiaxed}} dendritic grains in metal-alloy solidification is numerically simulated and validated via an experimental model. This phenomenon {{is characterized by}} a driving force which is induced by the solid-liquid density difference. Thereby, the solid dendritic grains, nucleated in the melt, sediment and pack with a relatively low inertia-to-dissipation ratio, which is the so-called Stokes number. The characteristics of the particle packed porous structure such as <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> fraction affect the final solidified product. A multi-sphere clumping Discrete Element Method (DEM) approach is employed to predict the <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> fraction as function of the grain geometry under the solidification conditions. Five different monodisperse noncohesive frictionless particle collections are numerically packed by means of a vertical acceleration: a) three dendritic morphologies; b) spheres and c) one ellipsoidal geometry. In order to validate our numerical results with solidification conditions, the sedimentation and packing of two monodisperse collections (spherical and dendritic) is experimentally carried out in a viscous quiescent medium. The hydrodynamic similarity is respected between the actual phenomenon and the experimental model, that is a low Stokes number, o(10 − 3). In this way, the experimental average <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> fraction is employed to validate the numerical model. Eventually, the average packing fraction is found to highly depend on the equiaxed dendritic grain sphericity, with looser packings for lower sphericity...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study for {{transient temperature response}} and pressure drop in a randomly packed bed at high Reynolds numbers is presented. The packed bed {{is used as a}} compact heat exchanger along with a solid-propellant gas generator, to generate room-temperature gases for use in control actuation, air bottle pressurization, etc. Packed beds of lengths 200 and 300 mm were characterized for packing-sphere-based Reynolds numbers ranging from 0. 8 x 10 (4) to 8. 5 x 10 (4). The <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> used in the bed consisted of phi 9. 5 mm steel spheres. The bed-to-particle diameter ratio was with the average packed-bed porosity around 0. 43. The inlet flow temperature was unsteady and a mesh of spheres was used at either end to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. Gas temperature and pressure were measured at the entry, exit,and at three axial locations along centerline in the <b>packed</b> beds. The <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> temperature was measured at three axial locations in the packed bed. A correlation based on the ratio of pressure drop and inlet-flow momentum (Euler number) exhibited an asymptotically decreasing trend with increasing Reynolds number. Axial conduction across the packed bed was found to he negligible in the investigated Reynolds number range. The enthalpy absorption rate to <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> from hot gases is plotted as a function of a nondimensional time constant for different Reynolds numbers. A longer packed bed had high enthalpy absorption rate at Reynolds number similar to 10 (4), which decreased at Reynolds number similar to 10 (5). The enthalpy absorption plots can be used for estimating enthalpy drop across packed bed with different material, but for a geometrically similar packing...|$|R
40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution (PSD) has a significant influence {{on the performance of}} fluidized bed reactors, as uneven distribution usually results from segregation and mixing tendencies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the segregation of wide range of {{particle size}} distribution in an industrial gas phase polymerization reactor by means of a CFD–PBM coupled model, where the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) was implemented to solve the population balance model. It was shown that the model is able to satisfactorily predict the available operational data in terms of pressure drop and bed height. Model sensitivities of discretization scheme, maximum <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> and fluidization/de-fluidization were also studied. The transient CFD–PBM/DQMOM coupled model is then utilized extensively to analyze minimum fluidization velocity, fluidization behavior and segregation phenomena at different velocities. The results suggested that third-order MUSCL discretization scheme, maximum <b>solid</b> <b>packing</b> value which is 0. 01 higher than specific solid volume fraction and also fluidization process were mathematically and physically consistent with real observation. In addition, the segregation is strongly affected at minimum fluidization velocity range of particles. The PSD becomes well-mixed at high gas velocity while the quasi-layer inversion was predicted in low gas velocity...|$|R

On 22 September, while attempting to clear a passage for three ships trapped in the ice, Litke again damaged its rudder and propeller, hardly escaping entrapment in the ice itself, and had to retreat to clear water in Provideniya bay. In the middle of October, Cheluskin was firmly trapped in <b>solid</b> <b>pack</b> ice and drifting westward through the Chukchi Sea.

The progress north-west was frustrated by ice and shoals, and at one time the Investigator became grounded so firmly that all stores had to be unloaded to her boats (one of which capsized, losing 3344 lbs of dried beef) before she could be freed.

5000|$|This type of {{detonator}} {{was invented}} in the 1940s {{as part of the}} Manhattan project to develop nuclear weapons. The design goal was to produce a detonator which acted very rapidly and predictably. Both Match and <b>Solid</b> <b>Pack</b> type electric caps take a few milliseconds to fire, as the bridgewire heats up and heats the explosive to the point of detonation. Explosive bridgewire or EBW detonators use a higher voltage electric charge and a very thin bridgewire, [...]04 inch long, [...]0016 diameter, (1 mm long, 0.04 mm diameter). Instead of heating up the explosive, the EBW detonator wire is heated so quickly by the high firing current that the wire actually vaporizes and explodes due to electric resistance heating. That electrical driven explosion then fires the detonator's initiator explosive (usually PETN).|$|E
