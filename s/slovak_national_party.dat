5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (<b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party).</b>|$|E
5|$|The party {{also became}} {{very active in}} {{establishing}} contacts with post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the Croatian Party of Rights, <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> and IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement. While not keeping official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the Scottish National Party, Irish Sinn Féin and Basque Herri Batasuna. Some of the parties it established contacts with most recently was the Freedom Party of Austria and the Italian Lega Nord, which {{after a period of}} distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Strache, the party has cooperated mainly with the Northern League, Vlaams Belang (successor to the Vlaams Blok, which it has traditionally maintained good ties with), and the Pro Germany Citizens' Movement in Germany. The FPÖ also has contacts with the Danish People's Party, the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> the Sweden Democrats, the Lithuanian Order and Justice, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany and the German Freedom party. In 2007, the party's then-only MEP {{was a member of}} the short-lived Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty grouping in the European Parliament. Outside the EU, it has contacts with Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Progressive Party (formerly of the Serbian Radical Party), the Swiss People's Party, the Israeli Likud, the U.S. Republican Party and the United Russia party.|$|E
5000|$|After graduating he {{returned}} to Ružomberok and became the founder and chief editor of the journal Hlas (The Voice), published by and in support of progressive young Slovak intellectuals who opposed the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party's</b> conservative approach to politics. He was a supporter and acquaintance of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the sociologist and philosopher {{who went on to}} be the founder and first President of Czechoslovakia. After unsuccessfully running for a seat in the Diet of Hungary, his agitation on behalf of Slovak causes led to him being imprisoned for a year in 1906 along with Andrej Hlinka, on the grounds of [...] "instigation against the Magyar nationality". He had continued to work as a doctor and in 1909 he published Ľudová obrázková zdravoveda (Illustrated Guide to Public Health).|$|R
5000|$|The Liberal Party {{also worked}} with some success to create a unified, Magyarized state. Ignoring the Nationalities Law, they enacted laws that {{required}} the Hungarian language {{to be used in}} local government and increased the number of school subjects taught in that language. After 1890 the government succeeded in Magyarizing educated Slovaks, Germans, Croats, and Romanians and co-opting them into the bureaucracy, thus robbing the minority nationalities of an educated elite. Most minorities never learned to speak Hungarian, but the education system made them aware of their political rights, and their discontent with Magyarization mounted. Bureaucratic pressures and heightened fears of territorial claims against Hungary after the creation of new nation-states in the Balkans forced Tisza to outlaw [...] "national agitation" [...] and to use electoral legerdemain to deprive the minorities of representation. Nevertheless, in 1901 Romanian and <b>Slovak</b> <b>national</b> <b>parties</b> emerged undaunted by incidents of electoral violence and police repression.|$|R
50|$|The Arbitration of Vienna fully {{satisfied}} nobody, {{and there}} followed 22 border clashes between November 2, 1938 and January 12, 1939, during which five Czechoslovaks {{were killed and}} six were wounded. The <b>Slovak</b> <b>national</b> militia Hlinka Guard participated in these clashes. The ineffectiveness of the Prague government in protecting their interests stirred Slovak and Ukrainian nationalism further. On November 8, 1938, the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> Unity <b>Party</b> got 97.5% of the Slovak votes, and a one-party state was instituted. Slovak autonomy was formalized by the Prague parliament on November 19, and to symbolize this new Slovak assertiveness, the country's name was then altered to Czecho-Slovakia. Carpatho-Ukraine was also given autonomy.|$|R
25|$|All Slovak {{political}} parties condemned the incident, except the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> led by Ján Slota, which remained silent.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January 2009, the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> {{called on}} Foreign Affairs Minister Ján Kubiš {{to demand the}} removal of the sculpture, calling it an offence to the Slovak nation. On 15 January 2009, Kubiš {{complied}} and lodged a formal protest, but did not demand {{the removal of the}} sculpture.|$|E
25|$|A {{coalition}} formed {{after the}} parliamentary elections in 2006, which saw the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (SNS) headed by Ján Slota (frequently described as ultra-nationalist right-wing extremist) {{become a member}} of the ruling coalition, led by the allegedly social-democratic Smer party. After its signing of a coalition treaty with far-right extremist SNS, the Smer's Social-Democratic self-identification was questioned.|$|E
50|$|Lukáš Parízek {{was born}} and raised in Bratislava. He {{completed}} his secondary education in 2006 at the Gymnázium Ivana Horvátha in Bratislava. Between 2006 and 2012 Parízek studied diplomacy at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in the Russian Federation where he obtained both a bachelor’s degree (2010) and a master’s degree (2012).He returned to the Slovak Republic to serve in the State administration and joined the <b>National</b> <b>Slovak</b> <b>Party,</b> where he campaigned at the 2016 parliamentary elections. Aside from his native Slovak he also speaks English, Russian, German and notions of Arabic.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Kotleba {{tried to}} {{transform}} the group into a political <b>party</b> (<b>Slovak</b> Togetherness - <b>National</b> <b>Party).</b> The party was dissolved by the Supreme Court because of its non-compliance with the Constitution (restriction of universal suffrage, replacement of the party system {{by the state of}} estates) as the first and yet only dissolved political party in the modern history of Slovakia. The group then continued to exist as a civil society. Also in this form it was temporarily banned by the Interior Ministry for [...] "activities that incite hatred and national, racial, religious as well as political intolerance", but the Slovak Supreme Court reinstated the group, claiming that [...] "the legal conditions for disbanding Slovenská Pospolitosť had not been met." [...] The group resumes operation unhindered.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the party {{are closely related to}} the {{nationalist}} Slovak Togetherness. The members of the movement tried to run in the 2006 elections under the name <b>Slovak</b> Togetherness - <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> but the party was dissolved by the Supreme Court on grounds of anti-constitutional activities. Instead of founding a whole new party, members of Slovak Togetherness under the leadership of Marian Kotleba entered the tiny Party of Friends of Wine that had existed since 2000, changed its name to People's Party of Social Solidarity in May 2009 and then to People’s Party - Our Slovakia in early 2010. This was done to avoid legal difficulties with registering a new party under this name given that a different party called Our Slovakia already existed.|$|R
25|$|Dzurinda's {{party was}} {{defeated}} by SMER in the 2006 parliamentary election. SDKU-DS was second with more than 18 per cent of votes. Because of refusal to renew the right-wing coalition government {{with the support of}} Meciar's party {{he was not able to}} continue governing. SMER leader Robert Fico has formed a coalition government with Meciar's HZDS and Slota's <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (SNS).|$|E
25|$|After the {{parliamentary}} elections in 2006, the nationalist <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (SNS) of Ján Slota {{became a member}} of the ruling coalition led by Robert Fico. In August a few incidents motivated by ethnic hatred caused diplomatic tensions between the countries. Mainstream Hungarian and Slovak media blamed Slota's anti-Hungarian statements from the early summer for worsening ethnic relations.

At the 20 and 21 September 2002 legislative elections, the party won 3.7% {{of the popular vote}} and no seats.

40|$|This Thesis {{analyses}} {{the position}} of the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> Council from 1944 through 1948 as a body that had acquired all legislative, executive and government powers after its revolutionary establishment in Slovakia. The Thesis also deals with the period preceding the constitution of the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> Council in order to point out the historical reasons of establishment of this <b>Slovak</b> <b>national</b> authority in light of developing Czech-Slovak relationships from late 18 th century to the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> Uprising, after which the <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> Council had been established and taken the reins thereof afterwards. The <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> Council is considered in this Thesis a <b>Slovak</b> <b>national</b> authority which originated under the circumstances of the historical period as an expression of the Slovak nation's independence concurrently entering the anti-fascist and anti-nationalist struggle aimed at release from the factual German thraldom. <b>Slovak</b> <b>National</b> Council in 1944 through 1948 reflects the Slovak nation's position within the period common restoration of the Czechoslovak Republic and the Thesis analyses how the position had been deteriorating due to the following historical events, particularly due to power ambitions of the Soviet Union pursuing its sphere of influence in the Czechoslovak Republic mainly [...] ...|$|R
