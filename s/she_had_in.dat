5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} {{took place}} on 23 October. She was re-elected with 54% of the vote, followed by socialist Hermes Binner, 37 points behind her. The opposition was divided between several candidates, and the perceived economic prosperity prevailed over voter's concerns about corruption and cronyism. It was the largest victory percentage in national elections since 1983. The Peronist party also won eight of the nine elections for governor held that day, increased their number of senators, and obtained {{the majority in the}} chamber of deputies, including the number of legislators needed for quorum. The Kirchners had lost that majority in the 2009 elections. She invited children on stage during the celebrations, and Vice President Amado Boudou played an electric guitar. As <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 2007, she gave a conciliatory speech.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.|$|E

5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E

25|$|The work {{is painted}} as life sized {{and in a}} shallow space, with Bathsheba {{dominating}} the composition as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> no other earlier version of the scene. It is not known whether Rembrandt painted Bathsheba for his own reasons, or to satisfy a commission. Presumably in response to Rembrandt's painting, his ex-pupil and close associate Willem Drost painted Bathsheba with David's Letter the same year, which {{is also in the}} Louvre.|$|E

25|$|The {{success and}} demand for Kngwarreye's {{paintings}} caused her many problems within the community {{as she tried to}} maintain her individual identity. The myth of the woman in her 80s who had never been outside the central desert becoming a great painter was one reason for her popularity. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact, been to Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Canberra, though this was only after she had become famous. There was much pressure from the white community for her to paint in a certain way, when they believed that one of her styles was more successful than others.|$|E

25|$|Bree was {{released}} from her psychiatric hospital and returned to Ferndale after Brooke's husband Boyd (Sam Bunkall) plead to her to donate a kidney to a sick Brooke. It soon turned out Bree {{had no intention of}} donating and blackmailed Boyd for thousands of dollars in exchange for the operation. Nonetheless, Bree bailed and Brooke paid her off to leave Ferndale. Bree returned claiming she had suffered another psychotic episode, though it was soon clear <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact murdered Travis Corfield (John Tui) and had returned to steal his money. Bree eventually confessed this to Brooke and tried to escape, only for her own sister to hand her into the police.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, the Washington Tug and Barge Co. {{sold the}} Patterson to C.K. West Co. of Portland Oregon who {{converted}} {{her to a}} motorship for operation along the Oregon coast; the steam engine was replaced with a diesel, probably the four-cylinder Bolinder engine <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1930. It was probably at this time or a year later that she underwent a substantial rebuilding. Her deckhouse, bowsprit and eventually also her mizzenmast were removed, her bow was reshaped, and the fore and main masts were replaced with, or reduced to, pole masts. A stern deckhouse and superstructure were constructed. These changes {{are evident in the}} photos of the 1938 shipwreck (this article and external links) and in a 1930 photo taken at Herschel Island.|$|E

25|$|In Nagoya in 1935, {{and again}} {{intending}} {{to leave the}} sex industry, Abe began working as a maid at a restaurant. She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Goro Omiya, a professor and banker who aspired {{to become a member}} of the Diet of Japan (Japanese parliament). Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. Omiya met Abe in Tokyo, and, finding that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the past contracted syphilis, paid for her stay at a hot springs resort in Kusatsu from November until January 1936. In January, Omiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant, and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business.|$|E
25|$|The {{revelation of}} Ludlam's dual {{citizenship}} prompted Ludlam's fellow co-deputy {{leader of the}} Greens, Senator Larissa Waters, to similarly check whether she also held Canadian citizenship. On discovering that she did, she resigned on 18 July 2017, four days after Ludlam. Waters was born to Australian parents who briefly lived in Canada, and returned with them to Australia while still a baby. She had previously believed that she was solely an Australian citizen, and {{that if she had}} wished to gain Canadian citizenship she would have needed to take active steps before age 21. However, she discovered <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact always held dual citizenship since birth. Her seat has been filled by a countback, returning former Democrats leader Andrew Bartlett, who held the second position after Waters on the Greens' 2016 Senate ticket in Queensland, to the Senate.|$|E

At Emma's house, Emma has taken Gold - and Hook's sword - since {{it was the last}} item that Gold touched when before he became the Dark One, which is what is needed to heal him. Emma wakes Gold up, by {{performing}} a healing spell, destroying the blade. She reveals that his heart is a blank slate and promises to make him the purest hero.

25|$|Burnett {{returned}} to London in 1894; there she heard news that her younger son Vivian was ill, so she quickly {{went back to}} the United States. Vivian recovered from his illness, but missed his first term at Harvard University. Burnett stayed with him until he was well, then {{returned to}} London. At this time she began to worry about her finances: she was paying for Vivian's education; keeping a house in Washington D.C. (Swan had moved out of the house to his own apartment); and keeping a home in London. As <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the past, she turned to writing as a source of income and began to write A Lady of Quality. A Lady of Quality, published in 1896, was to become {{the first of a series}} of successful adult historical novels, which was followed in 1899 with In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim; and in 1901 she had published The Making of a Marchioness and The Methods of Lady Walderhurst.|$|E
25|$|During the Russo-Swedish War (1788â90), Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte {{entered into}} politics.

In cooperation with {{the daughter of the}} ambassador, her friend Camille du Bois de la Motte, she handled the correspondence between the monarch and the ambassador, arranged secret meetings between them and acted as witness to them upon the King's request. This caused a rift between her and the King when she realized that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact been used to distract the ambassador. Adolf Fredrik Munck later blackened her {{in the eyes of the}} King by claiming that France was informed about the Swedish war plans through her friendship with Camille du Bois de la Motte.

Shachath tells her that the other times, she still had hope and purpose, but now she is willing to help Jude find peace. Sister Jude agrees, but says she must do one last thing. She visits the parents of the girl she killed, Missy, claiming to be a nun who found her calling after hearing of Missy's accident. She is intent on telling them the truth, when an adult Missy (Kristin Slaysman) walks into the home, revealing that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact survived the accident.
