5|$|At {{the extreme}} {{southern}} end of the site, Lombe's <b>Silk</b> <b>Mill</b> now houses the Derby Industrial Museum. This museum closed on 3 April 2011 and was mothballed for over two years.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013 a {{programme}} {{started to}} reinvent the <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> for the 21st Century, incorporating the principles of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Maths). The museum now opens 4 days a week.|$|E
5|$|These 18th-century {{improvements}} to the spinning process meant that handloom weavers were in great demand. but as power looms were introduced in factories in Manchester there was less work for them and there was serious unemployment in the town. In 1827 silk weaving began in Leigh, either {{as the result of}} a dispute or a labour shortage in the Middleton silk industry. William Walker was a middleman who opened the first <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> in Leigh in 1828, and others quickly followed, including James Pownall and Henry Hilton, whose mill survived until 1926.|$|E

5|$|Leigh's wealth as an {{industrial}} town resulted in many outlets for the entertainment of its population, including theatres, cinemas and public houses. In 1908 the Hippodrome Theatre on Leigh Road {{was built on}} the site of Walker's <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> of 1827, this subsequently became a cinema, first the Odeon, later the Classic. Another theatre, the Theatre Royal, was built on Lord Street which later became the Leigh Casino Club. The Palace Cinema was built in 1913 on Railway Road and the assembly rooms above the Conservative Club, were converted to a cinema known as the Sems in 1908. Brewery Lane is a reminder that there was once a brewery in Bedford belonging to George Shaw & Co.|$|E
5|$|Water-power {{was first}} {{introduced}} to England by John Lombe at his <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power {{to the process of}} producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously, meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers. Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright's first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers' housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills– sometimes developing a pre-existing community– with their own amenities such as schools, chapels, and markets. Most of the housing still exists and is still in use. Along with the transport infrastructure form part of the site. A transport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills' produce.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a <b>silk</b> <b>mill.</b> In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, {{maker of the}} Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors. The city's biggest employers, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and UPMC Susquehanna Lock Haven hospital, are among the seven biggest employers in Clinton County.|$|E

25|$|The Turkey Hill Experience {{is located}} in a former Ashley and Bailey <b>silk</b> <b>mill,</b> part of which was {{originally}} built in 1899. The location had several owners and uses in the decades that followed, before being abandoned after the Tidy Products company stopped using it as a sewing factory in the late 1970s. The building was vacant for more than 25 years before Turkey Hill began to work with a developer to repurpose the building. This former <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> {{should not be confused with}} the nearby Ashley and Bailey Company <b>Silk</b> <b>Mill</b> in West York or the Ashley and Bailey <b>Silk</b> <b>Mill</b> in Marietta, both of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

25|$|Beeston {{grew from}} its village status with its {{development}} as a silk weaving centre {{in the early nineteenth}} century. The first <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> was burned down (along witrh Nottingham Castle) in the Reform Bill riots of 1831. With the decline of the silk industry, many of the former mills moved to light industrial uses in the early twentieth century. Equipment produced by the Beeston Boiler Company is still to be found all around the former British Empire.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the river}} has been {{important}} for milling, {{and the channel}} has been modified by the creation of mill ponds, weirs and sluices. Most of the mills used water wheels to generate their power, although two used water turbines. One was a <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> for a short period, and one was a paper mill, with the rest milling corn or producing flour. Several have been converted to become homes or hotels, but one is still operated on an occasional basis. The river {{has been used for}} navigation in the past, although its exact nature is unclear.|$|E

In 1925, she matriculated to a nurses training program at New Rochelle Hospital Training School for Nurses in New York. After receiving her nursing degree, De Vries married Wilbur Fuhr (June 5, 1928). A daughter, Mary Lee, was born to the couple in 1930. Shortly after Mary Lee's birth, Fuhr died unexpectedly. De Vries remarried in 1943 to Lou Stoumen and gave birth to a second daughter, Toby, in 1946. Stouman and De Vries divorced in 1949.|$|R

25|$|The {{promoters}} of the Midland Counties Railway suggested a line linking Nottingham, Derby and Leicester, with an extension to Rugby for London. Their original plan in 1833 {{had been to}} bring their line to Derby at Darby's Yard and Exeter Gardens, at {{the east side of}} the present Market Place, with a bridge over the Derwent. Following Vignoles's reassessment in 1835 a new route was proposed, either north or south of the Derby Canal to a terminus near St. Mary's Bridge with a branch to Full Street near to John Lombe's <b>Silk</b> <b>Mill.</b> Both options would cross the North Midland lines north of the other station.|$|E
25|$|Jersey Shore {{was once}} {{a major player in}} the {{railroad}} industry. The New York Central Railroad built a large rail car building operation within the boundaries of Jersey Shore in the late 19th century. What had formerly been a minor stop on the Pennsylvania Canal and stagecoach lines was transformed overnight into an industrial boomtown. Over 1,000 skilled mechanics were employed at the car shops. They were able to earn wages that far exceeded the normal income of the average worker in Lycoming County at the time. Other early industrial ventures in Jersey Shore included the American Balance Valve and Machine Works manufacturers of railroad valves, Jersey Shore Steel, the Susquehanna <b>Silk</b> <b>Mill,</b> and the Jersey Shore Creamery Company.|$|E
25|$|A {{major fire}} {{developed}} {{and the train}} was stopped at 02:41 near <b>Silk</b> <b>Mill</b> signal box about a mile short of the station in Taunton, Somerset, by the communication cord being pulled. By that time, most {{of the victims were}} already dead from carbon monoxide poisoning. A small number of passengers awoke and were able to escape, although they had considerable difficulty in doing so due to the smoke and heat. The sleeping car attendant of the Plymouth coaches could only shout a warning to a few of the occupants before he was overcome by smoke; it was the attendant in the adjacent coach who pulled the communication cord. The victims as well as other injured passengers were taken to the nearby Musgrove Park Hospital for treatment.|$|E
50|$|Fair Weather Waist and Dress Company {{was forced}} to submit to {{arbitration}} in a suit initiated against it by Susquehanna <b>Silk</b> <b>Mills</b> in April 1927. The two businesses disputed a contract which involved more than $100,000 worth of crepe' de chine. Susquehanna sold 800pieces of silk to the Fair Waist and Dress Company in 1925, which after six pieces had been delivered, refused additional deliveries and returned the six pieces.

25|$|That summer, he and Bronsky became {{involved}} in a local zoning controversy involving their gym. On August 17, local building inspector Peter Kropf sent a certified letter to Keith Boyer and the four people leasing the building that the building had numerous violations and that Boyers had 45 days to bring it into compliance with state and local codes or face daily fines of up to $1,000. Kropf also claimed that Boyer never secured a necessary permit when he opened a gym in the former <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> in 1983. The three-story brick building housed a furniture-stripping business {{as well as the}} gym. Town officials raised concerns that the building may be unsafe, such as the absence of proper fire exits, to accommodate the hundreds of people that the gym was bringing in on the weekends. Yasinsky was the first to sign and acknowledge the town's letter.|$|E
25|$|Sandbed wheel {{was built}} in 1723, and by 1794, there were three water wheels {{supplying}} 52 grinding troughs. A steam engine was supplementing the wheels by 1886, but the wheels remained in use until at least 1907. The weir and the shuttles controlling the flow in the head goit remain. Below this, Morton wheels {{are known to have}} existed in 1581. The works became the Philadelphia Works around 1807, and a claim for £6,204 was made and received for damage caused by the 1864 flood. Next came Kelham Wheel, which was used as a cutlers wheel, a <b>silk</b> <b>mill,</b> and a cotton mill. Following fires in 1792 and 1810, the mill was rebuilt to use steam power, and became the Britannia Corn Mills after 1864. The buildings were demolished in 1975, but the weir remains in good order, {{and is one of the}} largest in Sheffield. Below this were the Town Corn Mill and wheel, which was water powered until 1877, and was the subject of an archaeological investigation in 1999, which uncovered the remains of the wheel pits.|$|E
25|$|The river has {{provided}} the power {{for a number of}} water mills along its course. At Twyford, there have been mills since at least 1365, and a <b>silk</b> <b>mill</b> was built in 1810. Silk worms thrive on mulberry trees, and Queen Elizabeth I had encouraged planting of them during her reign. The Wokingham area was known for its production of silk stockings, and Thomas and George Billing, who were from Macclesfield and were brothers, hoped to create a profitable business processing the silk. The spun silk was woven on looms set up in cottages, and for a while the Billings were reasonably successful, although labour costs were kept down by employing children who should have been at Polehampton School. The law changed to allow silk to be imported more freely from France, and only mills equipped with up-to-date equipment could compete. Thomas died in 1824, and the mill was sold to become a flour mill soon afterwards. The wooden building was burnt down in a fire in 1891. A new mill was built, and in 1927 was bought by Berks, Bucks and Oxon Farmers Ltd, a group of farmers who operated as a co-operative to mill animal feed. The mill was powered by water wheels and diesel engines until the early 1960s, when it was converted to use electric motors. A distribution warehouse was added in 1969, but another fire destroyed the building in 1976, and construction of a new mill was completed in 1979. The owners became bankrupt in the 1990s, and in 2001 the site was redeveloped for housing. Although none of it is original, much of the building has four storeys, as did the pre-1976 building, and incorporates cosmetic features to suggest the previous use of the site.|$|E

50|$|The 18th {{century was}} a period of {{economic}} prosperity for the region, with the development of the industry (glove-making in Grenoble, <b>silk</b> <b>mills</b> in the Rhône valley). Important trade shows also occurred at Grenoble or Beaucroissant.|$|R
50|$|Logan <b>Silk</b> <b>Mills</b> {{was famous}} for {{providing}} the silk for the gown of the First Lady Caroline Harrison wore when her husband, Benjamin Harrison, was inaugurated the 23rd President of the United States in 1889. The Logan <b>Silk</b> <b>Mills</b> {{went out of business}} the following year and the space was occupied by the Wegman Piano Company. The Auburn Button Works remained in the complex until about 1900. A fire swept through the west wing on May 1, 1914 and destroyed the third floor. The complex was used as manufacturing space for automobile and mill supplies, shoes, marine hardware, and has also provided warehouse space.|$|R
