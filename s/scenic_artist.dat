She was also the story editor on the new series, but sought a promised associate producer credit. Non-writing staff who were brought from working on the film franchise included Rick Sternbach and Andrew Probert, as well as Michael Okuda who was hired as a <b>scenic</b> <b>artist.</b> Roddenberry hired costume designer William Ware Theiss, who had designed The Original Series costumes, while Milkis and Justman recruited art director Herman Zimmerman.

25|$|To pay {{the initial}} rent on the Downshire Hill house, Shaw sold {{many of his}} books and Craig pawned the gold watch which Henry Irving had given him. From the outset, the Society was run on a shoe-string using gifted amateur musicians and singers (75 in all), {{recruited}} from Martin Shaw and Nannie Dryhurst's Hampstead friends, supplemented by two professionals for the leads. Shaw arranged the scores, rehearsed and trained the singers and conducted all the productions. Craig not only designed and directed all the productions, he also produced and illustrated the programmes and designed the Society's stationery and posters. Neither of them took any pay. Craig's sister, Edith Craig, also worked on their productions as did the painter Jean Inglis and the <b>scenic</b> <b>artist</b> William Thompson Hemsley. Rehearsals took place in private houses in Hampstead, first in a large room in Guyon House lent to them by William Boulting, and later at Lested Lodge in Well Walk.|$|E

The {{training}} of {{students for the}} technical side of the Entertainment Industry in South Africa {{is not something that}} has been with us for many years. It is only for the last 33 years that an institution, the then Technikon Pretoria, started a course that trains <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> in South Africa. Not many institutions are training <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> in South Africa, and the current Department of Entertainment Technology has always been the leader in this field. In the United Kingdom, training students as <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> has been part of their programmes for the last ninety years. One finds that there is a demand for training <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> in the United Kingdom, because of the size and complexity of the Entertainment Industry there. During the Apartheid era, South Africa was excluded from the International scene, so the demand did not really exist here for a number of years. Lately, the Entertainment Industry in South Africa has picked up momentum and expanded its borders immensely, and this has created a great demand for trained <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> in South Africa. Today one can proudly say that one is part of an industry that trains people as <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> in South Africa that contributes to the global Entertainment Industry. The <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> who completed their studies at TUT are employed nationally and internationally, and deliver a very high standard of work on the most impressive projects. During the research that was done between the Tshwane University of Technology in South Africa and the Rose Bruford College and Guildhall School of Drama and Music, both in the United Kingdom in London, one can see that there are no major differences between the three institutions. Each institution has its own methodology, but at the end, all are working towards one goal, and that is to train the best <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> possible. The differences that present it are in the course structure, available facilities and the amount of staff allocated to do the training...|$|R

It shows Gotye and Kimbra naked throughout the clip, {{and as they}} sing, his skin is gradually painted into the backdrop via stop motion animation. In the director's cut, it features concealed nudity. The director's cut was never posted. The painting used in the video's background, painted by Howard Clark, {{is based on a}} 1980s artwork created by Gotye's father, Frank de Backer, who also designed the cover art for the related album, Making Mirrors. Emma Hack, an Australian artist and skin illustrator based in Adelaide, was hired by Pincus to work on the body paintings for Gotye and Kimbra. Melbourne <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artist</b> Howard Clark painted the backdrop. According to Hack, it took more than 23 hours to paint both Gotye and Kimbra to fit with Howard's background. Their painting symbolises their combined relationship.|$|E
500|$|Under the Jennisons, {{the main}} {{priorities}} for Belle Vue were the zoological and botanical gardens; amusements were provided {{merely as a}} distraction. The Jennisons laid out formal gardens in various styles between 1836 and 1898, including mazes, grottoes, an Italian garden, [...] "billiard-table lawns" [...] and constructed Tropical Plant Houses. There were also exotic constructions like the Indian temple and grotto, designed by George Danson, Belle Vue's <b>scenic</b> <b>artist.</b> Built to resemble a ruined temple, it housed snakes and crocodiles as well as flowers. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, [...] "the resort relied almost entirely for its attraction on its delightful gardens", but by 1931 the formalism had entirely disappeared. The gardens were also used to stage large political rallies for a wide spectrum of opinion, such as the Great Liberal Demonstration of 1924, at which Lloyd George addressed a crowd of 50,000, the first political meeting at which loudspeakers were used. The British Union of Fascists, popularly known as the Blackshirts, also held a meeting there, in September 1934.

5000|$|The {{union of}} <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> {{was founded in}} 1897 under the title [...] "the United <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> Association", which was briefly a local of the IATSE. Eventually the AFL-CIO ruled that the local must leave the IATSE and join the {{painters}} union. The organization instead chose to be independent. This lasted until 1918 when jurisdictional encroachment forced an affiliation with the IBPAT. However, the Brotherhood was guaranteed complete autonomy in its historical and traditional jurisdiction. On June 21, 1918, at their regular meeting at Geneva Hall in New York City, the <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> voted to accept a charter as United <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> of America (hence the USAA still seen in the unionâ€™s logo) being Local 829, an autonomous local of the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America. From that time on, Local 829 grew to include Scenic, Costume and Lighting Designers, Mural and Diorama <b>Artists,</b> <b>Scenic</b> Painters, Production Designers and Art Directors, Commercial Costume Stylists, Storyboard Artists and most recently Computer Artists, Art Department Coordinators, Sound Designers and Projection Designers working {{in all areas of}} the entertainment industry. In 1983, a group of West Coast designers chose to affiliate with United <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists,</b> and the Union opened a Los Angeles Regional office to serve them. In March 1990, a merger with IBPAT Local 350 in Chicago was effected and thereby jurisdiction was gained throughout the United States.Finally, on April 27 of 1999, after decades of suffering from a debilitating lack of common interest with the IBPAT, the membership of United <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists</b> Local 829 voted by an overwhelming majority to re-affiliate with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) and to disaffiliate from the IBPAT. The vote reflected a belief that the IATSE, an entertainment union, would provide better representation for United <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists,</b> who work in every type of theatrical, dance, motion picture, television, opera, and commercial production in the United States and around the world. At a special meeting of the IAâ€™s General Executive Board, United <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artistâ€™s</b> request for re-affiliation was unanimously approved and United <b>Scenic</b> <b>Artists,</b> Local USA 829, IATSE was born. The members of IATSE Local USA 829 (so named because another Local 829 already existed in the IA) now enjoy full membership rights in the IATSE. In its hundred-ten-plus years of existence, the local has negotiated Agreements with major film studios, television networks, the Broadway League, the League of Resident Theatres (LORT), numerous scenery supply companies, opera companies, ballet companies, and numerous independent production companies.|$|R

[...] Buckland also complained in the press that the art director's job, like that of the actor, suffered from over-production. [...] Buckland noted that he had supervised 56 pictures in a single year and added, [...] "Studio necessities compel him to supervise the art work on a number of productions at one time.

2500|$|One {{aspect of}} the series of books that the {{production}} team wanted to be captured in the series was {{the notion of a}} lack of specific time period or geography for the settings; Handler stated that he wrote enough for establishing set pieces, but purposely left more specific details vague [...] "in order for young readers to fill in the blanks themselves". Sonnenfeld wanted to capture that same sense of ambiguous time and place, and he and his team worked to try to define a set of subjective rules of what elements could be included. Sonnenfeld brought on Bo Welch, production designer for Edward Scissorhands, which Handler considered to capture the same sense of a [...] "familiar but completely imaginary" [...] suburban setting he had in mind for his books. While the production team used computer-generated imagery where needed, they attempted to avoid this use where possible, such as by using large painted backdrops, by key <b>scenic</b> <b>artist</b> John E.
