5000|$|The air escapes {{through the}} pump {{discharge}} nozzle whilst the fluid drops {{back down and}} is once more entrained by the impeller. The suction line is thus continuously evacuated. The design required for such a self-priming feature has an adverse effect on pump efficiency. Also, {{the dimensions of the}} separating chamber are relatively large. For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side channel and water ring pumps. Another type of <b>self-priming</b> <b>pump</b> is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an open impeller. This design is not only used for its self-priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example when draining water from construction pits.|$|E

40|$|The {{self-priming}} {{process of}} <b>self-priming</b> <b>pump</b> is gas-liquid two-phase flow process with complex internal transient flow. The effect of gas-liquid mixing and separating performances {{will play a}} crucial role during self-priming process. In order to study the self-priming process and improve the self-priming performance, the model named JETST- 100 was selected. Based on Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow model, transient numerical simulation of the gas-liquid mixing and separating phenomena on the pump chamber was carried out by using CFX software. The distributions of velocity vector, contours of gas volume fraction and liquid velocity of the pump or jet aerator, and the change of the gas volume fraction by monitoring points on the jet aerator were obtained. Test and simulation results show that the gas-liquid two-phase flow from the guide vane will form a larger velocity circulation, so that the gas-liquid separation is not sufficient. And the volume fraction of liquid inside pump chamber decrease with a large amount of water enters the outlet pipe. It is found that adding the baffle plate can prevent the generation of circulation on guide vane back, the gas-phase volume fraction of jet aerator inlet and nozzle outlet decreases, improve the self-priming performance of the pump...|$|E

In this thesis, silicone rubber was integrated with standard silicon based micromachining processes to allow fabrication of large deflection actuators. Taking {{advantage of the}} low Young's modulus and resulting flexibility of silicone rubber, several different devices for fluidic control were demonstrated. A novel self-releasing process for defining large actuators on silicon substrates irrespective of backside opening size was developed and used to generate micro balloon actuators used for delta wing control. When deployed near the separation line on the rounded leading edge of a delta wing, significant aerodynamic moments were generated allowing flight control at high angle of attack. To allow more flexibility in spatial actuation, a flexible metal substrate actuator "skin" was also developed and tested on flight models. With vertical actuations of 2 mm, rolling moment coefficients up to 0. 012 were obtained at high angle of attack, comparable to conventional flaps. The low durometer and flexibility of silicone rubber membranes were exploited to fabricate a peristaltic pump. Taking advantage of the low dead volume and good sealing afforded by membranes combined with form-fitting chambers, a <b>self-priming</b> <b>pump</b> capable of pumping gas and liquid with high particle immunity was demonstrated. Due to the planar nature of the device, it is straightforward to construct integrated systems of reservoirs, channels, valves, and pumps. Standalone operation without an external pneumatic source was achieved using thermopneumatic actuation with air as the working fluid. To achieve low power consumption and reasonable operational frequency, a suspended silicon island heater process was also developed. Flow rates up to 6. 3 [ [...] . ]/min at 291 mW power consumption were achieved with thermopneumatic actuation and flow rates above 100 [ [...] . ]/min can be easily obtained with external pneumatic operation. Using technology developed for the peristaltic pump, a diaphragm pump topology suitable for complex fluidic systems was developed. By using a plurality of active valves and a single pumping chamber, fluids can be pumped from any input to any output. This can significantly {{reduce the number of}} pumps necessary for anything other than the simplest flow system. Using an improved thermopneumatic actuator, integrated flow systems can be constructed...|$|E

5000|$|Centrifugal pumps {{which are}} not {{designed}} with an internal or external self-priming stage can only start to pump the fluid after the pump has initially been primed with the fluid. In addition, a suction-side swing check valve or a vent valve must be fitted to prevent any siphon action and ensure that the fluid remains in the casing when the pump has been stopped. In <b>self-priming</b> centrifugal <b>pumps</b> with a separation chamber the fluid pumped and the entrained air bubbles are pumped into the separation chamber by the impeller action.|$|R
50|$|A {{flexible}} {{impeller pump}} is a positive-displacement pump that, by deforming impeller vanes, draws the liquid into the pump housing and moves {{it to the}} discharge port with a constant flow rate.

A chromogenic enzyme substrate assay method was used to easily detect coliform bacteria by monitoring the color change of the sampled water mixed with a reagent. Live webcam image streaming to the web browser of the end user with a Wi-Fi connected sensor node shows the water color changes in real time. The liquid can be manipulated on the web-based user interface, and also can be observed by webcam feeds. Image streaming and web console servers run on an embedded processor with an expansion board. The UART channel of the expansion board is connected to an external Arduino board and a motor driver to control <b>self-priming</b> water <b>pumps</b> to sample the water, mix the reagent, and remove the water sample after the test is completed.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of two blades <b>self-priming</b> solid-handling centrifugal <b>pumps</b> {{is carried out}} through a 1 D/ 3 D numerical approach.

The study of this kind of machines, which at this time is based almost entirely on empirical data derived from experience, can receive great advantages from the three-dimensional numerical simulations. Recent developments in CFD calculations can provide a means to follow this guideline.

40|$|Rotating {{machinery}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} typical types of mechanical equipment and plays a significant role in industrial applications. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery has gained wide attention for its significance in preventing catastrophic accident and guaranteeing sufficient maintenance. With the development of science and technology, fault diagnosis methods based on multi-disciplines are becoming the focus in the field of fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. This paper presents a multi-discipline method based on image-processing for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Different from traditional analysis method in one-dimensional space, this study employs computing method in the field of image processing to realize automatic feature extraction and fault diagnosis in a two-dimensional space. The proposed method mainly includes the following steps. First, the vibration signal is transformed into a bi-spectrum contour map utilizing bi-spectrum technology, which provides a basis for the following image-based feature extraction. Then, an emerging approach in the field of image processing for feature extraction, speeded-up robust features, is employed to automatically exact fault features from the transformed bi-spectrum contour map and finally form a high-dimensional feature vector. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector, thus highlighting main fault features and reducing subsequent computing resources, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is adopt to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector. At last, probabilistic neural network is introduced for fault identification. Two typical rotating machinery, axial piston hydraulic <b>pump</b> and <b>self-priming</b> centrifugal <b>pumps,</b> are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method based on image-processing achieves a high accuracy, thus providing a highly effective means to fault diagnosis for rotating machinery...|$|R
40|$|<b>Self-priming</b> solid-handling {{centrifugal}} <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} in many industrial and civil applications for the transport of slurries and fluid with suspensions. This class of pumps has to undergo restrictive geometrical and structural constraints (reduced number of blades, device for the selfpriming, high mechanical resistance) which usually do not allow an optimal fluid dynamic design. This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that the usual methods of investigation for these pumps are either not reliable (one-dimensional and/or similarity analysis) or can require large time effort (experimental campaign). In this paper, a numerical integrated procedure developed for the study of two blades selfpriming solid-handling centrifugal pumps and performed by means of the CFX-Tascflow numerical code, has been carried out on a particular class of solid handling pumps. A number of variations of the blade geometry is considered and studied numerically. In particular, the effect of the leading edge profile and of different thickness distribution on the blade mean line is analysed, in terms of total performance variations, flow field features and profile pressure distributions...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the {{characterization}} and performance studies of <b>self-priming</b> peristaltic <b>pump</b> for drug delivery application. Conventional {{materials and methods}} {{have been used to}} fabricate single cam mechanism based peristaltic micropump. To control the fluid flow precisely in micro liter range, a single cam mechanism has been used instead of conventional roller mechanism. The fabricated pump is suitable for liquid, gas and foam. Using water as a fluid medium, a flow rate of 12. 5 mu l/rpm is achieved using a flexible silicone tube of inner diameter 1. 5 mm and outer diameter 2. 5 mm. Other than water, higher viscosity fluids showed a decrease in the flow rate. The designed micropump exhibits a linear dependence of flow rate in the voltage range of 2. 5 V to 5 V. Drug delivery using micropump demands that the micropump has to pump against the blood pressure (maximum of 25 kPa) with constant flow rate. Here the designed pump is able to pump the liquid with a constant flow rate of 500 mu l/min (water) up to a backpressure of 40 kPa. It was observed that, by increasing the backpressure above 40 kPa, flow rate of the pump gradually decreased to 125 mu l/min at 120 kPa. In addition, Micropump based drug delivery demands that the micropump should be normally in closed condition in all the positions to avoid drug leakage and bleeding. Hence, micropump has been characterized for normally closed condition in all positions (0 degrees to 360 degrees). However, a minute leak of 0. 14 % was found for an inlet pressure of 140 kPa. Also, the normally closed region with no leak is observed up to 60 kPa of pressure in all positions (0 degrees to 360 degrees) ...|$|R
