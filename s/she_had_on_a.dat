2500|$|Prime Minister Paul Martin {{followed}} Chrétien's example and, for Clarkson's successor, {{put forward}} to the Queen the name of Michaëlle Jean, who was, like Clarkson, a woman, a refugee, {{a member of a}} visible minority, a CBC career journalist, and married to an intellectual husband who worked in the arts. Her appointment initially sparked accusations that she was a supporter of Quebec sovereignty, and it was observed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> few occasions trodden into political matters, as well as continuing to foster the notion that the governor general had replaced the Queen as head of state, thereby [...] "unbalancing... the federalist symmetry." [...] But Jean ultimately won plaudits, particularly for her solidarity with the Canadian Forces and Canada's Aboriginal peoples, as well as her role in the parliamentary dispute that took place between December 2008 and January 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Princess Henry's royal {{train of}} five {{carriages}} left Victoria at 10.45 am, and steamed in to Herne Bay at 12.26 pm, with her saloon carriage stopping exactly {{at the red}} carpet, to be met by an escort of soldiers presenting arms and Fusiliers playing the National Anthem. The Princess wore a grey brocade dress, with a cuirass bodice of a darker shade with gold embroidery. Her cloak was entirely of grey beads and ornamented with black silk braid, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> black hat with stone-grey lancet plume feathers. Mr Knollys in the [...] "magnificent uniform of the City of London Yeomanry" [...] presented Sir Mark Edlmann Collet, High Sheriff of Kent, [...] "who was attended by two footmen in gorgeous livery and bearing silver-tipped wands." [...] The High Sheriff in turn presented various council, ecclesiastical and mayoral personages to the Princess, and she was given a bouquet. Gathering at the station to meet the Princess at the station were [...] "territorials in scarlet and buff and the New College Cadet Corps in more sober khaki with bayonets fixed," [...] along with 4th Company F Battalion The Buffs, East Kent Regiment [...] "in their scarlet and buff uniforms." [...] They were joined by a squadron of mounted 6th Dragoon Guards who were to provide the guard of honour and travelling escort [...] "with glistening helmets and tossing plumes and flashing swords." [...] Taking centre ground to provide the music was the Band of the Second Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers [...] "in full dress with their busbies". The station was [...] "decorated with flags and a covered way laid with red carpet had been prepared from the gateway {{on the right of}} the booking office. [...] All round were flags, which had plenty of life in the fresh, southerly breeze." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you can talk," [...] {{replied the}} girl scornfully, [...] "but you'd {{be like the}} rest of 'em." [...] But she was glad that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> clean collar and apron-if it was ironing day.|$|E

6000|$|But he had {{not taken}} six steps {{when he saw her}} coming. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> grey furry scarf, hiding her mouth, making her look much older.

60|$|One {{day when}} Roger came he found {{six feet of}} young man reposing at ease in his {{particular}} chair.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{white dress}} I {{had never seen}} with a low neck and short sleeves, and she looked so sweet, so dainty, so {{altogether}} desirable, that I groaned a hundred times in my jealousy.

6000|$|Aunt Em had her calico dress skirt [...] "tucked up," [...] and {{she wore}} a faded, blue-checked apron.

6000|$|It was awfully rude {{of him to}} {{keep her}} waiting! And he was soon down in the empty dining-room, where a sleepy maid was already {{bringing}} in their coffee. Anna was there alone. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flax-blue shirt, open at the neck, a short green skirt, and a grey-green velvety hat, small, with one black-cock's feather. Why could not people always wear such nice things, and be as splendid-looking! And he said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} her take to anyone so quick," [...] Laura smiled. Howard noticed her in {{particular}} for the first time. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> clean calico dress and a gingham apron, and she looked strong and fresh and handsome. Her head was intellectual, her eyes full of power. She seemed anxious to remove the impression of her unpleasant looks and words the night before.

60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> black bonnet, {{and a black}} shawl, and no {{crinoline}} at all; and a pair {{of large}} green spectacles, and a great hooked nose, hooked so much that the bridge of it stood quite up above her eyebrows; and under her arm she carried a great birch-rod. Indeed, she was so ugly that Tom was tempted to make faces at her: but did not; for he did not admire the look of the birch-rod under her arm.|$|E
60|$|Fitz has a {{very pretty}} wit of his own, and a good {{reputation}} on circuit; but he is timid before great people.

She was in court mourning (for the late Prince of Schlippenschloppen). <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large black funereal turban and appurtenances, and a vast breastplate of twinkling, twiddling black bugles. No wonder a man could not be gay in talking to HER.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I {{wish you}} could have been at that banquet. The dinner service was all gold and cut glass. There were about forty men and eight ladies present besides Aunt Maggie and I. You'd never have known the third richest woman in the world. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new black silk dress with so much {{passementerie}} on it that it sounded exactly like a hailstorm I heard once when I was staying all night with a girl that lived in a top-floor studio.|$|E
