One such boy, after patiently doing his work for many days, contrived to connect this <b>stop-cock</b> {{with some of the}} moving parts of the engine, by a wire, in such a manner, that the engine itself did the work which had been entrusted to him; and after seeing that the whole business would go regularly forward, he left the wire in charge, and went away to play.|$|E
60|$|I {{have here}} a furnace with a pipe {{going through it}} like an iron gun-barrel, and I have stuffed that barrel full of bright iron-turnings, and placed it across the fire, to be made red-hot. We can either send air through the barrel to {{come in contact with}} the iron, or we can send steam from this little boiler {{at the end of the}} barrel. Here is a <b>stop-cock</b> which shuts off the steam from the barrel until we wish to admit it. There is some water in these glass jars, which I have {{coloured}} blue, so that you may see what happens. Now, you know very well that any steam I might send through that barrel, if it went through into the water, would be condensed; for you have seen that steam cannot retain its gaseous form if it be cooled down.|$|E

One could wish that this friendly dragon could be in some way moderated in his appetite for coal,--he does consume without mercy, it must be confessed,--but then great is the work he has to do. At any hour of day or night, in the most distant part of your house, you have but to turn a <b>stop-cock</b> and your red dragon sends you hot water for your need; your washing-day becomes a mere play-day; your pantry has its ever-ready supply; and then, by a little judicious care in arranging apartments and economizing heat, a range may make two or three chambers comfortable in winter weather.

60|$|It is {{certainly}} something combustible, but not combustible {{in the way}} that hydrogen is. Hydrogen would not have given you that noise; but the colour of that light, when the thing did burn, was like that of hydrogen: it will, however, burn without contact with the air. That is why I have chosen this other form of apparatus, for the purpose of pointing out to you what are the particular circumstances of this experiment. In place of an open vessel I have taken one that is closed (our battery is so beautifully active that we are even boiling the mercury, and getting all things right--not wrong, but vigorously right); and I am going to shew you that that gas, whatever it may be, can burn without air, and in that respect differs from a candle, which cannot burn without the air. And our manner of doing this is as follows:--I have here a glass vessel (G) which is fitted with two platinum-wires (IK), through which I can apply electricity; and we can put the vessel on the air-pump and exhaust the air, and when we have taken the air out we can bring it here and fasten it on to this jar (F), and let into the vessel that gas which was formed by the action of the voltaic battery upon the water, and which we have produced by changing the water into it,--for I may go as far as this, and say we have really, by that experiment, changed the water into that gas. We have not only altered its condition, but we have changed it really and truly into that gaseous substance, and all the water is there which was decomposed by the experiment. As I screw this vessel (GH) on here (H), and make the tubes well connected, and when I open the <b>stop-cocks</b> (HHH), if you watch the level of the water (in F), you will see that the gas will rise. I will now close the <b>stop-cocks,</b> as I have drawn up as much as the vessel can hold, and being safely conveyed into that chamber, I will pass into it an electric spark from this Leyden jar (L), when the vessel, which is now quite clear and bright, will become dim. There will be no sound, for the vessel is strong enough to confine the explosion. [A spark was then passed through the jar, when the explosive mixture was ignited.] Did you see that brilliant light? If I again screw the vessel on to the jar, and open these <b>stop-cocks,</b> you will see that the gas will rise a second time. [The <b>stop-cocks</b> were then opened.] Those gases [referring to the gases first collected in the jar, and which had just been ignited by the electric spark] have disappeared, as you see: their place is vacant, and fresh gas has gone in. Water has been formed from them; and if we repeat our operation [repeating the last experiment], I shall have another vacancy, as you will see by the water rising. I always have an empty vessel after the explosion, because the vapour or gas into which that water has been resolved by the battery explodes {{under the influence of the}} spark, and changes into water; and by-and-by you will see in this upper vessel some drops of water trickling down the sides and collecting at the bottom.|$|R

But the poorer people are--and therefore usually, alas! the more ignorant--the less water they get; and the less they care to have water; and the less they are inclined to pay for it; and the more, I am sorry to say, they waste what little they do get; and I am still more sorry to say, spoil, and even steal and sell--in London at least--the <b>stop-cocks</b> and lead-pipes which bring the water into their houses.

After giving your boy his breakfast, to find fault with him for being incessantly in motion when his system has absorbed it, is simply to find fault with him for being healthy and happy. To give children food and then to restrain the resulting activity, is conduct very analogous {{to that of the}} engineer who should lock the action of his engine, turn all the <b>stop-cocks,</b> and shut down the safety-valve, while he still went on all the time putting in coal under the boiler. The least that he could expect would be a great hissing and fizzling at all the joints of his machine; and it would be only by means of such a degree of looseness in the joints as would allow of the escape of the imprisoned force in this way that could prevent the repression ending in a frightful catastrophe.|$|R

6000|$|And now I come to {{the next}} great vital element for which [...] "our house" [...] must provide,--WATER. [...] "Water, water, everywhere,"--it must be plentiful, it must be easy to get at, it must be pure. Our {{ancestors}} had some excellent ideas in home living and housebuilding. Their houses were, generally speaking, very sensibly contrived,--roomy, airy, and comfortable; but in their water arrangements they had little mercy on womankind. The well {{was out in the}} yard; and in winter one must flounder through snow and bring up the ice-bound bucket, before one could fill the tea-kettle for breakfast. For a sovereign princess of the republic, this was hardly respectful or respectable. Wells have come somewhat nearer in modern times; but the idea of a constant supply of fresh water by the simple turning of a <b>stop-cock</b> has not yet visited the great body of our houses. Were we free to build [...] "our house" [...] just as we wish it, there should be a bath-room to every two or three inmates, and the hot and cold water should circulate to every chamber.|$|E
60|$|Among our must-be's, {{we would}} lay by a generous sum for plumbing. Let us have our bath-rooms, and our {{arrangements}} for cleanliness and health in kitchen and pantry; and afterwards let {{the quality of}} our lumber and the style of our finishing be according to the sum we have left. The power to command a warm bath in a house at any hour of day or night is better in bringing up a family of children than any amount of ready medicine. In three quarters of childish ailments the warm bath is an almost immediate remedy. Bad colds, incipient fevers, rheumatisms, convulsions, neuralgias innumerable, are washed off in their first beginnings, and run down the lead pipes into oblivion. Have, then, O friend, all the water in your house that you can afford, and enlarge your ideas of the worth of it, that you may afford a great deal. A bathing-room is nothing to you that requires an hour of lifting and fire-making to prepare it for use. The apparatus is too cumbrous,--you do not turn to it. But when your chamber opens upon a neat, quiet little nook, and you have only to turn your <b>stop-cocks</b> and all is ready, your remedy is at hand, you use it constantly. You are waked in the night by a scream, and find little Tom sitting up, wild with burning fever. In three minutes he is in the bath, quieted and comfortable; you get him back, cooled and tranquil, to his little crib, and in the morning he wakes as if nothing had happened.|$|R
60|$|The bending of {{them was}} {{accomplished}} {{by means of a}} powerful lever. It would be an endless business to detail all that was done in this workshop. Every piece of comparatively small iron-work used in the construction of railway engines, carriages, vans, and trucks, from a door-hinge to a coupling-chain, was forged in that smithy. Passing onward, they came to a workshop where iron castings of all kinds were being made; cylinders, fire-boxes, etcetera,--and a savage-looking place it was, with numerous holes and pits of various shapes and depths in the black earthy floor, which were the moulds ready, or in preparation, for the reception of the molten metal. Still farther on they passed through a workroom where every species of brass-work was being made. And here Bob Marrot was amazed to find that the workmen turned brass on turning-lathes with as much facility {{as if it had been}} wood. Some of the pieces of brazen mechanism were very beautiful and delicate-- especially one piece, a <b>stop-cock</b> for letting water into a boiler, the various and complex parts of which, when contrasted with the huge workmanship of the other departments, resembled fine watch-work.|$|E
60|$|C is a {{travelling}} carriage {{that supports the}} portraits in turn, from which the composite has to be made.

For convenience of description I will confine myself to the first instance only, and will therefore speak of C as the carriage that supports the frame that holds the negative transparencies. C can be pushed along the board and be clamped anywhere, and it has a rack and pinion adjustment; but it should have been made movable by rack and pinion along the whole length of the board. The frame for the transparencies has the same movements of adjustment as those in the stage of a microscope. It rotates round a hollow axis, through which a beam of light is thrown, and independent movements in the plane, at right angles to the axis, can be given to it in two directions, at right angles to one another, by turning two separate screws. The beam of light is furnished by three gas-burners, and it passes through a condenser. The gas is supplied through a flexible tube that does not interfere with the movements of C, and it is governed by a <b>stop-cock</b> in front of the operator.|$|E
6000|$|Another scheme, more ingenious but {{not less}} fallacious, was propounded in 1670 by Francis Lana, a Jesuit, for {{navigating}} the air. This {{plan was to}} make four copper balls of very large dimensions, yet so extremely thin that, after the air had been extracted, they should become, in a considerable degree, specifically lighter than the surrounding medium. Each of his copper balls was to be about 25 feet in diameter, with the thickness of only the 225th part of an inch, the metal weighing 365 pounds avoirdupois, while {{the weight of the}} air which it should contain would be about 670 pounds, leaving, after a vacuum had been formed, an excess of 305 pounds for the power of ascension. The four balls would therefore, it was thought, rise into the air with a combined force of 1220 pounds, which was deemed by Lana to be sufficient to transport a boat completely furnished with masts, sails, oars, and rudders, and carrying several passengers. The method by which the vacuum was to be obtained was by connecting each globe, fitted with a <b>stop-cock,</b> to a tube of at least thirty-five feet long; the whole being filled with water; when raised to the vertical position the water would run out, the stop-cocks would be closed at the proper time, and the vacuum secured. It {{does not seem to have}} entered the head of this philosopher that the weight of the surrounding atmosphere would crush and destroy his thin exhausted receivers, but he seems to have been alarmed at the idea of his supposed discovery being applied to improper uses, such as the passing of desperadoes over fortified cities, on which they might rain down fire and destruction from the clouds! ...|$|E

The aperture within the hemisphere at f is very small: g is a brass collar fitted to the upper hemisphere, through which the shell-lac support of the inner ball and its stem passes; h is the inner ball, also of brass; it screws on to a brass stem i, terminated above by a brass ball B, l, l is a mass of shell-lac, moulded carefully on to i, and serving both to support and insulate it and its balls h, B. The shell-lac stem l is fitted into the socket g, by a little ordinary resinous cement, more fusible than shell-lac, applied at mm {{in such a way as}} to give sufficient strength and render the apparatus air-tight there, yet leave as much as possible of the lower part of the shell-lac stem untouched, as an insulation between the ball h and the surrounding sphere a, a. The ball h has a small aperture at n, so that when the apparatus is exhausted of one gas and filled with another, the ball h may itself also be exhausted and filled, that no variation of the gas in the interval o may occur during the course of an experiment.|$|E
6000|$|You {{have asked}} me several times, and I am very glad you have, [...] "How do you weigh gases?" [...] I will shew you; it is very simple, and easily done. Here is a balance, and here a copper bottle, made as light as we can {{consistent}} with due strength, turned very nicely in the lathe, and made perfectly air-tight, with a <b>stop-cock,</b> which we can open and shut, which at present is open, and therefore allows the bottle {{to be full of}} air. I have here a nicely-adjusted balance, in which I think the bottle, in its present condition, will be balanced by the weight on the other side. And here is a pump by which we can force the air into this bottle, and with it we will force in a certain number of volumes of air, as measured by the pump. [Twenty measures were pumped in.] We will shut that in {{and put it in the}} balance. See how it sinks: it is much heavier than it was. By what? By the air that we have forced into it by the pump. There is not a greater bulk of air, but there is the same bulk of heavier air, because we have forced in air upon it. And that you may have a fair notion in your mind as to how much this air measures, here is a jar full of water. We will open that copper vessel into this jar, and let the air return to its former state. All I have to do now is to screw them tightly together, and to turn the taps, when there, you see, is the bulk of the twenty pumps of air which I forced into the bottle; and to make sure that we have been quite correct in what we have been doing, we will take the bottle again to the balance, and, if it is now counterpoised by the original weight, we shall be quite sure we have made our experiment correctly.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} report (2) from this laboratory, {{a method for}} measuring intrarenal pressure was described which utilized some of the technics described by McMaster 0) in measuring intracutaneous pressures. This method {{was thought to be}} excellent for determining intrarenal pressures (to be abbreviated IRP), but it was criticized for being too time-consuming.

40|$|In the {{investigations}} taken {{up on the}} Catalytic Cracking of Kerosene Oil, the authors felt the need of a laboratory flow-rator which could maintain a reasonably steady and accurate rate of flow of oil during the test run of cracking. Several types of flow-rators described in literature were examined but found unsatisfactory for the purpose. A description of a simplified and fairly accurate all-glass flow-rator of the variable area type, designed by the authors, is given in this paper. The method of calibration of the flow-rator under varying temperature conditions is given. The accuracy of the flow·rator has been verified by actual test-run results and by making {{a comparison of the}} material balance. The results indicate an accuracy within 5 %. INTRODUC 1 ION A large variety of laboratory flow-meters designed to operate on different principles are described in literature. Although meters working on thermo-electric and electronic drop counting principles seem to be interesting, the Mariotte bottle type is found to be suitable for laboratory purposes. Zentner! employed an apparatus in which the liquid is siphoned from a Mariotte bottle and delivered through a capillary. An improved form of the above flow-meter has been described by Fabris and Peacock " in which, the liquid is used to measure the pressure differential across the capillary. Many difficulties, however, were encountered by us in testing the Mariotte bottle type, constructed in our laboratories. It was found that considerable time elapsed before the liquid attained definite differential height in the two limbs for a correct reading of a steady flow-rate to be taken. Further, it was difficult to set up the complicated all-glass construction in three dimensions on a wooden frame, and several parts were broken ar. d had to be frequently repaired, necessitating its recalibration every time. The final design of the flow-meter constructed by us was much simplified {{as a result of a}} numher of unsuccessful attempts to modify the older types.

30|$|Gas {{sampling}} for methane started 0  days after rice transplanting (DAT) {{and ended}} 14  days after harvest, {{and the gas}} samples were collected once weekly from 8 : 00 to 10 : 00  a.m. The measurement of methane emissions were measured using the static closed chamber technique (Crill et al. 1988; Wang and Wang 2003). The chamber of 50 -cm length, 30 -cm breadth and 70 -cm height made of 6 -mm thick acrylic sheets were used. The height of the chambers ranging from 90 to 120  cm was used during the later crop-growing period to accommodate the increasing plant height. To accommodate the chamber, rectangular U-shaped aluminum channels (50  cm[*]×[*] 30  cm) were used. The aluminum channels were inserted into the soil {{to a depth of}} 15  cm well ahead of gas sample collection. Each aluminum channel enclosed six plants of rice and covered an area of 0.25  m 2 (0.5  m[*]×[*] 0.5  m) to a height of 0.5 or 1.2  m (according to plant height). Each chamber was equipped with interior circulating fans to ensure complete gas mixing and to minimise changes in air temperature inside the chamber during sampling. For rice-growing season, an aluminum channel was inserted in each treatment field plot and remained there during the entire monitoring period. The top edge of the frame had a groove that could be filled with water to seal the rim of the chamber. Four gas samples were collected at 15 -min intervals over the course of 45  min. Gas samples were drawn from the chambers using a 50 -ml airtight syringe fitted with a three-way <b>stop-cock</b> and a fine needle inserted through the other self-sealing rubber septum. The samples were brought to the laboratory immediately after collection and methane concentration in the gas samples were analysed using a gas chromatograph (Varian, CP- 3800 GC, USA) equipped with a flame ionisation detector (FID) and a chromopack capillary column. Column, injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 50, 90 and 150  °C, respectively. The gas chromatographic system was calibrated periodically with a standard obtained from National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, India. Nitrogen (99.999 % pure) was used as a carrier gas whereas hydrogen and zero air were used for ignition of the flame in the FID. Methane fluxes (CH 4 mg/m 2 /h) were calculated from the temporal increase in the gas concentration inside the box using the equation of Parashar et al. (1996).|$|E
