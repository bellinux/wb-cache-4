5|$|The <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> is {{the changes}} in gene {{expression}} in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> is known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.|$|E
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the <b>SOS</b> <b>response.</b> The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of <b>SOS</b> <b>response.</b> The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E
40|$|Twenty pouch-young tammar {{wallabies}} (Macropus eugenii) {{were used}} to determine the generator of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) during development through ABR and focal superior olivary complex (SO) recordings. A click <b>response</b> from the <b>SO</b> in the wallaby was recorded from postnatal day (PND) 112 when the ABR was only a positive-negative deflection. Before PND 120, the <b>SO</b> <b>response</b> did not contribute to the ABR as it occurred outside the ABR time-span. After PND 140, the <b>SO</b> <b>response</b> was correlated with multiple waves of the ABR with its dominant component corresponding to the ABR P 3 wave. The latency, threshold, and amplitude of the <b>SO</b> <b>response</b> developed to the adult-like level at PND 140, while the rate-following ability in the <b>SO</b> <b>response</b> reached the adult level at PND 160. Presumably this was due to more complicated mechanisms underlying the auditory adaptation. The adaptation of the <b>SO</b> <b>response</b> was directly proportional to the stimulus rate and intensity as well as developmental status. Developmental comparison between the ABR and the focal responses from four auditory brainstem nuclei indicated that each ABR component may have a dominant contributor from the auditory brainstem, but there was no simple and exclusive association between the ABR component and the auditory brainstem nuclei...|$|R

25|$|The host cell, {{containing}} a dormant phage genome, experiences DNA damage {{due to a}} high stress environment, and starts to undergo the <b>SOS</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} distinction {{here is that}} between the two decisions; lysogeny and lysis on infection, and continuing lysogeny or lysis from a prophage. The latter is determined solely by the activation of RecA in the <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> of the cell, as detailed in the section on induction. The former will also be affected by this; a cell undergoing an <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> will always be lysed, as no cI protein {{will be allowed to}} build up. However, the initial lytic/lysogenic decision on infection is also dependent on the cII and cIII proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} correlate of the filament formation was described. The {{exposure to}} β-lactam antibiotics induced the <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> in Escherichia coli. During repair of DNA damage, the <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both β-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in E.coli through the DpiBA two-component signal transduction system {{leading to the}} inactivation of the ftsl gene product, penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene {{is a group of}} filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane transpeptidase required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl gene product requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the bactericidal effects of β-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the <b>SOS</b> <b>response</b> resulting in inhibition of cell division.|$|E
