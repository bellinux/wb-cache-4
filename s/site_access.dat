5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including <b>site</b> <b>access</b> restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fire, the {{government}} of Madagascar established the Direction nationale des opérations Rova (DNOR, or National Office of Rova Operations), a body directed by four national experts within Madagascar's Ministry of Culture who were tasked with developing and overseeing plans for {{the reconstruction of the}} Rova. Two years after the fire, several key milestones in the process had been achieved, with objects recovered from the fire inventoried, site excavations completed, preliminary restoration plans for Manjakamiadana developed, and work on the royal chapel initiated. A ramp was also built to enable <b>site</b> <b>access</b> for the necessary heavy construction vehicles. Prior to work commencing, a traditional ceremony was performed to restore the sanctity of the site, which had served a dual role as both a physical tomb and spiritual link to venerated ancestors.|$|E

It was also reported that helicopters were unable to land at the crash <b>site.</b> <b>Access</b> was also made difficult because the road leading to the site was covered in snow.|$|E

2500|$|Special trains were {{assembled}} at Nelson {{consisting of}} carriages to provide offices and accommodations {{for the staff}} and wagons to haul the scrap. [...] The demolition crews began their work at Glenhope on 21 November 1955, {{and by the end}} of the week the Glenhope station was no more. [...] The original expectation that the work could be completed in six months proved to be too ambitious, as for much of the railways length there was limited <b>site</b> <b>access,</b> the need to also lift sidings, or to not obstruct level crossings to allow for the passage of vehicular traffic. [...] The lifted rails and sleepers were hauled back to and stored in the Nelson station yard pending disposal. [...] Many of the sleepers were sold by tender, while some of the rails ended up at other railway projects around the country. [...] The last rail was symbolically lifted on Friday 21 December 1956.|$|E
