40|$|It {{is known}} that {{equilibrium}} thermodynamics can be deduced from a constrained Fisher information extemizing process. We show here that, more generally, both non-equilibrium and equilibrium thermodynamics {{can be obtained from}} such a Fisher treatment. Equilibrium thermodynamics corresponds to the ground state solution, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics corresponds to excited state solutions, of a <b>Schroedinger</b> <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> (SWE). That equation appears as an output of the constrained variational process that extremizes Fisher information. Both equilibrium- and non-equilibrium situations can thereby be tackled by one formalism that clearly exhibits the fact that thermodynamics and quantum mechanics can both be expressed in terms of a formal SWE, out of a common informational basis.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} quantum brain {{model is}} proposed using a nonlinear <b>Schroedinger</b> <b>wave</b> <b>equation.</b> The model proposes that {{there exists a}} quantum process that mediates the collective response of a neural lattice (classical brain). The model is used to explain eye movements when tracking moving targets. Using a Recurrent Quantum Neural Network(RQNN) while simulating the quantum brain model, two very interesting phenomena are observed. First, as eye sensor data is processed in a classical brain, a wave packet is triggered in the quantum brain. This wave packet moves like a particle. Second, when the eye tracks a fixed target, this wave packet moves not in a continuous but rather in a discrete mode. This result reminds one of the saccadic movements of the eye consisting of 'jumps' and 'rests'. However, such a saccadic movement is intertwined with smooth pursuit movements when the eye has to track a dynamic trajectory. In a sense, {{this is the first}} theoretical model explaining the experimental observation reported concerning eye movements in a static scene situation. The resulting prediction is found to be very precise and efficient in comparison to classical objective modeling schemes such as the Kalman filter.

40|$|The quantum {{principles}} that establish the energy levels and degeneracies needed {{to evaluate the}} partition functions are explored. The uncertainty principle {{is associated with the}} dual wave-particle nature of the model used to describe quantized gas particles. The <b>Schroedinger</b> <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> is presented as a generalization of Maxwell's wave equation; the former applies to all particles while the Maxwell equation applies to the special case of photon particles. The size of the quantum cell in phase space and the representation of momentum as a space derivative operator follow from the uncertainty principle. A consequence of this is that steady-state problems that are space-time dependent for the classical model become only space dependent for the quantum model and are often easier to solve. The partition function is derived for quantized free particles and, at normal conditions, the result is the same as that given by the classical phase integral. The quantum corrections that occur at very low temperatures or high densities are derived. These corrections for the Einstein-Bose gas qualitatively describe the condensation effects that occur in liquid helium, but are unimportant for most practical purposes otherwise. However, the corrections for the Fermi-Dirac gas are important because they quantitatively describe the behavior of high-density conduction electron gases in metals and explain the zero point energy and low specific heat exhibited in this case...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{serves as}} a bridge between quantum {{computing}} and analogical modeling (a general theory for predicting categories of behavior in varying contexts). Since its formulation in the early 1980 s, analogical modeling has been successfully applied {{to a variety of}} problems in language. Several striking similarities between quantum mechanics and analogical modeling have recently been noted: (1) traditional statistics can be derived from a non-statistical basis by assuming data occurrences are accessed through a spin-up state (given two equally probable quantum states, spin-up and spin-down); (2) the probability of predicting a particular outcome is determined by the squaring of an underlying linear measure and is the result of decoherence (which occurs when a quantum system is observed); and (3) a natural measure of certainty (called the agreement) is based on one chance of guessing the right outcome and corresponds to the integrated squaring of <b>Schroedinger's</b> <b>wave</b> <b>equation.</b> Analogical modeling considers all possible combiantions of a given context of n variables, which is classical terms leads to an exponential explosion on the order of 2 **n.

40|$|According to Schroedinger's ideas, {{classical}} {{dynamics of}} point particles should {{correspond to the}} " geometrical optics " limit of a linear <b>wave</b> <b>equation,</b> {{in the same way}} as ray optics is the limit of wave optics. It is shown that, using notions of modern wave theory, the " geometrical optics " analogy leads to the correspondence between a classical Hamiltonian H and a " quantum " <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> in a natural and general way. In particular, the correspondence is unambiguous also in the case where H contains mixed terms involving momentum and position. In the line of Schroedinger's ideas, it is also attempted to justify the occurrence, in QM, of eigenvalues problems, not merely for energy, but also for momentum. It is shown that the wave functions of pure momentum states can be defined in a physically more satisfying way than by assuming plane waves. In the case of a spatially uniform force field, such momentum states have a singularity and move undeformed according to Newton's second law. The mentioned unambiguous correspondence allows to uniquely extend the Klein-Gordon relativistic <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> to the case where a constant gravitational field is present. It is argued that <b>Schroedinger's</b> <b>wave</b> mechanics can be extended to the case with a variable gravitational field only if one accepts that the <b>wave</b> <b>equation</b> is a preferred-frame one. From this viewpoint, generally-covariant extensions of the <b>wave</b> <b>equations</b> of QM seem rather formal. Finally, it is conjectured that there is no need for a quantum gravity.
