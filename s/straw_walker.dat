50|$|The Selbstfahrer is a {{self-propelled}} <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> combine harvester. For the German market, the Selbstfahrer {{was offered}} with a 2600 mm header, in other countries, a 3000 mm and a 3600 mm header were offered as well. The header - designed for harvesting bent fruit - and the reel are adjustable vertically with a hydraulic system. The knife cutter bar is replaceable with a pickup-reel. The Selbstfahrer is usable as a stationary threshing machine as well.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1977, these {{harvesters}} {{marked a}} departure from traditional combine harvester design, in that threshing and separation was performed mainly by a rotor, {{as opposed to the}} drum and <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> type models used previously. This is shown in the image at right, where the bulk of the processing area is devoted to a cylinder, that spins and threshes grain from the grain heads and allows for far greater capacity than the previous drum and walker design of harvester. This increase in capacity has led to a significant productivity increase of harvesters and therefore farmers who use them.|$|E
50|$|With its {{acquisition}} of Hürlimann in 1979, the company {{changed its name}} to SAME-Lamborghini-Hürlimann (S-L-H). In 1995, the group acquired Deutz-Fahr from the German group KHD, changing name definitively to SAME Deutz-Fahr. SAME Deutz-Fahr India was founded in 1996. From 2003 to 2012, SDF was a shareholder in the German group Deutz AG; In 2003, the group acquired 10% of the Finland based company Sampo-Rosenlew, which specialised in the production of components and 4 and 5 <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> combine harvesters. This shareholding was subsequently sold. In 2005, following its {{acquisition of}} the Croatia based company Ðuro Ðakovic, the group founded the company Deutz-Fahr Combines, through which it now produces Deutz-Fahr branded components and combine harvesters. In 2008, the Same Deutz-Fahr History Museum was established at the group's main headquarters in Treviglio. In 2011, the group acquired Grégoire A/S, a company which specialised in equipment for wine farming, olive oil farming, pruning and for the treatment and harvesting of grapes and olives. Also in 2011, SDF initiated a joint venture in China with Shandong Changlin Machinery. In 2014, the company SAME Deutz-Fahr Traktör Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. was founded in Istanbul, Turkey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>straw</b> <b>walkers</b> {{are located}} above the sieves, and also have holes in them. Any grain {{remaining}} {{attached to the}} straw is shaken off and falls onto the top sieve.|$|R
5000|$|Whilst the {{majority}} of the grain falls through the concave, the straw is carried by a set of [...] "walkers" [...] {{to the rear of the}} machine, allowing any grain and chaff still in the straw to fall below. Below the <b>straw</b> <b>walkers,</b> a fan blows a stream of air across the grain, removing dust and fines and blowing them away.|$|R
50|$|The {{threshing}} drum with a width of 1250 mm and {{a diameter of}} 450 mm has six rasp bars, its rotational speed is infinitely adjustable between 650 min&minus;1 and 1400 min&minus;1. The distance between the {{threshing drum}} and concave is finely adjustable. Four <b>straw</b> <b>walkers</b> with an overall width of 1250 mm and a total length of 2400 mm separate the remaining grain from the straw. The grain is cleaned twice with sieves measuring 920 mm × 1070 mm. An elevator transports the cleaned grain to a sorting cylinder on the roof. It sorts three quality grades of grain. For some fruit types, special sorting sieves were offered.|$|R
40|$|Grain loss {{monitors}} {{are installed}} on combine harvester {{and make it}} possible to measure grain loss on different parts of the combine. The instrument permits the operator to adjust a proper ground speed to keep grain loss within an acceptable range. In this study a loss monitoring system was implemented to measure grain losses continuously on <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> and sieves. Two grain loss monitors (KEE and TeeJet) were installed behind the <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> and the sieves of JD- 955 and JD- 1165 combine harvesters. Harvesting performance parameters such as combine total and processing losses were then measured. To evaluate the precision and accuracy of the instruments, the measured and monitored losses were compared and investigated. The results of a two-year research showed that the average processing loss of the combine harvesters with 10 - 12 % grain moisture content and 750 rpm drum speed was 0. 82 % which is whitin the acceptable range recommended by ASAE Standard No. S 343. 3. Furthermore, {{there was no significant difference}} between the measured and monitored values of processing loss...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of combine harvester setting on harvest losses and it aims on individual components of combine harvesters. The principles of tangential and axial threshing mechanisms are described. Separator rotors and <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> principles are analysed {{in the part of}} remaining grain separation. Also the cleaning mechanisms are mentioned and clarified. Theoretical part finishes by the description of combine harvester settings impact on harvest losses. The influence of combine harvester settings on harvest losses were verified by experimental measurement. The change of threshing mechanism and ground speed were realized with subsequent monitoring of cleaning and grain separation losses. Finally the calibration of controlled engine choking was investigated for the material flow monitoring...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to investigating the factor that effect repair and maintenance cost of combine harvester. Combine harvester is use to overcome shortage of manpower in agriculture sector. Repair and maintenance cost is the main factor in order to select a new or second hand combine harvester because the capacity or age of the machine may increase the cost of repair and maintenance. Common model of combine harvester that is mainly use in Malaysia is New Holland. The {{research was}} conducted in Langkawi and Kota Setar district. This research is significant for the conductor or owner to decide the best combine harvester before purchasing. The combine harvester with several ability and durability that can enhance {{the efficiency of the}} combine harvester in harvesting operation. Cross section survey that is use to collect the data and regression and correlation matrix is the data interpreted result in the research model. The distribution of critical parts have changed during repair and maintenance cost activities are ground speed vari-drive (24 %), shaft tire (18 %) and grain elevator drive (9 %), for the maintenance in off season the part normally changed are wheel, conveyor belt and pump bush track (10 %), Soucy track (9 %), and, <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> and header (8 %). Combine harvester need to be repair and maintenance after usage in between 60 I to 900 hours in seasons. The owner or farmer need to repair and maintained the combine harvester to reduce the factor that enhance combine harvester breakdown. This problem needs to overcome to reduce the losses to owner of combine harvester. Machinery cost is the secondary highest cost after own the land...|$|E
50|$|It was the {{disadvantages}} of the rotary combine (increased power requirements and over-pulverization of the straw by-product) which prompted {{a resurgence of}} conventional combines in the late nineties. Perhaps overlooked but nonetheless true, when the large engines that powered the rotary machines were employed in conventional machines, {{the two types of}} machines delivered similar production capacities. Also, research was beginning to show that incorporating above-ground crop residue (straw) into the soil is less useful for rebuilding soil fertility than previously believed. This meant that working pulverized straw into the soil became more of a hindrance than a benefit. An increase in feedlot beef production also created a higher demand for straw as fodder. Conventional combines, which use <b>straw</b> <b>walkers,</b> preserve the quality of straw and allow it to be baled and removed from the field.|$|R
5000|$|The cut crop {{is carried}} up the feeder throat (commonly called the [...] "feederhouse") by a chain and flight elevator, then {{fed into the}} {{threshing}} mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating threshing drum (commonly called the [...] "cylinder"), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through {{the action of the}} cylinder against the concave, a shaped [...] "half drum", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the <b>straw</b> <b>walkers.</b> This action is also allowed because grain is heavier than straw, which causes it to fall rather than [...] "float" [...] across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops. After the primary separation at the cylinder, the clean grain falls through the concave and to the shoe, which contains the chaffer and sieves. The shoe is common to both conventional combines and rotary combines.|$|R
40|$|Emerging identity-preserved grain markets {{depend on}} {{avoidance}} of commingling grain at harvest. Knowledge of where grain resides in a combine, cleaning labor requirements, and resulting purity levels would assist producers. Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain. The greatest amounts of corn and soybean material (17 to 74 lb) {{were found in the}} grain tank and rock trap. Intermediate amounts were found in the head or feederhouse, elevators, and at times the cylinder/rotor (soybeans), the unloading auger (soybeans, oats), and rear axle/chopper area. The least amounts were found in the cleaning shoe and <b>straw</b> <b>walkers</b> (cylinder-type machine). Time spent to clean the combine varied from about two hours to seven hours. Cleaning the head, grain tank, threshing rotor/cylinder, and cleaning shoe required more time than other areas. Immediately after cleaning, small amounts of prior (commingled) grain and foreign material, 0. 2 to 2. 5 lb, were found in the first bushel of subsequent grain harvested. Following clean-outs, commingled grain levels dropped below 0. 5 % after 20 bu were harvested. Over 14 lb of wheat were found during the first clean-out of a combine following 50 ac of oat harvest (no physical clean-out prior to oat harvest) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to compare aktivity and grade work combine {{harvester}} with different threshing system at harvesting a grain and oilseed rape {{in the business of}} agricultural production. Work was focuse on the size harvesting losses, grade grind and spreading crop residues, influence on the moisture of harvested crops on the size losses grade grind and spreading crop residues, throughput combine harvester, analysis of performance and consumption fuel. Work is complete about principal parametr agricultural operations, principal parametr owner machines and simply analysis of operating and investment costs. Although combine harvester didn't work at same land, measurement was done in the most consistent as possible in harvested condition regarding the weather, terrain, etc. From results are clearly that almost all the results achieved best results with a conventional combine harvester threshing mechanism Claas Lexion 580. Exception was only throughput at harvest of winter oilseed rape, which had machine John Deere S 690 with axial threshing of 1. 23 kg ha- 1 higher than Claas Lexion 580. Consumption fuel was lower at harvest of winter wheat with procrastination straw on the line by machine Claas Lwxion 670 with value 11, 0 l. ha- 1.. When shredding straw was reached average values for all combine. The worst grind and spread straw demonstrated combine harvester John Deere S 690 where avoid spreading crop residues over the entire stroke. All machines accomplish agro-technical requirements for the combine in terms of losses off 1, 5 % in direct harvest, performance, throughput, quality scatter chop, shred the quality of crop residues and working speed. Results this work convince me to recommend harvester Claas Lexoon 580 especially for large agricultural business and for service businesses with minimum efficiency 1 340 ha. rok- 1. For smaller business or business with higer structure of livestock production I would have chosed thresher with <b>straw</b> <b>walker</b> technology separation device and to Claas Lexion 670. Combine harvester John Deere S 690 U would advised more for service businesses and large business engaged in growing corn for grain with minimum area coverage. For both machines I would choose the cutter adapter on the frame 9 meters...|$|E
40|$|Purchasing and {{maintaining}} tractors and operating machines {{are two of}} the most considerable costs of the agricultural sector, which includes farm equipment manufacturers, farm contractors and farms. In this context, repair and maintenance costs (R&M costs) generally constitute 10 - 15 % of the total costs related to agricultural equipment and tend to increase with the age of the equipment; hence, an important consideration in farm management is the optimal time for equipment replacement. Classical, R&M cost estimation models, calculated as a function of accumulated working hours, are usually developed by ASAE/ASABE for the United States operating conditions. However, R&M costs are strongly influenced by farming practices, operative conditions, crop and soil type, climatic conditions, etc. which can be specific for individual countries. In this study, R&M cost model parameters were recalculated for the current Italian situation. For this purpose, data related to the R&M costs of 100 4 WD tractors with engine power ranging from 59 to 198 kW, and of 20 SP combine harvesters (10 <b>straw</b> <b>walkers</b> combines and 10 axial flow combines) with engine power ranging from 159 to 368 kW working in Italy were collected. According to the model, which was obtained by interpolating the data through a two-parameter power function (proposed by ASAE/ASABE), the R&M cost incidence on the list price of Italian tractors at 12, 000 working hours (estimated life of the machines) was 48. 6 %, as compared with 43. 2 % calculated through the most recent U. S. model while, for self propelled combine harvesters, the R&M cost incidence at 3, 000 working hours was 23. 1 % as compared with 40. 2 % calculated through the same U. S. model...|$|R
