The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.|$|E

50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run.

50|$|A jump start, {{also called}} a boost, {{is a method}} of {{starting}} a vehicle with a discharged <b>starting</b> <b>battery.</b> A temporary connection is made to the battery of another vehicle, or to some other external power source.

If the vehicle charging system is functional, normal operation of the vehicle will restore the charge of the battery.|$|E

5000|$|The Model T engine's {{ignition}} system used a flywheel-mounted magneto {{to produce the}} current necessary to produce a spark to initiate combustion.

The coil stepped up the voltage and discharged it to the spark plug in the cylinder. Ignition timing was adjusted manually by using the spark advance lever mounted on the steering column, which rotated the timer, advancing or retarding the ignition timing. A battery could be used for starting current: at hand-cranking speed, the magneto did not always produce sufficient current.

Nordic Paper {{has built a}} new section of its facility consisting of six new motors. These engines have a voltage drop at the motor starter and {{our goal is to}} reduce this voltage drop as much as possible. This is to be reduced by means of capacitors. This voltage drop can in turn lead to that they charge too much reactive power on the network because the engines require very reactive power. This reactive power outtake in turn can lead to penalties from the network owner. The voltage drop can cause complications to the equipment. We have concluded that there are two good compensation methods to compensate the reactive power of these is by using power capacitors that are running all the time and <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> which is running until the engine has started in the normal operating range. A calculation was made to the capacitors and placements to the capacitors were produced by hand.

40|$|With the {{continuing}} transition to renewable inherently intermittent energy sources like solar- and wind power, electrical energy storage will become progressively {{more important to}} manage energy production and demand. A key technology {{in this area is}} Li-ion batteries. To operate these batteries efficiently, {{there is a need for}} monitoring of the current battery state, including parameters such as state of charge and state of health, to ensure that adequate safety and performance is maintained. Furthermore, such monitoring is a step towards the possibility of the optimization of battery usage such as to maximize battery lifetime and/or return on investment. Unfortunately, possible online measurements during actual operation of a lithium-ion battery are typically limited to current, voltage and possibly temperature, meaning that direct measurement of battery status is not feasible. To overcome this, battery modeling and various regression methods may be used. Several of the most common regression algorithms suggested for estimation of battery state of charge and state of health are based on Kalman filtering. While these methods have shown great promise, there currently exist no thorough analysis of the impact of so-called filter tuning on the effectiveness of these algorithms in Li-ion battery monitoring applications, particularly for state of health estimation. In addition, the effects of only adjusting the cell capacity model parameter for aging effects, a relatively common approach in the literature, on overall state of health estimation accuracy is also in need of investigation. In this work, two different Kalman filtering methods intended for state of charge estimation: the extended Kalman filter and the extended adaptive Kalman filter, as well as three intended for state of health estimation: the dual extended Kalman filer, the enhanced state vector extended Kalman filer, and the single weight dual extended Kalman filer, are compared from accuracy, performance, filter tuning and practical usability standpoints. All algorithms were used with the same simple one resistor-capacitor equivalent circuit battery model. The Li-ion battery data used for battery model development and simulations of filtering algorithm performance was the “Randomized Battery Usage Data Set” obtained from the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence.   It is found that both state of charge estimators perform similarly in terms of accuracy of state of charge estimation with regards to reference values, easily outperforming the common Coulomb counting approach in terms of precision, robustness and flexibility. The adaptive filter, while computationally more demanding, required less tuning of filter parameters relative to the extended Kalman filter to achieve comparable performance and might therefore be advantageous from a robustness and usability perspective. Amongst the state of health estimators, the enhanced state vector approach was found to be most robust to initialization and was also least taxing computationally. The single weight filter could be made to achieve comparable results with careful, if time consuming, filter tuning. The full dual extended Kalman filter has the advantage of estimating not only the cell capacity but also the internal resistance parameters. This comes at the price of slow performance and time consuming filter tuning, involving 17 parameters. It is however shown that long-term state of health estimation is superior using this approach, likely due to the online adjustment of internal resistance parameters. This allows the dual extended Kalman filter to accurately estimate the SoH over a full test representing more than a full conventional battery lifetime. The viability of only adjusting the capacity in online monitoring approaches therefore appears questionable. Overall the importance of filter tuning is found to be substantial, especially for cases of very uncertain <b>starting</b> <b>battery</b> states and characteristics...|$|E
