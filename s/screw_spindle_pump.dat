40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} a device for performing screw operations comprising a freely programmable handling device to whose free axis a <b>screw</b> <b>spindle</b> is attached, a screw tool, which engages {{with the head}} of a screw, and a compensator element arranged between the <b>screw</b> <b>spindle</b> and the <b>screw</b> tool, having laminations arranged {{in the form of a}} bellows as described in the main patent P 3623056. 1. The device according to the invention is characterized by traction mechanisms attached to the inside and/or outside of the compensator element, said mechanisms being operated via an axially displaceable bearing, and by means of which the compensator element is contractable...|$|R
50|$|A {{screw pump}} is a positive-displacement (PD) pump that use one or several screws to move fluids or solids along the screw(s) axis. In its {{simplest}} form (the Archimedes' screw pump), a single screw rotates in a cylindrical cavity, thereby moving the material along the <b>screw's</b> <b>spindle.</b> This ancient construction is still {{used in many}} low-tech applications, such as irrigation systems and in agricultural machinery for transporting grain and other solids.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{deviation}} often {{appears in}} the feeding device of machine because of the <b>screw</b> <b>spindle</b> geometry torsional moment and the wear. The automatic compensation of the changes was proposed {{by means of a}} ball screw pretightening device by using adjustable force measurement and control. The detail design and simulation were conducted for the specific device. A case study was presented for the CNC lathe’s application. Testing results have shown that the device can be easily operated with an acceptable precision for positioning...|$|R
50|$|There were {{originally}} eight cams for forward motion and three for reverse, which gave {{a range of}} cut-offs from 15% to 85% in forward gear. The hand reversing <b>screw</b> <b>spindle</b> carried a disk, suitably notched with a locking device {{to ensure that the}} cam rollers would be in the centre of the selected cams under working conditions. During drifting, the reversing gear is placed in the neutral position where the exhaust valves are held fully open. These conditions were ideal for drifting and superior to any Walschaerts valve gear in admitting steam to the steam chests, even with cylinders equipped with by-pass valves, snifting valves and drifting valves.|$|R

50|$|The C.W. system {{comprises}} a twin culvert fed by four vertical <b>spindle</b> <b>pumps</b> {{feeding the}} condensers arranged in two parallel groups, and discharging to eight cooling towers. The cooled C.W. {{from the tower}} ponds is returned to the pump suction for re-circulation. A special feature of the C.W. plant at Cottam is the annular moat arrangement around the pump house. The moat is 45.72m (150 ft) external diameter, 5.486m (18 ft) deep and 3.048m (10 ft) wide. Suction for the four pumps is taken tangentially {{from the inside of}} the moat. This arrangement causes a continual circular, vortex free flow of water within the moat and allows any combination of the four pumps to be operated as the station demands.|$|R
50|$|Located in the NW {{corner is}} the {{original}} inlet pumping station by W.B. Bryan and finished in red brick and Portland stone. Still in situ are {{three of the five}} gas-fuelled liquid-piston pumps designed by H. A. Humphrey. In 1970 these were made redundant by the installation of a vertical <b>spindle</b> electric <b>pump.</b>|$|R
40|$|N. Mononobe and S. Okabe {{proposed}} the formula of the seismic earth pressure {{acting on the}} retaining wall by expanding Coulomb's and Rankine's Formula in 1924. Studies of seismic earth pressure have been attempted by many students but without experimental success so far. Lately, the measurements of active earth pressure during the vibration are carried our in out laboratory, using the shaking box (30 cm in depth, 56 cm in width, 100 cm in length) with the movable wall. The movable wall is supported by two rollers in vertical direction and four <b>screw</b> <b>spindles</b> in holizontal direction and is displaced with various kinds of displacement type by the rotation of handle. This results give us following suggestions : 1) The resultant force of the seismic active earth pressure are nearly constant {{in spite of the}} difference of displacement type of wall. 2) The internal friction angle of dry sand decrease at the rate of 2. 0 ～ 2. 5 degrees per increment of seismic coef. 0. 1 during vibration. 3) The redistribution of the earth pressure acting on the retaining wall is recognized...|$|R
50|$|Drainage of the Bardney District, which {{consisted}} of the villages of Bardney, Bucknall, Edlington, Horsington, Southrey, Stixwould, Tupholme and Thimbleby, was authorised by an Act obtained in 1843. The district covered an area of 2720 acre, and a drainage engine was erected in 1846. It consisted of a low pressure condensing beam engine, driving a 28 ft scoop wheel. Drainage rates were collected from 2610 acre, but again, water entered the district from the higher ground to the north, and so the engine drained almost twice that area. The beam engine and scoop wheel were replaced by a Robey tandem compound steam engine and a vertical <b>spindle</b> <b>pump</b> in 1913. The station was further upgraded in 1936, when two Ruston & Hornsby oil engines with Gwynnes pumps were installed. Electric pumps manufactured by Allen-Gwynnes were installed around 1977, but the oil engines were retained as a back-up system.|$|R
2500|$|The Lark Engine {{pumping station}} was {{upgraded}} again in 1974. The Blackstone engine was retired but kept intact {{as part of}} the history of the district, the Crossley engine became the standby, and the Crossley enginehouse was extended to allow the installation of a [...] Dorman diesel engine, which drives a [...] Allen Gwynne vertical <b>spindle</b> <b>pump.</b> The work included the provision of a wooden plaque, showing all of the engines which had been installed since the opening of the station in 1842, which was unveiled by Mrs F. G. Starling at the formal opening held on 25 May 1976. Further improvements followed, when negotiations with British Rail resulted in the skew bridge, which carried the Ely to Norwich line over the main drain being demolished and replaced by a culvert. This action allowed the main pumping drain to the Lark Engine to be made deeper and wider, improving flows between the two halves of Burnt Fen.|$|R
40|$|The ball-screw {{feed drive}} has varying {{high-order}} dynamic characteristics due to flexibilities of the slender <b>screw</b> <b>spindle</b> and joints between components, and an obvious feature of non-collocated control when a direct position measurement using a linear scale is employed. The dynamic characteristics and non-collocated situation {{have long been}} the source of difficulties in motion and vibration control, and deteriorate the achieved accuracy of the axis motion. In this study, a dynamic model using a frequency-based substructure approach is established, considering the flexibilities and their variation. The position-dependent variation of the dynamic characteristics is then fully investigated. A corresponding control strategy, which is composed of a modal characteristic modifier (MCM) and an intelligent adaptive tuning algorithm (ATA), is then developed. The MCM utilizes a combination of peak filters and notch filters, thereby shaping the plant dynamics into a virtual collocated system and avoiding control spillover. An ATA using an artificial neural network (ANN) as a smooth parameter interpolator updates the parameters of the filters in real time in order to cope with the feed drive’s dynamic variation. Numerical verification of the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy is shown for a real feed drive...|$|R

50|$|The {{machinery}} for projecting and withdrawing the {{torpedo tube}} {{consists of a}} couple of chain drums worked by gearing which is driven by a rotary engine made by Root, New York, NY. One of these drums is placed in the tank or reservoir in the bows of the vessel, and the chain from it is used for hauling in the tube. In order to prevent the chain from overriding on the drum, it is guided by passing through a suitable block which, as the drum revolves, is moved transversely along the drum and deposits the chain in regular coils. The transverse movement of the guiding block is given by a <b>screwed</b> <b>spindle</b> which has a pinion fixed on it gearing into a spur wheel on the chain drum. The hauling out of the torpedo carrier is effected by means of a chain attached to its inner end and led to the second chain drum which is placed above and slightly abaft the tank, as shown in Fig. 2. The arrangement adopted for guiding the chain is the same in this case as in that of the hauling-in drum. Each drum is loose upon its shaft, but is capable of being connected to it by a clutch, the two clutches being connected by levers {{so that they can be}} thrown into gear alternately. The tube can be run in and out by the machinery we have described at the rate of from 8 to 12 double strokes per minute.|$|R

500|$|Certain {{techniques}} and styles {{can be found}} throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as [...] "Wish", and [...] "The Day the World Went Away" [...] exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in [...] "Starfuckers, Inc." [...] and [...] "Burn". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in [...] "The Collector", from With Teeth, and concert favorite [...] "March of the Pigs". Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song [...] "Hurt", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word [...] "I" [...] every time the B/E# dyad is played. [...] "Closer" [...] concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of [...] "Piggy" [...] on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of [...] "Heresy", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout [...] "A Warm Place", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on [...] "The Downward Spiral". On The Fragile, Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire {{second half of the}} three-minute long [...] "The Great Destroyer".

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{comparison between}} {{the two types of}} pumps is available, because a [...] vertical <b>spindle</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> was installed at Prickwillow on the River Lark in Cambridgeshire, alongside an existing [...] scoop wheel. A series of tests were carried out in 1880, to check their efficiency. The scoop wheel lifted 71.45 tons per minute through 9.78 ft, with the engine indicating that it was developing , while the newer installation was developing , and raised 75.93 tons per minute through 10.84 ft. Efficiency was calculated as 46 per cent for the scoop wheel and 52.79 per cent for the centrifugal pump. The most significant difference was the coal consumption, which was reduced from 11.64 lb per hour to 6.66 lb per hour for the newer system.|$|R

50|$|A {{differential}} screw is {{a mechanism}} used for making small, precise {{adjustments to the}} spacing between two objects (such as in focusing a microscope, moving the anvils of a micrometer, or positioning optics). A differential <b>screw</b> uses a <b>spindle</b> with two <b>screw</b> threads of differing leads (aka thread pitch), and possibly opposite handedness, on which two nuts move. As the spindle rotates, {{the space between the}} nuts changes based on the difference between the threads. These mechanisms allow extremely small adjustments using commonly available screws. A differential screw mechanism using two nuts incurs higher friction and therefore requires more torque to turn than a simple, single lead screw with an equivalent pitch.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{variability}} in yield oxidative status and appearance of palm oils as affected by fruit type and extraction equipment in the small scale industry. A 23 factorial experimental design with palm fruit types Dura and Tenera and extraction equipment digester <b>screw</b> hand <b>spindle</b> and hydraulic presses were studied. Quality indices of oils i. e. free fatty acid ffa peroxide value moisture content impurities colour and yield were accessed using standard methods. The ffa values obtained for oils produced from both Dura and Tenera fruit types and the extraction equipment ranged 5. 25 - 5. 71 were above the CODEX standard of 5. 0. Furthermore significant differences were also recorded in both moisture contents and impurities from the same oils produced. The oil yield from Tenera fruit types were two folds higher than the Dura fruit types. The redness colour of palm oils for Dura fruit types was a little above the Tenera fruit types. However the yellowness and lightness of colour of palm oils for Tenera were higher than oils from Dura fruit types. Therefore the study concludes that the oil processors in the small scale industry preferred the digester screw press machine because it gave low level of impurities and moisture content than other presses. Tenera fruit type is {{the best choice for}} palm oil processing because of its higher oil yield content. However in terms of oil colour Dura fruit type is preferred...|$|R

The fact is that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) composites {{are very difficult to}} machine. A large number of holes need to be drilled in CFRP for many applications. Therefore, so it is important to develop cost-effective drilling processes. CFRP has been drilled by rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) successfully. The literature has reports about the effects of input variables on output variables (including cutting force, torque, surface roughness, tool wear, and workpiece delamination) in RUM of CFRP. However, there are no reports on power consumption in RUM of CFRP. This paper reports the first study on power consumption in RUM of CFRP. It reports an experimental investigation on effects of input variables (ultrasonic power, tool rotation speed, feedrate, and type of CFRP) on power consumption of each component (including ultrasonic power supply, <b>spindle</b> motor, coolant <b>pump,</b> and air compressor) and the entire RUM system...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{approach has}} been developed to determine the optical orientation of biaxial minerals by combining spindle stage and X-ray-diffractometer measurements. First, a goniometer head, with crystal affixed, is <b>screwed</b> onto a <b>spindle</b> stage, and its orientation matrix for the biaxial indicatrix is determined. Next, the same goniometer head is transferred to a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer, where the unit cell and, in turn, an orientation matrix for the reciprocal crystallographic axes are determined. The necessary transformations and calculations are then developed to relate these two orientation matrices mathematically. Examples for two orthorhombic minerals of known optical orientation, one monoclinic mineral of unknown optical orientation, and one triclinic mineral of known optical orientation are given. Several measurements were repeated to test the accuracy, reproducibility, and systematic errors of the method; these measurements yielded an accuracy and reproducibility of the method to within 1. 0 °. Once a suitable crystal has been selected and mounted on a goniometer head, all the required measurements and calculations can be performed in approximately one hour...|$|R
40|$|We {{focus on}} the central spindle which {{supports}} the rotating magnetic platters which hold all of the data. The spindle must operate with great precision and stability at high rotational speeds. Design practice has converged on oil-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings as the most common choice for spindles. That is, a layer of viscous oil separates a rotating shaft (the bearing) from the fixed outer sleeve (the journal). In hard drives, {{it is very important}} for the shaft to be centered within the sleeve. Plain journal bearings (i. e. both surfaces are circular cylinders) are unstable to perturbations that push the shaft off-center. It was found that this stability problem can be overcome by cutting diagonal grooves into the journal in a pattern called a herring-bone. Another consequence of this design is that very high pressures are generated by the grooves as they drive the oil {{to the middle of the}} bearing, away from the top/bottom ends of the <b>spindle.</b> This <b>pumping</b> action generally works to oppose leakage out of the bearing. We examine how choices for the groove pattern can influence the key properties of the bearing. The focus is to understand the effect of the groove geometry on the pumping action. In particular the undesirable behavior caused by the low pressures created near the top/bottom ends of the bearing which, under many conditions, may result in the pressure becoming negative, relative to atmospheric pressure. Negative pressure can result in cavitation or, when it occurs near an air-oil interface, can cause air to be ingested and hence create bubbles. Any bubbles in the oil can corrupt the lubricating layer in the bearing and, as they are created and collapse, can cause significant undesirable vibrations. The negative pressures have therefore been identified as one of the key problems in design of hard disk drive bearings. We will use numerical computations and some analysis to show that by modifying the groove geometry we can reduce the negative pressure while retaining good stability characteristics...|$|R

For this reason the B.E.12 and the R.E.8, not to mention Vickers' own FB 19, mounted their forward-firing machine guns on the port side of the fuselage so that a relatively short version of the push rod could be linked directly to the gun.|$|R

It was produced in four capacities: 2.5 L (2495 cc, 153 ci), 3.0 L (2994 cc, 183 ci), 3.1 L (3098 cc, 189 ci), 3.4 L (3412 cc, 207 ci), with the 3.0 litre version being {{the most common and}} widely used. These engines were fitted {{to a wide range of}} vehicles, from Ford Transit vans to sedans, coupés like the Ford Capri and sports cars like TVR and Marcos. The earlier versions of engine were rated at 128 hp ( [...] 95 kW [...] ) and 173 lb/ft of torque, around October 1971 the engine was revised by modifying the camshaft and cylinder heads that improved the power and torque to produce 157 SAE Hp or 138 DIN hp (103 kW) at 5000 rpm and 192 SAE lb/ft or 174 DIN lb/ft of torque at 3000 rpm. At the same time, the oil disptick was moved from the front of the engine to the side, the inlet manifold was improved from earlier models, and the compression ratio was raised slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1 due to a change of the piston design. The shape of the inlet ports were also changed, from an O-port design to a D-port design which improved the flow characteristics of the heads, the old Weber 40 DFAV carburetor that was prone to over-fueling and resulting bore wash was replaced by the Weber 38 DGAS Carburetor, the air filter housing was also changed and later around 1976 and a hot air intake was added consisting of a metal pipe running from the top of a plate welded on the exhaust manifold or header to an opening in the air intake to prevent the carburetor from icing and making the engine warm up quicker, the carburetor was also modified again and a return style fuel system was adopted and a vacuum operated choke in the air filter housing were also added, this and a Positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system were also early forms of emissions control. The camshaft gear was also made slightly stronger by using steel with nylon teeth instead of being completely made from nylon as on previous ones. Aftermarket steel, aluminium, and alloy gears have been produced as replacements to prevent the gear from stripping its teeth: this is commonly due to overheating causing the nylon to weaken. This is one of the two major [...] "weak points" [...] of the Essex vee-engines with the other being the hexagonal oil <b>pump</b> <b>spindle</b> / shaft which can round off or even break.|$|R
