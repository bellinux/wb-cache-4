40|$|By crossed immunoelectrophoresis, 85 {{different}} antigens {{were demonstrated}} in sonicated preparations of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp 1). The precipitin patterns of 82 anodic-migrating antigens were numbered and were designated the Lp 1 reference system. Eleven antigens were <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling,</b> and seven {{of these were}} shown to be surface antigens. One heat-stable surface antigen (antigen no. 61) was highly reactive with limulus amoebocyte lysates and formed a precipitin resembling lipopolysaccharide. Serum from an isolation confirmed case of Lp 1 infection and serogroup-specific rabbit antiserum reacted specifically with antigen no. 61, which was designated the serogroup-specific antigen. Normal human and rabbit sera commonly had antibodies to antigen no. 66 of the Lp 1 reference system. This antigen is antigenically related to the "common antigen" of Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} germ tube-specific antigens of Candida albicans, rabbit antiserum {{prepared to}} Formalin-treated yeast possessing germ tubes was adsorbed with stationary-phase blastospores. By immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, this antibody did not react with blastospores but detected germ tube-specific antigens in hyphal forms. Germ tube-specific antigens appeared 30 min after placing blastospores in appropriate conditions for germ tube formation. Hyphae, formed by allowing yeast to germinate for 24 h, still retained germ tube-specific antigens, but blastospores budding off these hyphae were unstained, as were log-phase blastospores. Germ tube-specific antigens were sensitive to heat, sodium metaperiodate oxidation, dithiothreitol reduction, and proteolysis with pronase, trypsin, or chymotrypsin, whereas antigens common to blastospores and germ tubes were <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling,</b> treatment with proteolytic enzymes, and dithiothreitol reduction.

Their action on smooth muscle is not affected by atropine, eserine, antihistamines, iproniazid, bretylium or by lysergic acid diethylamide. The active substances are probably peptides and {{there is evidence that}} the urine contains a mixture of peptides, some of which relax and some of which contract the rat duodenum.

Although a variety of gram-positive organisms was susceptible, none {{of a wide range}} of different gram-negative strains was inhibited. The active substance produced by one of these strains was extracted from cultures grown on solid media (Todd-Hewitt agar) and was shown to be bactericidal in action. This bacteriocin (streptocin B 1) was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Production of the bacteriocin was repressed by addition of certain fermentable carbohydrates to the basic medium and enhanced by the addition of yeast extract. The bacteriocin was shown to exist in two distinct and interconvertible physical forms: a basic unit of molecular weight 10, 000 and an aggregate having a molecular weight of over 200, 000.

40|$|Partial {{constriction}} of {{the main}} renal arteries of dogs and other animals is followed by persistent elevation of the blood pressure (1 - 5). There is good evidence for {{the view that the}} liberation into the blood stream of a substance from the kidney initiates the humoral mechanism that determines the elevation of the blood pressure (6). A saline extract of normal kidney capable of producing a pressor effect when injected intravenously into animals was first described by Tigerstedt and Bergman (7). For the active principle in the renal extract they suggested the name renin. Recently (8, 9) it was shown that renin alone is not capable of producing vasoconstriction but must act in the presence of blood plasma or serum. Then it was demonstrated (10, 11) that renin reacts with a globulin in the blood serum to form a heat <b>stable</b> (<b>to</b> <b>boiling)</b> vasoconstrictor and pressor substance, which was named angiotonin (10), and hypertensin (11). It is now recognized that renin is an enzyme and that a globulin in the serum is its substrate (11, 12).

40|$|Galactomannan (GM) {{extracted}} from mycelia of Aspergillus fumigatus with cold dilute alkali reacted with antiserum specific for an antigen that circulated in invasive aspergillosis in rabbits and humans. The GM was purified by its affinity for concanavalin A and {{was separated from}} a nonantigenic glucan by gel permeation on Sephacryl S- 200. The GM molecular weight of between 25, 000 to 75, 000 was smaller than the antigen present in infected rabbit serum which was retained by an ultrafiltration membrane that had a nominal molecular weight limit of 125, 000. The ratio of galactose to mannose present in GM was 1 : 1. 17. The serological activity of GM was <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> but labile to 0. 01 N HCl, implicating galactofuranose as an antigenic determinant. Analysis of purified GM by methylation-gas chromatography suggested a structure consisting of a 1 leads to 6 -linked mannan backbone with oligogalactoside side chains 3 units long, terminating in galactofuranose. The presence of mannose as a side chain component was also inferred. Another antigen of A. fumigatus, which did not bind to concanavalin A, was isolated after tandem chromatography on diethylaminoethyl- and carboxymethyl-Sephadex and {{was identified as a}} galactan.

40|$|Summary. We isolated, and {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli, a gene (WcsI 20) that is strongly induced during cold acclimation of wheat. The gene product was purified {{and used to}} produce antibodies. Immunoblotting experi-ments with the anti-WCS 120 antibody identified several cold-induced proteins named FTMs for Freezing Toler-ance Markers since they {{are associated with the}} develop-ment of freezing tolerance. This protein family was found to be coordinately regulated specifically by low temperature, highly hydrophilic, <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling,</b> and to have a pI above 6. 5. The accumulation kinetics during the acclimation period indicated a positive correlation with the capacity of each genotype to develop fieezing tolerance. Accumulation of the proteins was higher in the freezing-tolerant genotype than in the less tolerant one. In addition, their accumulation was more pro-nounced in the crown and leaf tissues compared with roots, confirming a relationship to the capacity of the different issues to develop freezing tolerance. Analysis of different species (eight monocots and four dicots) in-dicated that this protein family is specific for freezing-tolerant cereals. The antibody did not cross-react with any of the non-cereal species examined. The anti-FTMs antibody represents a potential tool for breeders to select for freezing tolerance traits in the Gramineae...|$|E
40|$|To impact carbon emissions, new {{materials}} for carbon capture must be inexpensive, robust, {{and able to}} adsorb CO 2 specifically from a mixture of other gases. In particular, materials must be tolerant to the water vapor and to the acidic impurities that are present in gas streams produced by using fossil fuels to generate electricity. We show that a porous organic polymer has excellent CO 2 capacity and high CO 2 selectivity under conditions relevant to precombustion CO 2 capture. Unlike polar adsorbents, such as zeolite 13 x and the metal–organic framework, HKUST- 1, the CO 2 adsorption capacity for the hydrophobic polymer is hardly affected by the adsorption of water vapor. The polymer is even <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> in concentrated acid for extended periods, a property that is matched by few microporous adsorbents. The polymer adsorbs CO 2 {{in a different way}} from rigid materials by physical swelling, much as a sponge adsorbs water. This gives rise to a higher CO 2 capacities and much better CO 2 selectivity than for other water-tolerant, nonswellable frameworks, such as activated carbon and ZIF- 8. The polymer has superior function as a selective gas adsorbent, even though its constituent monomers are very simple organic feedstocks, as would be required for materials preparation on the large industrial scales required for carbon capture...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that the}} immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal antibody (MAb) B 6. 1 protects mice against disseminated candidiasis, whereas the IgM MAb B 6 does not. Both MAbs are specific for an adhesin fraction isolated from the cell surface of Candida albicans, but their epitope specificities differ. In the present study, we examined the surface locations of both epitopes and obtained structural information regarding the B 6. 1 epitope. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopic analysis of C. albicans yeast forms showed that epitope B 6. 1 is displayed rather homogeneously over the entire cell surface, whereas epitope B 6 {{appears to have a}} patchy distribution. Both antibodies were essentially nonreactive with the surfaces of mycelial forms of the fungus, indicating that neither epitope is expressed on the surfaces of these forms. For isolation of the B 6. 1 epitope, the adhesin fraction consisting of cell surface phosphomannan was subjected to mildly acidic (10 mM HCl) hydrolysis and was fractionated into acid-labile and acid-stable portions by size exclusion chromatography. Antibody blocking experiments showed that the B 6. 1 epitope is an acid-labile moiety of the phosphomannan and that the B 6 epitope is located in the acid-stable fraction. The B 6 epitope appeared to be mannan because it was <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> heat (<b>boiling)</b> and protease treatments but was destroyed by alpha-mannosidase digestion. The B 6. 1 epitope eluted from the size exclusion column in two fractions. Mass spectroscopic analyses showed that one fraction contained material with the size of a mannotriose and that the other was a mixture of mannotriose- and mannotetraose-size substances. Dose response inhibition tests of the fractions indicated that the B 6. 1 epitope is associated with the mannotriose. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis of the epitope yielded data consistent with a beta-(1 [...] > 2) -linked mannotriose. The fine structure of the B 6 epitope is under investigation. Information derived from these investigations will be useful both in understanding protective versus nonprotective antibody responses to C. albicans and in improving anti-Candida vaccine formulations...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{work from}} this {{laboratory}} has demonstrated {{the persistence of}} Bacteroides intermedius in the livers of mice receiving an intraperitoneal inoculum of B. intermedius and Fusobacterium necrophorum. This study was undertaken to determine whether F. necrophorum enhanced the in vitro growth of B. intermedius. Tryptose phosphate broth {{did not support the}} growth of B. intermedius alone, but the bacterium did survive in a tryptose phosphate broth culture of F. necrophorum. B. intermedius cultured in F. necrophorum-conditioned tryptose phosphate broth grew impressively, reaching maximal absorbance at 24 h after inoculation. The growth of B. intermedius in F. necrophorum-conditioned tryptose phosphate broth was proportional to the amount of conditioned medium present. The B. intermedius growth-stimulating factor was detectable in conditioned medium 8 h after inoculation with F. necrophorum and could be detected throughout the 96 -h incubation period. Growth-factor-active fractions eluted from a Sephadex G- 100 column did not absorb at 280 nm and were retained on the column until 4 column volumes were eluted. The growth factor was nondialyzable and <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling,</b> lyophilization, extraction with hot aqueous phenol, and trypsin digestion. The factor was inactivated by exposure to pH 2. 0 in the pepsin digestion protocol. Significant amounts of hexose, methyl pentose, and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate were detected in pooled growth-factor-active fractions eluted from the Sephadex column. This pool was also active in the Limulus lysate endotoxin assay. These results suggest that the B. intermedius growth-stimulating factor produced by F. necrophorum is a lipopolysaccharide...|$|E
40|$|Melanin {{biosynthesis}} {{involves the}} enzymatic conversion of tyrosine, via dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), to melanin {{through a number}} of intermediate steps. It is generally assumed that the major rate-limiting factor in this process is the amount of active tyrosinase (monophenol monoxygenase; monophenol, dihydroxyphenylalanine: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1. 14. 18. 1) available since when dopa has been oxidized by tyrosinase to dopa quinone the succeeding steps can occur spontaneously through auto-oxidation. We now present evidence that a later step, namely the conversion of dopachrome to 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid may also be under regulatory control. We have found a factor(s) from 3 different melanomas (Cloudman, B 16, and Greene) which catalyzes this step. This activity is also present in mushrooms, which contain a potent pigment-synthesizing system, but not in a variety of cell lines of nonmelanocytic origin. We have not yet identified the factor but it is of relatively low molecular weight (less than 1000 daltons by Sephadex G 10 gel filtration), negatively charged at pH 6. 8, and <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling.</b> The factor contains no detectable sulfhydryl groups. In crude cell extracts the factor appears to be complexed to tyrosinase since it cochromatographs with tyrosinase through the early steps of purification. The factor binds tightly to QAE-Sephadex anion exchange resin and can be separated from tyrosinase by differential salt elution. We have not yet demonstrated that the factor has a physiological role in melanogenesis but we feel such a role is likely since the activity was found only in cells with melanin-synthesizing systems...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed model of nasal challenge, we have obtained data that clearly demonstrate, {{for the first}} time, kinin generation during a local allergic reaction in vivo. Allergic individuals (n = 8) and matched nonallergic controls (n = 8) were challenged intranasally with the appropriate antigen and nasal washes were taken before and after challenge. Washes were assayed for kinin, histamine, and [3 H]-N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME) -esterase activity. Increased kinin generation was found by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in the nasal washes of all the allergics (5, 560 +/- 1, 670 pg/ml) but in none of the controls (38 +/- 16 pg/ml). The presence of kinin was highly correlated with that of histamine and TAME-esterase activity and {{with the onset of}} clinical symptoms (P less than 0. 001). Serial dilutions of nasal washes produced RIA displacement curves that paralleled the standard curve, and recovery of standard kinins that were added to nasal washes was 100 +/- 4 % (n = 14). Kinin recovery was identical in both allergics and controls and did not vary significantly with antigen challenge. The immunoreactive kinin in nasal washes was <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> and not precipitated by ethanol, but completely destroyed by carboxypeptidase B. It was evenly distributed between the sol and gel phases of nasal washes. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the immunoreactive kinin in nasal washes showed it to be a mixture of lysylbradykinin and bradykinin. We conclude that kinins are produced during local allergic reactions in the nose and may contribute to the symptomatology of the allergic response...|$|E

40|$|Acrylamide gel {{electrophoresis}} {{was used to}} show {{the similarities and differences}} in the membrane proteins of two vaccine and two virulent strains of Mycoplasma mycoides var. mycoides. Immunoelectrophoretic (IEP) analysis was also used to partially characterize the associated antigens. Antibody spectra to the antigens of M. mycoides differ in rabbit, pig, and cattle sera. Rabbits produce better precipitating antibody against the anodic migrating protein mycoplasma antigens than cattle and pigs as seen in IEP. However, rabbit anti-M. mycoides serum did not show precipitating antibody against the heat-stable carbohydrate antigen. As judged by IEP, the major carbohydrate antigen extracted from the media, or boiled whole organism, is similar to that present in the sera-infected cattle and knee joints of calves. This carbohydrate antigen has a cathodic migration in IEP at pH 8. 6. Periodate oxidation, classically used to destroy carbohydrate, also destroys most of the protein antigens. Heating the antigens to 56 C for 10 min destroys many of the noncarbohydrate antigens and 100 C eliminates all but the carbohydrate antigen. Extraction of M. mycoides with chloroform-methanol, phenol, ethanol, or ethanol-acetone reduced or eliminated most of the protein antigens. Some of the isolated antigenic fractions of M. mycoides were tested to determine their activity in the diagnostic complement fixation test for contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and their inhibitory effect in this test by using bovine anti-M. mycoides antisera having precipitating antibody and circulating antigen.

40|$|Scatter factor (SF) (also {{known as}} {{hepatocyte}} growth factor [HGF]) is a fibroblast-derived cytokine that stimulates motility, proliferation, and morphogenesis of epithelia. SF may play major roles in development, repair, and carcinogenesis. However, the physiologic signals that regulate its production {{are not well}} delineated. We found that various human tumor cell lines that do not produce SF secrete factors that stimulate SF production by fibroblasts, suggesting a paracrine mechanism for regulation of SF production. Conditioned medium from these cell lines contained two distinct scatter factor-inducing factor SF-IF activities: a high molecular weight (> 30 kD), heat sensitive activity and a low molecular weight (< 30 kD) heat stable activity. Further studies revealed that SF-producing fibroblasts also secrete factors that stimulate their own SF production. We characterized the < 30 -kD SF-IF activity from ras- 3 T 3 (clone D 4), a mouse cell line that overproduces both SF and SF-IF. The < 30 -kD filtrate from ras- 3 T 3 conditioned medium induced four- to sixfold increases in expression of SF biologic activity, immunoreactive protein, and mRNA by multiple SF- producing fibroblast lines. Ras- 3 T 3 SF-IF activity was <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling,</b> extremes of pH, and reductive alkylation, but was destroyed by proteases. We purified ras- 3 T 3 SF-IF about 10, 000 -fold from serum-free conditioned medium {{by a combination of}} ultrafiltration, cation exchange chromatography, and reverse phase chromatography. The purified protein exhibited electrophoretic mobility of about 12 kD (reduced) and 14 kD (nonreduced) by SDS-PAGE. The identity of the protein was verified by elution of biologic activity from gel slices. Purified SF-IF stimulated SF production in a physiologic concentration range (about 20 - 400 pM). Its properties and activities were distinct from those of IL- 1 and TNF, two known inducers of SF production. We suggest that SF-IF is a physiologic regulator of SF production...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of insect cuticle has been reviewed briefly and an account given {{of the processes}} by which hardening (tanning) occurs after the moult. The sclerotin wall of the cockroach ootheca is formed by the intermingling of the accretions of {{the left and right}} colleterial glands. This system, because of its comparative convenience, is studied with a view to shedding light on the sclerotin formation in the cuticle. With reference to their role in sclerotization, the properties of insect blood and cuticle oxidases are reviewed and comparisons made with the animal and plant enzyme grouse they most resemble andndash; tyrosinases and laccases. The function of copper in these oxidases is discussed. A method was developed for determining the protein concentrations, in the presence of phenolic compounds, of the diluted secretion from the left colleterial glands of Periplaneta. This involved digestion (6 N -HCl, 6 hours) of the protein followed by estimation with ninhydrin of the total amino acids in the hydrolysate. Investigation of the properties of the copper-containing (0. 1 - 0. 2 %) phenoloxidase of the left colleterial gland showed that the enzyme is specific towards diphenols (especially ortho-) and is therefore not a tyrosinase. In the majority of its properties the oxidase resembles a laccase, although it is more specific than the plant enzymes. Phenolic substrates bearing an amino group in the side chain are not active andndash; a property which clearly distinguishes the cockroach phenoloxidase from the blood tyrosinase of insects. Towards certain substrates (catechol, hydroquinone, homoprotocatechuic acid) activity is unexpectedly <b>stable</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> while towards others (protocatechuic acid and its aldehyde) it is destroyed. Possibly non-enzymic, as well as enzymic, activity exists. The effect of some substances (detergents, dopa, catechol, tyrosine, ascorbic acid) on the activity of the phenoloxidase towards protocatechuic acid (3 andmu;moles) is measured. The stimulation caused by ascorbic acid (0. 15 andmu;moles) is related to the possible requirement of cuprous ions for enzyme activity. The phenoloxidase activity which resides in a articulate fraction of the gland secretion, is (unlike other copper oxidases) not inhibited by metal chelating agents, such as phenylthiourea, diethyldithiocarbamate, ethylenediaminetetracetic acid and 4 -chlororesorcinol, in the presence of sodium phosphate buffer (0. 1 M -, pH 6. 8). Cyanide and borate are effective inhibitors, however. Varied attempts to purify the participate enzyme and thus to fractionate it from the prosclerotin or structural protein met with little success. The specific activities (Q O 2 's) of the supernatants obtained after high speed centrifugation (100, 000 - 182, 000 andtimes; g) are approximately five to ten times higher than those (3. 93 andplusmn; 1. 15 (10)) of untreated enzyme preparations. An examination of this "purification" led {{to the conclusion that the}} enzyme activity appeared to be rather dependent on the state of aggregation of the protein particles. Further evidence of this effect was inferred from the stimulating action of anionic (deoxycholate) and neutral ("Tween") detergents (added prior to buffering) upon phenoloxidase activity. Prior to the institution, as a regular procedure, of dialysis (0. 01 M -NaCl) of the colleterial gland secretion (to remove endogenous phenolic compounds), a long induction period (ca. 20 - 60 mins.) before commencement of oxygen uptake by enzyme and substrate was frequently observed. This long period was minimized by the addition of right gland homogenate or ascorbic acid. In section II, the phenolic compounds found in insect cuticle and in cockroach colleterial glands were examined with reference to their biosynthesis and to their role in sclerotization. Protocatechuic acid, its 4 -o-andbeta;-D-glucoside and p-tyrosine were identified (chromatographically and spectrophotometrically) in homogenates of left colleterial gland. After aerobic incubation (37 anddeg;C) of these homogenates substances strongly resembling catechol and tyramine were separated by paper chromatography and identified by their u. v. spectral properties after elution. Protocatechuic acid and p-tyrosine, when added (with and without right gland preparation) to homogenates of left glands, increased the production of catechol and tyramine respectively. From densitometric measurements of ferric chloride/ferricyanide sprayed paper chromatograms the aerobic conversion by left gland homogenate of p-tyrosine (1 andmu;mole added) into tyramine (0. 62 andmu;moles) was demonstrated, The amine was also separated by absorption on Amberlite-IRC (H +). The decarboxylase systems responsible for catechol and tyramine production, whether induced or not, were heat labile. There is some manometric evidence that the former enzyme is located in right gland cells while the latter is present in the larger gland tissue. These findings are made uncertain by the retardation of the reactions in presence of inorganic buffers (and an anaerobic atmosphere) and by extraneous gas evolution particularly during incubation of mixed homogenates of both glands. In the light of some evidence, the possibility that tyramine might be enzymically oxidized by homogenates of left gland is weighed. The significance of such a reaction, together with the decarboxylation of p-tyrosine and protocatechuic acid, is discussed with regard to the biosynthesis of tanning quinones from the p-tyrosine of the insect blood. </p...|$|E
