40|$|The {{extraction}} of <b>coffee</b> <b>solubles</b> from roasted and ground coffee {{is a complex}} operation, the understanding of which {{is key to the}} brewing of high quality coffee. This complexity {{stems from the fact that}} brewing of coffee is achieved through a wide variety of techniques each of which depends on a large number of process variables. In this paper, we consider a recent, experimentally validated model of coffee extraction, which describes extraction from a coffee bed using a double porosity model. The model incorporates dissolution and transport of coffee in the coffee bed. The model was shown to accurately describe {{extraction of}} <b>coffee</b> <b>solubles</b> from grains in two situations: extraction from a dilute suspension of coffee grains and extraction from a packed coffee bed. The full model equations can only be solved numerically. In this work we consider asymptotic solutions, based on the dominant mechanisms, in the case of coffee extraction from a dilute suspension of coffee grains. Extraction in this well mixed system, can be described by a set of ordinary differential equations. This allows analysis of the extraction kinetics from the coffee grains independent of transport processes associated with flow through packed coffee beds. Coffee extraction for an individual grain is controlled by two processes: a rapid dissolution of coffee from the grain surfaces in conjunction with a much slower diffusion of coffee through the tortuous intragranular pore network to the grain surfaces. Utilising a small parameter resulting from the ratio of these two timescales, we construct asymptotic solutions using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The asymptotic solutions are compared with numerical solutions and data from coffee extraction experiments. The asymptotic solutions depend on a small number of dimensionless parameters, so the solutions facilitate quick investigation of the influence of various process parameters on the coffee extraction curves.

40|$|Production of <b>soluble</b> (instant) <b>coffee</b> powders {{typically}} involves {{extraction of}} roasted coffee by water followed by evaporation {{in order to}} concentrate extracts before spray or freeze drying to produce dry coffee powder. In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is {{a major cause of}} fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^− 2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25 ◦C and 70 ◦C were much higher for the original extract (13. 3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1. 3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60 ◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts...|$|R

40|$|Coffee {{is widely}} {{consumed}} worldwide; therefore, the methylxanthines contained in coffee, mainly caffeine (CF), {{are among the}} most abundant bioactive compounds in our diet. In the present work, the bioavailability and metabolism of methylxanthines in a commercial <b>soluble</b> green/roasted <b>coffee</b> blend was studied. After a 3 -day restriction of methylxanthine-containing foods, fasting healthy subjects (12 men and women) consumed the coffee product containing 70. 69 mg CF and 0. 119 mg theobromine (TB). Plasma samples were taken before (t= 0 h) and after coffee consumption at different time points (0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 12 h). Urine was collected at baseline (- 2 - 0 h) and at different intervals (0 - 2, 2 - 5, 5 - 8, 8 - 12 and 12 - 24 h). Samples were analyzed by HPLC-DAD and LC-MS-QToF, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. CF was the main methylxanthine found in plasma (Cmax= 10. 50 μM, Tmax= 1. 2 h). In addition, seven methylxanthines and methyluric acids were detected between 0. 5 and 12 h after coffee intake, paraxanthine (PX) being the major metabolite (Cmax= 3. 36 μM), followed by 1 -methyluric acid (1 -MU; Cmax= 1. 44 μM) and 1 -methylxanthine (1 -MX; Cmax= 1. 27 μM), identified in plasma samples for the first time. In 24 h urine, eleven methylxanthines and methyluric acids were detected, 1 -MU being the major metabolite (Cmax= 150. 52 μM, Tmax= 12 h) amounting to 67. 7 % of the total urinary metabolites. In conclusion, a rapid absorption, metabolization and excretion of caffeine and its derived methylxanthines and methyluric acids have been observed after consumption of a green/roasted coffee product. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
