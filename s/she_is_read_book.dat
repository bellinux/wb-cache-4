40|$|Advisors: Eloy Merino. Committee members: Linda Saborio; Francisco Solares-Larrave. This {{thesis is}} a {{translation}} into English of Paco Ignacio Taibo II's Mexican detective novel, Amorosos fantasmas. The approach used in translating was {{in line with}} Lawrence Venuti's concept of foreignization. This approach was employed {{in favor of a}} more common style of domestication. Foreignization allows the translated text to retain some linguistic and cultural elements that are important or distinctive in the source text. In doing so, it evokes a feeling of foreignness. The reader of this translation may feel aware that he or <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>reading</b> a <b>book</b> that <b>was</b> not originally written in English; it is intentionally less fluent than a domesticated translation would be. The first introduction is an essay explaining the translation approach, why it is appropriate, and some of the difficulties encountered in the task of translating. The second is an analysis of the protagonist and a brief study of the previous novels in the series, of which Amorous Ghosts is the sixth. The series features Hector Belascoaran Shayne, Mexican private detective, and is written in the novela negra, or noir style. Paco Ignacio Taibo II uses the devices of this genre in order to criticize and call attention to social inequities, government corruption and bourgeois apathy in Mexico City. In Amorous Ghosts, Belascoaran finds himself at a particularly low and lonely point, haunted metaphorically by ghosts of his own past {{as well as those of}} his clients. He is propelled on by the strength of his ideals, however, to solve two murder cases and bring his own brand of justice to the perpetrators. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
