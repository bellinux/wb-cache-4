5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Bulge was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation. Had the Americans given way, the German advance would have overrun the vast supply depots around Liège and Spa and possibly have changed {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Bulge.|$|E
5|$|One <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring {{displays}} {{an image}} of the Administration Building, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.|$|E

5|$|Whelp Side, between Whelpside Gill and Mines Gill, {{appears as}} a {{distinct}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain when seen from the west, largely grassy though with a few crags and boulders in places, and with coniferous plantations on its lower slopes which were planted to stabilise the land around the reservoir. North of Mines Gill are the Helvellyn Screes, a more craggy stretch of hillside, beneath the north-west ridge, with a loose scree covering in places.|$|E

5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lanzerath Ridge {{was fought}} on December 16, 1944, {{the first day}} of the Battle of the Bulge during World War II, near the village of Lanzerath, Belgium, along the key route for the German advance on the {{northern}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation. It was fought between two squads totalling 18 men belonging to an American reconnaissance platoon, four U.S. Forward Artillery Observers, and a battalion of about 500 German paratroopers. During a day-long confrontation, the American reconnaissance troops inflicted dozens of casualties on the Germans and delayed by almost 20 hours the advance of the entire 1st SS Panzer Division, the spearhead of the German 6th Panzer Army.|$|E
50|$|A headshot {{occurs when}} a player is hit {{directly}} {{in the head by}} a high thrown ball. A high thrown ball is a ball thrown above <b>shoulder</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person hit in the head. Shoulder height is <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player in an upright standing position. If a player is ducking or crouching and hit in the head this will NOT be deemed a headshot as the ball was NOT thrown above shoulder height.|$|R

5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dying Cú Chulainn, and {{could also be a}} manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is {{associated}} with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. The mantle was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.|$|E
5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E

40|$|Page(s) : 2 (1), 28 - 45, 25 Ref. A field {{experiment}} was conducted {{over two years}} (1979 and 1980) to investigate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> seeding rates, sowing methods and manure and urea applications on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> forage sorghum {Sorghum bicolor (L.)

The results revealed that planting on <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge is a superior practice to avoid salinity hazards affecting <b>the</b> early stages <b>of</b> growth. More plants per unit area and higher yields were recorded on plants grown on <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge compared to those grown on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> farmyard manure alone or in combination with urea to salty soils significantly increased forage fresh and dry yields and improved forage quality.

40|$|Determining <b>the</b> {{employment}} status <b>of</b> {{an individual is}} crucial for <b>the</b> survival <b>of</b> any organisation that uses <b>the</b> services <b>of</b> contractors, {{as well as for}} <b>the</b> survival <b>of</b> legitimate independent contractors. The {{employment status}} issue is thus one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key issues to be addressed in this contribution. In South Africa all the risks and obligations pertaining to the relevant employment taxes are squarely being placed on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employer, or if the contractor is truly independent, on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contractor. A failure to comply with all the complex legislation could result in dire consequences for the persons concerned.

This makes the recovery much easier and reduces the need to turn the head to breathe. As one shoulder is out of the water, it reduces drag, and as it falls it aids the arm catching the water; as the other shoulder rises it aids the arm at end of the push to leave the water.|$|E
