50|$|Magnetic {{levitation}} train (maglev) {{systems by}} the German Transrapid were built as <b>straddle-type</b> monorails, {{as they are}} highly stable and allow rapid deceleration from great speed. At speed, maglev trains hover over the track and are not in physical contact with it. The maglev is the fastest train of any type, the experimental SCMaglev having recorded a speed of 603 km/h. The commercial Shanghai Maglev Train has run at 501 km/h. However, the guideway is so wide {{that it can be}} argued it is not legitimate to call it a monorail. There are also slower maglev monorails intended for urban transport, such as Japan's Linimo (2003).|$|E
50|$|The Mark IV {{monorail}} was {{a design}} model of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail trains. The design {{was developed by}} legendary Disney Imagineer Bob Gurr. Ten trains were built by Martin Marietta in 1969 {{at the cost of}} about $7 million USD each and they were used on the Walt Disney World Monorail System between 1971 and 1989 before they were replaced by the Mark VI monorail, although a few lasted until 1991. Sometime between 1991 and 1994 Monorail Coral and Lime (which had been introduced new in 1984) were sold for $3.5 million each, refurbished, and used to begin the Las Vegas Monorail operations. In 2004 Lime and Coral (now the MGM and Bally) were replaced by fully automated Bombardier MVI 4-car trains.|$|E
30|$|There is {{no power}} {{collection}} quality standard for <b>straddle-type</b> monorail.

30|$|The {{influence}} of the {{various factors}} on dynamic {{responses of the}} <b>straddle-type</b> monorail track beam is investigated in this paper. The mechanism obtained in the analytical procedure provides the necessary theoretical accumulation {{for the development of}} the <b>straddle-type</b> monorail traffic technology.|$|E
30|$|The {{track of}} <b>straddle-type</b> monorail consists of a PC beam {{which is made}} of concrete, and the {{positive}} and negative catenaries are rigidly installed along {{the two sides of the}} PC beam [1]. Because of the particular wheel–rail coupling relationship and the collection modes, the coupling relation between the pantograph and catenary in the <b>straddle-type</b> monorail is very different from other systems. Therefore, the aims to ameliorate coupling relation and improve the power collection quality between pantograph and catenary are of great significance and will serve to improve the safety of the operation of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail.|$|E
30|$|The {{calculations}} denote {{that all}} the factors (curve radius, driving speed and vehicle load) have important effect on the dynamic responses of the <b>straddle-type</b> monorail track beam under a moving train. These rules with respect to different conditions should be very useful in the procedures of the design or operation of the <b>straddle-type</b> transportation system.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, ADAMS, one multi-body {{dynamics}} software, is used {{to calculate}} the wheel–rail coupling dynamics of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicle.|$|E
30|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Chongqing metro line 2 in 2004, the {{monorail}} has the advantages like small turning radius, small footprint, strong climbing ability, low noise, comfort, low cost (only about metro's 1 / 3 – 1 / 2). Monorail transporation got wide acclaim. In 2011, Chongqing line 3 with independently developed equipment and technology has been put into operation, which indicates that light rail technology in China is approaching maturity. The successful operation of large-capacity monorail transportation in Chongqing indicates that the technology of large-scale and large-span <b>straddle-type</b> monorail transportation has matured and formed a demonstration and promotion effect. Besides Chongqing, Guiyang, Liupanshui began planning for investment in the construction of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail transportation, Indonesia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Pakistan and other countries are also in the planning of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail transportation [1].|$|E
30|$|Although the {{monorail}} was put {{in operation}} in 1970 s, {{it has not been}} accepted much in the world for a long time; The maximum distance of the monorail operated in the whole world was less than 100  km until 2004, which is the cause that its research is not comprehensive, especially on <b>straddle-type</b> monorail track vertical coupling dynamics, so far, there were very few studies, and the works about the vertical dynamics of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicle were almost zero.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{advantages}} including strong adaptability {{to complex}} terrain, low land occupancy, moderate freight volume and low construction cost, <b>straddle-type</b> monorail transportation systems have already {{become the first}} choice of urban railway systems in small–medium cities, mountainous cities and cities with topographic and geological complexity [1]. The <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicle is mainly supported, guided and stabilized by a single-track beam. The vehicle straddles and runs on the track beam, with the center of gravity of its body located above the track. Comparing to traditional railway vehicles, the running gears of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicles use rubber tires, with guide wheels and steady wheels set {{on both sides of the}} track beam. The track beam has a simple structure, playing the roles of bearing structure and track structure. Thus, the performance of the structure can be fully maximized while the maintenance workload of the track beam is of little requirement [2].|$|E
30|$|The {{lateral span}} of the walking wheels in <b>straddle-type</b> {{monorail}} vehicles is very short. Hence, steady wheels must be set to improve the capsizing resistance of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicles. The vehicle capsizing resistance is usually evaluated based on the buoyant center height and flexibility coefficient. In the UIC 505 - 5 regulation, the flexibility coefficient is defined as follows: When a vehicle stays on a line with a superelevation of δ, by assuming that the angle between the cross-section centerline of the vehicle and centerline and the line cross-section centerline perpendicular to the track top plane is ϕ, the ratio of ϕ to δ is the flexibility coefficient S.|$|E
30|$|In {{the actual}} {{operation}} of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail, {{the weight of}} the pantograph head is set to 1, 3, 5 and 7  kg, and then, the influence of the weight of the pantograph head on the power collection quality is analyzed.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method for}} the analysis of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicle–bridge coupling system in this paper can be used to simulate the dynamic responses of the bridge–vehicle interaction system, and the self-developed calculation software is efficient in the analysis of dynamic responses of the complex bridge–train coupling system.|$|E
40|$|OVERVIEW: With {{close to}} {{four decades of}} {{experience}} developing and deploying <b>straddle-type</b> monorail systems, Hitachi has now added to its lineup of standard/larger model monorails with a smaller, standardized, cost-effective monorail system.

30|$|In this study, the Sperling {{index is}} used to {{evaluate}} the riding stability of monorail vehicles. Due to the lack of the track irregularity spectrum of the <b>straddle-type</b> monorail, the ISO 8608 A-level road spectrum {{is used to}} simulate the track irregularity. After obtaining the acceleration of the vehicle during rectilinear motion, the Sperling index can be obtained based on treatment according to GB 5599 - 85.|$|E
30|$|The multi-body {{dynamics}} UM {{software is}} utilized {{to construct the}} single-vehicle dynamic model. Via simulation, its dynamic performance was analyzed. Dynamic analysis {{results indicated that the}} <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicle designed in this study has a favorable curve passing-through motion performance. When the A-level road spectrum coefficient is 0.5, the stability index of the monorail vehicle is excellent within the speed range of 90  km/h.|$|E
3000|$|As a {{standard}} of public transport, the vertical dynamic action of monorail determines many problems like the safety of train operation, the riding comfort and the vertical force of rail beam [2, 3]. The vertical dynamics is mainly caused by {{the interaction of the}} rail beam and the body (bogie), and the surface roughness of the track beam is the mechanism of its formation. The <b>straddle-type</b> monorail track beam is divided into two kinds of PC beam (prestressed reinforced concrete beam and steel structure beam), they are all prefabricated and finished, and so the surface smoothness is very good. (At least they are close to the US road A road surface, but because there is no relevant research, so we lack specific data.) The gap between the beam and the beam, which called finger-band, is considered to be the largest vertical excitation source in the track beam, so if we want to study the vertical dynamics of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail, we must study its vertical dynamics at the finger-band.

We experienced a case of straddle injury to the posterior fourchette that caused acute hematocolpos due to delayed adequate treatment with hypotension and acute abdomen in an adolescent girl.

30|$|At present, the {{coupling}} relationship between the pantograph and catenary is not ideal for <b>straddle-type</b> monorail. The power collection quality is poor, and the wear of the contact strip of a pantograph is uneven. Therefore, the key problem of coupling {{relation between the}} pantograph and catenary is the dynamics of a pantograph–catenary system. This paper analyzed the modal of catenary through simulation with finite element model and the vibration modal of pantograph multi-rigid-body dynamic model by simulation in multi-body danamics software ADAMS. A rigid-flexible coupling dynamic model of pantograph–catenary system is established. Finally, extensive research has been made on the influence of pantograph head parameters on the power collection quality.|$|E
30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of <b>straddle-type</b> {{monorail}} vehicle single-axle bogie is developed. The vertical suspension system uses tumbler structure. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework bottom via rotational joints, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. The lateral suspension system uses suspenders. Lateral elasticity was provided by the lateral oscillation of the suspenders. The deflection between the carbody and bogie during the motion when passing through curves is adapted by the vertical oscillation of the suspenders. The guide wheels and steady wheels rotates around the horizontal axle {{at the end of the}} framework. Rubber springs are set between the spindles and framework, and make it easier to adjust the pre-compressive pressure between the steady wheels and guide wheels.|$|E
30|$|The {{contact force}} between the {{pantograph}} and catenary of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail {{should be in}} the range of 44 – 79  N in the whole working stroke, and in the range of 59 − 10 + 10  N in normal working positions. Therefore, according to evaluation index system in this study, the maximum contact force between the pantograph and catenary should be less than 79  N, the minimum contact force between the pantograph and catenary should be greater than 44  N, and the optimum mean contact force should also be in the range of 59 − 10 + 10  N [2]. The standard deviation of contact force directly reflects the fluctuation range of contact forces. The smaller the standard deviation is, the smaller the fluctuation range of the contact force is, and the better the power collection quality.|$|E
3000|$|According to {{parameters}} {{listed in}} Table  1, the flexibility coefficient {{of this new}} <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicle can be calculated based on Eq.  3. When all the guide wheels are {{in contact with the}} steady wheels at the same time, the flexibility coefficient is 0.284. When steady wheels on one side and guide wheels on the opposite side leave the track surface, the flexibility coefficient is 0.651. According to the definition of the flexibility coefficient, the greater the flexibility coefficient, the easier it is for the vehicle to capsize on the curves. Hence, to ensure a favorable anti-overturning capacity of the straddling monorail vehicles, a certain degree of preload pressure should be applied on the guiding or stabilizing wheels to guarantee a consistent contact between the wheels and track beam.

30|$|In this paper, {{the force}} and dynamic {{response}} of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail walking wheel passing through the finger plate are studied. An equivalent stiffness method {{for dealing with the}} dynamics of nonlinear mechanical materials such as rubber tires is presented, a dynamic model for {{the force and}} dynamic response of finger-shaped plate and walking tire is designed, their simulation models are constructed, the dynamic simulation calculation is carried out by using ADAMS, the results are in good agreement with the measured data, and the validity of the kinetic model is verified. According to the experimental data, this paper proved that finger-band is the maximum excitation source of vertical vibration of monorail vehicle  by simulation, we can reduce the effective stiffness of the tire when crossing the band by change refers to the geometric structure and parameters of the finger-band,  it has great effect to reduce the vertical vibration of vehicle.|$|E
30|$|In view of {{the fact}} that {{exhibits}} monorail transportation in recent years, the good situation and the lack of <b>straddle-type</b> monorail vehicle vertical dynamics research, the key problems of vertical vibration were studied in this paper: The vertical coupling is between walking tires and finger-band. A dynamic model based on the vertical equivalent stiffness of tire is proposed, the force mode of the tire is determined through the comparison calculation and the dynamics model between walking tires and finger band was established on ADAMS Dynamics Software. By dynamic calculation, the vibration of four running wheels in time and frequency domains is obtained, and the vibration of the front axle of the front bogie is studied in detail; the correctness of the model is confirmed by comparing with the real vehicle test. Finally, the limitations of this paper and the direction of follow-up work are discussed.|$|E
30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of single-axle bogie of <b>straddle-type</b> {{monorail}} vehicle is designed. The tumbler structures are adopted in the vertical suspension system. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. In addition, the lateral suspension utilizes the suspender way, with longitudinal force transmitted via single pull rods. Guide wheels and steady wheels are connected to the end support arms of the framework through spindles around the horizontal direction. Rubber springs, the pre-compressed magnitudes of which could be adjusted, are set between the spindles and support arms. The multi-body dynamics software UM is adopted to construct a dynamic model and simulate related dynamic performance. The results of the simulation indicate that this new kind of bogie has a favorable performance when passing through curves and has a greater riding stability. The flexibility factor equation of this new monorail vehicle is deduced, with its flexibility factor obtained.|$|E
30|$|An {{analytical}} procedure of dynamic interaction {{analysis of the}} straddle monorail bridge–vehicle coupling system is proposed in this paper based on the finite element method and energy method. The calculation procedure is programmed with VB language for {{the solution of the}} governing motion equations of the <b>straddle-type</b> monorail bridge–vehicle coupling system. The effects of speed, three kinds of loads and different radius of curvature on dynamic responses of the monorail bridge–vehicle coupling system are analyzed. The simulation indicates that vertical vibration amplitude of the track beam decreases while the lateral amplitude increases with the increase in the radius of the curvature; the maximum value in lateral and vertical direction is 0.075 and 0.43  mm, respectively; and the maximum amplitude (lateral and vertical) and acceleration (lateral and vertical) are 0.69, 0.046  mm, 0.15 and 0.62  m/s 2, respectively, at the speed of 80  km/h. The vibration amplitude (lateral and vertical) and vertical acceleration increase with the increasing load, and the maximum values are 0.041, 0.43  mm and 0.44  m/s 2, respectively. The lateral acceleration is not easily affected by the load conditions.|$|E
30|$|Since {{urban traffic}} {{conditions}} become heavier, monorail transportation {{system has been}} introduced in many cities in China, which has the advantages of low costs, short construction period, little influence on the surrounding environment and strong adaptability to the complex terrain and line type. The first monorail transportation line in China has been put into operation in Chongqing City, which is imported from Japanese technology. The mechanism of this monorail transportation system should be explored in depth; however, the publications of studies on the monorail transportation system are scarce. Lee [1], Kim [2, 3] and Naeimi et al. [4] investigated the dynamic responses of the straddle monorail train and the degree of riding comfort based on the multi-rigid-body principle, respectively. Trahair [5] proposed a calculation method which takes the beneficial lateral load into account in the analysis of the lateral buckling of the monorail steel beam. Kim and Kawatani [6] analyzed the dynamic responses of the improved monorail steel track beam with a transverse support system under seismic activities. Ren et al. [7, 8], Zhao [9], Du and Wang [10], Ma [13], Liu [11, 12] and Shan [14] also studied {{the responses of the}} straddle monorail vehicle from different aspects. All the studies above studied the mechanism of the <b>straddle-type</b> monorail train, but there were no publications that recorded the mechanism of the monorail track beam under different factors.|$|E
40|$|Background: High-flow {{priapism}} {{is a rare}} condition {{characterized by}} a prolonged and painless erection. Since it may permanently impair erectile function, it must be managed and treated as soon as possible, in order to restore potency. The case we are presenting here was successfully treated by embolizing the penile artery using an autologous clot. Case Report: A case of delayed painless high-flow priapism that occured after blunt <b>straddle-type</b> perineal trauma, that was persistent for more than 30 days is being presented. Doppler ultrasonographic examination of the cavernosal artery revealed a 1. 5 cm-diameter pseudoaneurysm at the right cavernosal artery, together with a high-velocity shunt between the two cavernous arteries. Extravasation from the proximal sites of both of the cavernous arteries and a right cavernosal artery pseudoaneurysm was detected on angiography. The patient was successfully treated by embolization of the penile artery with an autologous clot in two sessions with a 3 -day interval. Conclusions: This experience along with {{a survey of the}} literature made us conclude that embolization of cavernous artery by means of an autologous clot is a very effective procedure and a method of choice for treatment of high-flow priapism and for restoration of penile erectile function. What makes our case even more interesting and important, is the fact that priapism of one month’s duration could well be treated by means of this method.
