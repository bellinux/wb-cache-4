5|$|Viking metal {{emerged from}} black metal {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, <b>sharing</b> <b>with</b> black metal an {{opposition}} to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes {{in favor of the}} Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.|$|E
