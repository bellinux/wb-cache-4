6000|$|This indeed {{had been}} quite the thing I was asking myself all the wondrous way down from Rome, and was to ask myself afresh, on the return, largely {{within sight of the}} sea, as our earlier course had kept to the ineffably romantic inland valleys, the great {{decorated}} blue vistas in which the breasts of the mountains shine vaguely with strange high-lying city and castle and church and convent, even as shoulders of no diviner line might be hung about with dim old jewels. It was odd, at the end of time, long after those initiations, of comparative youth, that had then struck one as extending the very field itself of felt charm, as exhausting the possibilities of fond surrender, it was odd to have positively a new basis of enjoyment, a new gate of triumphant passage, thrust into one's consciousness and opening to one's use; just as I confess I have to brace myself a little to call by such fine names our latest, our ugliest and most monstrous aid to motion. It is true of the monster, as we have known him up to now, that one can neither quite praise him nor quite blame him without a blush--he reflects so the nature of the company he's condemned to keep. His splendid easy power addressed to noble aims makes him assuredly on occasion a purely beneficent creature. I parenthesise at any rate that I know him in no other light--counting out of course the acquaintance that consists of a dismayed arrest in the road, with back flattened against wall or hedge, for the dusty, smoky, stenchy shock of his passage. To no end is his easy power more blest than to that of ministering to the ramifications, as it were, of curiosity, or to that, in other words, of achieving for us, among the kingdoms of the earth, the grander and more genial, the comprehensive and complete introduction. Much as was ever to be said for our old forms of pilgrimage--and I am convinced that they are far from wholly superseded--they left, they had to leave, dreadful gaps in our yearning, dreadful lapses in our knowledge, dreadful failures in our energy; there were always things off and beyond, goals of delight and dreams of desire, that dropped {{as a matter of course}} into the unattainable, and over to which our wonder- working agent now flings the firm <b>straight</b> <b>bridge.</b> Curiosity has lost, under this amazing extension, its salutary renouncements perhaps; contemplation has become one with action and satisfaction one with desire--speaking always in the spirit of the inordinate lover of an enlightened use of our eyes. That may represent, for all I know, an insolence of advantage on which there will be eventual heavy charges, as yet obscure and incalculable, to pay, and I glance at the possibility only to avoid all thought of the lesson of the long run, and to insist that I utter this dithyramb but in the immediate flush and fever of the short. For such a beat of time as our fine courteous and contemplative advance upon Naples, and for such another as our retreat northward under the same fine law of observation and homage, the bribed consciousness could only decline to question its security. The sword of Damocles suspended over that presumption, the skeleton at the banquet of extravagant ease, would have been that even at our actual inordinate rate--leaving quite apart [...] "improvements" [...] to come--such savings of trouble begin to use up the world; some hard grain of difficulty being always a necessary part of the composition of pleasure. The hard grain in our old comparatively pedestrian mixture, before this business of our learning not so much even to fly (which might indeed involve trouble) as to be mechanically and prodigiously flown, quite another matter, was the element of uncertainty, effort and patience; the handful of silver nails which, I admit, drove many an impression home. The seated motorist misses the silver nails, I fully acknowledge, save in so far as his aesthetic (let alone his moral) conscience may supply him with some artful subjective substitute; in which case the thing becomes a precious secret of his own.|$|E

40|$|Live load {{distribution}} factors {{are used to}} determine the live-load moment for bridge girder design when a two dimensional analysis is conducted. A simple, analysis of bridge superstructures are considered to determine live-load factors {{that can be used to}} analyze different types of bridges. The distribution of the live load factors distributes the effect of loads transversely across the width of the bridge superstructure by proportioning the design lanes to individual girders through the distribution factors. This research study consists of the determination of live {{load distribution}} factors (LLDFs) in both interior and exterior girders for horizontally curved concrete box girder bridges that have central angles, with one span exceeding 34 degrees. This study has been done based on real geometry of bridges designed by a company for different locations. The goal of using real geometry is to achieve more realistic, accurate, and practical results. Also, in this study, 3 -D modeling analyses for different span lengths (80, 90, 100, 115, 120, and 140 ft) have been first conducted for <b>straight</b> <b>bridges,</b> and then the results compared with AASHTO LRFD, 2012 equations. The point of starting with <b>straight</b> <b>bridges</b> analyses is to get an indication and conception about the LLDF obtained from AASHTO LRFD formulas, 2012 to those obtained from finite element analyses for this type of bridge (Concrete Box Girder). After that, the analyses have been done for curved bridges having central angles with one span exceeding 34 degrees. Theses analyses conducted for various span lengths that had already been used for <b>straight</b> <b>bridges</b> (80, 90, 100, 115, 120, and 140 ft) with different central angles (5 º, 38 º, 45 º, 50 º, 55 º, and 60 º). The results of modeling and analyses for <b>straight</b> <b>bridges</b> indicate that the current AASHTO LRFD formulas for box-girder bridges provide a conservative estimate of the design bending moment. For curved bridges, it was observed from a refined analysis that the distribution factor increases as the central angle increases and the current AASHTO LRFD formula is applicable until a central angle of 38 º which is a little out of the LRFD`s limits...|$|R

50|$|The side-spar {{principle}} {{is not limited}} to a <b>straight</b> <b>bridge,</b> however. The tower could be offset and the bridge deck wrap around the spar in an arc, e.g., Chords Bridge in Jerusalem. Such a bridge would be particularly suited for use in the confines of a canyon, where the road is brought in the upstream direction down one side, crosses a stream, and turns back to a downstream direction on the other side. By placing {{a large portion of the}} turn on the bridge, rather than on the approaches, the turn may be made more gentle, allowing faster traffic. This would require more torsional (twisting) rigidity in the roadbed than would a <b>straight</b> <b>bridge.</b> A bridge of this type (supported by a spar), traveling through a much smaller arc, was one of the original proposals for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Similar bridges, without the spar, could be supported by cables anchored in the canyon walls (where conditions are suitable).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a skew angle on simple-span {{reinforced}} concrete bridges is {{presented in this paper}} using the finite-element method. The parameters investigated in this analytical study were the span length, slab width, and skew angle. The finite-element analysis (FEA) results for skewed bridges were compared to the reference <b>straight</b> <b>bridges</b> as well as the American Association for State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Standard Specifications and LRFD procedures. A total of 96 case study bridges were analyzed and subjected to AASHTO HS- 20 design trucks positioned close to one edge on each bridge to produce maximum bending in the slab. The AASHTO Standard Specifications procedure gave similar results to the FEA maximum longitudinal bending moment for a skew angle {{less than or equal to}} 20 °. As the skew angle increased, AASHTO Standard Specifications overestimated the maximum moment by 20 % for 30 °, 50 % for 40 °, and 100 % for 50 °. The AASHTO LRFD Design Specifications procedure overestimated the FEA maximum longitudinal bending moment. This overestimate increased with the increase in the skew angle, and decreased when the number of lanes increased; AASHTO LRFD overestimated the longitudinal bending moment by up to 40 % for skew angles less than 30 ° and reaching 50 % for 50 °. The ratio between the three-dimensional FEA longitudinal moments for skewed and <b>straight</b> <b>bridges</b> was almost one for bridges with skew angle less than 20 °. This ratio decreased to 0. 75 for bridges with skew angles between 30 and 40 °, and further decreased to 0. 5 as the skew angle of the bridge increased to 50 °. This decrease in the longitudinal moment ratio is offset by an increase of up to 75 % in the maximum transverse moment ratio as the skew angle increases from 0 to 50 °. The ratio between the FEA maximum live-load deflection for skewed <b>bridges</b> and <b>straight</b> <b>bridges</b> decreases in a pattern consistent with that of the longitudinal moment. This ratio decreased from one for skew angles less than 10 ° to 0. 6 for skew angles between 40 and 50 °...|$|R

40|$|Horizontally curved {{concrete}} deck on multiple steel box girder bridges is a structurally efficient, economic, and aesthetically pleasing method of supporting curved roadway systems. Modern highway constructions {{are often in}} need of bridges with horizontally curved alignments due to the tight geometry restrictions. Continuous curved composite box girder bridges allow {{for the use of}} longer spans, thus reducing costs of the substructure. Despite all inherent advantages of continuous curved composite box girder bridges, they do pose challenging problems for engineers in calculating the load distribution due to moving vehicles across the bridges. Curved bridges are subjected to high torsional as well as flexural stresses. The interaction between the box girders is also more complicated in curved bridges than that in <b>straight</b> <b>bridges.</b> North American codes for bridges have recommended expressions for the load distribution factors only for <b>straight</b> <b>bridges</b> and not for curved bridges. Impact factors proposed in these codes are generally restricted also to <b>straight</b> <b>bridges.</b> In addition, simplified formula to predict the fundamental frequency of analyzing the bridges is not available. To assist engineers in dealing with the complexities of continuous curved composite box girder bridges, a reliable, accurate, and simple method is required to calculate the structure 2 ̆ 7 s response under self-weight and vehicular loading. The refined three-dimensional finite-element analysis method is employed to investigate the static and dynamic responses of the bridge. Two two-equal-span two-box physical bridge models were constructed in the laboratory. One of the <b>bridge</b> models was <b>straight</b> in plan while the other was horizontally curved. The physical models were tested under several static loading cases to better comprehend their elastic behaviour. Free-vibration tests were also conducted to obtain the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of the bridge models. Both models were loaded up to failure to examine the collapse mechanism and its correlation with the finite element modeling. Findings obtained from the two physical bridge models were compared to those predicted by the analytical models. The agreement between the finite element model and the experimental model made it possible to use the analytical models to conduct three parametric studies on several bridges.

5000|$|Two viaducts {{south of}} Montrose were {{designed}} by Sir Thomas Bouch, {{the architect of the}} original Tay Bridge, but due to delays in building the Tay Bridge and the line by Dundee, they were not built until 1879. [...] Construction was by Gilkes Wilson and Company supervised by Bouch's son William. The more northerly bridge the South Esk Viaduct, was of iron lattice girder construction. Following the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 the viaduct was inspected and found to have a distinct curve, although the plans showed a <b>straight</b> <b>bridge,</b> and many of the piers were out of perpendicular. Tests in 1880 over a period of 36 hours using both dead and rolling loads led to the structure becoming seriously distorted and eight of the piers were declared unsafe.

Such designs were widely used by Victorian engineers until rendered obsolete by the introduction of other American truss designs in the 1880s.
