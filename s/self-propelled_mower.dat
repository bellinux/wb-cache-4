50|$|The Claas Cougar is a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>mower</b> {{produced}} by the German agricultural machinery manufacturer Claas. The mower, which is named after the cougar, a large American cat, was first presented in 2003. Due to its maximum cutting width of 14 m it is classified as the largest <b>self-propelled</b> <b>mower</b> in the world.|$|E

50|$|Simple {{rubber belt}} (non-stretching fixed {{circumference}} manufactured using various highly durable and flexible materials) CVTs {{are commonly used}} in small motorized vehicles, where their mechanical simplicity {{and ease of use}} outweigh their comparative inefficiency. Nearly all snowmobiles, utility vehicles, golf carts and motor scooters use CVTs, typically the rubber belt or variable pulley variety. Many small tractors and <b>self-propelled</b> <b>mowers</b> for home and garden also use simple rubber belt CVT. Hydrostatic systems are more common on the larger units--the walk behind self propelled mowers are of the slipping belt variety.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{internal}} structure of a small <b>self-propelled</b> <b>mower,</b> extract key points and make the main outlines of the machine by connecting the points in four ways: straight lines connect, arcs connect, free curves connect and data fitting. Then start from the main outlines and make the morphological evolution {{by the rules of}} "tilt", "fillet " and the characteristic of curves to obtain lots of basic shapes of the machines. Choose and modify the shapes by a unified style to get the final design of the mower. The period of the R&D of the small <b>self-propelled</b> <b>mower</b> is shorten and the final design is simple and effective in line with the appearance needs of such kind of products. Moreover the final shells of the mower are better match with the structural components. That verifies the feasibility of the design method and its better effect...|$|E

Focusing on the vast scope and great hourly output. The design emphasis is on compliance ergonomic rules, easy maintenance and functionality of the machine. For a very innovative features can be seen ejecting the cab, crop spacing on the sides, drive hydraulic cutter bars. In particular, {{the location of the}} cabin and boarding colors and folding machine cutter bars during transport. The machine was created to perfect performance, operator comfort, performance focused on large cysts and fluid design...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We managed thirty-three {{patients}} who had open injuries of the foot related {{to the use of}} a lawn mower from 1985 through 1992. Twenty-eight of the patients were male and five were female. They ranged in age from four to seventy-three years old. The injuries were {{associated with the use of}} push lawn mowers (twenty-two patients), riding lawn mow-ens (nine patients), and <b>self-propelled</b> lawn <b>mowers</b> (two patients). The injuries included forty open frac-tunes, twenty amputations, eighteen lacerations of the skin and nail beds, nine lacerations of tendons, two closed fractures, segmental loss of bone in two patients, and segmental loss of the Achilles tendon in one pa-tient. The findings on culture of intraoperative speci-mens revealed a mean of 3. 1 organisms (range, one t...|$|R
40|$|A new {{implementation}} of a Computational Aeroacoustics formulation, based on Lighthillâ€™s Analogy, has been validated on two physical tests. The implementation involves sequential solutions, first of a static CFD, followed by a transient CFD, followed by the acoustical propagation. All of the solutions are performed using finite element methods, and the acoustic sources are integrated directly onto the acoustic mesh from within the CFD, not interpolated afterwards. The process is validated on both an engine cooling fan installed in a mock hood and cooling package, and on a single-blade, <b>self-propelled,</b> walk-behind lawn <b>mower...</b>|$|R
