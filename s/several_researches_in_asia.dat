40|$|This study explores higher {{education}} <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>Asia.</b> Drawing on scientometrics, the mapping {{of science and}} social network analysis, this paper examines the publications of 38 specialised journals on {{higher education}} {{over the past three}} decades. The findings indicate a growing number of higher education research publications but the proportion of Asian publications in relation to the total world publications <b>in</b> higher education <b>research</b> remains stationary. The higher education <b>research</b> community <b>in</b> <b>Asia</b> is heavily concentrated in a few countries and universities, resting on {{a relatively small number of}} core scholars who publish <b>research</b> <b>in</b> the international specialised higher education journals. In response to increasing challenges in Asian higher education systems, the paper suggests that the higher education <b>research</b> community <b>in</b> <b>Asia</b> needs to be expanded and include more regional and international collaborations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Although researching of and {{publishing}} on {{different aspects of}} the society <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia</b> and the post-Soviet world has become a popular activity in the international context, little attention is paid to the concept, processes, and conditions of <b>researching</b> <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia</b> itself. Yet, the quality of the research outcomes, which depend on the above factors, and which constitutes a foundation for policy and practice decisions, including in education is of paramount importance. This paper is about themes, concepts, issues and challenges involved in the process of understanding and carrying out <b>research</b> <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia.</b> It draws upon the outcomes of a number of experiences, namely: (a) the presenter’s personal experiences of conducting <b>research</b> <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia,</b> (b) interviews and informal conversations with a number of scholars involved in studying education and society <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia,</b> and (c) review of literature on research. The concepts and processes of researching are connected with literature on Soviet and post-Soviet research conditions. The paper highlights implications for the quality of research products, researching capacity, conditions of researching, and for training local and external researchers to undertake qualitative inquiry <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia.</b> Writing a paper on the challenges of educational <b>research</b> <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia</b> is a challenging task for a number of reasons, the most important of which is the dearth of reliable and valid data due to the underdeveloped <b>research</b> tradition <b>in</b> Central <b>Asia,</b> the lack of research facilities, critical scholarship and a lack of confidence <b>in</b> sharing the <b>research</b> data for identifying solutions to the problems...|$|R
