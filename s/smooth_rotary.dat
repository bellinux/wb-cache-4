50|$|Strowger also {{filed the}} first patent for a rotary dial in 1891. The first dials worked by direct, forward action. The pulses were sent as the user rotated the dial to the finger stop {{starting}} {{at a different}} position for each digit transmitted. Operating the dial error-free required <b>smooth</b> <b>rotary</b> motion of the finger wheel by the user, but was found as too unreliable. This mechanism was soon refined to include a recoil spring and a centrifugal governor to control the recoil speed. The user selected a digit to be dialed by inserting a finger into the corresponding hole and rotated the dial to the finger stop. When released from this position, the dial pulsing contacts were opened and closed repeatedly, thus interrupting the loop current in a pattern on the return to the home position. The exchange switch decoded the pattern for each digit thus transmitted by stepping relays or by accumulation in digit registers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{smoothness}} {{tool path}} {{is essential in}} five-axis high speed machining. However, the smoothness of the tool orientation in the part coordinate system cannot assure the smooth motions of the rotary axes of a five-axis machine tool because the conversion of tool posture from the part coordinate system to the machine coordinate system is nonlinear. To generate a tool path with <b>smooth</b> <b>rotary</b> motions of the five-axis machine tool, the tool path in this paper is represented with three spline curves: the cutter location curve and the two trajectory curves of the rotary axes of the machine tool, so that the rotary axes’ motions can be simultaneously smoothed. For a flank milling tool path, the geometric deviations between the envelope surface of the tool movement and the design surface should be respected while smoothing the tool path. The point-to-surface distance is adopted to calculate the geometric deviations, and then a smoothness optimization model is developed to smooth the rotary axes’ motions using the weighted least squares method. A numerical example of five-axis flank milling of a S-shape surface is given to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|E

The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism is done using vector loop method and cosine rule are applied to describe {{the position of the}} piston. Following the velocity of piston and connecting rod is performed by differentiating the position in terms of the crank angle and connecting rod angle respectively. The acceleration equation with brief form is derived from the velocity in the same principle. Based on the kinematics, the equations of motion of crank mechanism components are formulated for each moving link and platform then, all motion parameters of each component about its crank angle are readily derived. Furthermore the 2 D model is provided by using 2 D Auto CAD software in order to visualize the system and mathematical algorithm solved by using software MATLAB. The forces acting on the crank mechanism and the torque applied are also formulated based on the angles of the crank and connecting rod. Introduction. The Internal combustion engine is those that burn their fuel which is mixture of air and petrol from carburetor inside the cylinder or compress air only on the cylinder and injects diesel from injector nozzle. These IC engines convert the chemical energy stored in their fuel into heat energy during the power stroke of piston. The energy produced from burning of fuel is used for motion of piston; the working of a four stroke engine is based on simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics of IC engine is not altering from simple slider crank mechanism. The kinematics formulation of the crank mechanism such as piston motion and connecting rod motion utilizes different software and methodologies for which it is suitable for manipulation The crank mechanism comprised of components like crank shaft, connecting rod and piston which changes the sudden displacement to a <b>smooth</b> <b>rotary</b> output which is the input to many devices such as pumps generators and compressors. A detailed procedure of getting stresses in the fillet area of a crank mechanism particularly crank shaft was introduced by Henry et al. [1], in which FEM and BEM (Boundary Element Method) were used. Obtained stresses were ratified by experimental results on turbocharged compression ignition engine with Ricardo type combustion chamber configuration. The crank mechanism durability assessment tool used in this study was developed by RENAULT Guagliano et al. [2] conducted a study on a marine diesel engine crankshaft and connecting rod. Payer et al. [3] developed a two-step technique to perform nonlinear transient analysis of crank mechanism combining a beam-mass model and a solid element model and Prakash et al. [4] performed stress and fatigue analysis on three example parts belonging to three different classes of engines, light automotive crankshaft was studied by Borges et al. [5]. The geometry of the crank mechanism was geometrically restricted due to limitations in the computer resources available to the authors. Shenoy and Fatemi [6] conducted dynamic analysis of loads in the connecting rod and piston components, which is in contact with the crankshaft. Dynamic analysis of the connecting rod is similar to dynamics of the crankshaft, since these components form a slide-crank mechanism and the connecting rod motion applies dynamic load on the crank-pin bearing [...] Shenoy and Fatemi [7] optimized the crank mechanism considering dynamic service load on the component. It was shown that dynamic analysis is the proper basis for fatigue performance calculation and optimization of dynamically loaded components. A literature survey by Zoroufi and Fatemi [8] focused on durability performance evaluation and comparisons of forged steel and cast iron crankshafts. The piston-connecting rod-crankshaft assembly in the reciprocating piston-engines is used to transform the gas forces generated during combustion within the working cylinder into a piston stroke, which the crankshafts converts into useful torque available at the flywheel. The cyclic operation leads to unequal gas forces, and the acceleration and deceleration of the reciprocating powe...|$|E

5000|$|Like radial engines, rotaries were {{generally}} built {{with an odd}} number of cylinders (usually either 7 or 9), so that a consistent every-other-piston firing order could be maintained, to provide <b>smooth</b> running. <b>Rotary</b> engines with an even number of cylinders were mostly of the [...] "two row" [...] type.|$|R
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{necessity to}} miniaturize <b>smooth</b> torque <b>rotary</b> actuators has placed severe {{constraints on the}} current slotless permanent-magnet technology. These constraints are mainly the consequence of the relatively large effective magnetic airgap which limits the achievable magnetic loading and, therefore, the torque density of slotless permanent-magnet rotary actuators. Further, the miniaturization has to be achieved at ever-decreasing costs and, therefore, it would be advantageous to implement solid back irons. However this, even at reduced magnetic loading, still results in considerable eddy-current losses. Therefore, a careful selection of the various actuator dimensions and most appropriate soft magnetic laminated or solid material {{is a prerequisite for}} applications that require smooth speed and torque characteristic. This paper will identify the influence of various parameters of the slotless permanent-magnet actuator on the eddy-current loss in the back iron using both 2 -D and 3 -D finite-element analysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of cyclic stress history on corrosion fatigue strength, two-step fatigue tests were performed on the 0. 45 %C carbon steel <b>smooth</b> specimens in <b>rotary</b> bending in laboratory air and in salt water (3. 0 % NaCl). It was clarified that {{the values of the}} cumulative ratio changed complexly under various conditions, involving the magnitude of stresses, stress sequences and environments. It was pointed out from the experimental examination that the behaviour of the maximum crack length on the specimen surface is useful for evaluation of fatigue damage. The maximum crack length during fatigue was deduced by using the statistics of extremes and approximating the distribution of crack lengths by three-parameter Weibull distribution. The cumulative damage rule for two-step fatigue was introduced theoretically by regarding fatigue damage as the maximum crack length obtained from the statistical properties of distributed cracks on the smooth specimen surface...|$|R
25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a <b>smooth,</b> continuous line. <b>Rotary</b> cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|R
