5000|$|STTD {{is one of}} {{numerous}} open loop transmit diversity schemes which also include Phase Switched Transmit Diversity (PSTD), Time Switched Diversity (TSTD), Orthogonal Transmit Diversity (OTD) and Space Time Spreading (STS) 1. The aim {{of all of these}} schemes is to smooth the Rayleigh fading and drop out effects observed when using only a single antenna at both ends of a radio link in a Multipath propagation environment. Diversity improves link reliability for each user over time, especially near cell edges (in the absence of <b>soft</b> <b>handoff),</b> and also the average performance of an ensemble of users at any particular instant. Not being reliant on slow channel-state feedback from the mobile (i.e. user equipment) means that open loop STTD is almost immune to Doppler shifts associated with high UE speeds and is the preferred method for this scenario. However, an open loop transmit diversity scheme must not degrade performance for a user close to the base station where the channels may be line of sight and nearly ideal. Since STTD is an orthogonal coding system this is also guaranteed.|$|E

Some important characteristics of the cellular configuration in <b>soft</b> <b>handoff</b> systems are used to propose a new design of efficient call admission control (CAC) in CDMA systems. Then, the paper constructs a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model for CAC in CDMA with a <b>soft</b> <b>handoff</b> queue, obtains closed-form solutions, and thus develops loss formulas as performance indices {{such as the new}} blocking probability and the handoff dropping probability. In order to determine handoff traffic arrival rate, a fixed-point strategy is developed.

A new <b>soft</b> <b>handoff</b> scheme—eliminating pseudo handoff calls (EPHC) —is proposed to improve channel utilization efficiency based on mobility information.

40|$|A {{workflow}} {{is a team}} process {{since many}} actors work on various tasks to complete an instance. Resource management in such workflows deals with assignment of tasks to workers or actors. In team formation, {{it is necessary to}} ensure that members of a team are compatible with each other. When a workflow instance of, say, an insurance claim (or a surgery) process is performed, the handoffs between successive tasks are often soft as opposed to hard, and actors who perform successive tasks in this process instance must cooperate. If they cooperate well, it can improve quality and increase throughput of the instance. In general, the degree of required cooperation between a pair of tasks varies and this should be captured by a model. This paper develops a model to capture the compatibility between actors while assigning tasks in a workflow to a group of actors. The model is tested through a simulation and the results from a greedy algorithm are compared with optimal results. A technique for computing the compatibility matrix is given and used for an empirical validation from a real execution log.

The information rates and the transmit power levels of the users are not dictated by the base stations.

In the hard handover case, for which there is a unique stable Nash equilibrium, we determine the selfish repartition of the users between the base stations and then we assess its social efficiency, which is measured in terms of sum-rate. In the soft handover case, the problem consists in determining the optimum selfish power allocation for each user and analyzing its sum-rate efficiency with respect to the equivalent virtual K £ S multiple input multiple output (MIMO) network.

Given the highly scalable nature of DHTs, the ability to efficiently tap the storage resources of so many devices is very attractive. Unfortunately DHTs have been having a difficult time finding a foothold on mobile devices due to poor performance, {{both in terms of}} network overhead and lookup failure. Much of the research that has been done attributes this poor performance to the extra hops packets must make due to the mismatch between the physical topology and the DHT overlay. This research has attempted to bring the logical overlay in line with the physical network {{to reduce the number of}} unnecessary hops each packet must make. A large amount of sophisticated and fascinating research has been done to match the physical and logical layers to alleviate this problem. While that mismatch is certainly important, another oft-ignored aspect of the problem is churn caused by changing IP addresses. This paper will present a survey of potential changes to the Chord algorithm (and eventually the network stack) to ameliorate the disruption that changing IP addresses have on the overlay. The first change this paper presents is simply to use the MAC address of the node as a unique identifier instead of the IP address as suggested in the original Chord paper. This allows the node to transition to a new IP address without fear of its key space changing. The next change is to the access point handoff process, where a callback was inserted into the MAC layer of the network stack to allow the Chord application to be notified of a pending access point transition and what its new address will be (termed softish handoff for the purposes of this paper). Finally several transition scenarios are detailed and tested in this paper including: traditional Chord with the IP address used as the identifier (used as a baseline); using the MAC address of there wireless interface as the Chord identifier; broadcasting the new address to associated nodes; removing and reinserting the node on IP change; an implementation of IPMN to keep the TCP connections alive even in the face of rapidly changing IP addresses (this strategy also broadcasts the new IP address to associated nodes that do not have open TCP connections). It is important to note that the focus of this thesis is to address is the disruption that changing IP addresses have on the application level overlay. Softish handoffs were implemented to facilitate this but are not intended to be a replacement of or improvement over <b>soft</b> <b>handoffs</b> provided by CDMA enabled cell networks. The unique id, new address broadcasting and IPMN based socket transitions should have similar effects in an environment with real <b>soft</b> <b>handoffs,</b> assuming there is some notification of a new access point being available. It is also not the purpose of this thesis to present a more efficient implementation of Chord, only to compare strategies for dealing with IP address transition...|$|R

Although the system design rules and operating procedures for voice services (i. e., IS- 95 A services) are well established and understood, with the launch of cdma 2000 1 x high-rate data service worldwide in year 2002, these rules and procedures need to be re-examined. We have built a complete 3 G cdma 2000 1 x cellular simulator, which simulates the physical layer using Signal Processing WorkSystem (SPW) and networking layers using OPNET Modeler, to investigate various design issues of cdma 2000 1 x networks. In this paper, we perform system design trade-off study for supporting <b>soft</b> <b>handoff</b> for packet data calls using cdma 2000 1 x cellular simulator. <b>Soft</b> <b>handoff</b> provides diversity for the link (switched diversity for the reverse link and combined diversity for the forward link); as a result, the link quality can be improved. However, <b>soft</b> <b>handoff</b> also introduces overhead on the forward link; specifically transmit power, channel element and Walsh code. As a result, the <b>soft</b> <b>handoff</b> regions in IS- 95 A networks must be engineered to achieve a delicate balance between call quality and network capacity. <b>Soft</b> <b>handoff</b> has always been performed for voice calls (in both IS- 95 A and cdma 2000 1 x networks) to enhance the call quality {{with the understanding that}} there would be some degradation of the forward link capacity. However, this design rule needs to be reexamined for data calls since the QOS requirement for data calls is different from that for voice calls.
