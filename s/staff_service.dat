25|$|Considered {{a member}} of the {{informal}} faction of young officers insisting on reforming the Polish Army in exile into a highly trained specialized force rather than cannon fodder, Kalenkiewicz co-authored several memorials urging the Polish authorities to reform the standard infantry units into airborne units capable of both armed reconnaissance and diversion, and possible help in the envisioned all-national uprising in the German-occupied country. One of such memorials made Kalenkiewicz noted by Gen. Władysław Sikorski, who in October 1941 moved him to <b>staff</b> <b>service</b> in the newly established Airborne Training and Studies detachment of the Polish General Staff. One of the direct outcomes of the group's activities was the creation of the Polish 1st Independent Airborne Brigade under Gen. Stanisław Sosabowski. Kalenkiewicz also volunteered to be transported to occupied Poland and help the Home Army.|$|E

25|$|The republican {{reform of}} the Army {{implemented}} between January and May 1911 did not changed deeply {{the organization of the}} last years of the Monarchy, the changes being specially the honors, disciplinary and conscription systems, with the transformation of a mainly professional army into a mainly militia army. Notable changes in the organization included the increase of the number of divisions and regiments, the extinction of the traditional caçadores units, the creation of independent units of machineguns (being part of the infantry, but organized in batteries as the artillery) and the subdivision of the artillery arm in two almost separate branches (the field artillery and the foot artillery, this last being mainly a weapon engineering and technical branch, but being also responsible for the operation of the heavy guns of the garrison and coastal artillery). By this organization, the Metropolitan Army included the general officers, the <b>Staff</b> <b>Service,</b> the several arms and services (the engineering, artillery, cavalry and infantry arms, the military health, military veterinary and military administration services, the military secretariat and the auxiliary staffs), the Army general services (War Secretariat, Army Staff, headquarters and military territorial commands, military courts and justice, military schools, retirees companies and military invalids asylum) and the services of the Lisbon Entrenched Camp. The Army troops included the active troops, the reserve troops and the territorial troops. The active troops included eight divisions (each with four infantry regiments, one machinegun batteries group, one mounted artillery regiment and a cavalry regiment) and a cavalry brigade (with three cavalry regiments), plus non-divisionary engineering troops (eight companies of sappers-miners, eight divisionary sections of bridges, eight sections of floodlights, ten sections of field telegraphists, one bridge park, one wireless telegraph company, one balloon company, one railway companies group and one fortress telegraphists company, the majority of these units being administratively grouped in two sappers-miners and one pontoneers battalions), artillery troops (two mountain artillery regiments, one horse batteries group, two howitzers batteries groups and three independent mountain batteries), infantry troops (three infantry regiments and three independent machinegun companies), health service troops (eight health companies, administratively grouped in three companies groups) and military administration troops (eight supply companies and eight transportation companies, grouped in three military administration companies groups).|$|E

2500|$|Across {{the first}} seven years, since the entry into force of the Stability and Growth Pact, all EU Member States were {{required}} to strive towards a common MTO being [...] "to achieve a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus over a complete business cycle - while providing a safety margin towards continuously respecting the government's 3% deficit limit". The {{first part of this}} MTO, was interpreted by the Commission <b>Staff</b> <b>Service</b> to mean continuously achievement each year throughout the business cycle of a [...] "cyclically-adjusted budget balance net of one-off and temporary measures" [...] (also referred to as the [...] "structural balance") at minimum 0.0%. In 2000, the second part was interpreted and operationalized into a calculation formula for the MTO also to respect the so-called [...] "Minimal Benchmark" [...] (later referred to as [...] "MTO Minimum Benchmark"). When assessing the annual Convergence/Stability programmes of the Member States, the Commission <b>Staff</b> <b>Service</b> checked whether the structural balance of the state complied with both the common [...] "close to balance or surplus" [...] criteria and the country-specific [...] "Minimal Benchmark" [...] criteria. The last round under this assessment scheme took place in Spring 2005, while all subsequent assessments were conducted according to a new reformed scheme - introducing the concept of a single country-specific MTO as the overall steering anchor for the fiscal policy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958 the {{historian}} [...] {{published a book}} entitled [...] "Generalstabsdienst an der Front und in der O.H.L." [...] ("General <b>Staff</b> <b>Service</b> on the frontline and in the Army High Command"). [...] The book consisted of extracts from Thaer's diaries and from his letters (mostly addressed to his wife) written during the First World War, to which Kaehler added his own commentary. [...] Kaehler had the greatest difficulty in persuading Thaer to allow {{the publication of his}} diaries and letters: [...] in the end he agreed to publication provided it should take place only after his death. [...] (His wife predeceased him by sixteen years.) [...] Thaer's position at the heart of power in the German army during the final part of the war, and his open-minded attitude bordering, sometimes, on criticism regarding the decisions of the army leadership mean that his records are excellent sources for historians re-evaluating the First World War. [...] There have been critics who pointed out that the need for secrecy meant that even in his diaries he could not record the actual proceedings of the General Staff meetings. [...] But taken in combination with the known attitudes and judgements expressed by the principal protagonists, Ludendorff, Hindenburg and the Kaiser during the end phase of the already lost war, they provide evidence for motivations and imputed culpabilities, and they offer valuable insights into the origins of the destructively toxic [...] "Dolchstoß" [...] legend.|$|E

[...] "I sent home a strong {{recommendation}} {{that he should be}} promoted, when he was last here, and received an intimation three days ago that he had been gazetted lieutenant and transferred to my staff. This time I shall simply, send home a copy of the report he has furnished me with, and that of Colonel Wilberforce, and say that I leave the reports to speak for themselves, but that in my opinion it is a case altogether exceptional. That is all I can do now. The question of course is, whether he shall return to <b>staff</b> <b>service</b> again, or shall continue in command of the corps with which he has done so much. If he does the latter he must have local rank, otherwise he would be liable to be overruled by any Portuguese officer of superior rank. I think that the best way would be to send a copy of the reports to Lord Beresford, saying that my opinion is very strong that Lieutenant O'Connor should be allowed to retain an independent command of the corps that he has raised and disciplined; and that I will either myself bestow local rank upon him, and treat the corps as forming a part of the British army, like that of Trant, or that he should give him local rank as its colonel, in which case he would operate still independently, but in connection with Beresford's own force." ...|$|E
