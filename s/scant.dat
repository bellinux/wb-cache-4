5|$|All of Kafka's {{published}} works, except some {{letters he}} wrote in Czech to Milena Jesenská, were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted <b>scant</b> public attention.|$|E
5|$|Although Rossier's time in Japan {{was brief}} and the {{surviving}} photographic legacy of his sojourn is <b>scant,</b> he nevertheless had a lasting impact on photography in the country.|$|E
5|$|Although ancient air wells are {{mentioned}} in some sources, there is <b>scant</b> evidence for them, and persistent belief in their existence {{has the character}} of a modern myth.|$|E
5|$|Nai Talim evolved {{out of his}} {{experiences}} at the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, and Gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the Sevagram ashram after 1937. Nehru government's vision of an industrialised, centrally planned economy after 1947 had <b>scant</b> place for Gandhi's village-oriented approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} <b>scant</b> evidence of Mesolithic life in Orkney, but the later assemblage of houses and monumental Neolithic {{structures in the}} archipelago is without parallel in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Wormshill's {{location}} remains rural. Because {{of geography}} and restrictions on development, {{building in the}} village has been <b>scant</b> since the 1960s and 1970s. In 1821, the parish contained only 26 dwellings: by 2001, {{the total number of}} houses had risen to 82.|$|E
5|$|A 16th-century water gate in {{the eastern}} wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to {{the shore of the}} loch. The {{adjacent}} buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is the base of a doocot (pigeon house) and the <b>scant</b> remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.|$|E
5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given <b>scant</b> attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{the early}} {{occupation}} of Ditton is <b>scant.</b> A Mesolithic tranchet axe, a sharpening flake, three microliths and 36 blades were found at Ditton, but the exact site of the find is now unknown. Mesolithic flint implements, Iron Age pottery and pit dwellings have also {{been reported in the}} Holt Hill area of Ditton.|$|E
5|$|Green Archaeoastronomy {{is named}} after {{the cover of the}} book Archaeoastronomy in the Old World. It is based {{primarily}} on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively <b>scant</b> compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is <b>scant,</b> mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which were invented nearly {{as soon as the}} horse was domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Jacques I {{assumed the}} name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French {{aristocracy}} showed <b>scant</b> respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.|$|E
5|$|Pemex {{disallowed}} {{release of}} specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo present their results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference. That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted <b>scant</b> attention. Coincidentally, many experts in impact craters and the K–Pg boundary were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield {{had plenty of}} geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{record for}} this period is {{relatively}} <b>scant,</b> although improving. Toponymy provides significant {{information about the}} Scandinavian presence and examples of Norse runes provide further useful evidence. There is a significant corpus of material from the Gaelic oral tradition that relates to this period, but its value is questionable.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} disaster {{occurred in}} southern Haiti, where {{as many as}} 2,000 people died, possibly more. The towns of Jacmel and Jérémie—both on the Tiburon Peninsula—were devastated by catastrophic freshwater flooding after days of torrential rains. The entire peninsula, already remote in its own right, was isolated for a time, ensuring only <b>scant</b> detail of the disaster reached the outside world. Information was initially relayed to {{the capital city of}} Port-au-Prince by a single aircraft.|$|E
5|$|There is {{also the}} presumed site of a chapel near MacLean's Point (just east of the landing place) where an incised cross, {{tentatively}} dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries was found. Archaeological evidence of the Norse presence in the Hebrides is <b>scant,</b> but boat shaped stone settings found {{not far from the}} chapel may be graves from this period of occupation.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>scant</b> archaeological {{evidence}} for the spread of Buddhism from the Kushan Empire into Iran proper. However, it is known from Chinese sources that An Shigao (fl. 2nd century AD), a Parthian nobleman and Buddhist monk, traveled to Luoyang in Han China as a Buddhist missionary and translated several Buddhist canons into Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received <b>scant</b> attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Diolkos at Corinth, there is <b>scant</b> {{literary}} evidence {{for two more}} ship trackways by that name in antiquity, both in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius (c. 320–400AD) records two passages from his 1st centuryAD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria {{which may have been}} located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his trackway.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the fossil record of insects is <b>scant,</b> including beetles from the Lower Triassic. However, there are a few exceptions, such as in Eastern Europe. At the Babiy Kamen site in the Kuznetsk Basin, numerous beetle fossils were discovered, including entire specimens of the infraorders Archostemata (e.g. Ademosynidae, Schizocoleidae), Adephaga (e.g., Triaplidae, Trachypachidae) and Polyphaga (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Byrrhidae, Elateroidea). However, species from the families Cupedidae and Schizophoroidae are not present at this site, whereas they dominate at other fossil sites from the Lower Triassic. Further records are known from Khey-Yaga, Russia, in the Korotaikha Basin.|$|E
5|$|Chocolatier is {{a casual}} {{strategy}} video game with action game elements, developed by Big Splash Games {{and published by}} PlayFirst. The game was released as a download on May 1, 2007 and was followed by CD-ROM release on September 27, 2007. Players {{assume the role of}} a young Chocolatier, who must navigate 14 cities around the globe while buying ingredients, manufacturing chocolates, and selling them to chocolate shops. Two modes of play are available: in story mode the player must rebuild an almost bankrupt chocolate empire and acquire 64 chocolate recipes from around the world; in free mode players start out with <b>scant</b> resources and must become successful chocolatiers.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is <b>scant.</b> What is known is that {{the crew of the}} ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that displayed the Silver Line on an unofficial map that resembled the current version, but with thin lines. The interplay between Metro's unofficial proposal {{and those of}} other designers received attention in a number of press outlets. A poster displaying a map of similar design has been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received <b>scant</b> attention until 2008. Wyman, one of the original designers of the map, was confirmed as the layout specialist who would be redesigning the map by the Washington Post on June 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the <b>scant</b> details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is <b>scant</b> in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though <b>scant,</b> supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} Apatosaurus have been {{designated}} from <b>scant</b> material. Marsh named as many species as he could, {{which resulted in}} many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005 Paul Upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of Apatosaurus. They found that A.louisae was the most basal species, followed by FMNHP25112, and then a polytomy of A.ajax, A.parvus, and A.excelsus. Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the relationships of Apatosaurus slightly differently, and also supported separating Brontosaurus from Apatosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The Andean condor is {{the only}} {{accepted}} living species of its genus, Vultur. Unlike the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of , the fossil record of the Andean condor recovered to date is <b>scant.</b> Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, {{may have been a}} smaller palaeosubspecies, V. gryphus patruus.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine territories, {{held back}} by their closed economies, {{the lack of any}} {{activity}} closely linked to foreign trade, and the <b>scant</b> amounts of labour and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.|$|E
5|$|The castle, {{situated}} on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, {{is one of}} the largest in Scotland in area. It was approached from the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle were laid out around two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-story Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises the <b>scant</b> remains of earlier buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} British {{deployment}} into the Adriatic came in May 1808, when the frigate HMS Unite under Captain Patrick Campbell arrived off Venice. During May, Campbell severely disrupted French and Italian shipping off the busiest Adriatic seaport and captured three ships sent against {{him by the}} Italian Navy. The French response to these depredations was to despatch the small frigate Var to Venice, an action which {{had little effect on}} British operations. British activity in the Adriatic was however curtailed during the year by the British war with the Ottoman Empire, which absorbed the <b>scant</b> British naval resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>scant</b> {{record of}} the ship's {{movements}} under any of her later names. The Los Angeles Times reports her arrival at West Coast ports as Seisho Maru at least twice. In March 1930, the ship arrived at Tacoma, Washington, from Singapore {{to pick up a}} load of logs for export. Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinctive}} timber building traditions {{found their}} confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was {{the practice of}} log building with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique {{thought to have been}} imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. The other was the stave building tradition (typically found in stave churches), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric long houses that had roof-bearing posts dug into the ground. Although there is <b>scant</b> archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the Oseberg ship) suggest significant mastery of woodworking and engineering. In the Lofoten archipelago in Northern Norway, a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the Lofotr Viking Museum.|$|E
5|$|William Etty {{was born}} in 1787, {{the son of a}} York baker and miller. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, {{publisher}} of local newspaper the Hull Packet. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London, with the intention of becoming a history painter {{in the tradition of the}} Old Masters. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he submitted paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received <b>scant</b> attention when exhibited.|$|E

5|$|Alfred John Shout {{was born}} in Wellington, New Zealand, on 8 August 1882. He was the eldest of nine {{children}} to an English-born father, John Richard Shout, and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (née Kelly, formerly McGovern). Information on Alfred Shout's early life is rather <b>scant</b> and the details differ between sources, but according to his First World War attestation form he was privately educated. In early 1900, Shout travelled to South Africa with his elder half-brother, William McGovern. The brothers sought to join one of the colonial contingents then engaged in the Second Boer War; Alfred enlisted in the newly raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (using the surname Shout) found a place in Bethune's Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was an irregular colonial force formed in eastern Cape Colony, and Shout was allotted to the unit's No.1 Company with the service number 9216.|$|E
