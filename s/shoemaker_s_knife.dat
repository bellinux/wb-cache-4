40|$|A seismic {{isolation}} {{system for the}} proposed 'Advanced LIGO' detector upgrade is under development. It consists of a two-stage in-vacuum active isolation platform that is supported by an external hydraulic actuation stage. A full-scale preliminary-design technology demonstrator of the in-vacuum platform has been assembled and is being tested at Stanford's engineering test facility. Unanticipated excess ground motion from local human activity at LIGO Livingston has prompted accelerated development of the external stage for installation and use in the initial Livingston detector. As an interim measure, active external isolation in the laser beam direction is implemented using existing PZT external actuators.

40|$|An {{essential}} step in {{the life}} cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is integration of a DNA copy of the viral RNA into the genome of the infected cell. We show here that this step can be faithfully accomplished in vitro by the enzymatic machinery of another retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). Mini-HIV substrates, which are linearized plasmids with long terminal repeat sequences at their ends, were incubated with cytoplasmic extracts of MoMLV-infected NIH 3 T 3 cells and target DNA. The MoMLV integration apparatus carried out integration of the mini-HIV substrates correctly; the terminal nucleotides of the viral substrate were removed, and a 4 -base-pair duplication of the target DNA flanked the inserted viral DNA (C. <b>Shoemaker,</b> <b>S.</b> P. Goff, E. Gilboa, M. Paskind, S. W. Mitra, and D. Baltimore, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 : 3932 - 3936, 1980). Our experiments show that the substrate sequence requirements for integration in vitro were limited to a few nucleotides, as the similarity between HIV and MoMLV long terminal repeat ends is minimal...|$|R
