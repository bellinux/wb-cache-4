5|$|Following these events, Bourassa {{proclaimed that}} a {{referendum}} would occur in 1992, with either sovereignty {{or a new}} Constitutional agreement as the subject. This prompted a national referendum on the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> that included the proposals of Meech Lake as well as concerns of the broader Canadian federation. The Accord failed in Quebec and English Canada.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> to the {{sporting}} regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) {{to be released from}} the queue before the car returns to pit lane, allowing the drivers to unlap themselves and to ensure a clean restart.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> {{exempted}} {{important issues}} from {{any sort of}} arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

5|$|Trudeau's {{successor}} as Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, and Quebec Liberal premier Robert Bourassa {{sought a}} series of Constitutional amendments designed to address Quebec's concerns. In {{what became known as}} the Meech Lake Accord, the Federal government and all provincial premiers agreed to a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> that decentralized some powers and recognized Quebec as forming a distinct society. The Accord, after fierce debate in English Canada, fell apart in dramatic fashion in the summer of 1990, prompting outrage in Quebec and a surge in support for sovereignty. While the Accord was collapsing, Lucien Bouchard, a cabinet minister in Mulroney's government, led a coalition of Progressive Conservative and Liberal members of parliament from Quebec to form a new federal party devoted to Quebec sovereignty, the Bloc Québécois.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, {{securing}} {{his first}} full, six-year {{term in the}} Senate. Newly elected President John F. Kennedy– Cooper's former Senate colleague– chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi. Following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War, consistently advocating negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church on a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, McCreary was re-elected to {{the state}} House without opposition. In the {{upcoming}} legislative session, the major question {{was expected to be}} the Cincinnati Southern Railway's request for authorization to build a track connecting Cincinnati, Ohio, with either Knoxville or Chattanooga, Tennessee, through Central Kentucky. The action was opposed by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, a bitter rival of the Cincinnati line. Appeals to the General Assembly to oppose the bill on grounds that an out-of-state corporation should not be granted a charter in the state were successful in 1869 and 1870, and an attempt by the federal Congress to grant the charter was defeated by states' rights legislators there. Moreover, newly elected governor Preston Leslie had opposed a bill granting Cincinnati Southern's request {{when he was in the}} state Senate in 1869. In the lead-up to the 1871 session, frustrated Central Kentuckians threatened to defect from the Democratic Party in future elections if the bill were not passed in the session. Supporters of Cincinnati Southern won a victory when McCreary, a staunch supporter of the bill to grant the line's request, was elected Speaker of the House. After approval of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> designed to give Kentucky courts some jurisdiction in cases involving the line and the Kentucky General Assembly some measure of control over the line's activities, the bill passed the House by a vote of 59–38. The vote in the Senate resulted in a 19–19 tie; President Pro Tem John G. Carlisle—a native of Covington, through which the proposed line would pass—cast the deciding vote in favor of approving Cincinnati Southern's request. With the will of the people clearly expressed through the legislature, Governor Leslie did not employ his gubernatorial veto. McCreary was again returned to the House without opposition in 1873 and was again chosen Speaker of the House during his term.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} of his predecessors, budget matters {{occupied}} a major portion of Brown's time. During the 1976 campaign, Carter criticized Defense spending levels of the Ford administration and promised cuts in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion. Shortly after he became secretary, Brown suggested a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> to Ford's proposed FY 1978 budget, having the effect of cutting it by almost $3 billion, but still allowing a Total Obligational Authority (TOA) increase of more than $8 billion over the FY 1977 budget. Subsequent budgets under Brown moved generally upward, reflecting high prevailing rates of inflation, the need to strengthen and modernize conventional forces neglected somewhat {{since the end of the}} Vietnam War, and serious challenges in the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1989, the U.S. Congress {{passed a}} <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{amendments}}</b> to the Clean Air Act. Title IV of these amendments established the Acid Rain Program, a {{cap and trade}} system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO2 emissions from power plants. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.|$|E

However, the governor was given {{more control over the}} process in which he previously had none. Another amendment removed the ban on consecutive terms, allowing Indiana's first consecutive term governors in over one hundred years. A third amendment granted the power to prepare a budget to a State Budgetary Agency, which was run by officials appointed by the governor. The significant authority this gave the governor over the budget was the [...] "greatest transfer of power" [...] to the governor yet, according to historian and professor of political science Linda Gugin.|$|E

[...] On September 22 Sifton announced new management of the AG agreeable to the bondholders, the government, and the banks. [...] The Conservatives protested that other companies were prepared to construct the railroad for less than the sum agreed on with the A, to which Sifton replied that the Privy Council's ruling meant that the government could not use the money raised to deal with any other company. [...] The Conservatives filibustered the legislation and moved a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> (including one calling for the scheme to be put to referendum), but the Liberals voted unanimously in its favour.

[...] Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC) retorted that the bill would lead to [...] "despotism and tyranny", and Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC) argued that the bill was unconstitutional because it deprived states of their right under [...] to establish voter qualifications and because the bill's special provisions targeted only certain jurisdictions. On May 6, Ervin offered an amendment to abolish the coverage formula's automatic trigger and instead allow federal judges to appoint federal examiners to administer voter registration. This amendment overwhelmingly failed, with 42 Democrats and 22 Republicans voting against it. After lengthy debate, Ted Kennedy's amendment to prohibit poll taxes also failed 49-45 on May 11. However, the Senate agreed to include a provision authorizing the Attorney General to sue any jurisdiction, covered or non-covered, to challenge its use of poll taxes. An amendment offered by Senator Robert Kennedy (D-NY) to enfranchise English-illiterate citizens who had attained at least a sixth-grade education in a non-English-speaking school also passed by 48-19.
