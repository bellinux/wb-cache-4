He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him. <b>Sikhism,</b> to Gandhi, {{was an integral part}} of Hinduism, in the form of another reform movement. Sikh and Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as a difference of opinion.|$|E

50|$|As the 19th century {{drew to a}} close, untouchables such as the Mazhabis {{were still}} denied equal access to the gurdwara (places of worship) by their fellow Sikhs and {{during the early years}} of the 20th century members of the Arya Samaj tried to {{capitalise}} on this in their attempts to reconvert those groups to Hinduism.

5|$|The Indian subcontinent {{was home}} to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd {{millennium}} BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and <b>Sikhism</b> emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.|$|E
5000|$|The {{violence}} in Delhi {{was triggered by}} the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards who responded to her authorisation of the military operation. The Indian government reported 2,700 deaths in the ensuing chaos. In {{the aftermath of the}} riots, the government reported that 20,000 had fled the city; the People's Union for Civil Liberties reported [...] "at least" [...] 1,000 displaced persons. The most-affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods of Delhi. Human rights organisations and newspapers across India believed that the massacre was organised. The collusion of political officials in the violence and judicial failure to penalise the perpetrators alienated Sikhs and increased support for the Khalistan movement. The Akal Takht, <b>Sikhism's</b> governing body, considers the killings genocide.|$|R
50|$|Before 1984 Dr. Aulakh had no {{political}} involvement - either in Punjab {{or in the}} United States. All that changed when in June of 1984 the Indian Army attacked <b>Sikhism's</b> holiest shrine, the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar. The objective was to destroy the Sikh militants that were demanding more political autonomy for Punjab and the Sikhs and had turned portions of the temple complex into fortified positions in expectations of an attack. Large scale mayhem resulted and the Indian Government, led by Indira Gandhi, also attacked with the army tens of other Sikh gurdwaras throughout Punjab. All of Punjab was put under martial law and all communications were cut off. Thousands of Sikhs were killed {{and tens of thousands}} were imprisoned without due process during this campaign - named officially as Operation Bluestar by the Indian government. This inflamed the Sikhs everywhere and demand for an autonomous Sikh Homeland, a concept that had been around since the partition of Punjab in 1947, gained much greater support almost overnight.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second reason}} was {{attempts}} {{made by the}} then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi to use Bhindranwale to undermine the Akali Dal (Eternal Party), a political party. The strategy backfired when 13 Sikhs in Amritsars {{were killed in a}} clash between Sikhs and Nirankaris. They were holding [...] a demonstration against the Nirankaris who with the permission of the then government holding a peaceful Congressional [...] "Samagam" [...] at the event of Baisakhi. Such a clash took violent shape and a total of 13 lives were lost. According to the government, Bhindranwale and his followers became a source of disruption and mayhem, but a secret 3rd agency was also working to make Punjab situation unstable {{at the behest of the}} Government. Bhindranwale gained a lot of support from the Sikhs, rural Sikhs especially, because they felt alienated from the Indian government. Their disruptions became so bad that in 1984, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to flush out Bhindranwale and his followers who were in the Harimandir Sahib complex, <b>Sikhism's</b> most holy shrine, in Amritsar. The operation undertaken by the army was codenamed Operation Blue Star. Most Sikhs militants inside the complex were killed and the Akal Takht was bombed.|$|R
