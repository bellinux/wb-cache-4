That night, Archer dreams {{that he is}} attacked by Reptilians, and Hernandez tries to help him {{come to terms with}} his memories and new-found adulation.

25|$|When Peggy awakes, {{she finds}} herself back {{in the spring of}} 1960, her senior year of high school, after she passed out after {{donating}} blood in the school gym (where the reunion was). She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings are the way they were 25 years before.

25|$|When the manga began serialization, Arakawa was {{considering}} several major plot points, including the ending. She wanted the Elric brothers to recover their bodiesat least partly. As the plot continued, {{she thought that}} some characters were maturing and decided to change some scenes. Arakawa said the manga authors Suihō Tagawa and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations for her character designs; she describes her artwork as a mix of both of them. She found that the easiest of the series's characters to draw were Alex Louis Armstrong, and the little animals. Arakawa likes dogs so she included several {{of them in the}} story. Arakawa made comedy central to the manga's story because <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimize sad scenes.|$|E

25|$|It is {{just before}} dawn. Four priests are {{mourning}} {{the death of}} King Séthos. They wish he had died an honourable death in battle, but the terrible truth {{is that he was}} murdered by the brother he loved. Dawn breaks as Queen Nephté arrives with her young son to pay tribute to her dead husband. Nephté says that it is only the thought of her child which keeps her alive, otherwise life is barren for her without Séthos. She asks the priests to reveal who killed him. When the arrival of her brother-in-law Pharès is announced, the priests are horrified and Nephté begins to suspect he is the murderer. Pharès tries to flatter Nephté. He also claims it was Séthos' dying wish that he should become her new husband. Nephté admits this is true but <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> wrong to talk of marriage while Séthos is still unavenged. However, Pharès seems reluctant to search for the assassin, but at Nephté's insistence he finally agrees to swear on his brother's tomb that he will bring the criminal to justice. The priests are shocked at this sacrilege. After Pharès has left, the chief priest Amédès reveals what Nephté has suspected: Pharès is the killer. Nephté demands vengeance, but she also fears for her son's safety. Amédès agrees to hide the boy among the tombs. He says {{it will be difficult to}} get revenge because Pharès is both respected and feared by the Egyptians. The temple opens as the statesmen and common people arrive for Séthos' funeral rites. The temple girls reveal that Sethos is now an immortal in heaven. Nephté implores the Egyptians to avenge her husband. They swear on the altar to do so. Amédès says he will reveal the murderer's name that evening.|$|E

500|$|Cindy begins helping Darren plan {{his wedding}} to girlfriend Nancy. Waring felt Cindy's {{feelings}} had been [...] "reawakened" [...] through this storyline, adding {{that they never}} [...] "fully went away". Waring opined that Darren asking Cindy to help plan his wedding made her feel [...] "needed and wanted". Waring felt that Cindy does not plan to split Darren and Nancy up but that there is [...] "a little part of [...] that thinks, 'Surely he's going to choose me?" [...] Waring added that when Cindy is trying on wedding dresses for Nancy Cindy thinks [...] "that it should be her". Cindy attempts to kiss Darren which Waring said is [...] "the worst possible thing she could have done, because <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> means something but Darren thinks otherwise". Dawson said Darren is no longer interested in Cindy. Waring said Darren telling Cindy {{she will have to}} let him go leaves her [...] "devastated". Waring added that when Cindy realises how much Darren likes Nancy she says [...] "that if Nancy is who Darren wants, then she'll just have to accept it". Dawson felt that Darren's relationship with Cindy was [...] "just sex", adding that [...] "it was more of a raw attraction rather than something that would work well in the long-term". Dawson added that it was good to revisit the relationship as the pair have been through a lot together. He added that since his relationship with Cindy [...] "Darren has matured ... Their recent goodbye scene was a great one to bring a bit of closure to what they had".|$|E

She's so puzzled; I believe <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it's</b> my duty to go and do something immoral. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it's</b> immoral that I should marry her brother; but, after all, that isn't immoral enough.

2500|$|Beauvoir {{writes that}} [...] "mystery" [...] is {{prominent}} among men's myths about women. She also writes that mystery {{is not confined}} by sex to women but instead by situation, and that it pertains to any slave. <b>She</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> disappeared during the eighteenth century when men however briefly considered women to be peers. She quotes Arthur Rimbaud, who writes that hopefully one day, women can become fully human beings when man gives her her freedom.|$|E
2500|$|I {{never saw}} anyone like Mrs Simeon as a talker {{and manager of}} {{everything}} and everybody. She has managed her own servants all {{out of the house}} already and changed some of the new ones ... When she wants a new servant, instead of it being a perfectly simply open affair, there is as much intrigue about it as about any secret piece of diplomacy. She is of course unpopular and drags him into her affairs too, and then <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is all [...] "the Colony".|$|E

She lives entirely in the present, not even for today, but in the moment. Clara is the total nonconformist. What she wants she gets, if she can. What she desires to do she does. She has a big heart, a {{remarkable}} brain, and the most utter contempt for the world in general. Time doesn't exist for her, except that <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> will stop tomorrow. She has real courage, because she lives boldly. Who are we, after all, to say she is wrong? ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Phillips holds {{a dinner}} for adults, {{inviting}} Cope to pair with {{the daughter of}} a banking family. Cope disappoints her, reacting to the presence of prominent elders with [...] "a caution that almost became expressiveness."(119) Cope takes ill, nearly faints, and fears he has appeared a weakling. At Mrs. Phillips' insistence he spends the night: [...] "he felt greatly subordinated; he wished that he might have capitulated to a man."(126) When Cope and Amy walk to campus in the morning, <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a privilege...curtailed much too soon,"(129) while he would rather have walked alone. Foster's reaction to Cope's fainting is [...] "as if a shaping ideal had dissipated. Or as if a trace of weakness in one seemingly so young and strong was not altogether unacceptable as a source of consolation."(129) ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Jennifer {{returns to}} Salem after {{receiving}} the news that her grandmother, Alice Horton, is very ill and does not have much time left.

While in Salem, Jennifer tries to provide guidance to Bo and Hope, inferring that <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is best if they reconcile. She also gets to reunite with her old friend, Carly Manning, who she had not seen in years. Jennifer leaves Salem after Alice's funeral and after an altercation with Vivian Alamain, and returns to London to be with her family. She, however, returns to Salem in November of that same year to help Hope, who was in prison after confessing to the Salem Muggings.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{critical}} {{topic is}} to address various {{objects in the}} book and the characters' relationships with them, such as Rebecca's diamonds or the piano Amelia values when <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> came from George and dismisses upon learning that Dobbin provided it. Marxist and similar schools of criticism that go further and see Thackeray condemning consumerism and capitalism, however, largely overstate their case. Thackeray is pointed in his criticism of the commodification of women in the marriage market, but his variations on Ecclesiastes's [...] "all is vanity" [...] are more personal than institutional. He also has broad sympathy with a measure of comfort and financial and physical [...] "snugness". At one point, the narrator even makes a [...] "robust defense of his lunch": [...] "It is all vanity to be sure: but who will not own to liking a little of it? I should like to know what well-constituted mind, merely because it is transitory, dislikes roast-beef?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 May 2009, Emina's third studio album Vila (Fairy) was {{released}} through PGP RTS. She dedicated this album to her late grandfather, Adam.

The track [...] "Ne zaboravi" [...] featured a back-up vocal by the famous Turkish pop singer İzel.

The song also won the award for Best Song in the Balkans from Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2009 at the 1st Balkan Music Awards in which Emina was also nominated for Best Female Performer in the Balkans 2009 whereas her song [...] "Pile moje" [...] was among the nominees for Best Song in the Balkans from Republic of Serbia for 2009. It is also mentioned by Emina that the reason why she chooses the name Vila for the album is because <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> {{is one of the best}} songs she has ever written and that is why she wants people to pay attention to it.|$|E
