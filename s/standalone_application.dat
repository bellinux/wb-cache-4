5|$|Since GNOME 3.2 Web allows {{creating}} application launchers for web applications. The subsequent {{invocation of}} a launcher {{brings up a}} plain single instance of Web limited to one domain, with off-site links opening in a normal browser. The launcher created this way is accessible from the desktop and {{is not limited to}} GNOME Shell. For instance it may be used with Unity, used on Ubuntu. This feature facilitates the integration of the desktop and World Wide Web, which is a goal of Web's developers. Similar features {{can be found in the}} Windows version of Google Chrome. For the same purpose Mozilla Foundation previously developed a <b>standalone</b> <b>application</b> Mozilla Prism, which was superseded by the project Chromeless.|$|E
25|$|Wiki {{software}} {{is a type}} of collaborative software that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It may be implemented as a series of scripts behind an existing web server, or as a <b>standalone</b> <b>application</b> server that runs on one or more web servers. The content is stored in a file system, and changes to the content are stored in a relational database management system. A commonly implemented software package is MediaWiki, which runs Wikipedia. Alternatively, personal wikis run as a <b>standalone</b> <b>application</b> on a single computer. WikidPad is an example. One application, TiddlyWiki, simply makes use of an even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside.|$|E

25|$|For Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, {{it came in}} two flavors, one {{for home}} users {{and the other for}} {{enterprise}} use. The only difference between the two was that the latter could be configured via group policy. The home edition was bundled with MSN Toolbar, while the other was available as a <b>standalone</b> <b>application.</b> Later, when MSN Toolbar was discontinued in favor of Windows Live Toolbar, the home edition of Windows Desktop Search was discontinued as well. The last version available for Windows 2000 is Windows Desktop Search 2.66.|$|E
25|$|Also {{under the}} Piapro brand is Crypton's Piapro Studio, a Vocaloid vocal editor {{implemented}} as a VST/AU plugin bundled {{with all of}} their full V3 Vocaloid products (Miku V3, Miku V3 English, Miku V3 Bundle, Meiko V3, Kaito V3). This allows for full vocal editing functionality nearly identical in feature support to Yamaha's full Vocaloid 3 Editor software, which is available as either a <b>standalone</b> <b>application</b> or a plugin for Cubase. All Vocaloid 3 voice libraries include the Tiny Vocaloid 3 Editor for free, however this is quite severely limited in functionality compared to the full V3 editor, being limited to just 17 bars of output, along with some other limitations - serving mainly as a beginner's taste of Vocaloid editing or a way to easily test out a new vocal library. Piapro Studio was created to allow owners of Crypton's V3 products to have a fully featured vocal editor with a modernized and streamlined interface bundled free of charge. It also allows for the loading of 3rd-party, non-Crypton Vocaloid 3 voicebanks - as well as V2's that have been imported into the full V3 editor beforehand. Being a VST plugin, it allows the user to operate entirely within their DAW of choice, {{in contrast to the}} tiny or full V3 editors which are standalone applications and the user must export a wav to import into their DAW each time a change or update is needed - or export an updated wav file from their DAW as the background music to import into the V3 editor. This integration of the vocal editing within the DAW as a VST instrument plugin allows for convenient editing and a smoother workflow. Currently Piapro Studio is lacking some features of the full V3 editor, but most of these are not needed to work with the vocal composition and tuning of the Vocaloid, instead currently some convenience and expansion features such as WAV import and Vocaloid 3's Job Plugins (a scripting system), are absent from Piapro Studio. Crypton has however has mentioned they would like to implement something similar to Job Plugins {{at some point in the}} future. Piapro Studio is also regularly updated every few months with new features and bug fixes. Vocaloid 3 Editor updates appear much less frequently, generally only around the time of release of a new Vocaloid. Piapro Studio also features some Piapro social designed singer icons and vocal preview samples, added in an update in the Summer of 2014.|$|E
