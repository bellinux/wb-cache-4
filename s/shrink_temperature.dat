40|$|A {{method to}} functionalize cholecyst-derived {{extracellular}} matrix (CEM) with free amine groups {{was established in}} an attempt to improve its potential for tethering of bioactive molecules. CEM was incorporated with Generation- 1 polyamidoamine (G 1 PAMAM) dendrimer by using N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -N’-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) crosslinking system. The nature of incorporation of PAMAM dendrimer was evaluated using <b>shrink</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements, FTIR assessment, ninhydrin assay and swellability. The effect of PAMAM incorporation on mechanical and degradation properties of CEM were evaluated using uniaxial mechanical test and collagenase degradation assay, respectively. Ninhydrin assay and FTIR assessment confirmed the presence of increasing free amine groups with increasing quantity of PAMAM in dendrimer-incorporated CEM (DENCEM) scaffolds. The amount of dendrimer used was found to be critical in controlling scaffold degradation, <b>shrink</b> <b>temperature</b> and free amine content. Cell culture studies showed that fibroblasts seeded on DENCEM maintained their metabolic activity and ability to proliferate in vitro. In addition, fluorescence cell staining and SEM analysis of cell-seeded DENCEM showed preservation of normal fibroblast morphology and phenotype...|$|E
40|$|The {{shrinkage}} temperature of collagen {{is related to}} its stability. When shrinkage takes place, {{it is thought that}} the hydrothermal agitation at this temperature is sufficient to overcome the forces, chiefly hydrogen bonds, which hold together the polypeptide chains. When stability is reduced by removal of hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond breakers or by chemical damage, less energy is required to force the chains apart and so the <b>shrink</b> <b>temperature</b> is reduced. This is also paralleled by reduced resistance to the action of trypsin-like enzymes. Conversely, the introduction of new cross links into collagen, as in tanning, will increase enzyme resistance and the <b>shrink</b> <b>temperature.</b> The different forms of collagen, soluble and in-soluble, which occur together in native collagen, vary somewhat in their stability. Banga, Bal 6, and Szab 6 (1956) have suggested that the soluble has a stabilizing effect on the insoluble. In addition, polysaccharides and non-collagen proteins are con-cerned in the biogenesis of collagen fibres and their development into fully mature collagen (Bowes and Kenten, 1950; Partridge, 1948; Jackson, 1953). These constituents, always present in intimate association with native collagen, are probably important in determining the final stability and low turnover rate characteristic of fully mature collagen. It was therefore thought of interest to examine the shrink temperatures of human tissues of different ages to ascertain whether there were any age trends, and, if so, to correlate them with those changes in the various constituents which are known to take place with development and ageing. Further, since collagen in the uterus is rapidly deposited during pregnancy and rapidly absorbed after parturition (Harkness and Harkness, 1954), a feature which distinguishes this from collagen of other tissues and organs, the <b>shrink</b> <b>temperature</b> of uterine collagen from the uterus of various ages and in pregnancy was therefore of special interest.

Recently, some desalination technologies are taking advantage from the coupling with renewable resources. Among emerging technologies, Membrane Distillation (MD) is considered {{as one of the most}} promising as it can be easily powered by solar thermal energy or waste-heat. As an emerging technology, efforts are required to optimize MD unit geometry and operating conditions in order to reduce fresh water production specific cost. Temperature polarization phenomenon is a well-known detrimental effect for the MD process. Spacers are traditionally used to enhance mixing and <b>shrink</b> <b>temperature</b> boundary layers yet yielding higher pressure-losses. The present work is devoted to testing the performance of two different two-layer net-spacers: overlapped and woven. Investigations were carried out by both experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations at different Reynolds numbers ranging from creeping to turbulent flow regime. Experiments (intermediate to high Re) were performed via a novel experimental technique making use of thermochromic liquid crystals and digital image analysis. Computational data (low to intermediate Re) were obtained via steady state (low Re) and Direct Numerical Simulations (intermediate Re), adopting the Unit Cell approach. A good agreement between experiments and CFD data was found in the range of superposition. Results showed that woven spacers guarantee a better mixing than overlapped ones especially in the low-intermediate range of Re thus resulting into a higher Nusselt number.

Permeation results showed that the permeate fluxes are controlled by both osmotic pressure and fouling/gel layer phenomena, leading to a rapid decrease of permeate fluxes with the concentration factor. The rejection coefficients to organic matter were higher than 95 %, indicating that nanofiltration has a very good ability to concentrate the tannins and produce a permeate stream depleted from organic matter.

40|$|Thermo-sensitive {{polymers}} {{are appealing}} materials for several therapeutic applications, {{such as in}} regenerative medicine and in situ drug release. These macromolecules are characterized by the ability to undergo swelling/deswelling processes during temperature change-induced phase transitions. Swelling and <b>shrinking</b> <b>temperatures</b> depend on the specific physicochemical properties, namely salt concentration or pH, of the thermo-sensitive gels {{as well as the}} incubation environment. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying the gel-swelling equilibrium and kinetics is necessary for the selection of an appropriate gel in relation to the specific pharmaceutical application. Thermo-sensitive polymers used in medicine include polyacrylamides, polyvinyls, polyethers, polysaccharides, and polyphosphazenes. A few of them have been successfully used as 3 -dimentional supports for cell cultivation, allowing for the production of scaffolds with excellent biologic properties for application in regenerative medicine. Stem cells that can undergo specific differentiation under the appropriate stimulation have also been cultivated. The ability of drug/polymer solutions to turn into gels at physiologic temperature has been exploited for local drug delivery. The prolonged in situ presence and slow drug release enhances the therapeutic performance of antibiotics used in urogenital pathologies, anti-inflammatory agents, and anticancer drugs. The reduced toxicity as well as lower fluctuations in peak-to-trough drug concentrations make these systems superior to traditional gels. Thermo-sensitive hydrogels have also been demonstrated to be interesting formulations for the delivery of biotechnological drugs. Proteins and oligonucleotides can be loaded under mild conditions, stabilized, and released at a controlled rate.
