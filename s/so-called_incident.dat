50|$|Population-based cancer {{registries}} {{monitor the}} frequency of new cancer cases (<b>so-called</b> <b>incident</b> cases) every year in well defined populations and over time by collecting case reports from different sources (treatment facilities, clinicians and pathologists, and death certificates). The frequency of these incident cases are expected per 100,000 of the mother population. If an unexpected accumulation can be observed, a hypothesis about possible causes is generated. This hypothesis is investigated in a second step by collecting more detailed data. The aim is to recognize and to reduce risks. Population-based registries can also monitor the effects of preventive measures. All population-based central registries in the United States and Canada {{are members of the}} North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. This organization acts as a voice for the registries when dealing with national standard-setting organizations, sets standards for digital cancer record transmission, and certifies the registries for the quality of their data, among other functions.|$|E
40|$|The <b>so-called</b> <b>incident,</b> {{reflected}} and transmitted strain histories {{are typically}} recorded during standard Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) experiments. Subsequently, the stress-strain curve for the specimen material is determined {{based on these}} recordings. Unless wave deconvolution techniques are employed, the reliable measurement of the reflected wave requires an input bar which is {{at least twice as}} long as the striker bar (of equal impedance). The present brief technical note elucidates the advantages of a simple alternative configuration which has only been seldom used in the past. Based on the assumption of quasi-static equilibrium at the specimen level, we present a modification of Kolsky’s formulas such that the stress-strain curve for the specimen material can be obtained from the measurement of the incident and transmitted strain histories only. As a result, the measurement of the reflected wave may be omitted and a much shorter input bar can be chosen. Conversely, a much longer striker bar may be used for a given input bar length, thereby increasing the valid duration of standard SHPB experiments by up to 100 % through the use of the modified Kolky formulas. An example experiment is shown where the duration of valid measurements has been increased by more than 70 %...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{three distinct}} {{problems in the}} healthcare operations field and demonstrates how decision making can be improved in each setting. The first problem addresses how to make dynamic, real-time allocation decisions of testing time slots for a Cardiac Diagnostic Testing Center (CDTC) {{in the presence of}} multiple competing patient classes. Using historical data from the CDTC at a partner hospital, we explore the performance of a dynamic model which is based on a multi-commodity network flow formulation of the CDTC 2 ̆ 7 s scheduling problem. It incorporates the possibility of 2 ̆ 2 bumping 2 ̆ 2 different patient classes in order to accommodate requests from other patient classes. Our results indicate that this approach will result in drastically improved quality of service for inpatients with little or no reduction in the quality of service to the outpatients, relative to existing policy at our partner hospital. We then shift to exploring another important problem involving healthcare resources: during a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI), to which one of several area hospitals should each victim be sent? These decisions depend on resource availability (both transport and care) and the survival probabilities of patients. We focus on the critical time period immediately following the onset of an MCI and are concerned with how to effectively transport victims to the different area hospitals in order to provide the greatest good to the greatest number of patients while not overwhelming any single hospital. We explore two settings. First, we examine the deterministic version of the problem. We compare our proposed model with a model in the extant literature and also against several current policies commonly used by the <b>so-called</b> <b>incident</b> commander. Finally, we explore a dynamic and stochastic setting for the MCI problem, looking at how our decisions affect the expected number of survivors as events unfold over time. To address the infamous 2 ̆ 2 curse of dimensionality 2 ̆ 2, we develop a heuristic methodology that combines the use of a stochastic dynamic program (SDP) and Monte Carlo simulation to arrive at a final decision policy. We call this methodology 2 ̆ 2 scenario iteration. 2 ̆ 2 Managerial insights are also discussed for each of the MCI models. ...|$|E

40|$|The South African {{legal system}} is uncodified {{and from a}} {{comparative}} law perspective it is usually classified as a “mixed legal system”, meaning a mixture between Romano-Germanic law (in the form of Roman-Dutch law) and English common law. Property law is deeply rooted in Roman and Roman-Dutch law and a sharp distinction is drawn between ownership and possession {{and the protection of}} these two institutions. This contribution focuses on the protection of quasi-possession namely the possession of rights. Only certain rights can be possessed in South African law. These are rights of use such as servitutal rights and <b>so-called</b> <b>incidents</b> of possession (for example the access to water and electricity in terms of a contract such as a contract of letting and hiring). There is only one possessory remedy in South African law, the mandament van spolie (spoliation order or actio spolii). This remedy originated in 9 th century Canon Law and it protects possession against spoliation (the unlawful deprivation of possession of a thing or an alleged right). In accordance with the Roman, Canon law and Roman-Dutch tradition, when applying the mandament the court is not supposed to investigate the merits of the case (the actual rights of the parties). The Court only establishes whether there was possession of the alleged right (the exercise of actions usually associated with the right) and whether there was spoliation. Recently, however, the South African Supreme Court of Appeal started to focus on the actual rights (real or personal) of the parties involved. It is submitted that this approach is incorrect and that the same results could have been achieved if the Court had followed the traditional Roman and Roman-Dutch approach. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This article extends theory around consumer-brand {{relationship}} quality {{by exploring}} {{conditions under which}} such relationships may be transformed into exceptionally negative dispositions toward once-coveted brands. Survey and experimental {{results indicate that the}} more self-relevant a consumer-brand relationship, the more likely are anti-brand retaliatory behaviors after the relationship ends. These anti-brand behaviors are diverse: from complaining to third parties, to negative word of mouth, to illegal actions such as theft, threats, and vandalism. In contrast, post-exit consumer-brand relationships that were low in self-relevance but were high in trust, commitment, and satisfaction are less likely to result in anti-brand actions. The role of a discrete product or service failure is also explored, and results suggest that self-relevance may motivate retaliation {{even in the absence of}} a <b>so-called</b> critical <b>incident.</b> Ultimately, this research illuminates previously unexplored mechanisms—including self-conscious emotional reactions—that motivate consumer hostility and retaliation. ...|$|R
