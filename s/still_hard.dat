5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth century, the Europeans mostly were {{interested}} in expanding trade links.

25|$|By Saturday, March 30, Sheriff Presley and Chief of Police Jack Runnels {{posted a}} $500 reward {{in an effort}} to gain any new {{information}} on the Griffin and Moore case that would lead to the arrest and conviction of the slayer or slayers. Officers stated that all clues found thus far had been fruitless. The results from the blood-stained sand were expected to arrive the day before, but due to delays at the laboratory, the results had not come in. By April 11, the officers were <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> at work on the case. Presley said that his department and other authorities had not relaxed for one minute since the discovery of the crime. He also stated that the $500 reward was still being offered and that no tip, no matter how small, was left without a thorough investigation.|$|E
25|$|For the 1907–08 season, {{a new set}} of {{forwards}} {{were signed}} but goals were <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> to come by. Despite possessing a strong half back line made up of Hawkes, Fred Hawkes and Fred White, the club slumped to 18th place and made a financial loss. The following year the team recovered to ninth place, but the financial situation worsened. The forwards finally found the goal in 1909–10, but too many goals were let in at the other end and the club finished 15th. The continuing financial problems caused the sale of forward pair John Smith and Thomas Quinn to Millwall. By 1910–11 gates were up, finances were being brought under control and the club challenged for the title before eventually finishing in ninth place. Optimism was in the air {{at the start of the}} 1911–12 season, but it was to finish in tragedy – popular full-back Sammy Wightman died from injuries sustained in a match against Brighton & Hove Albion, and a high wage bill, a spate of injuries and a lack of goals contributed to the club being relegated to the Southern League's Second Division.|$|E

500|$|During the night, Bompart {{attempted}} to decoy the British by sending the schooner Biche with {{orders for the}} frigate Résolue, commanding Captain Jean-Pierre Bargeau to beach his ship and fire flares {{in the hope of}} distracting Warren from his pursuit. For unknown reasons this order was never carried out, and in the morning Warren was <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> behind Bompart, whose ships were now sailing in two uneven lines.

500|$|A railway {{to serve}} Deeside was {{authorised}} on 16 July 1846, {{but it was}} decided to wait for the Aberdeen Railway to open first. The company survived after the railway mania as the Aberdeen Railway bought a large number of shares. Interest in the line was restored after Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, to which the Royal Family made their first visit in 1848, and the Aberdeen Railway was able to sell its shares. Investors were <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> to find, but a [...] line as far as Banchory was ceremonially opened on 7 September 1853; public services began the following day with three trains a day that took about an hour. First class accommodation was available for d a mile, reduced to 1d a mile for third class. Initially services were operated by the Aberdeen Railway to its terminus at Ferryhill, and the Deeside Railway used a horse to shunt wagons at Banchory. In 1854 the Deeside introduced its own rolling stock and ran through to the Aberdeen's Guild Street station which opened the same year.|$|E
500|$|Like Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. On Metacritic, the album holds {{a score of}} 81 out of 100, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone called A Ghost Is Born [...] "as eerie as anything Wilco have recorded yet" [...] and applauded Tweedy for offering [...] "illuminating curiosity about what can happen in a song." [...] Billboard cited it as Wilco's [...] "most difficult and uncompromising album to date." [...] Akiva Gottlieb of Stylus Magazine praised A Ghost Is Born as being [...] "even more brilliant" [...] than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, a sentiment echoed by Michael Metevier of PopMatters, who added that the album made him [...] "surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club wrote that A Ghost Is Born [...] "channels its shaggy sound into pop music" [...] that [...] "constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence, but it's <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> not to hum along." [...] James Hunter of The Village Voice felt that [...] "Wilco's ideas are unremarkable, but are worked out with intelligence and striking conception. And as it happens, the new organic emphasis tables some of Wilco's lamer stylistic obsessions." [...] Q called the album [...] "more meandering" [...] than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but also [...] "more confident, more coherent, yielding an all-enveloping warmth that's entirely resistant to any iPod shuffle function." ...|$|E

Swift's first televised performance of [...] "Change" [...] {{was at the}} 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards, where she, donning a sparkly evening gown, sang on an elevator suspended from the crowd. She then came down, where she was joined by a teenage choir, and finished the performance by surfing the crowd. Swift performed [...] "Change" [...] on the first North American leg of the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a sparkly silver and black dress with black, leather boots. She noted, [...] "It's been a tough year", and commenced singing throughout the stage as images of victims of economic and natural disasters were projected on the video screens. As the song approximated, its last refrain, she said, [...] "Things turn back around." [...] Then, scenes of triumph appeared on the video screens. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter attended the May 22, 2009 concert in Los Angeles, California at the Staples Center and commented, [...] "It was overly simplistic and a bit naive, but <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> not to be moved." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said Swift offered the audience with optimistic thinking with the performance in the August 27, 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two other}} populous Hasidic sub-groups, which do not {{function}} as classical Rebbe-headed [...] "courts", but as decentralized movements, retaining some {{of the characteristics of}} early Hasidism. Breslov rose under its charismatic leader Nachman of Breslov in the early 19th century. Critical of all other Rebbes, he forbade his followers to appoint a successor upon his death in 1810. His acolytes led small groups of adherents, persecuted by other Hasidim, and disseminated his teachings. The original philosophy of the sect elicited great interest among modern scholars, and that led many newcomers to Orthodox Judaism ("repentants") to join it. Numerous Breslov communities, each led by its own rabbis, now have thousands of full-fledged followers and far more admirers and semi-committed supporters. Chabad-Lubavitch, originating in the 1770s, did have hereditary leadership, but always stressed the importance of self-study rather than reliance on the Righteous. Its seventh and last leader, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, converted it into a vehicle for Jewish outreach. By his death in 1994, it had many more semi-engaged supporters than Hasidim in the strict sense, and they are <b>still</b> <b>hard</b> to distinguish: Estimates for number of Chabad affiliates of all sorts therefore range from 50,000 to 200,000. None succeeded Schneerson, and the sect operates as a large network of communities with independent leaders.|$|E
