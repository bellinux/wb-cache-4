5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> years, while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The {{gestation}} period is around 15–16 months. The calf, which typically weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.|$|E

During the episode, which was Cycle 1 episode 6, she handled two models per day working for <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> hours with each. The works covered the shoulders, legs, breasts and stomach and included long hair extensions. The episode resulted in work that was so successful {{that none of the}} contestants were eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The Kadazan-Dusun, {{located on}} the western coast of Sabah, refer to their agung {{ensemble}} as a tawag or bandil, which consists of <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> large gongs in shoreline groups and 7–8 large gongs for those in interior valleys. In southwestern Sarawak, Bidayuh agung ensembles consist of nine large gongs divided into four groups (taway, puum, bandil, and sanang), while among the Iban of Sawarak, Brunei, Kalimantan, agung ensembles are smaller in comparison.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage to}} Salé was considerable; a wall from the Almohad Caliphate was {{severely}} damaged, and the Great Mosque of Salé {{was struck by}} six cannonballs. Several homes were destroyed, and many were burnt down. Between 12 and 15 civilians were killed, along with <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> soldiers. Tactically, the battle was a victory for France. In order to prevent Tangier from receiving a similar bombardment, Morocco agreed to pay 100,000 francs to the French on 29 November 1851.|$|E
5|$|The handcarts were {{modeled after}} carts used by street {{sweepers}} and were made {{almost entirely of}} wood. They were generally <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> feet (183 to 213cm) long, wide enough to span a narrow wagon track, and could be alternately pushed or pulled. The small boxes affixed to the carts were three to four feet (91 to 122cm) long and eight inches (20cm) high. They could carry about 500 pounds (227kg), most of this weight consisting of trail provisions and a few personal possessions.|$|E
5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E

5|$|After {{repeated}} positives {{over the}} summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI {{has sought to}} have samples taken during the Giro retested. In October 2009, {{it was announced that}} <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> riders from this Giro had presumptive positives, while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected. In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The identities of those riders who tested positive have not yet been revealed. It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have presumptive positives.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months. Births {{generally}} {{occur in}} the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.|$|E

5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, by then renamed to Sound Transit, began {{a series}} of public {{hearings}} in late 1997 to determine the routing of the line. Tukwila leaders preferred a route serving the Southcenter Mall that would add <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> minutes of travel time and $150 million in project costs. The Sound Transit Board chose an at-grade line on International Boulevard as their preferred routing in February 1999, which the city argued would interfere with their near-term plans to revamp the street. The board's preferred route, selected in November 1999, included an at-grade line on International Boulevard through Tukwila and an elevated station at South 154th Street with a park and ride facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivers in}} the Vikos–Aoös area are a {{destination}} for rafting and canoe-kayaking. Additional forms of adventure sports include climbing, hiking and mountain biking along local paths in order to observe the area's natural features and architecture. Popular trails in the region include the crossing of the Vikos Gorge, which lasts approximately <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> hours and is considered of medium difficulty, as well as hiking around the peaks of Tymfi. Several viewpoint are accessible only on foot, such as the Oxya and Beloe outlooks, and the 15th century Monastery of Saint Paraskevi that offer panoramic views to the Vikos Gorge.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{producers}} knew that Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, {{they did not know}} when he would do so, and so the first two episodes were initially written without him. In either case, {{the producers}} created a new character, Adam Carter. In addition, the writers heavily researched the episodes; many of the story lines are based on truth. The producers also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each. Filming started in January 2004 and took place over <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, England, with some scenes shot in a cross-English Channel ferry in the fifth episode.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bermuda Weather Service, {{the islands}} of Bermuda {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once every <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> years, on average. Due to the small area of the island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but {{the center of the}} first storm narrowly missed the islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E

50|$|The first ODI Match {{was played}} in the stadium during the 1983/84 season when India hosted Pakistan and won the match by four wickets. The match between India and Pakistan on 20 March 1987 was a thriller which ended with the scores tied at 212 in 44 overs. India were {{declared}} the victors because they lost fewer wickets (<b>six</b> <b>to</b> Pakistan's <b>seven).</b>|$|R
50|$|If the try or convert is {{scored by}} kicking the ball through the uprights, the team gets an {{additional}} one point for their touchdown, bringing their total for that score from <b>six</b> points <b>to</b> <b>seven.</b> If two points are needed or desired, a two-point conversion may be attempted by running or passing from scrimmage. A successful touchdown conversion brings the score's total to eight.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} at 10 to 14 months. A {{seasonal}} breeder, {{the time when}} mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters oestrus (which lasts for four to six days), it seeks the company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation lasts for <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn is kept in concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi lives for 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Details {{of giant}} otter {{reproduction}} and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided {{much of the}} information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, {{with an average of}} two. Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, {{as well as by}} bushfires and droughts.|$|E
