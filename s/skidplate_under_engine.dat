40|$|This paper reports {{our efforts}} to develop an instrument, TG- 1, to measure {{particulate}} emissions from diesel engines in real-time. TG- 1 while based on laser-induced incandescence allows measurements at 10 Hz on typical engine exhausts. Using such an instrument, measurements were performed in the exhaust of a 1. 7 L Mercedes Benz engine coupled to a low inertia dynamometer. Comparative measurements performed <b>under</b> <b>engine</b> steady state conditions showed the instrument to agree within {+-} 12 % of measurements performed with an SMPS. Moreover, the instrument had far better time response and time resolution than a TEOM{reg_sign} 1105. Also, TG- 1 appears to surpass the shortcomings of the TEOM instrument, i. e., of yielding negative values <b>under</b> certain <b>engine</b> conditions and, being sensitive to external vibration...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} dynamic {{modelling}} and stability {{analysis of a}} generic UAV in the glide phase <b>under</b> <b>engine</b> failure condition. When such extreme phenomena occurs, the most desirable requirement is to survive that stage by keeping the vehicle controllable by maintaining its orientation and to glide the vehicle towards the intended direction with maximum extended range. This study investigates the stability aspects of one such aerial vehicle <b>under</b> <b>engine</b> failure condition. In the proposed architecture, a six degree of freedom vehicle dynamic simulation model is implemented {{through a set of}} coupled non-linear differential equations. The aerodynamic forces and moments encountered by the UAV during various phases of the flight are ascertained through empirical / non-empirical techniques. Non-linear constrained optimization technique is employed to evaluate the steady state values of the optimized trajectory for the complete flight regime. Results from dynamical systems theory are applied to investigate local stability characteristics of UAV around the steady state. Complete set of dynamic modes of UAV throughout the glide phase are evaluated and mode content in each of the motion variable is determined using modal decomposition technique. The dynamic characteristics of the open-loop configuration are assessed to generate adequate benchmark performance for closed-loop controller desig...|$|R

25|$|On 3 August 1917 Mitchell had {{her third}} encounter, sailing south of Start Point {{in the guise}} of the French {{schooner}} Cancalais. She encountered a U-boat, UC-75, which approached, opening fire at a range of nearly three miles. Mitchell's crew again hove to and the panic party abandoned ship, while the gun crews waited for their target to come into range. However the U-boat was too cautious, and after being shelled for fifteen minutes, Lawrie elected to clear away and close <b>under</b> <b>engine</b> power. Mitchell was able to score some hits before the U-boat disappeared, but no loss was confirmed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{different}} volume ratios, soybean biodiesel is mixed with 0 # diesel by 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 %. These blends (B 0, B 20, B 40, B 60 and B 80) are tested using Xinchai 490 B diesel engine for their combustion and emission performance. It is concluded that output power first increases and then decreases as the volume ratio increases, while higher fuel consumption is presented. Meanwhile, smoke emission of B 80 decreases remarkably up to 30. 4 % versus B 0. NOX emission also increases slightly <b>under</b> <b>engine</b> external characteristic condition...|$|R
