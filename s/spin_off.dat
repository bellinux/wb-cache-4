5|$|Edea is one {{of three}} {{character}} concepts, along with Fujin and Raijin, to have been created before Final Fantasy VIII. Tetsuya Nomura had designed Edea even before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano, who was the character illustrator of Final Fantasy VI and previous games. In Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Edea's design is used as an alternate costume of Ultimecia's. Although she has not appeared in Final Fantasy <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> games like Dissidia, her namesake has been carried into the Bravely Default series with Edea Lee.|$|E

It revealed it would instead seek to sell the division to another bank.

The European Commission confirmed in April 2017 that it would scrutinise the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Gaiman {{revisited}} Hell {{as depicted}} by Alan Moore in Swamp Thing, {{beginning with a}} guest appearance by Jack Kirby's Etrigan the Demon in issue No. 4 (April 1989). The story introduces Hell's Hierarchy (as their entry is titled in Who's Who in the DC Universe), headed by Lucifer (who would <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> into his own series in 1999), Beelzebub (later adversary to Kid Eternity), and Azazel, whom Dream defeated later in the series. Dream visited the Justice League International in the following issue, No. 5 (May 1989). Although multiple mainstream DC characters appeared in the series throughout its run, such as Martian Manhunter and Scarecrow, {{this would not be}} the norm. Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of Dream, in issue No. 8 (August 1989).|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of Smith and Brinker, Pillsbury allowed many of their changes to be relaxed, as well as scaled back on construction of new locations which {{had the effect of}} stalling corporate growth. By failing to follow through on the changes of the two men, Pillsbury caused its own value to diminish as it derived more than one third of its sales and two thirds of its profits from the burger chain. When the British alcoholic beverages company Grand Metropolitan PLC made a hostile bid for Pillsbury, the company devised a plan to <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> the financially flailing restaurant unit in hopes to raise an estimated US$2billion {{that could be used to}} fend off the unwanted suitor. The complex potentially tax-free stock split plan would have led to the chain, along with its distribution system Distron, becoming a separate entity for the first time in over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, 2017, Channing Dungey {{announced}} at the ABC Upfronts that the network ordered another Grey's Anatomy spin-off, this one focusing on firefighters in Seattle. The series is set to premiere mid-season in 2018. Stacy McKee, long-term Grey's writer and executive producer, {{will serve as the}} spin-off's showrunner. The new show will most likely be introduced during an episode of Grey's Anatomy next season. In July 2017, it was announced that Jaina Lee Ortiz was the first actress cast in the spin-off series. In September 2017 it was announced that Jason George, who has played Dr. Ben Warren since season 6, would be leaving Grey's Anatomy to move to the spin-off. He's expected to be a series regular on Grey's Anatomy until the spin-off begins production. In October 2017 it was announced that five new series regulars for the <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> had been cast being Grey Damon, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Barrett Doss. It was also announced that the spin-off had a 10 episode order for the first season. Later in October 2017, it was announced that Miguel Sandoval was cast as the Captain of the firehouse.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, {{after eight}} years of private operation, the Pillsbury Company {{acquired}} the Burger King brand and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, the chain had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. Pillsbury continued to grow the company utilizing the existing franchise system despite its flaws. The power of its independent franchises came to a head in 1973 when Chart House, owner of 350 restaurants and one of its largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100million (USD) which Pillsbury declined. When Chart House's bid failed, its owners Billy and Jimmy Trotter put forth a second plan that would require Pillsbury and Chart House <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company. Again Pillsbury declined the proposed divestiture. After the failed attempts to acquire the company, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters soured; when Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for failing to comply with the right of first refusal clause in their contracts. Burger King won the case, successfully preventing the sale. The two parties did eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio. Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King holdings and refocused on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury $390million (USD) in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.|$|E
