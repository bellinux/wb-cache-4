5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will <b>sell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to <b>sell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to <b>sell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all counterfeit footwear in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he has moved from that spot and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E

5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to <b>sell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E

25|$|Peruggia {{may have}} been {{motivated}} by an associate whose copies of the original would significantly rise in value after the painting's theft.

However, the original painting remained in Europe. After having kept the Mona Lisa in his apartment for two years, Peruggia grew impatient and was caught when he attempted to sell it to directors of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It was exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery for over two weeks and returned to the Louvre on 4 January 1914. Peruggia served six months in prison for the crime and was hailed for his patriotism in Italy. Before its theft, the Mona Lisa was not widely known outside the art world. It was not until the 1860s that some critics, a thin slice of the French intelligentsia, began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting.|$|E

25|$|Nasser's {{first choice}} for buying weapons was the United States, but his {{frequent}} anti-Israeli speeches and his sponsorship for the fedayeen who were making raids into Israel {{had made it}} difficult for the Eisenhower administration to get the approval of Congress to sell weapons to Egypt. American public opinion was deeply hostile towards selling arms to Egypt that might be used against Israel, and moreover Eisenhower feared starting a Middle Eastern arms race. Eisenhower very much valued the Tripartite Declaration as a way of keeping peace in the Near East. In 1950, in order to limit the extent that the Arabs and the Israelis could engage in an arms race, the three nations which dominated the arms trade in the non-Communist world, namely the United States, the United Kingdom and France had signed the Tripartite Declaration, where they had committed themselves to limiting how much arms they could <b>sell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Near East, and also to ensuring that any arms sales to one side was matched by arms sales of equal quantity and quality to the other. Eisenhower viewed the Tripartite Declaration, which sharply restricted how many arms Egypt could buy in the West, as one of the key elements in keeping the peace between Israel and the Arabs, and believed that setting off an arms race would inevitably lead to a new war.|$|E
