500|$|In April, Diplo told The Huffington Post that he {{had reached}} an {{agreement}} to clear the samples. However, in an August interview with Pitchfork, Baauer {{said that he has}} not made any money from the song, despite Diplo's reported agreement: [...] "I'm meeting with my lawyer ... so I'm gonna find that out. I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my fucking bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up , I didn’t even know who it was who did that I knew the Jayson Musson [...] <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself in that fucking pickle. Legal letters and shit. Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else..." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Scientology {{accounts}} {{present a}} different perspective. A 1959 biography describes Hubbard as [...] "never noted {{for being in}} class" [...] and says that he [...] "thoroughly detest his subjects." [...] He attributed his choice of course to his father, having [...] "decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself obediently studying." [...] In a 1953 lecture, {{he said that he}} was [...] "forced into engineering, mathematics, majoring in nuclear physics– very antipathetic to me, but there was order and there was discipline..." [...] Christiansen comments that the claims made about Hubbard's expertise and scientific knowledge are crucial to Scientology's own self-image and legitimation. Hubbard is presented as [...] "a man with an impressive amount of various theoretical as well as practical personal competences and educational qualifications." [...] Scientology traces its own origins to Hubbard's [...] "scientific" [...] methodology, which he is said to have learned while at university. Although Scientology positions itself as a religious belief, it nonetheless claims to be a true science, a [...] "technology" [...] capable of achieving precise and replicable results.|$|E
500|$|Location {{scouting}} {{revealed a}} former Wall Street bank {{that had been}} closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar. [...] The building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Trust Bank branch, where the bank heist occurs. [...] "Without a bank, we didn’t have a movie," [...] Lee explained. [...] "But everything ended up going very smoothly. We shot {{in the heart of}} Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It was like having a back lot in the middle of Wall Street." [...] An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: [...] "The space literally presents Case’s power, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don’t have to push the power, because it’s all around you." [...] The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming. Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan.|$|E
5000|$|Traga is {{the third}} album by the Chilean band Fiskales Ad-Hok, {{launched}} in 1995 under [...] "Culebra Records", BMG sub-label. After releasing this album, Fiskales Ad-Hok decide they do not feel comfortable in their workplace, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>founded</b> an independent record label themselves, CFA - Autonomous Phonographic Corporation - under which throw all his later works.|$|R

5000|$|According to Turmel: [...] "Quebec Social Credit first {{argued for}} a {{national}} LETS currency. But Canada Social Credit didn't agree and threw me out and changed their policy from prohibition of interest rates to 6%. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>founded</b> the Christian Credit thinking that credit could only be Christian and friendly {{if there was no}} interest. This is the way I explained then what are the Abolitionist Party programs of today: ...|$|R
2500|$|Singh recollected {{to reporters}} about his childhood: [...] "When {{we were kids}} we couldn't afford golf balls {{so we had to}} make do with coconuts. My father used to say, 'Little Vijay, golf balls don't fall off trees you know,' <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> some that did!" [...] Growing up, he played snooker, cricket, football, and the island's most popular sport, rugby. He is the son of Mohan Singh, an {{airplane}} technician who also taught golf. Growing up, he admired the swing of Tom Weiskopf, using it as an early model for his own.|$|E
2500|$|To {{shape the}} science of the film, Boyle and Garland hired {{scientific}} advisers, including NASA employees and astrophysicists. Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester, was hired to advise {{the cast and crew}} after the director had seen Cox on the science TV series Horizon. Cox gave regular lectures to the film's cast members about solar physics, and also advised the filmmakers to scale down the nuclear device in the film from the mass of the Moon to the size of Manhattan. In the film's backstory, a Q-ball enters and is caught in the Earth's Sun, and begins to eat it away. According to Cox, the Sun would not be dense enough in real life to stop a Q-ball, but filmmakers took creative licence in writing the backstory. Cox noted in the DVD commentary that several inaccuracies were permitted to allow for plot. He also dismissed criticisms of the film by scientists: [...] "Sunshine is not a documentary. It's trying to just, in an hour and forty minutes, get across a feeling of what it's like – not only to be a scientist, because obviously there's much more in it than that. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it interesting to watch the kind of people that get upset because the gravity is wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Waits {{taught himself}} {{how to play}} the piano on a neighbor's instrument. He often took trips to Mexico with his father, who taught Spanish. He says that he found his love of music during those trips through a Mexican ballad that was [...] "probably a Ranchera, you know, on the car radio with my dad". He began playing in an R band called The Systems by 1965 while {{attending}} Hilltop High School in Chula Vista, California. His first job was at Napoleone Pizza House in National City, about which he sings in [...] "I Can't Wait to Get Off Work (And See My Baby on Montgomery Avenue)" [...] on Small Change, and also in [...] "The Ghosts of Saturday Night (After Hours at Napoleone's Pizza House)" [...] on The Heart of Saturday Night). He later admitted that he was not a fan of 1960s music: [...] "I wasn't thrilled by Blue Cheer, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> an alternative, even if it was Bing Crosby." [...] Five years later, he was working as a doorman at the Heritage nightclub in San Diego where artists of every genre performed, and he performed his first paid gig for $6. He was a fan of Bob Dylan, Lord Buckley, Jack Kerouac, Louis Armstrong, Howlin' Wolf, and Charles Bukowski, but he began developing his own idiosyncratic musical style.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, admitted. The {{unexpected}} always moves me <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> you {{many things}} {{in the course of}} our acquaintance. To-night you are the one thing I never expected to find you: an honest man." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{reached the}} station, however, I {{was glad that}} it had not done <b>so,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my father sitting on the stoep reading a letter that had been brought by a mounted Hottentot.|$|R
6000|$|... “Ha! ha! <b>So</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> you at last, you scamp!” {{he cried}} in a rage. “A pretty run {{you have given}} me! And made me pay out twenty-five cents, too, {{to come in the}} fair after you!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know because}} I am a villain, sir. I am {{not worthy of}} your kindness. I told you <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> the book, sir, that night, when you had too much wine at Barbeau's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am aware}} of all that, Pigeonswing, and wish {{it had not been}} <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> the body of Elksfoot sitting up against a tree soon after you left me, and knew by whose hands he had fallen." ...|$|E
60|$|Naturally I am kind-hearted, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> {{it beyond}} {{me to leave}} even this hateful and repulsive thing alone in a strange and hostile world. The result was that when I entered the iron mole I took her with me.|$|E
6000|$|M. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found.</b> But {{you will}} have consolations--Bailiffs and Drains and Liquid Manure and the Primrose League, and, perhaps, if you're lucky, the Colonelcy of a Yeomanry Cav-al-ry Regiment--all uniform and no riding, I believe. How old are you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I have," [...] she {{answered}} at once. [...] "I have looked upon {{you in that}} light, but somehow it was not convincing. Why, I do not know. There was <b>so</b> much <b>I</b> <b>found</b> to like in you, so much--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Capt. M. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found.</b> But {{you will}} have consolations--Bailiffs and Drains and Liquid Manure and the Primrose League, and, perhaps, if you're lucky, the Colonelcy of a Yeomanry Cav-al-ry Regiment--all uniform and no riding, I believe. How old are you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{child of}} five years old, who soon ceased howling, and confided his history to me. He had been visiting grandmamma in London, and was going home to Illershall; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> the best plan would be to leave the train at the next station, and take him home.' ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> {{myself back}} at Rodenhurst before dinner with this curious outcome {{of my day}} in town. I still said nothing to Sir Dominick, but I slept {{that night in the}} laboratory, and I placed the Lascar's hand in one of the glass jars {{at the end of my}} couch.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one noticed}} so small a {{creature}} as a Woggle-Bug, and when I {{found that the}} hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine, I resolved to establish my future home beside it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> a charming nest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many, many months.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Julie; not <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> {{you with}} too much difficulty. In London, you see, I could not find you. Here, for a minute, you must listen to me. Do you not know, Julie, that your {{character}} is in my hands?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> am <b>found</b> on Ingpen Beacon, or on Wylls-Neck to the west, Or else on homely Bulbarrow, {{or little}} Pilsdon Crest, Where men have never cared to haunt, nor women have walked with me, And ghosts then keep their distance; and I know some liberty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really!" [...] said Sir William. [...] "I {{have not}} <b>found</b> it <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> have not <b>found</b> it <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> {{have had to}} keep myself hard at work, all my life, {{choosing}} between this or that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Similarly, it {{was through}} Mr Lightwood that you ever saw her again, for you were {{with him on the}} night when my father was found, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> you with her on the next day. Since then, you have seen my sister often. You have seen my sister oftener and oftener. And I want to know why?' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is deeply}} {{interesting}} to tread {{in the footsteps}} of bold adventurous men, and visit the scenes which have been rendered classic by their deeds of heroic daring or of patient endurance. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it during my brief sojourn in the regions of Baviaans River, where, upwards of fifty years before, my countrymen had faced, fought, and subdued the savage, the wilderness, and the wild-beast.|$|E
60|$|I learnt from it {{also this}} in particular, that being abroad in {{the rainy season}} was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be, {{especially}} in those rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came in a dry season was always most accompanied with such storms, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> this rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September and October.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even gazelle {{shooting}} has its dangers," [...] replied Tarzan. [...] "Especially {{when one}} goes alone. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it <b>so</b> today. <b>I</b> also <b>found</b> {{that while the}} gazelle is the most timid of animals, {{it is not the}} most cowardly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your father's talking led me {{to think}} <b>so.</b> I'm glad <b>I</b> <b>found</b> you for there is money coming to your father. How much I don't know, but quite some." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'May be <b>so,</b> sir. <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> one already, by God's grace, and I'm much mistaken if I don't {{begin to}} see my way towards another.' ...|$|R
60|$|That {{night my}} mother never slept, but sat all through it in her nursing chair, {{brooding}} over I know not what. As I left her when I went to my bed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> her when I came from it at dawn. I can remember well pushing the door ajar to see her face glimmering white in the twilight of the May morning, as she sat, her large eyes fixed upon the lattice.|$|E
60|$|Being {{under no}} disgraceful charge, and quite serene and {{harmless}} {{in all his}} ways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, {{and especially in the}} inclosed grass-platted yard thereof. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> him there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face towards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cuffed the boy, {{and he said}} he'd {{take it out on}} Mumbles, as soon as I'd gone away. I didn't like that. I {{offered to}} buy the dog, but the boy didn't dare sell him. He said it belonged to his father, who'd kill him and kick up a row besides if he didn't bring Mumbles home. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out where they lived and as it wasn't far away I went home with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Later that morning, when {{relieved}} by my second officer, I threw myself on my couch {{and for some}} three hours or <b>so</b> <b>I</b> really <b>found</b> oblivion. It was so perfect that on waking up I wondered where I was. Then came the immense relief of the thought: on board my ship! At sea! At sea! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} my mood {{declined}} again; {{it was as}} if that light, that sense of release that had shone so clear and strong in my mind, had escaped me. I sought earnestly to recover it. But I could not do <b>so,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my old narrow preoccupations calling urgently to me again.|$|R
5000|$|... We had an {{overwhelming}} response from younger dancers {{who wanted to}} join Rennie Harris Puremovement and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>founded</b> a second company to meet this demand. I wanted the second company to be a training company that would teach technique, professionalism, responsibility, work ethic and Dance and Theater etiquette. RHAW's (Rennie Harris Awe-Inspiring Works) mission {{is to focus on}} the education of the youth and mentorship. In addition the youth will learn the history of hip-hop and its relativity to today's fast growing youth culture. Artistically RHAWS choreographic works are less complexed than the first company. RHAW prides itself on going back to the basics of street dance and presenting works that are reflective of its original movement vocabulary and aesthetic." [...] ~Rennie Harris~ ...|$|R
