25|$|The {{opposition}} badly {{wanted to}} get its story out {{to the rest of}} the world and <b>so,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they acquired a territorial base in Benghazi, foreign reporters were able to join them. These reporters were, to a large extent, free to travel wherever and to talk to whomever they wished within opposition-controlled areas. This proximity and relative freedom of access to the opposition side of events, combined with reporters' natural sympathies for what they see as genuine popular rebellions against despotic regimes, undoubtedly aided the opposition and hurt the Gaddafi-government in getting their respective messages out.|$|E
25|$|It {{is an old}} {{trick of}} the Indian Office to blacken the {{character}} of any Indian that happens, notwithstanding the retardation caused by the Indian Bureau, to rise a little above the ranks. <b>So</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> an educated Indian begins to deplore the conditions of his brother Indians, the Indian Office dubs such a one a disturber, an agitator, and lately he {{is placed in the}} Bolshevik class. The whole Indian Bureau system of managing Indian business {{to the detriment of the}} Indian but for the benefit of a few greedy and voracious whites, is the most dramatic autocracy in existence the world over. Gradually through assistance of the American press, the generous hearted and justice loving American people are learning something of this present day Indian government humbuggery and deceit practiced by the Indian Office forces.|$|E
25|$|How did {{evolutionary}} non-related genes come {{in close}} proximity in the first place? Either there is a force that brings functionally related genes near to each other, or the genes came near by change. Singer et al. proposed that genes came {{in close proximity}} by random recombination of genome segments. When functionally related genes came {{in close proximity to}} each other, this proximity was conserved. They determined all possible recombination sites between genes of human and mouse. After that, they compared the clustering of the mouse and human genome and looked if recombination had occurred at the potentially recombination sites. It turned out that recombination between genes of the same cluster was very rare. <b>So,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> a functional cluster is formed recombination is suppressed by the cell. On sex chromosomes, the amount of clusters is very low in both human and mouse. The authors reasoned this was due to the low rate of chromosomal rearrangements of sex chromosomes.|$|E

When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. <b>So</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved {{the complexity of the}} human beings".|$|E
500|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that [...] "I was already doing voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the boring middle child, I want to be a bratty 10-year old boy.' <b>So</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I gave a demonstration, [...] hired me on the spot." [...] Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. [...] The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.|$|E
2500|$|Where an arrested {{individual}} {{does not}} receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours, the calculus changes. In such a case, the arrested individual does not {{bear the burden of}} proving an unreasonable delay. Rather, the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance. The fact that in a particular case it may take longer than 48 hours to consolidate pretrial proceedings does not qualify as an extraordinary circumstance. Nor, for that matter, do intervening weekends. A jurisdiction that chooses to offer combined proceedings must do <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> is reasonably feasible, but in no event later than 48 hours after arrest" ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 2, 2010, Badu {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct for her public nudity, a class C {{misdemeanor}} indicating a $500 fine, when a witness came forward. According to Dallas Deputy Police Chief Mike Genovesi, the witness [...] "had two small children with her and was offended". In an interview for the Dallas Morning News, Badu said that her part in the video foreshadowed the controversy and reaction to the video, stating [...] "I knew that would happen, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the thought came to my mind, I decided to assassinate myself as a gesture. Because {{it was going to}} happen anyway. The video is a prediction of what is happening now". In an April 3, 2010 interview on The Wanda Sykes Show, she explained in response to critics of the video that she did not intend to disrespect the memory of John F. Kennedy with its allusion to his assassination, stating [...] "My point was grossly misunderstood all over America. JFK is one of my heroes, one of the nation's heroes. John F. Kennedy was a revolutionary; he was not afraid to butt heads with America, and I was not afraid to show America my butt-naked truth." [...] On April 28, 2010, Badu challenged the disorderly conduct charge by pleading not guilty rather than paying the fee by mail. On August 13, she paid the $500 fine and agreed to serve six months probation through February 11, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|When the two steamers {{began their}} journey {{down the coast}} again, it wasn't long before they found three of the prahus. The water was shallow that the Rainbow had the Jolly Bachelor in tow and her captain, the rajah mudah, {{intended}} to release the other ship {{as soon as they}} were in a good firing position. Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to be sure, and they said yes, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull so. We put on all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, where we could not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which we returned with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to say that one of the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E
