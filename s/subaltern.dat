5|$|In 1943, Elizabeth {{undertook}} {{her first}} solo public appearance {{on a visit}} to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944. In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second <b>subaltern</b> in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was awarded the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{served with}} the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War. He was a <b>subaltern</b> in Arthur St. Clair's army in the American defeat at the Battle of the Wabash on November 4, 1791. During the retreat, a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting on a log. Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run, but Madison, who was already known to be of frail constitution, stood to reveal {{that he had been}} badly wounded and was {{bleeding}} profusely. Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen; he helped Madison astride the horse, and they both escaped.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutionary War forced William and Mary {{to close}} in 1781, as its {{buildings}} were used as barracks for British, French, and American troops as each nation successively controlled the college and surrounding area. Although William C. Davis records that Breckinridge had previously served as an ensign in the Botetourt County militia, Harrison notes that the most reliable records of Virginians' military service do not indicate his participation in the Revolutionary War, but less reliable sources mention him as a <b>subaltern</b> in the Virginia militia. If he enlisted, Harrison speculates that he served {{in one or two}} short 1780 militia campaigns supporting Nathanael Greene's army in southwest Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{entered the}} University of Melbourne in 1898 to study law, but left in 1900 {{to serve in}} the Imperial Bushmen in the South African War. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and given a British Army commission, but chose to remain with the Victorian Imperial Bushmen as an {{attached}} <b>subaltern.</b> He returned to Australia in 1901, but went back to South Africa to serve with the Border Scouts, who patrolled remote and inhospitable areas. In December 1901, he distinguished himself in repelling a numerically superior Boer force, and received a congratulatory telegram from General Lord Kitchener. After he returned to Australia, he completed his law degree and became a solicitor. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Militia in 1904, and he was promoted to lieutenant in 1905, captain in 1909, major in 1911, and lieutenant colonel in 1913, commanding the 58th Battalion (Essendon Rifles).|$|E
5|$|Louis Edward Nolan (4 January 1818– 25 October 1854) was a British Army {{officer and}} cavalry tactician {{best known for}} his role and death in the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. Born to a minor {{diplomatic}} official and his wife, Nolan was educated at the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where he was noted as an enthusiastic horseman and military theorist. After early graduation he was commissioned as a <b>subaltern</b> in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment, serving in Austria, Hungary and on the Polish frontier, where he again became known for his horsemanship and was promoted to senior lieutenant. Due to the nepotism inherent in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces, Nolan succeeded in transferring to the British Army as a Cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{was born}} on 4 January 1818 to Babington and Elizabeth Nolan, in York County, Upper Canada. Following his father's {{dismissal}} from his minor diplomatic post at the British consulate in Milan, Nolan was accepted into the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where {{he was known as}} Ludwig by his fellow cadets. His father's desire to see him given a chance to enter a prestigious branch of the armed forces meant that Nolan was regularly transferred to other cadet schools {{to learn more about the}} military. Enthusiastic about the cavalry, he was noted as an excellent horseman and student of military theory, as well as history. With the multi-lingual nature of Austro-Hungary, he also studied languages, including Hungarian. Other subjects studied there included fortification, water engineering, mathematics, fencing, swimming and bridge-building. Nolan graduated from the Pioneer School a year early in May 1835, probably following a recommendation from Prince Liechtenstein, and was made a <b>subaltern</b> in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian Imperial Bushmen were {{initially}} based at Marandellas {{in case the}} Boers invaded Southern Rhodesia. In January 1901 they moved to the Cape Colony, where they were attached to a Coldstream Guards force {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Henniker. This sometimes formed part of a larger force under the command of Colonel Herbert Plumer. On 28 February 1901, a 16-man detachment of Victorian Imperial Bushmen under the command of Captain Joseph Dallimore tracked a party of Boers. During the night, Elliott, now a corporal, stole the Boers' 54 horses without waking them. At dawn the bushmen surrounded and attacked the Boer party's encampment, and compelled all 33 of them to surrender. For his part, Elliott was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the British Empire's second-highest award for gallantry by other ranks after the Victoria Cross, and mentioned in despatches. He was given a British Army commission as a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment on 20 November 1900, but he remained with the Victorian Imperial Bushmen as an attached <b>subaltern.</b> He embarked for Australia on 22 June 1901, reaching Melbourne on 12 July. His British Army commission was cancelled at his own request.|$|E

25|$|When the Colours {{are being}} paraded, they are carried either by a <b>subaltern</b> or warrant officer, {{dependent}} on the regiment. On parade, the Colours always have an armed escort, the Colour Party, who would normally be non-commissioned officers. In the infantry this role usually falls to Colour Sergeants.|$|E
25|$|Nancy Fraser {{identified}} {{the fact that}} marginalized groups are excluded from a universal public sphere, and thus {{it was impossible to}} claim that one group would, in fact, be inclusive. However, she claimed that marginalized groups formed their own public spheres, and termed this concept a <b>subaltern</b> counter public or counter-public.|$|E
25|$|The {{thirteen}} <b>subaltern,</b> commissioned in {{the wake}} of the 1962 War, who joined in Bakloh, and were destined to be the vanguard in the 1965 war were: R L Bhanot, V K Dhawan, P K Mishra, Anup S Rawat, SVS Tyagi, Prem S Saraswat, Verma, Baldev K Chatli, R Rajendran, B S Khattri, Satinder Pal, Sachdev and John Taylor.|$|E
25|$|When the {{war ended}} in November 1918, Gale volunteered to go to India in 1919, serving with the 12th Battalion, MGC where Captain John Harding was a fellow <b>subaltern</b> who, like Gale, was to attain the highest ranks in the army. However, in 1922 the MGC was disbanded and Gale reverted to serving with the Worcestershire Regiment, and served with the 3rd Battalion, Worcesters before that, too, was disbanded, with Gale {{transferring}} to the Machine Gun School in India. In 1928 he joined the 1st Battalion, Worcesters. During his time in India he gained entry to the Staff College, Quetta, attending from 1930 to 1931, and after {{two years in the}} institution he graduated as a staff officer. Promotion prospects during the interwar years were limited, and although he received above average grades in his annual reports, he remained a <b>subaltern</b> for fifteen years, until he was promoted to the rank of captain in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (DCLI) on 26 February 1930.|$|E
25|$|In Bakloh the {{battalion}} had 16 Subalterns. Thirteen joined in 1964. Their overseer, as the senior <b>subaltern,</b> was the handsome, affable, and popular Virendra K Dhawan, who loved three X rum, crumbling roller cigarettes, and KL Seghal's melancholy melodies. On 6 April 2011, {{a year before}} the Golden jubilee, to the regret of legions of friends and admirers, Virendra died.|$|E
25|$|Spivak also {{introduced}} the terms essentialism and strategic essentialism {{to describe the}} social functions of postcolonialism. The term essentialism denotes the perceptual dangers inherent to reviving <b>subaltern</b> voices in ways that might (over) simplify the cultural identity of heterogeneous social groups, and, thereby, create stereotyped representations of the different identities {{of the people who}} compose a given social group. The term strategic essentialism denotes a temporary, essential group-identity used in the praxis of discourse among peoples. Furthermore, essentialism can occasionally be applied—by the so-described people—to facilitate the subaltern's communication in being heeded, heard, and understood, because a strategic essentialism (a fixed and established <b>subaltern</b> identity) is more readily grasped, and accepted, by the popular majority, in the course of inter-group discourse. The important distinction, between the terms, is that strategic essentialism does not ignore the diversity of identities (cultural and ethnic) in a social group, but that, in its practical function, strategic essentialism temporarily minimizes inter-group diversity to pragmatically support the essential group-identity.|$|E
25|$|The Escort to the Colour and Colour Party slope arms. The Colour Sergeant marches to {{the right}} and {{to the rear of the}} Escort. Once the Colour Party, Ensign and Regimental Sergeant-Major have joined the Escort, the RSM repositions himself to the left of and behind the Escort. The <b>Subaltern</b> then orders the Escort to change arms and orders the slow march.|$|E
25|$|The turma {{was still}} {{commanded}} by a decurio, aided by two <b>subaltern</b> principales (under-officers), a sesquiplicarius (soldier with one-and-a-half times pay) and a duplicarius (soldier with double pay), {{as well as}} a signifer or vexillarius (a standard-bearer, cf. vexillum). These ranks corresponded respectively with the infantry's tesserarius (officer of the watch), optio, and signifer. The exact size of the turma under the Principate, however, is unclear: 30 men was the norm in the Republican army and apparently in the cohortes equitatae, but not for the alae. The De Munitionibus Castrorum, for instance, records that a cohors equitata milliaria numbered exactly 240 troopers, i.e. 30 men per turma, but also gives the number of horses for the ala milliaria, composed of 24 turmae, at 1000. If one subtracts the extra horses of the officers (two for a decurio, one for each of the two <b>subaltern</b> under-officers), one is left with 832 horses, which does not divide evenly with 24. At the same time, Arrian explicitly says that the ala quingenaria counted 512 men, suggesting a size of 32 men for each turma.|$|E
25|$|The Chief of the Artillery, Margrave Albert Frederick of Brandenburg-Schwedt {{noticed his}} talent, and in 1707 Schultze joined the Artillery corps. There {{he came to}} the notice of the future king, Friedrich Wilhelm I, who made him and <b>subaltern</b> in the Life Regiment. With this regiment, he fought in the War of Spanish Succession, {{especially}} at the Battle of Malplaquet and in the Siege of Bouchain in 1711.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{literature}} {{in the region is}} vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Diamela Eltit, Giannina Braschi, Ricardo Piglia, or Roberto Bolaño. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimonio, texts produced in collaboration with <b>subaltern</b> subjects such as Rigoberta Menchú. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic Carlos Monsiváis and Pedro Lemebel.|$|E
25|$|Eventually the Escort arrives back at its {{original}} position as no. 1 Guard - {{from where it}} first marched off in quick time. Their Captain, who had temporarily ceded his command to the <b>Subaltern,</b> resumes his command over No. 1 Guard by ordering them to present arms, thus bringing the Escort back in line with Nos 2-6 Guards. The entire parade is now ordered by the Field Officer to slope arms, thus concluding the trooping phase.|$|E
25|$|As an infant, Francis {{was taken}} to live in England by his mother. When Clara {{returned}} to India in 1867 she left her son {{in the care of}} two austere and strictly religious aunts. In 1870 his mother and father returned to England and reunited the family. In 1876 at age thirteen, Francis entered Clifton College, Bristol. In 1881 he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a <b>subaltern</b> in the 1st King's Dragoon Guards in 1882.|$|E
25|$|Within the Army, British {{officers}} who initially {{trained at the}} company's own academy at the Addiscombe Military Seminary, always outranked Indians, {{no matter how long}} their service. The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Rissaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior <b>subaltern</b> equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.|$|E
25|$|Cyril Lionel Robert James (4 January 1901– 31 May 1989), who {{sometimes}} wrote under the pen-name J. R. Johnson, was an Afro-Trinidadian historian, journalist and socialist. His works are influential in various theoretical, social, and historiographical contexts. His {{work is a}} staple of <b>subaltern</b> studies, and he figures as a pioneering and influential voice in postcolonial literature. A tireless political activist, James's work World Revolution outlining {{the history of the}} Communist International stirred debate in Trotskyist circles, and his history of the Haitian Revolution, The Black Jacobins, is a seminal text in the literature of the African Diaspora.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Mowat {{joined the}} Canadian Army and was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Second Battalion, The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, affectionately known as the Hasty Ps. He went overseas as a reinforcement officer for that regiment, joining the Canadian Army in the United Kingdom. He saw very brief active service when the 3rd Infantry Brigade was shipped to Brest, France, in June, 1940, but was quickly withdrawn. On July 10, 1943, he was a <b>subaltern</b> in command of a rifle platoon and participated in the initial landings of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 5:00am, Johnston set out {{to locate}} the main rebel force. In {{addition}} to the troops he had brought with him, a number of civilians volunteered along with the 36 armed members of the Parramatta Loyal Association militia were also called out and took over defence of the town. Over 50 enrolled in a reserve militia combined with the NSW Corps to march out and confront the rebels. Johnston decided to advance in two columns, one which he led himself towards Toongabbie, and another under a <b>subaltern,</b> Davies, which was sent along the Castle Hill Road.|$|E
25|$|Decolonized people {{develop a}} postcolonial {{identity}} {{that is based}} on cultural interactions between different identities (cultural, national, and ethnic as well as gender and class based) which are assigned varying degrees of social power by the colonial society. In postcolonial literature, the anti-conquest narrative analyzes the identity politics that are the social and cultural perspectives of the <b>subaltern</b> colonial subjects—their creative resistance to the culture of the colonizer; how such cultural resistance complicated the establishment of a colonial society; how the colonizers developed their postcolonial identity; and how neocolonialism actively employs the Us-and-Them binary social relation to view the non-Western world as inhabited by The Other.|$|E
25|$|To {{perpetuate}} {{and facilitate}} {{control of the}} colonial enterprise, some colonized people, especially from among the <b>subaltern</b> peoples of the British Empire, were sent to attend university in the Imperial Motherland; they were to become the native-born, but Europeanised, ruling class of colonial satraps. Yet, after decolonization, their bicultural educations originated postcolonial criticism of empire and colonialism, and of the representations of the colonist and the colonized. In the late twentieth century, after {{the dissolution of the}} USSR (1991), the constituent soviet socialist republics became the literary subjects of postcolonial criticism, wherein the writers dealt with the legacies (cultural, social, economic) of the Russification of their peoples, countries, and cultures in service to Greater Russia.|$|E
25|$|Each field {{artillery}} regiment was originally organised as two batteries, each of two troops of six guns. This was changed late in 1940 to three batteries each of eight guns. Perhaps {{the most important}} element of a battery was the Forward Observation Officer (FOO), who directed fire. Unlike most armies of the period, in which artillery observers could only request fire support, a British Army FOO (who was supposedly a Captain but could even be a <b>subaltern)</b> could demand it, not merely from his own battery, but from the full regiment, or even the entire {{field artillery}} of a division if required. The artillery's organisation became very flexible and effective at rapidly providing and switching fire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1813, {{in the midst of}} the Napoleonic Wars, Fallmerayer decided to seek his fame in {{military}} service and joined the Bavarian infantry as a <b>subaltern.</b> He fought with distinction at Hanau on October 30, 1813, and served throughout the campaign in France. He remained in the army of occupation on the banks of the Rhine until the battle of Waterloo, when he spent six months at Orléans as adjutant to General von Spreti. Two years of garrison life at Lindau on Lake Constance convinced him that his desire for military glory could not be fulfilled, and he devoted himself instead to the study of modern Greek, Persian and Turkish.|$|E
25|$|In 1764, John Garland, another Irish {{engineer}} {{at the service of}} Spain who was military governor of Valdivia, convinced him to move to the neighbouring, and less established, colony of Chile as his assistant. He was initially commissioned as a junior <b>subaltern</b> in the Spanish army. In 1770, now in his late forties, the president of Chile appointed him captain of a column of cavalry to resist the attacks of the Araucanian Indians, whom he defeated, founding the fort of San Carlos in the south of the province of Arauco. He gained the good-will of the Indians by his humanity and benevolence, and recovered big swathes of territory that had been lost by the Spaniards.|$|E
25|$|Harold Stackard {{initially}} was a <b>subaltern</b> in the Royal Naval Division. He served {{for five months}} on HMS Oratava of the 10th Cruiser Squadron. After serving in France (1914) and Gallipoli (1915), he transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service in October 1916. On 7 December 1916, Stackard was promoted from Probationary Flight Officer to Flight Sub-Lieutenant. On 26 December 1916, he was the pilot of Bristol Scout (N5405) when its undercarriage collapsed upon landing at the Royal Naval Air Station at Redcar in Yorkshire. After his training was completed, the pilot spent eight months on the Western Front with No. 9 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service. Despite spending {{four years in the}} service, having been wounded, and having been credited with fifteen aerial victories, Stackard {{does not appear to have}} been decorated.|$|E
25|$|The Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was the women's {{branch of}} the British Army during the Second World War. Formed in September 1938, {{enlistment}} was open to woman aged 18 upwards who could enlist for general or local service (Local service they served in their own local area, General service they could be sent where they were needed and could be anywhere in the country). The ATS served in non combat roles as cooks, clerks and storewoman. Large numbers of ATS also served with the artillery divisions as crews for the guns, searchlights and barrage balloons. One notable ATS member was No. 230873 Second <b>Subaltern</b> Elizabeth Windsor, who trained as a driver and mechanic, drove a military truck, and rose {{to the rank of}} Junior Commander. She is the last surviving head of state who served in uniform during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Robertson later {{recorded}} that {{it would}} have been impossible to live as a cavalry <b>subaltern</b> in Britain, where £300 a year was needed in addition to the £120 official salary (approximately £30,000 and £12,000 at 2010 prices) to keep up the required lifestyle; he was reluctant to leave the cavalry, but his Regiment was deployed to India, where pay was higher and expenses lower than in the UK. Robertson's father made his uniforms and he economised by drinking water with meals and not smoking, as pipes were not permitted in the mess and he could not afford the cigars which officers were expected to smoke. Robertson supplemented his income by studying with native tutors whilst others slept during the hot afternoons, qualifying as an interpreter—for which officers received cash grants—in Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Pashto and Punjabi.|$|E
