5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most <b>sledge,</b> which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, {{and they decided to}} abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a <b>sledge</b> down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital <b>sledge.</b> As the rear <b>sledge</b> was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned <b>sledge</b> and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.|$|E

5|$|Great Britain {{entered a}} total of twenty athletes at the Games; three {{individuals}} in alpine skiing and teams of twelve athletes in ice <b>sledge</b> hockey and five athletes in wheelchair curling. The team won a single silver medal, in the debut sport of wheelchair curling, and finished seventeenth in the medal table. In addition to the medal there were top ten finishes from Sean Rose and Liz Miller, in alpine skiing, and the ice <b>sledge</b> hockey team.|$|E
5000|$|August Neidhardt von Gneisenau {{described}} a <b>sledging</b> of 10 km from Grenzbauden (Pomezní boudy) to Schmiedeberg (Kowary) already in 1817. Much earlier however heavy <b>sledges</b> already transported timber and hay whereas {{smaller and more}} manoeuvrable <b>sledges,</b> so called [...] "Hitsch'n", were used to get faster from the ridges down into the valleys. Races with both types of <b>sledges</b> were a popular pastime among the locals and became an attraction for tourists. As <b>sledging</b> {{became more and more}} popular competitions were organized, the most popular and earliest during the late 19th century in Johannisbad (Janské Lázně). Around 1900 3930 <b>sledges</b> with long horn-shaped runners and 6000 sport <b>sledges</b> were counted {{on both sides of the}} mountains.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sledging</b> {{is common}} at most {{levels of the}} game in Australia, but one Australian with a {{particular}} reputation for <b>sledging</b> was former fast bowler Merv Hughes. His intimidating and aggressive bowling style was often accompanied by a mixture of humorous witticisms, and vitriolic abuse. On occasions he crossed the line from <b>sledging</b> to insulting; however, there are numerous occasions of classic <b>sledges</b> delivered by Hughes.|$|R
25|$|There is {{debate in}} the cricketing world as to whether this {{constitutes}} poor sportsmanship or good-humoured banter. <b>Sledging</b> is sometimes interpreted as abuse, and it is acknowledged some comments aimed as <b>sledges</b> do sometimes cross the line into personal abuse, however, {{this is not always}} the case. <b>Sledging</b> can sometimes be a humorous attempt at distraction. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh referred to the practice as 'mental disintegration'.|$|R
5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the <b>sledge,</b> and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the <b>sledge</b> to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E
5|$|The {{additional}} turbo-propulseur {{patent application}} 13.502, dated 3 December 1910, was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With {{the help of}} Despujols, a boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, Coandă supervised {{the building of a}} motor sled, powered by a 30hp (22kW) Gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur. The <b>sledge</b> was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand. A number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the <b>sledge.</b> A version of Coandă's turbo-propulseur design was shown {{for the second time in}} late 1910 at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the <b>sledge</b> being tested.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a <b>sledge</b> journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the <b>sledge,</b> and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Booth {{returned}} to the public spotlight when he condemned the <b>sledging,</b> or verbal intimidation tactics, {{that are used in}} modern cricket. He stated [...] "I can't remember in the games that I played in, I can't ever remember being <b>sledged,</b> and I can't ever remember <b>sledging</b> anybody", in reference to Steve Waugh's Australian team, which was perceived as being too hostile. In the Australian edition of the 2002 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he wrote a chapter titled [...] "The Curse of Sledging".|$|R
500|$|The sun {{set over}} Framheim on 21April, not to {{reappear}} for four months. Amundsen was {{mindful of the}} boredom and loss of morale that had blighted the Belgica expedition's winter in the ice, and {{although there was no}} possibility of <b>sledging</b> he ensured that the shore party kept busy. One urgent task was to improve the <b>sledges,</b> which had not worked well during the depot journeys. In addition to those [...] chosen specifically for the expedition, Amundsen had brought along several <b>sledges</b> from Sverdrup's 1898–1902 Fram expedition, which he now thought would be better suited to the task ahead. [...] Bjaaland reduced the weight of these older <b>sledges</b> by almost a third by planing down the timber, and also constructed three <b>sledges</b> of his own from some spare hickory wood. The adapted <b>sledges</b> were to be used to cross the Barrier, while Bjaaland's new set would be used {{in the final stages of}} the journey, across the polar plateau itself. [...] Johansen prepared the <b>sledging</b> rations (42,000biscuits, 1,320tins of pemmican and about [...] of chocolate), while other men worked on improving the boots, cooking equipment, goggles, skis and tents. To combat the dangers of scurvy, twice a day the men ate seal meat that had been collected and frozen in quantities before the onset of winter. The cook, Lindstrøm, supplemented the vitamin C intake with bottled cloudberries and blueberries, and provided wholemeal bread made with fresh yeast, rich in B vitamins.|$|R

5|$|Ice <b>sledge</b> {{hockey is}} open only to male {{competitors}} with a physical disability {{in the lower}} part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the <b>sledge.</b> They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their upper and lower limbs.|$|E
5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor <b>sledge</b> was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a <b>sledge,</b> fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Tender Mercies is a 1983 American drama film {{directed}} by Bruce Beresford. The screenplay by Horton Foote focuses on Mac <b>Sledge,</b> a recovering alcoholic country music singer who seeks {{to turn his}} life around through his relationship with a young widow and her son in rural Texas. Robert Duvall {{plays the role of}} Mac; the supporting cast includes Tess Harper, Betty Buckley, Wilford Brimley, Ellen Barkin and Allan Hubbard.|$|E
50|$|Whetter {{was chosen}} to {{accompany}} engineer Frank Bickerton and cartographer Alfred Hodgeman on a summer <b>sledging</b> party to explore the area {{to the west of}} the hut. This Western party would leave base on 3 December and use the air-tractor sledge—a wingless aeroplane taken on the AAE—haul a train of four <b>sledges.</b> However, the air-tractor broke down after just 10 mi, and the party continued without it. On the third day, man-hauling one of the <b>sledges,</b> the party discovered the Adélie Land meteorite, the first meteorite to be found in Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|On Scott's second {{expedition}} in Terra Nova in 1911-1913, Lashly {{was initially}} {{in charge of}} one of the expedition's two motor <b>sledges</b> which were to haul supplies southward in support of the polar party. However, the <b>sledges</b> quickly broke down, and the motor party had to switch to man-hauling the supplies.|$|R

5|$|Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the {{seventeen}} dogs left Cape Denison {{early in}} the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later. Stopping for the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half {{the weight of the}} party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third <b>sledge,</b> towed by the second dog team.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's <b>sledge</b> dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his <b>sledge,</b> with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
5|$|Mac <b>Sledge</b> (Robert Duvall), a washed up, {{alcoholic}} country singer, awakens at {{a run-down}} Texas roadside motel and gas station {{after a night}} of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange for a room. Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{was given}} {{leave from the}} Navy to write the {{official}} expedition account, The Voyage of the Discovery; this was published in 1905, and sold well. However, Scott's account {{in the book of}} Shackleton's breakdown during the southern journey led to disagreement between the two men, particularly over Scott's version {{of the extent to which}} his companion had been carried on the <b>sledge.</b> The implication was that Shackleton's breakdown had caused the relatively unimpressive southern record.|$|E

5|$|Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after {{inspection}} by HRH the Duke of York (the future King George V), {{who presented}} a Union Flag. Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions {{the ship was}} carrying Siberian <b>sledge</b> dogs, {{the first to be}} taken on an Antarctic expedition. After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the Antarctic Circle on 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the pack ice for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.|$|E
5|$|The Motown Record Corporation in Detroit, Michigan became {{successful}} {{with a string}} of heavily pop-influenced soul records, which were palatable enough to white listeners so as to allow R and soul to crossover to mainstream audiences. An important center of soul music recording was Florence, Alabama, where the FAME Studios operated. Jimmy Hughes, Percy <b>Sledge</b> and Arthur Alexander recorded at Fame; later in the 1960s, Aretha Franklin would also record in the area. Fame Studios, often referred to as Muscle Shoals, after a town neighboring Florence, enjoyed a close relationship with Stax, and many of the musicians and producers who worked in Memphis also contributed to recordings done in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} rest of the 1894–95 winter {{preparing}} clothing and equipment for the forthcoming <b>sledge</b> journey. Kayaks were built, to be carried on the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water. Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing that the vessel would be crushed, but Fram proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895 the ship's position was 83°34′N, above Greely's previous Farthest North record of 83°24.|$|E
