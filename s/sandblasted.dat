40|$|Abstract. Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different surface treatments on the microstructural and crystallographic changes of dental 3 Y-TZP ceramics. Methods: 21 pieces of zirconia specimens (15 × 15 × 1. 5 mm) were prepared and divided into 7 groups: control group; grinding group; polishing group; <b>sandblasting</b> group; <b>sandblasting</b> + veneer porcelain sintering group; <b>sandblasting</b> + veneer porcelain sintering twice group and <b>sandblasting</b> + annealing group. The crystal structure of specimen was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) before morphological observation with scanning electron microscope. Results: monoclinic phase increased after grinding while decreased little after polishing, bigger phase change presented after <b>sandblasting</b> compared with decreased phase change induced by veneer porcelain sintering; annealing eradicated the surface m phase. Grinding produced coarse scratches {{on the surface of}} samples with removal of surface particles; after grinding and polishing to 7 um level, the surface particles were removed massively, and the surface became smooth with remaining scare scratches and substantial micro cracks. <b>Sandblasting</b> removed scratches near completely producing coarse and irregular surface of samples.

The scope of work include tungsten carbide as cutting tool, silicon carbide for <b>sandblast</b> pre-treatment, PVD coating process and machining by turning operation.

Besides, the machining test performance shows the coated carbide with <b>sandblasting</b> surface pre-treatment provided longer tool’s life compared to original tungsten carbide and coated tungsten carbide without pre-treatment cutting tools. In addition, the micro hardness test indicated that average Vickers micro hardness of original tungsten carbide specimen was 863. 433 HV while coated carbide with <b>sandblasting</b> pre-treatment specimen was 1464. 9 HV. In surface roughness test, the surface roughness of tungsten carbide increase after subjected to pre-treatment but decrease after undergoes coating process.

40|$|Numerous parameterizations {{have been}} {{developed}} for predicting wind erosion, yet the physical mechanism of dust emission is not fully understood. <b>Sandblasting</b> is thought to be the primary mechanism, but recent studies suggest that dust emission by direct aerodynamic entrainment can be significant under certain conditions. In this work, using wind tunnel experiments, we investigated some of the lesser understood aspects of dust emission in <b>sandblasting</b> and aerodynamic entrainment for three soil types, namely clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam. First, we explored the role of erodible surface roughness on dust emitted by aerodynamic entrainment. Second, we compared the emitted dust concentration in <b>sandblasting</b> and aerodynamic entrainment under a range of wind friction velocities. Finally, we explored the sensitivity of emitted dust particle size distribution (PSD) to soil type and wind friction velocity in these two processes. The dust concentration in aerodynamic entrainment showed strong positive correlation, no significant correlation, and weak negative correlation, for the clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam, respectively, with the erodible soil surface roughness. The dust in aerodynamic entrainment was significant constituting up to 28. 3, 41. 4, and 146. 4 % compared to <b>sandblasting</b> for the clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam, respectively. PSD of emitted dust was sensitive to soil type in both <b>sandblasting</b> and aerodynamic entrainment.
