50|$|Heteranthera dubia is {{a species}} of aquatic plant known by the common names water <b>stargrass</b> and grassleaf mudplantain. It is native to North and Central America where it is {{widespread}} from Canada to Guatemala. It lives submersed in freshwater such as rivers and lakes. It is quite variable in appearance. The leaves are different sizes and shapes across individuals, partly genetic variation and partly response to water conditions, for example, the speed and turbulence of surrounding currents. Submersed individuals also have a different stem and leaf morphology from those that occur partially or {{completely out of the}} water. The inflorescence bears a single short-lived flower that blooms in the morning and wilts in the evening. It has six yellow perianth parts each less than a centimeter long spreading from a tubular throat one to seven centimeters long. There are three long, thick yellow stamens with curling anthers and one yellow style. The fruit is a capsule containing many winged seeds. The plant sometimes has galls in its tissue, which are caused by the parasitic fungus Membranosorus heterantherae.|$|E

40|$|Dairy {{farms in}} the San Carlos region of Costa Rica {{commonly}} utilize <b>stargrass</b> (Cynodon nlemfuensis) with a stocking rate averaging 2. 6 animals/ha/year. The research site was located in Aguas Zarcas, Costa Rica, and received an average annual precipitation of 432 cm. This location is characterized as a humid tropical biome. Serious soil compaction due to cattle traffic was evident through redoximorphic features beginning at 7. 5 cm below the soil surface in the <b>stargrass</b> dairy pastures; therefore, we hypothesized that compaction may be impeding forage production by diminished root growth and nutrient uptake. The objectives of this one year study were to characterize existing pasture conditions with regard to soil physical properties, and {{to determine the effect}} of stocking density, deep tillage, and fertilizer rate on soil bulk density, forage yield, and forage quality. Nine <b>stargrass</b> pastures with three different stocking densities were studied to assess the effect of tillage and fertilizer rate on forage yield and quality. The experimental design was such that the whole plot treatments where high (385 head/ha), medium (192 head/ha), and low (128 head/ha) stocking density. Stocking density treatments were not randomized due to limitations of management practices; however for experimental design purposes we treated them as randomized. The sub plot treatment was tillage, where each pasture was divided in half with deep tillage (35 cm) applied to one subplot and no tillage treatment on the other subplots. The sub-sub plot treatments were three fertilizer treatments; no fertilizer, 50 % of the recommended fertilizer rate, and the recommended fertilizer rate. Soil bulk density was measured at three depths before tillage, one month after tillage, and one year after tillage. Bulk density samples were taken at the soil surface, 7. 5 cm, 18 cm, and measured 0. 8 Mg/m 3, 0. 9 Mg/m 3, and 0. 9 Mg/m 3 for the three depths respectively, before treatments were in place. There were no statistical differences between tillage treatments for soil bulk density. Bulk density was not consistently measured in the tillage furrow, and so it might not have accurately measured tillage results. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments for forage yield. Additionally, stocking density was the only treatment with statistically significant differences for forage quality. The highest stocking density plots had the best forage quality (p≤ 0. 05). Seasonal differences in forage production were consistent with weather patterns. Rainy season forage production yielded more, with poorer quality than the semi-dry season. Pasture yield averaged 4225 kg/ha for rainy months, 3582 kg/ha for semi-dry months, and ranged from 3056 to 5691 kg/ha each month. ...|$|E

The experiment was a randomized complete block design with six treatments replicated four times. Treatments consisted of six cutting periods every 10 days, with the first cut 20 days after staging. Data, analysed at a probability level of P < 0. 05, showed that dry matter production incresed quadratically between 20 and 70 days of regrowth, whereas dry matter concentration increased cubically.

Conversely, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber concentrations increased quadratically.

40|$|The n-alkanes {{have been}} used to {{estimate}} forage dry matter intake, digestibility and the diet composition in grazing animals. The objective this study was to compare chromium oxide and n-alkanes techniques used to estimate forage intake. Twenty lactating dual-purpose cows receiving two sources of fat (treatments: conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) or Megalac (control)) plus 4 kg of concentrate were dosed with n-alkanes and chromium oxide to estimate the intake of <b>stargrass</b> (Cynodon nlemfüensis Vanderyst var. nlemfüensis). The in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility of the <b>stargrass</b> and concentrate were used to estimate the nutritive value of the digesta. The n-alkanes between C 23 and C 36 were quantified in the digesta and feces. The regression between metabolizable energy requirement (MEr, Mcal d- 1) and supply derived from forage DM intake estimated using chromium oxide was ME IntakeCr = 19. 1 + 0. 62 MEr (R² = 0. 27) and the same relationship estimated using C 35 :C 36 n-alkane ratio was ME IntakeC 35 :C 36 = 9. 3 + 0. 77 MEr (R² = 0. 52). There was a treatment effect on fecal concentration of chromium oxide with daily and period variations. For the n-alkane technique, treatment and period effects and a linear effect of day of collection on the fecal concentrations of C 35 were found. For C 36 fecal concentrations, there was a treatment effect and a quadratic effect of collection day. There was no treatment effect on the fecal concentration of the C 35 :C 36 ratio, but a period effect and a linear effect of day of collection were found. Estimates of daily intake using the two markers were different, but those obtained using the C 35 :C 36 pair of n-alkanes were more precise than those obtained using chromium oxide and in vitro digestibility.

40|$|Genetic {{conservation}} of vegetatively-propagated grasses requires intensive care of pot cultures or carefully separated field plots. Even with intensive care, there is {{high risk of}} mechanical contamination and loss of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses.

The experiment was conducted at Pesagro (Serop&# 233;dica, Rio de Janeiro State) between April 2012 and January 2013. The grazing (GT), rumination (RT) and idling (IT) times were evaluated every 10 minutes throughout a 24 -hour period. Forage samples were collected {{for the analysis of}} chemical composition and for leaf:stem ratio determination. Dry bulb, wet bulb and black globe temperatures were evaluated every hour along with the relative humidity, during grazing to characterize the environment and calculate the Black Globe Humidity Index (BGHI). The mean grazing time (6 hours) was inversely related to sward height. The rumination time was associated with lignin content, in autumn and spring. The mean idle time (9 hours) was related to the grazing time. Animals became tolerant to climatic variations, as GT, RT and IT showed no temporal variations.
