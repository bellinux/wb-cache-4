5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and <b>sorption</b> from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its <b>sorption</b> of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|The EMC of wood {{varies with}} the ambient {{relative}} humidity (a function of temperature) significantly, {{to a lesser degree}} with the temperature. Siau (1984) reported that the EMC also varies very slightly with species, mechanical stress, drying history of wood, density, extractives content and the direction of <b>sorption</b> in which the moisture change takes place (i.e. adsorption or desorption).|$|E
25|$|Adsorption is the {{adhesion}} of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or {{dissolved solid}} to a surface. This process creates {{a film of}} the adsorbate {{on the surface of}} the adsorbent. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the absorbate) is dissolved by or permeates a liquid or solid (the absorbent), respectively. Adsorption is a surface-based process while absorption involves the whole volume of the material. The term <b>sorption</b> encompasses both processes, while desorption is the reverse of it. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption {{is present}} in many natural, physical, {{biological}} and chemical systems and is widely used in industrial applications such as heterogeneous catalysts, activated charcoal, capturing and using waste heat to provide cold water for air conditioning and other process requirements (adsorption chillers), synthetic resins, increasing storage capacity of carbide-derived carbons and water purification. Adsorption, ion exchange and chromatography are <b>sorption</b> processes in which certain adsorbates are selectively transferred from the fluid phase {{to the surface of}} insoluble, rigid particles suspended in a vessel or packed in a column. Pharmaceutical industry applications, which use adsorption as a means to prolong neurological exposure to specific drugs or parts thereof, are lesser known.|$|E
25|$|Pesticides and {{herbicides}} {{are applied}} to agricultural land to control pests that disrupt crop production. Soil contamination can occur when pesticides persist and accumulate in soils, which can alter microbial processes, increase plant uptake of the chemical, and also cause toxicity to soil organisms. The {{extent to which the}} pesticides and herbicides persist depends on the compound’s unique chemistry, which affects <b>sorption</b> dynamics and resulting fate and transport in the soil environment. Pesticides can also accumulate in animals that eat contaminated pests and soil organisms. In addition, pesticides can be more harmful to beneficial insects, such as pollinators, and to natural enemies of pests (i.e. insects that prey on or parasitize pests) than they are to the target pests themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals in the clinker arises {{both from the}} natural raw materials and {{from the use of}} recycled by-products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 < pH < 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their <b>sorption</b> onto the cement mineral phases. Nickel, zinc and lead are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations. Chromium may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground. As chromate (CrO42−) is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration, it is sometimes reduced into trivalent Cr(III) by addition of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4).|$|E

2500|$|After these {{products}} are properly disposed, the process of treating them for minimizing environmental effect begins. Water treatment facilities use different processes {{in order to minimize}} or fully eliminate the amount of these pollutants. This is done by using <b>sorption</b> where suspended solids are removed by sedimentation. [...] Another method used is biodegradation, and through this method microorganisms, such as bacteria, feed or break down these pollutants thus eliminating them from the contaminated media.|$|E
2500|$|Glyphosate adsorbs {{strongly}} to soil, and residues {{are expected to}} generally be immobile in soil. Ground and surface water pollution is limited. Glyphosate is readily degraded by soil microbes to aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA, which like glyphosate strongly adsorbs to soil solids and is thus unlikely to leach to groundwater). Though both glyphosate and AMPA are commonly detected in water bodies, {{a portion of the}} AMPA detected may actually be the result of degradation of detergents rather than from glyphosate. Glyphosate does have the potential to contaminate surface waters due to its aquatic use patterns and through erosion, as it adsorbs to soil particles suspended in runoff. The mechanism of glyphosate <b>sorption</b> to soil {{is similar to that of}} phosphate fertilizers, the presence of which can reduce glyphosate <b>sorption.</b> Phosphate fertilizers are subject to release from sediments into water bodies under [...] conditions, and similar release can also occur with glyphosate, though significant impact of glyphosate release from sediments has not been established. Limited leaching can occur after high rainfall after application. If glyphosate reaches surface water, it is not broken down readily by water or sunlight.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{studies have}} shown that the {{mobility}} of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower “than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the <b>sorption</b> process.” [...] Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent. The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from “sorption and desorption isotherm models determined with humic acids, in aquifer sediments, and soils”. [...] From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.|$|E
2500|$|Chemical {{cartridge}} respirators use a cartridge {{to remove}} gases, {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), and other vapors from breathing air by adsorption, absorption, or chemisorption. [...] A typical organic vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40nbsp&grams of <b>sorption</b> media such as activated charcoal or certain resins. [...] The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer. [...] When filter cartridges become saturated or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.|$|E

50|$|At equilibrium, the {{relationship}} between water content and equilibrium humidity of a material can be displayed graphically by a curve, the so-called moisture <b>sorption</b> isotherm. For each humidity value, a <b>sorption</b> isotherm indicates the corresponding water content value at a given, constant temperature. If the composition or quality of the material changes, then its <b>sorption</b> behaviour also changes. Because {{of the complexity of}} <b>sorption</b> processes, the isotherms cannot be determined by calculation, but must be recorded experimentally for each product.|$|E

50|$|DVS {{measurement}} has applications over a {{wide range}} of industries. Both equilibrium vapor <b>sorption</b> isotherms and vapor <b>sorption</b> kinetic results can yield vital information for materials ranging from pharmaceuticals to fuel cells. Although water <b>sorption</b> experiments are most common, the use of organic vapor in DVS experiments can reveal additional sample properties. The below sections highlight how DVS experiments are utilized in several industries.|$|E

50|$|Immobilization of the {{contaminant}} {{may occur}} through <b>sorption</b> to the barrier materials or precipitation from the dissolved state. Organic compounds {{tend to be}} undergo <b>sorption</b> due to hydrophobic expulsion from the surrounding water. Metals, however, tend to sorb through electrostatic attraction or surface complexation reactions. <b>Sorption</b> and precipitation are potentially reversible and may thus require removal of the reactive medium and gathered products {{in order to continue}} with remediation.|$|E
50|$|Oyanedel-Craver and Smith {{have studied}} <b>sorption</b> of four heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg) to 3 kinds of {{bentonite}} clay. The overall {{conclusion of the}} study was that the organoclays studied have considerable capacity for heavy metal <b>sorption.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since {{almost all}} adsorptive {{separation}} processes are dynamic -meaning, {{that they are}} running under flow - testing porous materials for those applications for their separation performance has to be tested under flow as well. Since separation processes run with mixtures of different components, measuring several breakthrough curves results in thermodynamic mixture equilibria - mixture <b>sorption</b> isotherms, that are hardly accessible with static manometric <b>sorption</b> characterization. This enables the determination of <b>sorption</b> selectivities in gaseous and liquid phase.|$|E
5000|$|The {{moisture}} <b>sorption</b> {{properties of}} pharmaceutical {{materials such as}} excipients, drug formulations and packaging films are recognized as critical factors in determining their storage, stability, processing and application performance.

50|$|The main {{application}} of DVS is to measure water <b>sorption</b> isotherms. In general, a vapor <b>sorption</b> isotherm shows the equilibrium amount of vapor sorbed {{as a function}} of steady state relative vapor pressure at a constant temperature. For water <b>sorption</b> isotherms, water relative vapor pressure is more commonly expressed as relative humidity. In a DVS experiment this is accomplished by exposing a sample to a series of step changes in relative humidity and monitoring the mass change {{as a function of}} time. The sample mass must be allowed to reach gravimetric equilibrium at each step change in humidity before progressing to the next humidity level. Then, the equilibrium mass values at each relative humidity step are used to generate the isotherm. Isotherms are typically divided into two components: <b>sorption</b> for increasing humidity steps and desorption for decreasing humidity steps. <b>Sorption</b> can be further divided into adsorption (sorbate located on the surface) and absorption (sorbate penetrates the bulk).|$|E

50|$|From {{the thermal}} powers {{registered}} in the two chambers one can calculate the partial molar enthalpy of mixing of water.During the <b>sorption</b> experiment the water content in the sample increases until it reaches a value high {{enough to make the}} process of diffusion of water vapor between the chambers very slow.

50|$|Figure 1 shows {{a typical}} water <b>sorption</b> {{result from a}} DVS {{experiment}} for a microcrystalline cellulose sample.

The equilibrium mass values {{at the end of each}} humidity step were used to calculate the <b>sorption</b> and desorption isotherms (Figure 1b). The difference in water vapor uptake between the <b>sorption</b> and desorption isotherms is called the hysteresis. The shape and location of the isotherm hysteresis can elucidate information about the <b>sorption</b> mechanism and sample porosity. Although an isotherm experiment is the most common use of a DVS instrument, humidity (or other vapor) ramping experiments can be performed to investigate vapor-induced phase changes. These changes include: glassy to rubbery transitions, amorphous to crystalline conversions, and sample deliquescence.|$|E
