This then, we call God (Note: Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself).|$|E
25|$|Lewis is a gold prospector, who hasn't {{had much}} luck. After trading his land claim, with Fergus for a pocket knife, {{he now has}} nothing and spends his time {{painting}} his life story {{on the walls of}} a sea cave. Fergus still gripped with gold fever tries to reason with Lewis and realises that <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> more important than gold. In 1997 the children visit an art gallery, and see a painting by Lewis Bast, the same Lewis from 1867. The painting is of an unknown girl, but the children notice that the girl is Constance.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E

25|$|The wild {{worship of}} {{lawlessness}} and the materialist worship of law {{end in the}} same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy {{in the land of}} nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.|$|E

500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E

Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, [...] "Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for {{some of the things that}} have happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E

[...] A member of the IGN staff wrote in a season two review that [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] {{is one of the}} [...] "real winners {{to be found in the}} second season." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the most memorable line of the episode was Homer's idea of the perfect car, [...] "You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car! And <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> so snazzy they never go out of style — like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!" ...|$|E

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title.

When Will keeps {{ignoring}} her advances and is continuously hostile, he reveals that she was horrible to him in high school. Will also eventually reveals that during high school, he and Ross initiated the episode's titular rumor: that Rachel is a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school, and {{even went so far as}} to reach Chandler's high school. Rachel reacts tearfully, claiming she never hurt Ross in high school, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though Ross shockingly reveals that this is in fact true, much to everyone's amusement and disgust. Monica comforts Rachel, saying that despite the rumor, she was still the most popular girl in their high school and reminds Ross that due to his rumor, he was 'put on the map' in the school. She then reminds Ross and Rachel that they are having a baby together and that <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> more important than high school. Will feels betrayed that Ross had a relationship with Rachel but then that turns to a high five when he discovers that Ross [...] "knocked her up but did not marry her." [...] Ultimately the characters settle their differences. The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey wearing Phoebe's-turned-Rachel's maternity pants and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.|$|E

[...] " [...] just a world where people love people for who they are and not what they are and that creates such a broad variety of characters. It is representative of the world that we live in today, but it also doesn't make it out to be this statement—it's not a social/cultural statement," [...] she said.

Together with Anderson's childhood friend Mat Osman, they decided they had {{the core of a}} band, and spent hours a day playing songs by Roxy Music, The Smiths, David Bowie and The Cure. After deciding that neither Anderson nor Frischmann had the skill to be a lead guitarist, the band placed an advert in NME in the magazine's 28 October 1989 issue seeking to fill the position: [...] "Young guitar player needed by London based band. Smiths, Commotions, Bowie, Pet Shop Boys. No Musos. <b>Some</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> more important than ability. Call Brett." [...] The advert attracted the interest of nineteen-year-old Bernard Butler, who soon auditioned to join the band. The band settled on the name Suede. Lacking a drummer, the band initially used a drum machine. Despite Frischmann's efforts as the band's de facto manager, the band primarily played small-scale gigs around Camden Town in London.|$|E

[...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. [...] "Thinking about what that means to me and all the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," [...] I noted. [...] "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings." ...|$|E
