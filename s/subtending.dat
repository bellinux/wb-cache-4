Of the South America genera, a number have common features (tunicate bulbs, inflorescences with unarticulated pedicels, {{and one or}} two bracts <b>subtending</b> the inflorescence). These are Ipheion Raf., Leucocoryne Lindl., Nothoscordum Kunth, Tristagma Poepp., and Zoellnerallium Crosa. The position of Ipheion is particularly problematic.|$|E

500|$|In {{the broad}} field of mathematics, Shen Kuo {{mastered}} many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry, circle packing, and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry. Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, {{as large as}} 1043. Shen's [...] "technique of small increments" [...] laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series. Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be piled in layers in a space shaped like the frustum of a rectangular pyramid. In his formula [...] "technique of intersecting circles", he created an approximation of the {{arc of a circle}} s given the diameter d, sagitta v, and length of the chord c <b>subtending</b> the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d. Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231–1316). He also simplified the counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298). Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen's method of [...] "dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2," [...] was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition [...] "9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2".|$|E

2500|$|In Hindu astronomy, {{there was}} an older {{tradition}} of 28 Nakshatras which were used as celestial markers in the heavens. When these were mapped into equal divisions of the ecliptic, a division of 27 portions was adopted since {{that resulted in a}} cleaner definition of each portion (i.e. segment) <b>subtending</b> 13° 20' (as opposed to 12° 51 3/7’ in the case of 28 segments).

50|$|In geometry, {{an angle}} <b>subtended</b> by an arc, line segment, or other curve is one whose two rays {{pass through the}} {{endpoints}} of the arc. The precise meaning varies with the context.

A simple theorem of plane geometry states that arcs of equal lengths <b>subtend</b> equal angles in such a situation.|$|R
60|$|The {{rivers of}} our region are of three kinds; little surface drains principally in the north; broad {{estuaries}} like the Mersey and many streams of Eastern Scotland {{in the central}} parts, and a single bed, the Ogobe, breaking through the <b>subtending</b> Ghats, and forming a huge lagoon-delta. Beginning at Camarones are the Boroa and Borba Waters, with the Rio de Campo, fifteen leagues further south; of these little is known, except that they fall into the Bight of Panari or Pannaria.|$|E

50|$|Radian {{describes}} the plane angle <b>subtended</b> by a circular arc as {{the length of}} the arc divided by the radius of the arc. One radian is the angle <b>subtended</b> {{at the center of a}} circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius of the circle. More generally, the magnitude in radians of such a <b>subtended</b> angle is equal to the ratio of the arc length to the radius of the circle; that is, θ = s / r, where θ is the <b>subtended</b> angle in radians, s is arc length, and r is radius.

We ascertained, by inquiry, that the former has an extent wholly unsuspected by Dr. Wallin and by the first Expedition; and that a careful examination of it is highly desirable.
