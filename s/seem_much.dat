It cites, among other sources, Bell's theorem and Alain Aspect's experimental proof of Bell's {{to suggest that}} mainstream science has a strong materialist bias, and that in fact modern physics may have already disproved materialist metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mean}} time, Colonel Marwitz had been menaced by {{the advance of}} a {{considerable}} line of French cavalry and a battery, which latter annoyed him but little. This cavalry did not, however, <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> disposed to risk a close encounter: once it put forward a detachment, which was overthrown by two Squadrons of the 7th and 8th Uhlans, and then a regiment of French Chasseurs à Cheval fell upon the skirmishers of the 2nd Regiment of Infantry, but was driven back by two squadrons of the 5th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} new Liberalism did not <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more piquant or fertile than the respectable old. As it happened, in the fulness of time our {{distinguished}} apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with {{a share in}} the finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover no better way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not without a trace of arbitrary proscription) from the opposing party that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.|$|E

25|$|Blacklights are {{a subset}} of {{fluorescent}} lamps {{that are used to}} provide near ultraviolet light (at about 360nm wavelength). They are built in the same fashion as conventional fluorescent lamps but the glass tube is coated with a phosphor that converts the short-wave UV within the tube to long-wave UV rather than to visible light. They are used to provoke fluorescence (to provide dramatic effects using blacklight paint and to detect materials such as urine and certain dyes that would be invisible in visible light) as well as to attract insects to bug zappers. So-called blacklite blue lamps are also made from more expensive deep purple glass known as Wood's glass rather than clear glass. The deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge, producing proportionally less visible light compared with UV light. This allows UV-induced fluorescence to be seen more easily (thereby allowing blacklight posters to <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more dramatic). The blacklight lamps used in bug zappers do not require this refinement so it is usually omitted in the interest of cost; they are called simply blacklite (and not blacklite blue).|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} {{received}} generally favorable reviews. [...] Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it [...] "a rollicking musical memoir.... Weller's inventions make this Hair <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> funnier than I remember the show's having been. They also provide {{time and space}} {{for the development of}} characters who, on the stage, had to express themselves almost entirely in song.... he entire cast is superb.... Mostly... the film is a delight." ...|$|E

Chris Richards of The Washington Post chose the song as a highlight on the album commenting that [...] "'The Edge of Glory' makes a song like 'Government Hooker' <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more daring than it actually is". Caryn Ganz of Spin said that Lady Gaga's eccentric and outlandish persona—the so-called [...] "nutty come-ons"—were apparent in the [...] "grimy doom disco" [...] of [...] "Government Hooker". Christian Blauvelt of Entertainment Weekly described the song's chorus as [...] "an infectious raver with a killer hook [...] is pretty irresistible." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club gave the episode an overall score of C-, saying that at points the episode just got {{annoying}} especially when Troi was describing Armus' feelings. He thought that Yar's death scene was out of place in the episode and that overall Armus was unthreatening, saying [...] "Murdering Yar should make Armus <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more dangerous, but he's just so whiny and petulant and bland that he could've killed half a dozen cast members without leaving an impression." [...] Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that Yar's death was [...] "pointless", but thought that it was in a manner suitable for a security officer in Star Trek. He also felt that it was one of Troi's better episodes, but that Armus [...] "fails in every possible way as a villain, and that’s entirely on the backs of the people doing the visual effects and the voice casting." ...|$|E
500|$|In Iceland, {{expression}} {{of belief in}} the huldufólk ("hidden people"), elves that dwell in rock formations, is still relatively common. Even when Icelanders do not explicitly express their belief, they are often reluctant to express disbelief. A 2006 and 2007 study by the University of Iceland’s Faculty of Social Sciences revealed that many would {{not rule out the}} existence of elves and ghosts, a result similar to a 1974 survey by Erlendur Haraldsson. The lead researcher of the 2006–2007 study, Terry Gunnell, stated: [...] "Icelanders <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations". Whether significant numbers of Icelandic people do believe in elves or not, elves are certainly prominent in national discourses. They occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house- and road-building. In the analysis of Valdimar Tr. Hafstein, [...] "narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture. The elves fend off, with more or less success, the attacks and advances of modern technology, palpable in the bulldozer." [...] Elves are also prominent, in similar roles, in contemporary Icelandic literature.|$|E
2500|$|This {{becomes the}} main {{difference}} and, also, similarity between Menander and Plautus. They both address [...] "situations that tend to develop in the bosom of the family". Both authors, through their plays, reflect a patriarchal society in which the father-son relationship is essential to proper function {{and development of the}} household. It is no longer a political statement, as in Old Comedy, but a statement about household relations and proper behavior between a father and his son. But the attitudes on these relationships <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> different—a reflection of how the worlds of Menander and Plautus differed.|$|E

2500|$|As the Great Depression {{ended in}} the United States, world affairs worsened and spun the globe toward World War II. [...] After almost 26 years {{at the helm of}} the San Antonio Brewing Association, Emma Koehler decided it was time to {{relinquish}} the official title. [...] Her “retirement” closed an amazing chapter in the brewery's history. [...] While it may not <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> these days, Emma’s successful management role at Pearl was a breakthrough for its day. [...] At a time when women's suffrage was still in its infancy and women did not yet have the right to vote, Emma Koehler led Texas’ largest brewery and one of the larger breweries in the nation.|$|E
2500|$|The public {{revelation of}} Greece's {{military}} weakness {{also made the}} Bulgarians <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more menacing, as the spearhead of a shadowy Pan-Slav threat from the North; and while the Ethniki Etaireia might be blamed for starting the war, {{it was far from}} clear who had been responsible for losing it. [...] "The population as a whole became disillusioned, charges were hurled in all directions, recriminations proliferated like a plague and scapegoats were sought even among those least responsible. ... politicians and army leaders alike were attacked by a most vociferous press which, possibly with the exception of Gavriilidis' Akropolis, paid scant regard to its responsibility as the Fourth Estate." [...] (Carabott 1993 p.118) Participants in the language debate could not help being drawn into this political snake-pit.|$|E
2500|$|Considered on {{its merits}} as a [...] "flying" [...] film that is [...] "well worth seeing", later {{aviation}} film reviewers likewise bemoaned the [...] "typical story about personal conflict and a woman's faith that infected all too many flying films." [...] Following {{up on the}} art-or-artifice depiction, latter-day reviewer Christopher McQuain states that, [...] "Finding anything of interest in 'Toward the Unknown' depends on whether you consider the film as art or artifact; {{it is not a}} good movie, but it is a fascinating, revealing one. It is utterly transparent Cold War propaganda, with delighted displays of military aircraft in action, an eager, anxious glimpse forward to the Space Race, and an interest in human-scale affairs so desultory as to make the machines and the ability to build and fly them <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more important than the complications and consequences of militarism and war waged ..." ...|$|E

I can’t deny it…. [...] there’s more edge under some of my soft {{language}} than people realize.” [...] Because almost all of Tyler’s work covers the same territory—family and marriage relationships—and are located in the same setting, she has come under criticism for being repetitive and formulaic. [...] Reviewing The Patchwork Planet, Kakutani states: “Ms. Tyler's earlier characters tended to be situated within a thick matrix of finely nuanced familial relationships that helped define both their dreams and their limitations; the people in this novel, in contrast, <b>seem</b> <b>much</b> more like lone wolves, pulled this way and that by the author's puppet strings….Ms. Tyler’s famous ability to limn the daily minutiae of life also feels weary and formulaic this time around….As for the little details Ms. Tyler sprinkles over her story…they, too, have a paint-by-numbers touch. They add up to a patchwork novel that feels hokey, mechanical [...] [...] [...] and yes, too cute.|$|E
