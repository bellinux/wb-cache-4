25|$|Stereoscopic {{displays}} {{were developed}} based on liquid crystal polarized spectacles, {{and while this}} had been very expensive on the PS2, it now became a commodity item. A common alternative was to add a polarizable screen {{to the front of}} the display and to provide viewers with extremely cheap spectacles with orthogonal polarization for separate eyes. With projectors such as Barco, it was possible to project <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>display</b> onto special silvered screens and supply an audience of hundreds with spectacles. In this way molecular graphics became universally known within large sectors of chemical and biochemical science, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the backgrounds of many displays were black by default, it was common for modelling sessions and lectures to be held with almost all lighting turned off.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review {{empirical}} studies that investigate performance effects of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays</b> for medical applications. We focus on four distinct application areas: diagnosis, pre-operative planning, {{minimally invasive surgery}} (MIS) and training/teaching. For diagnosis, <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays</b> can augment the understanding of complex spatial structures and increase the detection of abnormalities. Stereoscopic viewing of medical data has proven to increase the detection rate in breast imaging. A stereoscopic presentation of noisy and transparent images in 3 D ultrasound results in better visualization of the internal structures, however more empirical {{studies are needed to}} confirm the clinical relevance. For MRI and CT, where images are frequently rendered in 3 D perspective, the added value of binocular depth has not yet been convincingly demonstrated. For MIS, <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays</b> can decrease surgery time and increase accuracy of surgical procedures. Performance of surgical procedures is similar when high resolution 2 D displays are compared with lower resolution <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays,</b> indicating an image quality improvement for <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays.</b> Training and surgical planning already use computer simulations in 2 D, however {{more research is needed to}} the benefit of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays</b> in those applications. Overall there is a clear need for more empirical evidence that quantifies the added value of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays</b> in medical domains, such that the medical community will have ample basis to invest in <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>displays</b> in all or some of the described medical applications...|$|R

50|$|Crosstalk is the {{interference}} {{that exists between}} {{the left and right}} views in a 3D display. In a display with high crosstalk, each eye is able to see the image intended for the other eye faintly superimposed.The perception of crosstalk in stereoscopic displays has been studied widely. It is generally acknowledged that the presence of high levels of crosstalk in a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>display</b> is detrimental. The effects of crosstalk in an image include: ghosting and loss of contrast, loss of 3D effect and depth resolution, and viewer discomfort.The visibility of crosstalk (ghosting) increases with increasing contrast and increasing binocular parallax of the image. For example, a stereoscopic image with high contrast will exhibit more ghosting on a particular <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>display</b> than will an image with low contrast.|$|E

50|$|The closer the {{parallax}} {{barrier is}} to the pixels, the wider the angle of separation between {{the left and right}} images. For a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>display</b> the left and right images must hit the left and right eyes, which means the views must be separated by only a few degrees. The pixel- barrier separation d for this case can be derived as follows.|$|E

50|$|A {{stereogram}} {{consists of}} a pair of two-dimensional frames, one for each eye. Common to both are the widths and heights of objects; their depth is encoded in the differences between right and left eye views. The geometric relationship between an object's third dimension and these position differences is presented below and depends on the location of the stereo-camera lenses and the observer's eyes. Other factors, however, contribute to the depth seen in a stereoscopic view and whether it corresponds to that in the actual object; the act of viewing a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>display</b> often alters observers' three-dimensional perception.|$|E
