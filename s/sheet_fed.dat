2500|$|Beginning in {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, {{technology}} permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time.

40|$|Abstract: Major {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} Isle of Rum commenced with the eruption of thick (. 100 m) intra-caldera rhyodacite ash-flow <b>sheets</b> <b>fed</b> from steep-sided feeder conduits in {{the proximity of the}} Main Ring Fault. Twenty plagioclase phenocrysts of the rhyodacite were analysed using single crystal 40 Ar/ 39 Ar laser dating, yielding a mean apparent age of 60. 83 0. 27 Ma (MSWD 3 : 65). On an age v. probability plot the feldspars do not, however, show a simple Gaussian distribution, but a major peak at 60. 33 0. 21 Ma and two smaller shoulders at c. 61. 4 Ma and 63 Ma. These older ages are interpreted to represent recycled and largely re-equilibrated feldspars. The age peak at 60. 33 0. 21 Ma is interpreted to represent the intrusion and eruption age of the rhyodacites. This new age constraint overlaps with that for the ultrabasic intrusion, implying that the latter was already forming at depth and supplying necessary heat during the early felsic activity phase, and quickly thereafter migrated upwards to shallow structural levels and intruded the volcano’s earlier deposits. Combined with previously published ages, these new age data highlight an extremely rapid succession of events at the Rum centre, the whole sequence occurring in potentially, 500 ka. The Isle of Rum {{has been the subject of}} intense geological investigation for well over 100 years. Early research (e. g. Geiki...|$|R
50|$|Sheet-fed presses offer several advantages. Because {{individual}} <b>sheets</b> are <b>fed</b> through, a {{large number}} of sheet sizes and format sizes can be run through the same press. In addition, waste sheets can be used for make-ready (which is the testing process to ensure a quality print run). This allows for lower cost preparation so that good paper is not wasted while setting up the press, for plates and inks. Waste sheets do bring some disadvantages as often there are dust and offset powder particles that transfer on to the blankets and plate cylinders, creating imperfections on the printed sheet. This method produces the highest quality images.|$|R

50|$|Mass-production of vinyl decals {{starts with}} large rolls of vinyl <b>sheet.</b> Vinyl is <b>fed</b> through a plotter or large-format printer/cutter which prints the desired image and cuts out the desired shapes. Designs are {{typically}} created using specialized computer software {{and sent to}} the machines electronically. After the patterns are cut, excess vinyl on the sheet is removed in a process called weeding. Finally, a paper pre-mask {{can be applied to the}} top of the vinyl design allowing easy application of multiple letters and shapes.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{document is}} laid {{on top of}} the chemically-coated side of a sheet of diazo paper, which is retrieved from a light-protected flat file, and the two <b>sheets</b> are <b>fed</b> into the diazo duplicator, being pulled into the machine by rotating rubber friction wheels. There are two chambers inside the machine. The first is the exposure area, where the sandwich of the two sheets (the master and the diazo paper) pass in front of an ultraviolet lamp. Ultraviolet light penetrates the original and neutralizes the light sensitive diazonium salt wherever there was no image on the master. These areas become the white areas on the copy. Once this process is complete, the undeveloped image at the locations where the UV light could not penetrate can often be seen as very light yellow or white marks/lines on the diazo sheet. This completes the exposure phase.|$|R

50|$|This {{process is}} {{sometimes}} produced using manual powdering. The substrate with the wet ink is dipped into the powdered polymer.

The powdered <b>sheet</b> is then <b>fed</b> into a radiant heating system (as above) at a speed that achieves a good-quality melted film.

40|$|We {{present results}} of a fully {{three-dimensional}} computational study of the calendering process of thermoplastics using the fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. Our aim is to elucidate unique 3 D features of the process, such as spreading and melt flow. We assume that the material is fed {{in the form of}} a sheet of finite thickness and detaches from the cylinders at a prescribed thickness. The rotational motion of the cylinders, the consequent pressure build-up (both in the machine and the transverse directions) and the presence of the free surfaces (sides) of the calendered sheet-both deformable and at ambient pressure-forces the thermoplastic melt to spread in the transverse direction. A decoupled iterative procedure is used to predict the shape of the spreading side surfaces under different conditions. A spiraling transverse flow pattern in the melt feeding section is shown to exist, which determines the actual flow path of the calendered material in a nonintuitive way. We show that insofar as the material redistribution (from the <b>fed</b> <b>sheet</b> to the produced film) during the process is concerned, the results of the present analysis predict a 3 D spiral flow pattern and a redistribution of the fed material from the central region of the <b>fed</b> <b>sheet</b> to the sides of the calendered product.

40|$|In the Archaean Pilbara Craton of Western Australia, three {{zones of}} {{heterogeneous}} centimetre- to metre-scale sheeted granites are interpreted to represent high-level, syn-magmatic shear zones. Evidence for the syn-magmatic {{nature of the}} shear zones include imbricated and asymmetrically rotated metre-scale orthogneiss xenoliths that are enveloped by leucogranite sheets that show no significant internal strain. At another locality, granite sheets have a strong shape-preferred alignment of K-feldspar, suggesting magmatic flow, while the asymmetric recrystallisation of the grain boundaries indicates that non-coaxial deformation continued acting upon the sheets under sub-solidus conditions. Elsewhere, randomly oriented centimetre-wide leucogranite dykes are realigned at a shear zone boundary to form semi-continuous, layer-parallel sheets within a magma-dominated, dextral shear zone. It is proposed that the granite sheets formed by the incremental injection of magmas into active shear zones. Magma was sheared during laminar flow to produce the sheets that are aligned sub-parallel to the shear zone boundary. Individual <b>sheets</b> are <b>fed</b> by individual dykes, with up to 1000 s of discrete injections in an individual shear zone. The sheets often lack microstructural evidence for magmatic flow, either because the crystal content of the magma was too low to record internal strain, or because of later recrystallisation...|$|R
