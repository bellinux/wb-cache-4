40|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward for the how tropical cyclones (tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic) first develop circulation at the surface, a key event that needs to occur before a storm can begin to draw energy from the warm ocean. One hypothesis suggests that the surface circulation forms from a "top-down" approach in which a <b>storm</b> <b>s</b> rotating circulation begins at middle levels of the atmosphere and builds down to the surface through processes related to light "stratiform" (horizontally extensive) precipitation. Another hypothesis suggests a bottom-up approach in which deep thunderstorm towers (convection) play the major role in spinning up the flow at the surface. These "hot towers" form {{in the area of}} the mid-level circulation and strongly concentrate this rotation at low levels within their updrafts. Merger of several of these hot towers then intensifies the surface circulation to the point in which a storm forms. This paper examines computer simulations of Tropical Storm Gert (2005), which formed in the Gulf of Mexico during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration s (NASA) Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) Experiment, to investigate the development of low-level circulation and, in particular, whether stratiform or hot tower processes were responsible for the <b>storm</b> <b>s</b> formation. Data from NASA satellites and from aircraft were used to show that the model did a good job of reproducing the formation and evolution of Gert. The simulation shows that a mix of both stratiform and convective rainfall occurred within Gert. While the stratiform rainfall clearly acted to increase rotation at middle levels, the diverging outflow beneath the stratiform rain worked against spinning up the low-level winds. The hot towers appeared to dominate the low-level flow, producing intense rotation within their cores and often being associated with significant pressure falls at the surface. Over time, many of these hot towers merged, with each merger adding to the rotation of the storm and the pressure falls at the surface. This process continued to increase the strength of the storm until the storm made landfall on the east coast of Mexico. These results support the bottom-up hypothesis for development...|$|R

The NASA ER- 2 and DC- 8 aircraft were instrumented with unique remote sensing instruments to help increase the overall understanding of hurricanes. This paper {{is concerned about}} one of the storms studied, Tropical Storm Chantal, that was a weak storm which failed to intense into a hurricane. One of the practical questions of high importance is why some tropical sto~ins intensify into hurricanes, and others remain weak or die altogether. The magnitude of the difference between the horizontal winds at lower levels and upper altitudes in a tropical storm, i. e., the wind shear, is one important quantity that can affect the intensification of a tropical storm. Strong shear as was present during Tropical <b>Storm</b> Chantal <b>s</b> lifetime and it was detrimental to its intensification. The paper presents an analysis of unique aircraft observations collected from Chantal including an on-board radar, radiometers, dropsondes, and flight level measurements. These measurements have enabled us to examine the internal structure of the winds and thermal structure of Chantal. Most of the previous studies have involved intense hurricanes that overcame the effects of shear and this work has provided new insights into what prevents a weaker storm from intensifying. The storm had extremely intense thunderstorms and rainfall, yet its main circulation was confined to low levels of the atmosphere. Chantal's thermal structure was not configured properly for the storm to intensify. It is most typical that huricanes have a warm core structure where warm temperatures in upper levels of a <b>storm</b> <b>s</b> circulation help intensify surface winds and lower its central pressure. Chantal had two weaker warm layers instead of a well-defined warm core. These layers have been related to the horizontal and vertical winds and precipitation structure and have helped us learn more about why this storm didn't develop...|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} {{description of a}} self-consistent model of magnetospheric ring current interacting with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves is presented. The model {{is based on the}} system of two kinetic equations; one equation describes the ring current ion dynamics, and another equation describes the wave evolution. The effects on ring current ions interacting with electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves and back on waves are considered self-consistently by solving both equations on a global magnetospheric scale under nonsteady state conditions. The developed model is employed to simulate the entire 2 - 7 May 1998 storm period. First, the trapped number fluxes of the ring current protons are calculated and presented along with comparison with the data measured by the three- dimensional hot plasma instrument Polar/HYDRA. Incorporating in the model the wave-particle interaction leads to much better agreement between the experimental data and the model results. Second, examining of the wave (MLT, L shell) distributions produced by the model during the storm progress reveals an essential intensification of the wave emission about 2 days after the main phase of the storm. This result is well consistent with the earlier ground-based observations. Finally, the theoretical shapes and the occurrence rates of the wave power spectral densities are studied. It is found that about 2 days after the <b>storm</b> <b>s</b> main phase on 4 May, mainly non-Gaussian shapes of power spectral densities are produced...|$|R

30|$|During <b>storm</b> <b>S</b> 3, EPBs # 13 and # 14 {{shown in}} Table  2 {{occurred}} in the recovery phase of the storm. In the previous studies concerning EPBs in the recovery phase, the enhancement of the S 4 index was observed during postmidnight period in the African and South American region in the 2015 St. Patrick’s Day storm Carter et al. 2016. In association with an intense storm, the density variations {{in the early morning}} were observed by the C/NOFS satellite (Zhou et al. 2016). Comparing these previous studies, EPBs # 13 and # 14 were observed before midnight, which is the typical time zone for an EPB occurrence. As previously described, EPBs observed around premidnight during the recovery phase are rare. Therefore, the occurrence of EPBs # 13 and # 14 seems to be affected by some unusual circumstances. One possibility is the fluctuation of the IMF Bz. As shown in Fig.  6, at the occurrence of EPBs # 13 and # 14, the IMF Bz was highly fluctuating. Generally, the over-shielding effect appears during the recovery phase of the storm due to a northward IMF following a southward IMF. In this case where the IMF Bz is fluctuating, {{it is possible that the}} over-shielding effect does not appear clearly. Therefore, the enhancement of the eastward electric field still continues at some level, and the occurrence of the EPBs is not inhibited, even in the recovery phase.|$|R

Assessment of surface cyclone tracks associated with the large snowstorms identified three primary tracks: one was located from the leeward side of the south-central Rocky Mountains east-northeast toward the Great Lakes; a second was from the lower Mississippi River basin northeastward toward the Great Lakes; and a third was along the coastal mid-Atlantic region northeast toward Maine. Temporal differences in the frequency of certain surface cyclone tracks were related to the decadal trends in regional large snowstorm occurrence.

40|$|The main {{emphasis}} {{of this study}} was to analyse the short-term development of abundance, population structure and vertical distribution of the dominant calanoid copepods during a phytoplankton bloom in the coastal area of the eastern Weddell Sea in December 2003. Microcalanus pygmaeus was by far the most abundant calanoid species. Metridia gerlachei, Ctenocalanus citer, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and the ice-associated Stephos longipes were also present in considerable proportions. The observed changes in the population characteristics and parameters of these species are described in detail and discussed in the context of the spring phytoplankton bloom. A conspicuous event occurring during the final stage of the study was the development of a strong storm. While the results suggest that this storm did not have any considerable influence on the populations of all other investigated copepod species, it very likely caused pronounced changes in the S. longipes population present in the water column. Before the <b>storm,</b> <b>S.</b> longipes was found primarily in the upper 100 m of the water column, and its population was dominated by adults (mean proportion = 41 %) and the copepodite stage I (mean proportion = 30 %). After the storm, the abundance increased considerably, and the copepodite stage I contributed by far the largest proportion (53 %) of the total population indicating that the early copepodite stages probably had been released from the sea ice into the under ice water layer due to ice break-up and ice melt processes caused by the storm...|$|R

40|$|The US Army Corps of Engineers' Field Research Facility (FRF) at Duck, North Carolina, has {{collected}} approximately biweekly beach-nearshore profile data to 8 -m depth and associated wave data since 1981. Sediment budget {{analysis was used}} to examine the medium-scale (years to a decade) variability of the beach-nearshore profile from 1981 to 1991. Significant changes occurred during four groups of energetic storm events during February/March of 1983, 1987, 1989 and December 1989. Each group was comprised of at least two storms within a period of less than 39 days both with Hmo > 4 m. During each storm group, offshore sediment movement caused a distinct outer bar to migrate offshore and grow in size resulting in an abrupt increase in the volume of sediment on the upper shoreface. The net profile changes were much larger than the changes due to single storms and the cumulative effect of the storms can be considered as one ‘event’. During these events, the first storm appears to have a destabilizing effect on the profile which has insufficient time to recover before the second (and subsequent) <b>storm</b> (<b>s).</b> As a result, several storms in quick succession are able to have a large impact on the morphology. The intervening periods between the groups of storm events (termed fairweather conditions) lasted up to 4 years. They are characterized by slow, but steady sediment redistribution (averaging 33 m 3 m? 1 year? 1) from the upper shoreface (> 5 m depth) toward the shore, while the total sediment volume was effectively constant. The onshore feed of sediment was not significantly affected by individual storms during the fairweather conditions.
