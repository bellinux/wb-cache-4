5|$|Subsequent to developing, deep {{convection}} began {{developing and}} increasing around the center. On September 11, an Advanced Microwave <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> temperature cross-section analysis indicated the system developed a warm thermal core; as a result, it was re-classified as Tropical Depression Ten. Convection continued increasing, and it intensified to tropical storm status by 1200UTC. Operationally, {{it was considered}} a tropical depression, and significant strengthening was not expected. However, reports from Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of tropical storm force winds, {{and as a result}} the National Hurricane Center named the cyclone Florence. The storm continued quickly intensifying, and with the Hurricane Hunters reporting flight-level winds of over 85mph (140km/h), it was estimated Florence attained hurricane status late on September 11, or just six hours after the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on the storm. The strongest winds were confined to a very small area {{near the edge of the}} convection. Initially, the hurricane was tracking west-southwestward, steered by a mid-level ridge to its northwest.|$|E
5|$|The first National Hurricane Center {{forecast}} on Nicole {{noted the}} development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend continued, transitioning into a tropical cyclone would be possible. The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60miles (95km) northwest of Bermuda. Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core within the system. Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong upper-level wind shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward {{under the influence of}} a large extratropical storm south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). Subtropical Storm Nicole lost its circulation as it was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm on October 11.|$|E
5|$|While passing to {{the south}} of Bermuda, the {{subtropical}} storm maintained winds of 70mph (110km/h), with wind gusts on the island surpassing 100mph (160km/h). After becoming dissociated from the Westerlies, the system turned northward, and began to develop convection over the center. In addition, the frontal characteristics of the subtropical storm continually weakened. On October 13, based on an Advanced Microwave <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> observation that stated that a warm core was present throughout the system, the National Hurricane Center designated the system as a tropical storm, and gave it the name Karen. At this point, Karen was located 200miles (320km) north of Bermuda. Karen slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and the storm intensified to a hurricane later on October 13. Convection continued to develop, and organized into a ring around the eye as Karen reached its peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h) on October 14 while located about 400miles (640km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E

25|$|Early on November9, an Advanced Microwave <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> pass of {{the system}} {{revealed}} a mid-level eye feature, indicative of an intensifying system. However, shallow convection along with scatterometer data showed no strengthening. The IMD assessed the system to have become a deep depression around this time and attained its peak intensity, with three-minute sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) and a barometric pressure of 1002mbar (hPa; 29.59inHg). The JTWC estimated the system to have been slightly stronger at its peak, with one-minute sustained winds of 75km/h (45mph). Continued moderate wind shear displaced most convection to the northwest {{of the center of}} circulation, counteracting the favorable poleward outflow which was enhanced by the mid-latitude westerlies. The wind shear took its toll by November10, leaving the storm's center devoid of showers and thunderstorms. More pronounced decay took place later in the day as the storm neared the coastline, with land interaction disrupting the circulation. Between 2300UTC on November10 and 0000UTC on November11, the deep depression made landfall along the border of the Nugal and Bari regions. Based on estimates from the JTWC, the system became only the fifth known tropical storm to strike the country since 1966, when accurate satellite measurements were started. Retaining some organized convection, the system gradually weakened as it moved inland; it was last noted by the IMD later on November11 as it neared Ethiopia.|$|E

40|$|We examine to {{what degree}} {{we can expect to}} obtain {{accurate}} temperature trends for the last two decades near the surface and in the lower troposphere. We compare temperatures obtained from surface observations and radiosondes as well as satellite-based measurements from the Microwave <b>Soundings</b> <b>Units</b> (MSU), which have been adjusted for orbital decay and non-linear instrument-body effects, and reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA) and the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). In regions with abundant conventional data coverage, where the MSU has no major influence on the reanalysis, temperature anomalies obtained from microwave sounders, radiosondes and from both reanalyses agree reasonably. Where coverage is insufficient, in particular over the tropical oceans, large differences are found between the MSU and either reanalysis. These differences apparently relate to changes in the satellite data availability and to differing satellite retrieval methodologies, to which both reanalyses are quite sensitive over the oceans. For NCEP, this results from the use of raw radiances directly incorporated into the analysis, which make the reanalysis sensitive to changes in the underlying algorithms, e. g. those introduced in August 1992. For ERA, the bias-correction of the one-dimensional variational analysis may introduce an error when the satellite relative to which the correction is calculated is biased itself or when radiances change on a time scale longer than a couple of months, e. g. due to orbit decay. ERA inhomogeneities are apparent in April 1985, October/November 1986 and April 1989. These dates can be identified with the replacements of satellites. It is possible that a negative bias in the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) used in the reanalyses may have been introduced over the period of the satellite record. This could have resulted from a {{decrease in the number of}} ship measurements, a concomitant increase in the importance of satellite-derived SSTs, and a likely cold bias in the latter. Alternately, a warm bias in SSTs could have been caused by an increase in the percentage of buoy measurements (relative to deeper ship intake measurements) in the tropical Pacific. No indications for uncorrected inhomogeneities of land surface temperatures could be found. Near-surface temperatures have biases in the boundary layer in both reanalyses, presumably due to the incorrect treatment of snow cover. The increase of near-surface compared to lower tropospheric temperatures in the last two decades may be due to a combination of several factors, including high-latitude near-surface winter warming due to an enhanced NAO and upper-tropospheric cooling due to stratospheric ozone decrease...|$|R

40|$|In Okitipupa area, south western Nigeria, the {{aquifers}} of the Coastal Plain sands {{are largely}} Quaternary porous sediments, but without records of their subsurface disposition. In this study, fifty Schlumberger soundings were conducted over the study area, aimed at delineating the boundaries, depth {{range of the}} shallow aquifer units, and assessing their vulnerability to near-surface contaminants. The study delineated two major aquifer units within the area: (i) the upper/surficial aquifer system, which occur at depths ranging from 5. 8 m (around Agbabu) to 61. 5 m (around Ikoya), and with materials of higher average resistivity (504. 7 Ωm), suggestive of gravelly/coarse to medium-grained sand and (ii) the intermediate aquifer system, characterised by depth range of 32. 1 - 127. 5 m, average resistivity of 296. 8 Ωm, typical of medium-grained sand saturated with water. The highly resistive, impermeable materials overlying the aquifer units around Ajagba, Aiyesan, Agbetu, Ilutitun, Igbotako, and Erinj suggests that the aquifer units are less vulnerable to near-surface contaminants than in Agbabu, Igbisin, Ugbo, and Aboto where aquifers are overlain by less resistive materials.

40|$|International audienceThe {{scientific}} {{objective of}} the Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission (CONSERT) aboard ESA spacecraft Rosetta is to perform a dielectric characterization of comet 67 P/Chuyurmov-Gerasimenko's nucleus.

For the <b>sounding,</b> the CONSERT <b>unit</b> aboard the lander will receive and process the radio signal emitted by the orbiter counterpart of the instrument. It will then retransmit a signal back to the orbiter to be received by CONSERT. This happens at the milliseconds time scale. During the descent of lander Philae onto the comet's surface, CONSERT was operated as a bi-static RADAR. A single measurement of the obtained data is composed of the dominant signal from the direct line-of-sight propagation path between lander and orbiter as well as paths from the lander's signal being reflected by the comet's surface. From peak power measurements of the dominant direct path during the descent, the knowledge of the orbiter and lander positions and simulations of CONSERT's orbiter and lander antenna characteristics as well as polarization properties, we were able to reconstruct the lander's attitude and estimate the spin rate of the lander along the descent trajectory. Additionally, certain operations and manoeuvres of orbiter and lander, e. g. the deployment of the lander legs and CONSERT antennas or the orbiter change of attitude in order to orient the science towards the assumed lander position, are also visible in the data. The information gained on the landers attitude is used in the reconstruction of the dielectric properties of 67 P/C-G's surface and near subsurface (metric to decametric scale) and will hopefully prove helpful supporting the data interpretation of other instruments. In the CONSERT measurements, the comet's surface is visible during roughly the last third of the descent enabling a mean permittivity estimation of the surface and near subsurface covered by the instruments footprint along the descent path.
