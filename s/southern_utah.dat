50|$|The {{line was}} {{transferred}} again during {{construction of the}} Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, then partially owned and later fully owned by the Union Pacific. The portion of the former <b>Utah</b> <b>Southern</b> from Lynndyl to Milford {{was used for the}} LA&SL main, and remains in use as the primary <b>Southern</b> California - <b>Utah</b> rail trunk today. The remainder of the former <b>Utah</b> <b>Southern</b> became spurs from the LA&SL main. The spurs to Eureka and Frisco were eventually abandoned. The LA&SL and <b>Utah</b> <b>Southern</b> used different routes between Lynndyl and Salt Lake, resulting in duplicate tracks between those two cities. The <b>Utah</b> <b>Southern</b> built tracks were routed to Salt Lake via Leamington Canyon of the Sevier River, passing through Nephi, Santaquin and Provo; the newer LA&SL built tracks were routed farther west in the desert, via Tooele and around {{the north end of the}} Oquirrh Mountains. Over time the tracks via Tooele became the preferred route for through traffic and the tracks via Provo became the secondary or local route; however the route via Provo is no longer contiguous. The portion between Provo and Lynndyl is still part of the Union Pacific, and is known as the Sharp Subdivision; the portion through the Salt Lake Valley is no longer part of the Union Pacific network.|$|R
