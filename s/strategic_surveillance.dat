The five primary goals of the plan are: 1. Advance the usefulness of surveillance information at the Federal level for prevention of occupational illnesses, injuries, and hazards. 2. Strengthen the capacity of State health departments and other State agencies to conduct occupational surveillance. 3. Strengthen surveillance of high-risk industries and occupations, and of populations at high risk, including special populations. 4.

40|$|Self-separation is {{a concept}} of flight {{operations}} that aims to provide user benefits and increase airspace capacity by transferring traffic separation responsibility from ground-based controllers to the flight crew. Self-separation is enabled by cooperative airborne surveillance, such as that provided by the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADSB) system and airborne separation assistance technologies. This paper describes {{an assessment of the}} impact of ADS-B system performance on the performance of self-separation as a step towards establishing far-term ADS-B performance requirements. Specifically, the impacts of ADS-B surveillance range and interference limitations were analyzed under different traffic density levels. The analysis was performed using a batch simulation of aircraft performing self-separation assisted by NASA s Autonomous Operations Planner prototype flight-deck tool, in two-dimensional airspace. An aircraft detected conflicts within a look-ahead time of ten minutes and resolved them using strategic closed trajectories or tactical open maneuvers if the time to loss of separation was below a threshold. While a complex interaction was observed between the impacts of surveillance range and interference, as both factors are physically coupled, self-separation performance followed expected trends. An increase in surveillance range resulted in a {{decrease in the number of}} conflict detections, an increase in the average conflict detection lead time, and an increase in the percentage of conflict resolutions that were strategic. The majority of the benefit was observed when surveillance range was increased to a value corresponding to the conflict detection look-ahead time. The benefits were attenuated at higher interference levels. Increase in traffic density resulted in a significant increase in the number of conflict detections, as expected, but had no effect on the conflict detection lead time and the percentage of conflict resolutions that were <b>strategic.</b> With <b>surveillance</b> range corresponding to ADS-B minimum operational performance standards for Class A 3 equipment and without background interference, a significant portion of conflict resolutions, 97 percent, were achieved in the preferred strategic mode.

The proportion of the total population that were screened for TB rose from 0. 4 % in 2001 to 1. 1 % in 2013, while the smear-positivity rate decreased from 28. 9 % to 8. 1 % in the same period. The total number of notified TB cases increased steadily from 2000; this has stabilized in recent years with 39 055 cases notified in 2013. The proportion of all TB cases that were smear-positive decreased from 78 % in 2000 to 36 % in 2013. Case notification rates (CNRs) for all forms of TB and new smear-positive TB in 2013 were 261 and 94 per 100 000 population, respectively. Higher CNRs were found in the north-west and south-east parts of the country and were higher for males especially in older age groups. The increase in TB screening, decline in the smear-positive rate and decline in notified smear-positive TB cases likely reflect a long-term positive impact of the NTP.

In Scotland, since the Kinnaird review in 2011, efforts have been made to engage with stakeholders to ensure that the <b>strategic</b> goals of <b>surveillance</b> are better aligned with the needs of the end-users and other beneficiaries. The aims of this study were to engage with Scottish surveillance stakeholders and multidisciplinary experts to inform the future long-term strategy for animal {{health surveillance}} in Scotland. In this paper, we describe the use of scenario planning as an effective tool for the creation and exploration of five plausible long-term futures; we describe prioritization of critical drivers of change (i. e., international trade policy, data-sharing philosophies, and public versus private resourcing of surveillance capacity) that will unpredictably influence the future implementation of animal health surveillance activities. We present 10 participant-developed strategies to support 3 long-term visions to improve future resilience of animal health surveillance and contingency planning for animal and zoonotic disease outbreaks in Scotland. In the absence of any certainty about the nature of post-Brexit trade agreements for agriculture, participants considered the best investments for long-term resilience to include data collection strategies to improve animal health benchmarking, user-benefit strategies to improve digital literacy in farming communities, and investment strategies to increase veterinary and scientific research capacity in rural areas. This is the first scenario planning study to explore stakeholder beliefs and perceptions about important environmental, technological, societal, political, and legal drivers (in addition to epidemiological “risk factors”) and effective strategies to manage future uncertainties for both the Scottish livestock industry and animal health surveillance after Brexit.

40|$|In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), in {{association}} with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), convened the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group to make recommendations to NIOSH concerning State-based surveillance activities for the coming decade. The original Work Group members agreed that the surveillance planning process should be outcome driven; e. g., begin with the identification of occupational injuries, illnesses and hazards to be placed under surveillance. The Work Group also identified a number of surveillance issues that cut across specific conditions and made several recommendations to NIOSH for the implementation of comprehensive State-based occupational health surveillance systems. A draft of the Work Group report contributed to the NIOSH <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Strategic</b> Plan. The Work Group report described draft 'profiles' for priority conditions to be placed under surveillance as part of State-based surveillance systems. Since the publication of the Work Group report, public health surveillance 'indicators' have been developed in several areas, including chronic disease, injury control and environmental health. These indicators are a construct of public health surveillance that define a specific measure of health or risk status (i. e., the occurrence of a health event or of factors associated with that event) among a specified population. Surveillance indicators allow a state to compare its health or risk status with that of other states and evaluate trends over time within the state, and guide priorities for prevention and intervention efforts. Occupational health indicators can provide information about a population's health status with respect to workplace injuries and illnesses or to factors that can influence health. These indicators can either be measures of health (work-related disease or injury) or factors associated with health, such as workplace exposures, hazards or interventions. This document describes the current recommended set of indicators for occupational health surveillance by the Work Group. The occupational health indicators that have been developed represent the consensus view of state and NIOSH representatives, and are intended as advisory to the states. The indicators represent a core set of data that, if collected at the state level, would assist in the development of programs to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses. They are a subset of the larger number of conditions that were recommended for surveillance in 2001. The indicators are intended to be used in conjunction with other guidelines for the state-based surveillance of occupational injuries and illnesses, and {{to be used as a}} complement to overall state and national goals to improve the health of the population.

40|$|Last updated March 2014 : {{changes to}} the Occupational Health Indicator {{methodology}} from the March 2013 version are highlighted in yellow. In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), {{in association with the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), convened the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group to make recommendations to NIOSH concerning State-based surveillance activities for the coming decade. The original Work Group members (see Appendix A) agreed that the surveillance planning process should be outcome driven; e. g., begin with the identification of occupational injuries, illnesses and hazards to be placed under surveillance. The Work Group also identified a number of surveillance issues that cut across specific conditions and made several recommendations to NIOSH for the implementation of comprehensive State-based occupational health surveillance systems (CSTE 2001). A draft of the Work Group report contributed to the NIOSH <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Strategic</b> Plan (NIOSH 2001). The Work Group report described draft 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 profiles 22 ̆ 0 ac? for priority conditions to be placed under surveillance as part of State-based surveillance systems. Since the publication of the Work Group report, public health surveillance 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 indicators 22 ̆ 0 ac? have been developed in several areas, including chronic disease, injury control and environmental health (CSTE 1999, STIPDA 1999, CDC 2001, CSTE 2002). These indicators are a construct of public health surveillance that define a specific measure of health or risk status (i. e., the occurrence of a health event or of factors associated with that event) among a specified population. Surveillance indicators allow a state to compare its health or risk status with that of other states and evaluate trends over time within the state, and guide priorities for prevention and intervention efforts. Occupational health indicators can provide information about a population 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s health status with respect to workplace injuries and illnesses or to factors that can influence health. These indicators can either be measures of health (work-related disease or injury) or factors associated with health, such as workplace exposures, hazards or interventions. This document describes the current recommended set of indicators for occupational health surveillance by the Work Group. The occupational health indicators that have been developed represent the consensus view of state and NIOSH representatives, and are intended as advisory to the states. The indicators represent a core set of data that, if collected at the state level, would assist in the development of programs to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses. They are a subset of the larger number of conditions that were recommended for surveillance in 2001. The indicators are intended to be used in conjunction with other guidelines for the state-based surveillance of occupational injuries and illnesses (NIOSH 1995, CSTE 2001), and {{to be used as a}} complement to overall state and national goals to improve the health of the population (CDC 2000).

40|$|The year 2008 {{witnessed}} a polio outbreak in Nigeria, with new international spread to bordering countries, persistent importations in south-central Africa and Sudan {{and the largest}} outbreak of polio in eight years in Pakistan. Elsewhere, western Uttar Pradesh in India - historically the world's most entrenched reservoir of polio but free of indigenous poliovirus type 1 {{for more than a}} year - was re-infected by a virus from a neighbouring state. By the end of the year, the number of children paralysed by polio in 2008 had returned to 1999 levels. And yet 2008 has proved to be a turning point in the fight against polio. To say 2008 was an arduous year in polio eradication is an understatement. To say it was a watershed for polio eradication is not. Against a sobering epidemiological backdrop, the progress made - in key political, technical, financial and operational areas - led the ACPE and SAGE 1 to conclude in November 2008 that the intensified eradication effort had shown that the remaining challenges in the four polio-endemic countries could be overcome. First and foremost, all tiers of government in key polio- infected countries - from central to local levels - have realized the level of support and effort required to finish polio eradication and are engaging in the global effort as never before. In addition to financial and operational commitments, the remaining countries with indigenous polio - Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan - now have special mechanisms to monitor the performance of eradication activities and hold local authorities accountable for their quality. Secondly, these efforts are being closely watched and frankly assessed. Following the re-infection of West Africa, for example, the international community has refocused its attention on key polio-affected countries, especially Nigeria, with a World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA) in May 2008 tasking each endemic country - by name - to act. Thirdly, the donor community has remained determined in the face of continued transmission of polio. Mindful that meeting established global health goals demands extraordinary perseverance, donors have redoubled efforts to finish the final lap. In January 2009, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a further US$ 255 million grant for polio eradication to Rotary International, which the latter pledged to match with another US$ 100 million, bringing to US$ 200 million Rotary's matching funds in the past year alone. That same month, the United Kingdom announced a multi-year contribution of US$ 150 million, and Germany signalled its intention to provide US$ 130 million. By the end of the year, these global developments and country-specific strategies were showing an impact on wild poliovirus transmission. In India, monthly vaccination campaigns in the highest-risk areas, using monovalent vaccine, have reduced wild poliovirus type 1 - the more dangerous of the two remaining strains - to record lows. In Nigeria, stronger leadership at state level brought about new commitments to accountability for the quality of vaccination campaigns. By early 2009, the proportion of children with no polio vaccination in the highest-risk states of northern Nigeria fell to under 10 % for the first time ever. In Afghanistan, teams exploited lulls in the conflict in the southern region to enter normally inaccessible areas and give children an additional dose of monovalent vaccine between large-scale campaigns. Pakistan started using finger-marking of vaccinated children to objectively measure coverage, thereby introducing real accountability of local authorities. With new multi-sectoral activities, the country laid the ground for the Prime Minister's Action Plan for Polio Eradication, launched in early 2009. Meanwhile, ongoing research in social attitudes, the development of new vaccines and behaviour of the poliovirus is expanding the current state of knowledge. In March 2008, Somalia became polio-free once again, demonstrating that full application of international outbreak response guidelines can stop the virus even in the most difficult conditions. This Annual Report of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) features progress made in 2008 towards the objectives defined in the GPEI Strategic Plan for 2004 - 08 and reports on intensified eradication activities.
