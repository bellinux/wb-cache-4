5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the <b>series</b> <b>to</b> end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} is important to know when to end a story, that he did not want the <b>series</b> <b>to</b> become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the <b>series</b> <b>to</b> write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we study {{analytic}} properties of the multiple Dirichlet <b>series</b> associated <b>to</b> additive and Dirichlet characters. For the multiple Dirichlet <b>series</b> associated <b>to</b> additive characters, the meromorphic continuation is established via obtaining translation formulas satisfied by these multiple Dirichlet series. While it seems difficult to obtain such a translation formula for the multiple Dirichlet <b>series</b> associated <b>to</b> Dirichlet characters, we rely on their intrinsic connection with the multiple Dirichlet <b>series</b> associated <b>to</b> additive characters in order to investigate their analytic characteristics. We are also able to determine the exact set of singularities of the multiple Dirichlet <b>series</b> associated <b>to</b> additive characters. Comment: This paper grew out of Chapter 5 of my Ph. D. thesis (2016). My thesis {{can be found in}} [URL]...|$|R
