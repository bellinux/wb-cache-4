50|$|The Industrial Revolution {{increased}} {{population density}} in manufacturing districts, and produced pipes useful for drain-waste-vent systems from buildings to <b>sewers.</b> Gravity <b>sewers</b> have been assembled from cast iron pipe, vitrified clay pipe, precast concrete pipe, asbestos-cement pipe, and plastic pipe. While some older brickwork <b>sewers</b> remain in use, new <b>sewers</b> of diameters exceeding 1 m typically use reinforced concrete. Corrugated metal pipe {{may be used}} for storm drains or wastewaters with similarly low risk of corrosive conditions. Non-cylindrical cross-sections may have advantages for large-diameter <b>sewers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sewerage. Sewage {{collection}} {{systems do}} not have sufficient hydraulic capacity to handle wastewater flows, especially in poor neighborhoods, which results in combined <b>sewer</b> overflows and sanitary <b>sewer</b> overflows.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary <b>sewer</b> system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined <b>sewer</b> overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

50|$|Simplified {{sanitary}} <b>sewers</b> {{consist of}} small-diameter pipes (typically 100 mm or about 4 inches), often laid at fairly flat gradients (1 in 200).

50|$|<b>Sewers</b> {{that were}} built {{in the early stages of}} {{urbanization}} were usually built before sewage treatment was implemented. Early <b>sewers</b> were simple drainage systems to remove surface runoff with any waste material it might contain. These drainage systems became combined <b>sewers</b> when sewage from kitchens, baths, and toilets was added; and the discharge became offensive. Early sewage treatment plants were built to treat the sewage during dry weather; but it was infeasible to treat the larger volume of mixed sewage and precipitation runoff from combined <b>sewers</b> during wet weather. Sanitary <b>sewers</b> were built to keep sewage from being mixed with surface runoff so the sewage could be efficiently treated during both wet and dry weather.|$|R

5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined <b>sewer</b> overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary <b>sewer</b> lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E

50|$|Sanitary <b>sewers</b> {{evolved from}} {{combined}} <b>sewers</b> built where water was plentiful. Animal feces accumulated on city streets while animal-powered transport moved people and goods.

Combined <b>sewers</b> were built to use surface runoff to flush waste off streets {{and move it}} underground to places distant from populated areas. Sewage treatment became necessary as population expanded, but treatment of diluted waste from combined <b>sewers</b> is more expensive than treating undiluted sewage.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a {{dredging}} project was proposed on Leggetts Creek {{to repair the}} damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington <b>Sewer</b> Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new <b>sewer</b> lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD Technical Assistance Program conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined <b>sewer</b> overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing into the stream is associated with a combined <b>sewer</b> system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E

40|$|Water is {{essential}} for our daily life. Despite this, much of our water has become polluted and nutrient-enriched. One main factor contributing to the problem are private <b>sewers.</b> In total, there are nearly 1 million private <b>sewers</b> in Sweden, which represent {{one of the largest}} point sources of nitrogen and phosphorus. A survey was carried out to investigate the status of private <b>sewers</b> at Källsjön, Sollefteå municipality. In addition, four municipalities around Sollefteå have been interviewed about the implementation of legislation concerning private <b>sewers.</b> The study shows that <b>sewers</b> around Källsjön are seemingly in relatively good condition. However, 36 % of the polled property owners have drains that are over 20 years old, and the function of these drains can be questioned. Interestingly, many of the surveyed property owners do not even know how old their drains are and what type of facility they have. Three of four interviewed municipalities are currently not performing any active control of private <b>sewers.</b> All municipalities provided information to property owners regarding current legislation. The study suggests that municipalities should act proactively to establish comprehensive inventories, a first step towards raising the standard of the individual <b>sewers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary <b>sewer</b> overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined <b>sewer</b> overflow.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of sewage contamination, including <b>sewer</b> odors and debris, in the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. The city of Nanticoke has a permit to discharge sewage into the creek. Four combined <b>sewer</b> overflows {{are present in the}} watershed. Orange sediment is deposited on the creek's streambed, indicating a high concentration of iron in the waters. Yellow boy is also present along the creek in some places and can be seen from South Cross Valley Expressway. The concentration of total dissolved solids in the creek is 622 milligrams per liter, higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency criterion for suitability for aquatic life.|$|E
