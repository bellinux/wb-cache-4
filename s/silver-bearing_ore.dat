In 1557 John Trelawny, John Tredeneck and Thomas Treffry were directed to take charge of the mines Kranich had discovered, and the Duchy of Cornwall advanced a loan of £600 to finance the enterprise. Although considerable lead was produced, the anticipated production of copper and silver did not materialise. The lead was sent to Treffry, who died in 1563, at which time it passed into the hands of his son, John, who refused to deliver it to Carnsew and Tredeneck, who had taken over the mines and were responsible for repayment of the loan. The outcome of a Chancery suit for recovery of the lead is not known.|$|E

It {{is located in the}} southern part of Catron County, approximately 7 miles east of Alma on County Road 7. Cooney Cemetery was created when James Cooney's brother, Captain Mike Cooney, and friends carved a sepulcher out of a rock in the canyon where he was killed and buried him there, sealing the tomb with the <b>silver-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> taken from the mine he discovered. The main part of the cemetery is located behind the above tomb and contains seven burials.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} silver objects {{began appearing}} in the late fourth millennium BC in Anatolia, Turkey. Prehistoric silver extraction is strongly associated with the extraction of the less valuable metal, lead; although evidence of lead extraction technology predates silver by at least 3 millennia. Silver and lead extractions are also associated because the argentiferous (<b>silver-bearing)</b> <b>ores</b> used in the process often contains both elements.|$|R

It is still an active mining center.The Spanish mined the rich Cerro de Pasco <b>silver-bearing</b> oxide <b>ore</b> deposits since colonial times. Sulfide minerals are more common in the Atacocha district however.|$|R
50|$|Its name, {{adopted in}} the thirteenth century in place of its more ancient name Segualeriae (Ségualières), refers to the silver mines in the area between the tenth and fifteenth centuries, when the <b>silver-bearing</b> lead <b>ores</b> in {{intrusive}} veins in the Largentières sandstone were exploited under the authority of the Counts of Toulouse and the Bishops of Viviers, whose title barons de Largentière was linked to the bishopric.|$|R
5000|$|Greek {{attitudes towards}} [...] "barbarians" [...] {{developed}} {{in parallel with}} the growth of chattel slavery - especially in Athens. Although the enslavement of Greeks for non-payment of debts continued in most Greek states, Athens banned this practice under Solon in the early 6th century BC. Under the Athenian democracy established ca. 508 BC, slavery came into use on a scale never before seen among the Greeks. Massive concentrations of slaves worked under especially brutal conditions in the silver mines at Laureion in south-eastern Attica after the discovery of a major vein of <b>silver-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> there in 483 BC, while the phenomenon of skilled slave craftsmen producing manufactured goods in small factories and workshops became increasingly common.|$|E

50|$|There {{are very}} few {{literary}} references to sources for silver. It is also difficult to identify the actual origin of the silver and the mines from those areas in which the majority of trade occurred. Because silver was used as currency {{it is even more}} difficult to pinpoint an area of origination due to its vast circulation. The 'Silver Mountains' mentioned in association with the campaigns of Sargon of Akkad are identified as the mines found at Keban on the Upper Euphrates. Other, more generic, silver-producing areas are Aratta, Dilmun, Elam, Marḫashi (also known as Barhashi or Parahshum) and Meluḫḫa. Some known areas in Iran containing argentiferous lead that could have been exploited at this time are Azerbaijan, Kerman, and the Miyana-Zanjan region. Anatolia, especially the mining region of Bolkardag in the Taurus Mountains, is also well known for <b>silver-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> deposits and probably supplied most of the silver to Mesopotamia at this time.|$|E

Early Iron Age bivillate hill forts survive nearby at Bayston Hill, Caer Caradoc in the Stretton Hills and on The Wrekin. The 1st century Roman legionary fortress at Uriconium, only a mile and half distant, {{was one of the}} largest towns in Roman Britain and the Romans exploited <b>silver-bearing</b> lead <b>ores</b> and outcrop coal on the Shropshire plains.|$|R

The main motive for settlement was to find and exploit deposits of precious metals. Archaeological evidence of silver extraction at La Isabela seemed {{to indicate that the}} expedition had located and tested deposits of <b>silver-bearing</b> lead <b>ore</b> in the Caribbean. Lead isotope analysis refutes this hypothesis but provides new evidence of the desperation of the inhabitants of La Isabela just before its abandonment...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of a biological treatment process to enhance silver recovery from a low grade, <b>silver-bearing</b> manganese <b>ore.</b> These manganese oxide ores have been classified as refractory and thereby characterized noncommercial for the recovery and production of silver by conventional methods. A species of Bacillus polymyxa, which was isolated from the Crystal Hill Mine in southern Colorado, facilitated the reductive dissolution of manganese dioxide. Insoluble Mn(IV) was reduced to soluble Mn(II), and silver ions contained within the manganese oxide lattice were released and/or exposed, making them amenable to cyanide extraction. A direct relationship was observed between the biological transformation of Mn(IV) to a lower valence and increased silver recovery following cyanidation. Batch studies, with ore passing minus 10 mesh (0. 14 inch diameter), had silver recoveries that were twice the amount extracted by chemical treatment alone over a 120 -hour period. However, rates of reductive dissolution diminished significantly as ore particle size increased and specific surface area decreased...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis anthracological {{study of}} fuel wood {{used in the}} Faravel mines {{is part of a}} {{doctorate}} research pro-gramme conducted on the interrelationship between mines and forests of the Southern Alps during the Middle Ages. The study area is situated in the upper Durance valley, a major mining region from the 11 th {{to the end of the}} 13 th century. Man sought and extracted <b>silver-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> from the valley bottoms to the summit of the mountains. He employed firesetting to attack the hard gneiss bedrock. The study of residual charcoal has been used to measure the impact of the mining economy on the development of mountain forests. The example of the small district of Faravel situated in an upper mountainous region (1900 e 2150 m altitude), illustrates a supply anchored at subalpine level with a gradual extension of the source area towards the timberline. The anthracological spectra document extinction of Pinus cembra L. at subalpine level and the lowering of the upper limit of the dense forest dominated by Larix decidua Mill. These changes are the result of agropastoral and mining pressure, as testified by both surviving man-uscripts and archaeology...|$|E
40|$|Blanice furrow {{is about}} 180 km long NNE-SSW {{trending}} fault system which extends from Český Brod through České Budějovice to Linz in Austria. Numerous small sized silver bearing Ag-Zn- Pb±Cu deposits and two late-orogenic gold deposits (electrum) are hosted in this tectonic zone. The most important <b>silver-bearing</b> <b>ore</b> regions are Stříbrná Skalice -Střímělice, Ratibořské Hory - Stará Vožice and Rudolfov which were mined in the Middle Ages. The most important gold- bearing deposit is Roudný which was mined {{in the period}} 1985 - 1930. In this thesis, mineralogical characteristics of ore and isotopic composition of carbonates were studied. Galena and sphalerite does not contain silver which {{has been found in}} Ag-rich fahlore and other Ag-minerals. δ 18 O values of carbonates are 11 - 23 ‰ SMOW and δ 13 C values are - 8 to - 17 ‰ PDB. These isotopoe charakteristics indicates deep methamorphic origin of hydrothermal fluid. Significant variations in δ 13 C value suggests more than one source of carbon which is probably of deep crustal origin mixed with carbon of organic origin hosted in moldanubian crystalline units. Isotope fractionation equations have been used to determine the temperatures of carbonate crystallization which are about 100 - 300 řC and quite well corresponds to homogenization temperatures of fluid [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Highland Mary mine of the Eureka Mining {{district}} in the western San Juan Mountains produced silver rich ore since the Colorado mining boom of the early 1870 ’s. Galena and tetrahedrite were suspected to be the dominant silver-bearing minerals in the ore, but the concentrations of silver in the minerals was not constrained. Argentiferous galena was widely documented in the western San Juan Mountains, with minor silver occurring in tetrahedrite. Electron Microprobe geochemistry of galena and tetrahedrite demonstrates that tetrahedrite is the dominant <b>silver-bearing</b> species in <b>ore</b> at the Highland Mary mine. Galena has concentrations of silver of 0. 01 to 0. 03 wt. % while tetrahedrite contains from 0. 02 to 13. 4 wt. % silver. At the Highland Mary mine tetrahedrite is the more economic mineral, but many questions remain about the physical and chemical controls {{on the distribution of}} these argentiferous minerals in the region. This research reinforces the importance of establishing the metal concentrations in different mineral phases for both mineral exploration and development...|$|R
