5|$|For burnt bone, {{testability}} {{depends on}} {{the conditions under which}} the bone was burnt. If the bone was heated under reducing conditions, it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> often usable.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} a GIS {{study published}} in 2014 documented that for many rural areas {{the time needed to}} drive to water testing labs than is longer than the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> viable.|$|E
5|$|Benford's law {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings. According to Benford's law, {{the probability that the}} first decimal-digit of an item in the data <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> d (from 1 to 9) equals , regardless of the unit of measurement. Thus, about 30% of the data can be expected to have 1 as first digit, 18% start with 2, etc. Auditors examine deviations from Benford's law to detect fraudulent accounting.|$|E
30|$|As {{part of the}} study, {{groundwater}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} different areas. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> randomly taken from whole area of newly installed pumps to investigate the different water quality parameters in the groundwater. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken in 500  ml bottles. The 60 water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected in total from the groundwater. After {{the collection of the}} <b>samples,</b> the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> preserved and analyzed in the laboratory.|$|R
40|$|Muscle {{samples from}} the neck and {{diaphragm}} and fecal <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from five hogs from each of 50 lots of market hogs at three Manitoba abattoirs. Environmental <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> also collected. Each <b>sample</b> <b>was</b> tested for Salmonella contamination, and tissue and fecal <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> tested for Campylobacter...|$|R
30|$|Twenty <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from different sandstone sources (Missouri sandstone, Roubidoux sandstone, and Berea sandstone). The length (L) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm) and the diameter (d) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm). To {{make sure that}} the dimensions of all <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> exact, a caliper was used to measure the core length and diameter. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed in an oven at 120  °C for 24  h. After that, the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> evacuated and then saturated to 100  % with brines of chosen concentrations.|$|R
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the gold-standard {{method of}} {{cellular}} localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. The <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> prepared for normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein {{of interest that}} is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details {{as well as the}} protein of interest.|$|E
5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
30|$|Twenty-six {{brown algae}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} during October and November, 2014. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from the}} fringing reefs area with transect at c. 50  m and depth {{in the range of}} 50 – 150  cm. Four species including Turbinaria sp., Sargassum sp., Cystoseira sp. and Padina sp. <b>were</b> identified. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> stored in polyethylene bottles until transferring to laboratory. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> then flushed by seawater that was collected from the relevant locations. The soft parts in algae <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> separated and oven-dried at 105  °C. Dried <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> crushed to fine powder for treatment.|$|R
30|$|In Oman, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from 4 governorates: Musandam, Batinah North, Dakhilya, and Dhahira (Fig.  6). At least 15 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} 5 farms in each governorate. Lime leaf <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> also collected from 6 farms in Al-Ain (UAE) in March 2013. In addition, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from Hormozgan and Kerman (Iran) (Fig.  6). At least 20 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from each country. All <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> labeled {{and transferred to}} Plant Pathology Research Laboratory, Sultan Qaboos University, where they were stored at − 80  °C until used.|$|R
30|$|Plasma and serum <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{obtained}} from arterial blood samples {{taken from the}} indwelling arterial catheter. Blood <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes at 10 °C and then <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> frozen at - 80 °C until analysis. Urine <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected and frozen at - 80 °C until analysis.|$|R
5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E
5|$|The CSF <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> also {{examined}} for xanthochromia—the yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid. This {{can be determined}} by spectrophotometry (measuring the absorption of particular wavelengths of light) or visual examination. It is unclear which method is superior. Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache. An interval of at least 12hours between {{the onset of the}} headache and lumbar puncture is required, as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin.|$|E
5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. This is useful if the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E
30|$|At 4 tile {{drainage}} (TD) and 5 river sites (Ri), <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken weekly or biweekly from March to July 2013. A total of 40 {{tile drainage}} and 63 river <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed. At each site and on every sampling date, {{the volume of}} diatom <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> determined and <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> filtered through a 20 -µm plankton net. The retained organisms were transferred into 50 -mL glass bottles and fixed in 5 ‰ non-acetic Lugol’s iodine solution [42]. After 48  h, the supernatant liquid of undisturbed <b>samples</b> <b>is</b> carefully removed and <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> thus concentrated to 30  mL for further processing.|$|R
30|$|<b>Sampling</b> <b>was</b> {{done during}} two periods in April/May 2014 (on-set of rainy season) and November/December 2014 (on-set of dry season) {{from the various}} {{locations}} indicated above. Depth integrated water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected over bridges and preserved at about pH 2 with conc. HNO 3, whilst sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected through coring with a PVC tube. Two water and sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken from each location. The fish <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected using dragnet and stored in an ice chest at 4  °C and transported to the laboratory. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> later identified in the laboratory and prepared for analysis.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{contaminated}} pistachio <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared in}} closed package. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed before treatment. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed between the electrodes and then {{exposed to the}} plasma at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18  min. After plasma exposure, the treated <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> transferred for fungal analysis, each treatment was repeated thrice.|$|R
5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so that the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> partly regrown during its decomposition.|$|E
5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed {{to collect a}} sample of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> then exposed to a reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which was developed in the 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is related}} to several other methods for determining atomic structures. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering electrons or neutrons, which are likewise interpreted by Fourier transformation. If single crystals of sufficient size cannot be obtained, various other X-ray methods {{can be applied to}} obtain less detailed information; such methods include fiber diffraction, powder diffraction and (if the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> not crystallized) small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} six and half years, 862 {{different}} clinical samples [sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, thorax puncture, cerebrospinal fluid and skin samples] were tested by Gen-probe amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD) or ligase chain reaction (LCR) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 239 parallel clinical <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> cultivated, and some <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> stained with Ziehl-Neelsen staining. 1 - 4 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> tested per patient. 29 (12. 13 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive and 177 (74. 05 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> negative with both cultivation and molecular genetic methods. 2 (0. 83 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only on cultivation, and 31 (12. 97 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only with the molecular diagnostic methods. The differences are undoubtedly explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} molecular diagnostic methods...|$|R
30|$|The PVC biofilm <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from four different regions located {{in and around}} Tirupati (Chittoor District), Andhra Pradesh, India. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} drinking water supply PVC pipelines and stored in plastic bottles. The collected <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> in amorphous form. These <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> stored in an ice box and transported for further microbiological characterization analysis.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} {{fourteen}} sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> received {{as outlined in}} the table below. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed within 3 days of receipt. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> assigned a central file number (2974) and entered into Battelle’s sample log-in system. All <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> received at a temperature within the optimal temperature range for unpreserved samples (4 ± 2 °C) ...|$|R
5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be {{made on the basis of}} 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the community as a whole rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
30|$|Soil {{and plant}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from paddy fields of rice growing regions in Western, Mwea and Coastal Kenya. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> {{taken from a}} depth of 0 – 15 cm in the sampling farms where a zigzag format of <b>sampling</b> <b>was</b> used. The plants were uprooted and separated into the root and shoot systems. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> kept separately in paper bags and carried to the laboratory. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> kept in a refrigerator at 4 °C {{during the period of}} experimentation.|$|R
30|$|A set of oil samples totaling sixteen (16) were {{obtained}} from different oil fields within the Niger Delta basin. Ten (10) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> obtained from Kolo Creek field, four (4) oil <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> obtained from Nembe Creek field and two (2) oil samples from Afam oil field. All <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> obtained from the wellhead {{and serve as a}} true representative of the bulk. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> stored in glass vials and preserved in a refrigerator till the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> required for analysis.|$|R
30|$|Water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from the five selected sites of the lake at about 10 to 15  cm below the water surface {{with the help of}} a Ruttner sampler. To remove metal contaminants, the <b>sampling</b> plastic bottles <b>were</b> washed with 10 % HNO 3 and were rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. Soon after collection, all <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> acidified by adding a few drops of concentrated HNO 3. Similarly, Sediment samples from the same selected sites were also collected using Ekman Dredge sampler, and the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken by Grab <b>sampling</b> process. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> placed in polyethylene bags. Also plant <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> manually {{collected from}} the each designated site. The plant <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> washed with lake water followed by rinsing with distilled water before placed in plastic bags. Later, all <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> packed and labelled carefully (USEPA 1991).|$|R
5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue <b>sample</b> <b>is</b> combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
3000|$|... * in {{the cross}} section were {{obtained}} for each sample. The volume of the <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> measured with a digital caliper. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> oven-dried, and the oven-dry weight and the BD of the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> determined.|$|R
30|$|Blood and {{beverage}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed for ethanol concentrations.
