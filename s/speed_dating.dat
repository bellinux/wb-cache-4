25|$|The {{popularity}} or {{charm of}} <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> {{has led to}} at least one offspring: Speed Networking. A structured way of running business networking events with the goal of making meeting potential business contacts easier and more productive.

25|$|In a 2012 study, {{researchers}} found that activation of specific brain regions while viewing images of opposite-sex <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> participants was predictive {{of whether or not}} a participant would later pursue or reject the viewed participants at an actual <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> event. Men and women made decisions in a similar manner which incorporated the physical attractiveness and likability of the viewed participants in their evaluation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>dating</b> is a formalized {{matchmaking}} {{process of}} dating system whose {{purpose is to}} encourage people to meet a large number of new people. Its origins are credited to Rabbi Yaacov Deyo of Aish HaTorah, originally as a way to help Jewish singles meet and marry. SpeedDating, as a single word, is a registered trademark of Aish HaTorah. <b>Speed</b> <b>dating,</b> as two separate words, is often used as a generic term for similar events.|$|E
25|$|According to the New York Times, {{participants}} in <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> experience {{an average of}} 2 in 10 or 3 in 10 matches. Online dating participants, in contrast, only find a compatible match with 1 in 100 or fewer of the profiles they study. As reported by the BBC in the Science of Love, it only takes between 90 seconds to 4 minutes of face-to-face interaction to determine attraction, which gives <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> an advantage over online dating.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, a {{documentary}} film called The Age of Love used humor and poignant adventures of 30 seniors who attend a <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> event for 70- to 90-year-olds, and discovered how {{the search for}} romance changes; or does not change; from a childhood sweetheart to older age.|$|E
25|$|The {{more time}} {{participants}} {{are allowed to}} make some judgment about a person, the more they will weigh information beyond physical appearance. Specific manipulations include identifying men as gay versus straight and people as trustworthy or not. In {{a study of the}} interaction between ratings of people in <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> and the form of media used to present them, impression accuracy in a <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> task was not significantly different when a potential date was presented in person versus in a video. However, impressions of dates made via video were to be much more negative than those made in person. An additional study that looked at characterization of a romantic partner suggested that {{people are more likely to}} rely on “gut reactions” when meeting in person, but there isn't sufficient information for this kind of evaluation when viewing someone online.|$|E
500|$|Rhys {{appears in}} all three Torchwood novels in the first wave {{published}} by BBC Books in January 2007, set between episodes of Torchwood series one. These novels expand on the difficult period in Gwen and Rhys' relationship— whilst his appearances in Another Life, and Border Princes, are relatively minor, he has a more significant role in Slow Decay, where he unwittingly brings himself into danger by taking an alien diet pill. Reviewer Patrick Holm feels {{that the success of}} these novels {{lies in the fact that}} they help readers empathise with characters such as Rhys. Rhys makes cameo appearances in Something in the Water (set between [...] "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" [...] and [...] "Meat") and Trace Memory, and has a significant role in The Twilight Streets, (released March 2008) which depicts an alternate future where Gwen and Rhys start a new Torchwood to make a safe world for their son after the Torchwood Team are destroyed fighting sentient particles known as the dark. Three more Torchwood books were released in October 2008 in which Rhys has an involved role. In Pack Animals [...] Rhys assists Gwen in her investigation and becomes part of a car chase, SkyPoint sees them inadvertently [...] discover an alien presence whilst flathunting and Almost Perfect, the first novel set after [...] "Exit Wounds", depicts Rhys <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> undercover. Rhys makes further appearances in later Torchwood novels Bay of the Dead, The House that Jack Built, and Consequences, all set between [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] and Children of Earth.|$|E

2500|$|Several online dating {{services}} offer online <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> where users meet {{online for}} video, audio or text chats. [...] The advantage of online <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> is that users {{can go on}} dates from home {{as it can be}} done from any internet enabled computer. The disadvantage is people do not actually meet one another. One of the advantages that <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> has over online <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> and online dating in general is that when being face to face with someone, you get a better sense of who they are due to their body language, gestures, tonality and more.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{feel that}} <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> has some obvious {{advantages}} over most other venues for meeting people, such as bars, discotheques, etc. in {{that everybody is}} purportedly there to meet someone, they are grouped into compatible age ranges, it is time-efficient, and the structured interaction eliminates the need to introduce oneself. [...] Unlike many bars, a <b>speed</b> <b>dating</b> event will, by necessity, be quiet enough for people to talk comfortably. <b>Speed</b> <b>dating</b> is for singles.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—The {{ability to}} judge another individual’s ro-mantic {{interest}} level—both toward oneself and toward others—is an adaptively important skill {{when choosing a}} suitable mate to pursue. We tested this ability using videos of individuals on <b>speed</b> <b>dates</b> as stimuli. Male and female observers were equally good at predicting interest levels, but they were more accurate when predicting male inter-est: Predictions of female interest were just above chance. Observers predicted interest successfully using stimuli as short as 10 s, and they performed best when watching clips of the middle or end of the <b>speed</b> <b>date.</b> There was consid-erable variability between daters, with some being very easy to read and others apparently masking their true intentions.
