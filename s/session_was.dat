5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third <b>session</b> <b>was</b> held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The Friday morning practice <b>session</b> <b>was</b> held on a dusty track scattered with debris and several drivers spun off the track. Hamilton set the fastest {{time of the first}} session, at 1 minute and 28.653 seconds; his late lap was almost one second quicker than teammate Button. The two Mercedes drivers ended third and fourth quickest; Michael Schumacher ahead of Rosberg. Vettel and Webber set the fifth and eighth fastest times respectively for Red Bull; they were separated by the Renault cars of Kubica and Vitaly Petrov. Alonso and Adrian Sutil rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The <b>session</b> <b>was</b> disrupted with two minutes remaining when Sutil ran wide at turn eight, which caused him to spin backwards and crash into the barriers, breaking his front wing and both front tyres.

5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Friday was held {{before the two}} races. The <b>session</b> <b>was</b> held on a dirty track with lap times gradually improving over the 45-minute period when the cars cleaned the circuit. Nato set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:55.392, ahead of Giovinazzi in second and Sirotkin third. Gasly was fourth-fastest; Rowland was fifth and Luca Ghiotto sixth. King, Arthur Pic, Marciello, and Sergio Canamasas rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The <b>session</b> <b>was</b> disrupted when King went onto the turn 15 run-off area and was required to swerve to avoid hitting a van parked at the corner. It prompted the activation of the virtual safety car (VSC) to allow the vehicle to be moved. Two further VSC periods were necessitated late in the session when Marciello and Gustav Malja slid off the track at the same corner, ending their sessions prematurely.|$|E
5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} <b>session</b> <b>was</b> held on Thursday {{before the}} two races. The <b>session</b> <b>was</b> held on a dry race track upon having dried up from earlier rain.

40|$|Background: TBL {{value in}} medical {{education}} is in promoting individual accountability while developing skills for teamwork. Summary of work: TBL <b>sessions</b> <b>were</b> introduced since 2010 to medical students at UGD. Two TBL <b>sessions</b> <b>were</b> administered {{for each of}} the courses ‘Fundamentals in Immunology’ and ‘Clinical Immunology’. <b>Sessions</b> <b>were</b> conducted in collaboration with the E-learning Center. Summary of results: TBL <b>sessions</b> <b>were</b> adjusted to 60 minutes sessions. A total of 544 medical students, 487 in Fundamentals of Immunology and 57 in Clinical Immunology underwent the TBL <b>sessions.</b> Students <b>were</b> divided in groups of 5 - 6 students and were initially administered a short Readiness Assessment Test followed by case presentations, discussions and teams answers to multiple-choice questions. TBL <b>sessions</b> <b>were</b> not obligatory. Points were awarded for presence and the winning team was awarded extra points. Because of the large number of students, two sets of TBL sessions on the same topic were created and administered. Conclusions: TBL <b>sessions</b> <b>were</b> very well accepted and enjoyed by the students. Students very much preferred this type of interactive, active learning as opposed to classical lecturing. Take-home messages: TBL <b>sessions</b> <b>are</b> a valuable teaching tool that can also be administered in medical schools in developing countries...|$|R
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in dry and warm weather conditions. Both Ferrari drivers {{maintained}} their good performance from qualifying; Barrichello had the fastest time of 1:22.251. Michael Schumacher set the second fastest time. Ralf Schumacher recorded the third fastest time with Coulthard rounding out the top four. The <b>session</b> <b>was</b> disrupted by an incident which involved de la Rosa when he struck the barriers at turn 12 – the <b>session</b> <b>was</b> prematurely ended as marshals were required to clear the track – and Herbert clipped the tyre barrier at turn 14 after spinning on oil on the circuit.|$|E
5|$|The second {{practice}} <b>session</b> <b>was</b> held in wet but drying weather conditions. During the session, Schumacher {{went off}} the track at the exit of turnfive, damaging his car's front wing in the process. However, he still set the fastest time of the session (1:23.607) after a change to his car's ride height proved beneficial to its performance. The top six was completed by Berger, Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, and Olivier Panis' Ligier.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday afternoon and evening sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third <b>session</b> <b>was</b> held on Saturday afternoon and lasted an hour. The first practice <b>session</b> <b>was</b> initially held on a wet track with a clear sky after rainstorms {{earlier in the day}} left standing water on parts of the circuit, and high humidity slowed the drying process. These conditions meant drivers used intermediate tyres first before dry tyres were utilised in the session's closing minutes. Webber set the fastest time of the first session with a late lap of 1 minute and 54.589 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second who was briefly quickest before Webber set his lap. Adrian Sutil, with a lap of 1:58.827, was third fastest, ahead of Vettel and Jaime Alguersuari. Button, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Sébastien Buemi, Kubica, and Vitaly Petrov rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers.|$|E

Audi's second R18 was twice shown a black and orange flag {{because of a lack}} of telemetry for which the team was given a €1,000 suspended fine for the remainder of the race weekend and were required to change the vehicle's battery. LMP2 was led by Pipo Derani's No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Oreca with a lap of two minutes and 8.974 seconds which was recorded within the session's first-quarter.
