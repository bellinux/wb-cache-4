50|$|A Wurstbrot is a {{slice of}} bread spread with slices of lunch meat or sausage. Additionally, the bread may be buttered to taste. It is a very simple and typical German type of sandwich, {{generally}} home-made, eaten cold, and popular as a snack, packed lunch {{as well as for}} breakfast or supper. The <b>sausage</b> used <b>for</b> <b>spreading</b> is never a bratwurst.|$|R

30|$|The {{amount of}} fluids {{released}} during chewing {{of meat and}} meat products {{is an important factor}} in their organoleptic evaluation.

Refrigerated storage of duck meat <b>sausages</b> <b>for</b> 14  days significantly (P <  0.01) decreased mean juiciness scores compared to fresh sausages, which is evident due to the loss of moisture during storage.|$|R

It is established that the use of the cavitation brine gives the finished product a gentle consistence, elasticity and distinct taste that makes it more preferable for the consumer. </p...|$|R
