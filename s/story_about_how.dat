25|$|Next is Aristophanes, {{the comic}} playwright.

And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, in order to become whole.

25|$|The Deathly Hallows {{are three}} magical {{objects that are}} the focus of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – an unbeatable wand, a stone to bring the dead to life, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, they are said to give mastery over death.

According to Rowling, the <b>story</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> these objects came into existence is based upon Geoffrey Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale.|$|E

This is a <b>story</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the domestic happiness of a young tutor, who marries the unacknowledged daughter of a Russian sensualist of the old type, dull, ignorant and genial, is troubled by a Russian sensualist of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous, with there being no possibility of saying who is most to blame for the tragic ending.|$|E

25|$|It was Tyre, a major {{maritime}} city-state of Phoenicia, {{which first}} settled Carthage, probably {{in order to}} enjoy a permanent station there for its ongoing trade. Legends alive in the African city for centuries assigned its foundation to a queen of Tyre, Elissa, also called Dido. The Roman historian Pompeius Trogus, a near contemporary of Virgil, describes a sinister web of court intrigue which caused Queen Elissa (Dido) to flee the city of Tyre westward with a fleet of ships. The Roman poet Virgil (70–19 B.C.) portrays Dido as the tragic, admirable heroine of his epic the Aeneid, which contains many inventions loosely based on legendary history, and includes the <b>story</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the Phoenician queen acquired the Byrsa.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told a <b>story</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> {{when he was a}} kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E
25|$|The Aztecs {{were one}} of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who {{migrated}} to this part of the Valley of Mexico {{after the fall of the}} Toltec Empire. Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already there, but the Aztecs were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs themselves had a <b>story</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> their city was founded after being led to the island by their principal god, Huitzilopochtli. According to the story, the god indicated their new home with a sign, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak. This image appears in Codex Mendoza, an early post-conquest manuscript, one of many Aztec codices, pictorial texts, and since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the image is in the center of the Mexican flag. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states or altepetl around Lake Texcoco, and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
