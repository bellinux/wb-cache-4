40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} discontinuous space vector PWM (DPWM) {{techniques for}} a five-phase two-level {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI). <b>Space</b> vector model <b>of</b> a five-phase VSI shows that there exist 32 space vectors with three different lengths forming three concentric decagons. Application of outer most and middle <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> vectors to implement Space vector PWM yield nearly sinusoidal output. Thus the proposed DPWM utilises the same <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> vectors to implement the discontinuous modulation techniques. Performance is evaluated in terms of total harmonic distortion (THD) in the output phase voltages. A significant reduction in switching losses is observed by adopting the proposed PWM schemes. The simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the concept. I...|$|R
40|$|Macedonia This paper investigates {{ethnic group}} relations. By {{utilizing}} Space Syntax theory and methodology, it considers one dimension {{of social relations}} between Albanians and Macedonians. That dimension is spatial appropriation during the evening hanging out and evening informal activities at the weekends. Otherwise, the overall relations between these two ethnic groups have been paradoxical, ranging from co-existence and respect to armed conflict. Two multiethnic towns {{in the western part}} of Macedonia are investigated. The "majority " in one of the towns is presented by Albanians and in the other one by Macedonians. Also, the use of the terms "majority " and "minority " is conditional, having in mind the slight difference between the size of the ethnic groups in the study cases. The study reveals similar- if not identical- social and spatial patterns. In fact, the relation between "majority " and "minority " is constant. In each town considered, during the evening events, the "majority", correspondingly "minority", uses a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> with similar configurational properties. The <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> used by the "minority " is separated, but, adjacent to the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> used by the "majority", which together belong to the centre of the town. 1...|$|R

Antenna array and aperture theory are applied to the model and used to derive equations for the total received field that enable a clear understanding of fading over various distances along the path. It is shown that lower frequency fades, which have often heretofore been attributed to shadowing by obstructions, can result from multipath interference. This is confirmed via Fourier analysis of data measured on line-of -sight microcellular-type radio channels at 1. 8 Hz. To preserve fidelity in results, this analysis is conducted within short path lengths over which the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> waves remains unchanged.
