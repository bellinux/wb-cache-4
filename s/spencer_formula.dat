The number 10, in (N+10), is the approximate number of days after the December solstice to January 1. This equation overestimates the declination near the September equinox by up to +1.5°. The sine function approximation by itself leads to an error of up to 0.26° and has been discouraged for use in solar energy applications. [...] The 1971 <b>Spencer</b> <b>formula</b> (based on a fourier series) is also discouraged for having an error of up to 0.28°. An additional error of up to 0.5° can occur in all equations around the equinoxes if not using a decimal place when selecting N to adjust for the time after UT midnight for the beginning of that day. So the above equation can have up to 2.0° of error, about four times the Sun's angular width, depending on how it is used.|$|E

40|$|REPLY: Dr. Spencer {{proposes a}} unique and presumably useful method of {{evaluating}} the percentage of tumors imaged {{as a function of}} the quantity of antibody administered. This is done using a Michaelis Menten type analysis. There are concerns about the formula A + T <=sAT â€”Â»(AT), in addition to those mentioned by Dr. <b>Spencer.</b> 1. The <b>formula</b> indicates that the antibody can dissociate back and forth to form a stable or internalized complex. However, it is possible that the degree to which each individual antibody is in equilibrium is dependent on its affinity, whether the antigen is shed from the surface and to what degree, and the extent to which internalization and/or modulation occurs. It is uncertain whether this formula would hold in all casesâ€” for example, there are studies, such as the use of T 101 in leukemia, in which other variables may influence this hypoth esis. 2. "'In may dissociate to a small or great extent after antibody binding and is in equilibrium with transferrin in the serum (- 5 % of the indium per day is in equilibrium with this protein). With '"I, there is considerable dehalogenation over time. This will affect calculation of actual uptake of the antibody isotope/complex. Thus, this equation is an oversimplification of what is actually happening at the cell surface, although, as Dr. Spencer suggests, it may lead to useful approaches...|$|R

University Teachers Group (UTG) abstracts This study aimed to identify the: • number of abstracts presented at the University Teachers Group session, from 1999 - 2010, at the British Orthodontic Conference. • following characteristics of the abstract and determine their influence on rate of and time to publication: o Funding disclosure: (Yes / No) o Dental School of origin • abstracts that went on to be published as a full paper in a peer reviewed journal. Design: Retrospective, observational study. Subject and Setting: The sample frame included dental clinical trials presented at the conferences of the International Association of Dental Research (IADR), European Orthodontic Society (EOS), European Organisation for Caries Research (ORCA), The American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) and The Australian Society of Orthodontists (ASO) from January 2005 to December 2007. The sample frame for the University Teachers Group (UTG) abstracts, included abstracts presented at the UTG session of the British Orthodontic Conference (BOC) 1999 - 2010. Sample size Spencer found a publication rate of 38 % from abstracts of clinical trials presented at EOS, IADR, ORCA and a 50 % increase would be give a publication rate of 57 %. Using data from <b>Spencer</b> in Pocock’s <b>formula,</b> 210 abstracts {{would be required to}} give 80 % power, at the 5 % level, and enable me to detect a 50 % rise in the proportion of clinical trial abstracts published. Method: Clinical trials presented at above conferences were identified from the associated journals or conference proceedings. Inter-examiner and intra-examiner reliability were assessed using a random 10 % sample of abstracts. A MEDLINE search was undertaken to determine whether the abstract had been published in full. The date of publication was recorded. Authors of abstracts that did not reach publication were contacted to determine the reasons. Results: Seven thousand and sixty-nine abstracts presented from 2005 - 2007 were identified, including 215 clinical trials. 142 abstracts were identified from the UTG session from 1998 – 2008, and all were included. The publication rate for the 2005 - 2007 sample was 32. 6 % and the UTG sample 34. 5 %. There were no predictors of publication in either group studied. The median time to publication of the 2005 – 2007 group was 16. 00 months, IQR (10, 26) and the mean time to publication for the UTG group was 18. 3 months (95 % CI 14. 38, 22. 19). For the unpublished 2005 - 2007 group, reasons given for failure to publish were lack of time (8. 3 %), language, culture, lack of teaching (1. 4 %), rejection (0. 7 %), motivation (0. 7 %), perceived editorial bias (0. 7 %) and length of review process (0. 7 %). For the UTG group, reasons given included lack of time (19. 4 %), lack of interest from SpR (9. 7 %) or in press (7. 5 %). Conclusions: No predictors of publication were found for either group studied. For the unpublished 2005 - 2007 group, main reasons given were lack of time (8. 3 %), language, culture and lack of teaching (1. 4 %). For the UTG group, reasons given included lack of time (19. 4 %), lack of interest from SpR (9. 7 %) or in press (7. 5 %). The qualitative results should be viewed with caution due to the low response rate (12. 4 % for the 2005 – 2007 sample, and 68. 8 % for UTG) ...|$|R
