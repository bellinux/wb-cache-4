We {{use the new}} GLOMAP {{model of}} global aerosol microphysics to {{investigate}} the sensitivity of modelled sulfate and <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> aerosol properties to uncertainties in the driving microphysical processes and compare these uncertainties with those associated with aerosol and precursor gas emissions. Overall, we conclude that uncertainties in microphysical processes have a larger effect on global sulfate and <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> derived condensation <b>nuclei</b> (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations than uncertainties in present-day sulfur emissions. Our simulations suggest that uncertainties in predicted sulfate and <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> CCN abundances due to poorly constrained microphysical processes {{are likely to be}} of a similar magnitude to long-term changes in sulfate and <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> CCN due to changes in anthropogenic emissions.

It also offers the opportunity to use ice core <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> records as proxies for past sea ice extent. To explore this possibility in the Arctic region, we use a chemical transport model to track the emission, transport and deposition of <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> from both the open ocean and the sea ice, allowing us to assess the relative importance of each. Our results confirm the importance of <b>sea</b> ice <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> (SISS) to the winter Arctic aerosol burden. For the first time, we explicitly simulate the <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations of Greenland snow and find they match high resolution Greenland ice core records to within a factor of two.

For the Amazon, a negative east–west gradient of <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> availability is assumed {{as a consequence of the}} barrier effect of the Andes Mountains for Pacific air masses. However, this generalized pattern may not hold for the tropical mountain rainforest in the Andes of southern Ecuador. To analyse <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> availability, we investigated the deposition of sodium (Na +) and chloride (Cl −), which are good proxies of sea spray aerosol. Because of the complexity of the terrain and related cloud and rain formation processes, <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> deposition was analysed from both, rain and occult precipitation (OP) along an altitudinal gradient over a period between 2004 and 2009. To assess the influence of easterly and westerly air masses on the deposition of sodium and chloride over southern Ecuador, <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> aerosol concentration data from the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) reanalysis data set and back-trajectory statistical methods were combined. Our results, based on deposition time series, show a clear difference in the temporal variation of sodium and chloride concentration and Na +  ∕ Cl − ratio in relation to height and exposure to winds. At higher elevations, sodium and chloride present a higher seasonality and the Na +  ∕ Cl − ratio is closer to that of <b>sea</b> <b>salt.</b> Medium- to long-range <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> transport exhibited a similar seasonality, which shows the link between our measurements at high elevations and the <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> synoptic transport.

40|$|Coarse <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> {{particles}} are emitted ubiquitously {{from the ocean}} surface by wave-breaking and bubble-bursting processes. These particles impact the atmospheric chemistry by affecting the condensation of gas-phase species and, thus, indirectly the nucleation of new fine particles, particularly in regions with significant air pollution. In this study, atmospheric particle concentrations are modeled for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions in northwestern Europe using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system and are compared to European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) measurement data. The <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> emission module is extended by a salinity-dependent scaling of the <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> emissions because the salinity in {{large parts of the}} Baltic Sea is very low, which leads to considerably lower <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> mass emissions compared to other oceanic regions. The resulting improvement in predicted <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations is assessed. The contribution of surf zone emissions is considered separately. Additionally, the impacts of <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> particles on atmospheric nitrate and ammonium concentrations and on nitrogen deposition are evaluated. The comparisons with observational data show that <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations are commonly overestimated at coastal stations and partly underestimated farther inland. The introduced salinity scaling improves the predicted Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations considerably. The dates of measured peak concentrations are appropriately reproduced by the model. The impact of surf zone emissions is negligible in both seas.
