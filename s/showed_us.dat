500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{developed}} by UK-based computer game company Zippo Games, headed by Ste and John Pickford; {{this was the first}} game Zippo developed for fellow UK-based video game company Rare. At the time, Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled Cosmic Pirate - a game that was published by Palace Software and released for the Commodore64, AtariST, and Amiga in 1988. New to the technical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library, though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "The NES seemed primitive by comparison, sub-Commodore64. But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers, which we appreciated, and we wanted to try to make games as good as that." [...] Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this Wizards & Warriors sequel; Pickford remarked: [...] "Rare <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> Wizards & Warriors and asked us to develop the sequel, and pretty much left us to it." [...] Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them.|$|E
500|$|The {{nationalist}} incursions became {{fewer and}} further between {{after the two}} guerrilla armies suffered repeated setbacks against the security forces during the late 1960s, with many attacks being countered by the RLI. The capture by the RLI of Phinias Majuru, the ZIPRA Director of Operations, in January 1970 caused a cessation for six years of major operations by ZIPRA, which had been the more active guerrilla army up to that point. The Rhodesian Light Infantry's performance during this early period of the Bush War is generally considered to have been of a very high standard, with historian Alexandre Binda pointing to Operation Cauldron (1968) in particular as having contributed to the Battalion's formidable [...] "fighting character" [...] and reputation as [...] "outstanding and peerless anti-terrorist fighters". This opinion was shared by Platoon Warrant Officer Herod of the Rhodesian African Rifles, who was wounded during this operation while fighting alongside the RLI on 18 March 1968. [...] "We of the RAR used to laugh at your soldiers," [...] he said in hospital to a visiting RLI officer; [...] "To us they looked like boys. But they <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> how to fight. They have the faces of boys, but they fight like lions." ...|$|E
500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E

TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles [...] "is surely {{one of the}} most intense guys on TV", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were [...] "an odd way to build a mythology: the Big Secret seems to be that people in {{positions}} of power are evil and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea."

I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, mostly complimenting Davies's performance as Daniel. Chris Carabott of IGN commented {{that if this}} is the last appearance of Davies on Lost, which he [...] "somehow" [...] doubts, then, [...] "I'm glad he had the opportunity to leave on such a strong note. He delivers in some really great, emotional, moments this week – especially in the scenes in which he is suffering from memory deterioration. I've become a huge fan of Davies {{over the course of the}} last couple of years thanks to his performance on this show." [...] Rachel Dovey of Paste said the episode revealed [...] "a whole different" [...] side of Daniel: [...] "We've oscillated before about the true nature of the physicist, whether it's good or evil [...] We decided he's mostly a decent guy, barring the whole experimenting-on-his-girlfriend-then-running-away-when-her-brain-turned-to-mush thing. In the past, he's just seemed lost and confused, and, since he has those big, earnest puppy eyes, we decided to forgive him. But 'The Variable' <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> the dynamic at the heart of Daniel's stuttering vulnerability. Like all broken superheroes and Freudian beings, the man has mommy issues. This week we dove inside the dynamic between Daniel and his mother growing up." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} after the war many of Cardus's earlier heroes and acquaintances died. On Fry's death in 1956 Cardus wrote of him as [...] "A great Englishman, {{measured}} by any standards of occupation, art and civilisation". In 1959, still in harness, Newman {{died at the age}} of 90; Cardus considered him the most outstanding of all music critics, and thought he should have been appointed a Companion of Honour (CH), or even to the Order of Merit. Beecham died on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for some years noted a decline in his old friend's powers, though he had written in 1954, on the occasion of Beecham's 75th birthday, of the debt the music world owed to the conductor: [...] "He led us out of the Teutonic captivity. He <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> other and more sensitive worlds". After Beecham's death, Cardus organised the publication of a celebratory memoir, as he had done with Kathleen Ferrier. To an extent the departed idols were replaced with new heroes: in music, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau; in cricket, Keith Miller and Garfield Sobers. Cardus maintained a keen antagonism towards much of contemporary music; discussing Pierre Boulez's Pli selon pli after a performance in 1965, he said he [...] "could not relate the varied succession of aural phenomena to music as my musical intelligence and senses recognise music".|$|E
