5|$|A <b>subfield</b> of the {{sociology}} of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology {{is the study of}} death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as {{the sociology}} of death. This topic is exemplifed by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms can {{be found}} almost {{anywhere}} on Earth. Bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, including most protists, some fungi, {{as well as some}} micro-animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microorganisms, although a <b>subfield</b> of microbiology is virology, the study of viruses.|$|E
5|$|Object {{permanence}} is {{the understanding}} that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied {{in the field of}} developmental psychology, the <b>subfield</b> of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.|$|E
40|$|A {{polynomial}} time algorithm to give a complete description of all <b>subfields</b> of a given number field was given in an article by van Hoeij et al. This article reports on a massive speedup of this algorithm. This is primary achieved by our new concept of Galois-generating <b>subfields.</b> In general {{this is a very}} small set of <b>subfields</b> that determine all other <b>subfields</b> in a group-theoretic way. We compute them by targeted calls to the method from van Hoeij et al. For an early termination of these calls, we give a list of criteria that imply that further calls will not result in additional <b>subfields.</b> Finally, we explain how we use <b>subfields</b> to get a good starting group for the computation of Galois groups.

40|$|Given a field {{extension}} K/k {{of degree}} n {{we are interested}} in finding the <b>subfields</b> of K containing k. There can be more than polynomially many <b>subfields.</b> We introduce the notion of generating <b>subfields,</b> a set of up to n <b>subfields</b> whose intersections give the rest. We provide an efficient algorithm which uses linear algebra in k or lattice reduction along with factorization in any extension of K. Implementations show that previously difficult cases can now be handled...|$|R
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent <b>subfield</b> of sociology, {{compared}} to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E
5|$|This <b>subfield</b> of {{sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this <b>subfield,</b> military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E
5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the <b>subfield</b> known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E
40|$|For {{a finite}} {{separable}} field extension K/k, all <b>subfields</b> {{can be obtained}} by intersecting so-called principal <b>subfields</b> of K/k. In this work we present a way to quickly compute these intersections. If the number of <b>subfields</b> is high, then this leads to faster run times and an improved complexity.

5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The <b>subfield</b> CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The <b>subfield</b> dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. Marine biology (biological oceanography) studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>subfields</b> of {{quaternion}} algebras that are quadratic extensions of their center in characteristic 2. We provide {{examples of the}} following: two non-isomorphic quaternion algebras that share all their quadratic <b>subfields,</b> two quaternion algebras that share all their inseparable but not all their separable quadratic <b>subfields</b> and two algebras that share all their separable but not all their inseparable quadratic <b>subfields.</b> We also discuss quaternion algebras over global fields and fields of Laurent series over a perfect field of characteristic 2 and show that the quaternion algebras over these fields are determined by their separable quadratic <b>subfields.</b> Throughout, these linkage questions are treated in the more general setting by considering the linkage of Pfister forms.

40|$|We study genus 2 {{function}} {{fields with}} elliptic <b>subfields</b> of degree 2. The locus Ł_ 2 of these fields is a 2 -dimensional subvariety of the moduli space M_ 2 of genus 2 fields.

We use a birational parameterization of Ł_ 2 by affine 2 -space to study the relation between the j-invariants of the degree 2 elliptic <b>subfields.</b> This extends work of Geyer, Gaudry, Stichtenoth and others. We find a 1 -dimensional family of genus 2 curves having exactly two isomorphic elliptic <b>subfields</b> of degree 2; this family is parameterized by the j-invariant of these <b>subfields...</b>|$|R
