As one front end of such a culinary-assistance system, an integrated, multi-sensor, low-cost, autonomous, smart spoon device, denoted as Lab-on-Spoon (LoS), has been conceived. The first realized instance presented here features temperature, color, and impedance spectroscopy sensing in a 3 -D-printed spoon package. Acquired LoS data are subject to sensor fusion and decision making on the host system. LoS was successfully applied to liquid ingredient recognition and quality assessment, including contamination detection, in several applications, e. g., for glycerol detection in wine. In future work, improvement to sensors, electronics, and algorithms will be pursued to achieve an even more robust, dependable and self-sufficient LoS system...|$|R

In addition, efficiency is also a major concern since many smart home applications are deployed on mobile devices where high-end GPUs are not available. In this paper, we investigate compact and efficient food image recognition methods, namely low-level and mid-level approaches.

On a challenging small food image dataset where only 12 training images are available per category, our framework has shown superior performance in both accuracy and robustness. In addition, to better model deformable food part distribution, we extend LDC’s feature-to-class distance idea and propose a mid-level superpixel food parts-to-class distance mining framework.

Even if projection {{is used as a}} priority, this system should be designed to solve three practical problems: 1) there are many areas where sharp images cannot be projected in a kitchen, 2) kitchen is a too complex environment to display visual prompts using only a single method, 3) remote supporters do not know the kitchen environment well enough. In this paper we propose a novel system overcoming the above problems as follows, respectively. 1) The system first tries indirect projection of circular markers as visual prompts around target objects. 2) Proper method is automatically selected from using pro-jector, embedded monitor and illumination devices based on environmental information. 3) The system automatically ac-quires flat surfaces to project on and their reflectance prop-erties as the environmental information.

3000|$|The <b>Smart</b> <b>Kitchen</b> is a {{good example}} for complex {{interactions}} between different subsystems that operate in a building or room, respectively. To achieve maximum energy efficiency, the system needs to know about room occupancy. Lighting conditions have to be adapted by electric light and sunblinds depending on outside light conditions and on the activity of the user, for example, when operating the coffee machine, reading journals that are on display in the kitchen, holding a meeting, or coming together for an informal break. The room climate has to be maintained, but only upon occupancy. Since the climate has much longer reaction times than, for example, lighting, the system has to either predict usage [35] or keep climate permanently at comfort level-which is not energy efficient. Instead the system has to operate the room in comfort mode (if it is occupied) or in pre-comfort mode (if unoccupied). In pre-comfort mode, the room can be operated in more relaxed conditions regarding temperature and humidity. This degree of freedom again allows for flexibility in usage of renewable energy sources and cost optimization (e.g., by cooling the room in summer at times when energy from the grid is cheap or when renewable energy is available). Lighting conditions are extremely critical, since human users react sensibly on changes, so the amount of changes has to be kept at a minimum. Furthermore, there is no common lighting level for a room, but it strongly depends on the geometry and obstacles in the room as well as the lighting installation in the room. To maintain a high level of comfort {{while at the same time}} optimizing for all other goals (energy efficiency, costs, usage of renewable) is a most challenging task that can be approached satisfactorily by the presented model [...]...|$|E
