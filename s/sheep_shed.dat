The median concentrations of airborne endotoxin determined with LAL test in poultry houses, <b>sheep</b> <b>sheds,</b> piggeries, cow barns, and horse stables were respectively 62. 49 mu g/m(3), 26. 2 mu g/m(3), 3. 8 mu g/m(3), 1. 65 mu g/m(3), and 1. 14 mu g/m(3), while those determined with the GC-MSMS technique were respectively 1. 06 mu g/m(3), 7. 91 mu g/m(3), 0. 2 mu g/m(3), 0. 31 mu g/m(3), and 1. 42 mu g/m(3). The median concentrations of airborne endotoxin determined with LAL test and GC-MSMS technique in hay storage barns were much smaller, 0. 09 mu g/m(3) and 0. 03 mu g/m(3), respectively. The concentrations of airborne endotoxin (LPS) detected with GC-MSMS method in the air of <b>sheep</b> <b>sheds</b> were significantly greater than in all other examined facilities, while those detected in hay storage barns were significantly smaller than in all other examined facilities (p< 0. 05). The concentrations of airborne endotoxin determined with LAL test and GC-MSMS analysis exceeded in most of animal houses examined (91 % by each method) the threshold limit value for airborne endotoxin of 0. 1 mu g/m(3) proposed by various authors. A significant correlation (p< 0. 05) between the concentrations of endotoxin determined with the LAL and GC-MSMS techniques was found in the air samples collected in poultry houses and <b>sheep</b> <b>sheds,</b> but not in other examined facilities. 3 -OH FAs with C- 14 -C- 18 chains were predominant in the air of the facilities under study. A significant correlation (p< 0. 05) was found between the concentrations of endotoxin determined with LAL test and the amounts of 3 -OH FAs with C- 14 -C- 16 chains. In conclusion, endotoxin in the concentrations detected in this study may present a respiratory hazard to both humans and livestock animals...|$|R

5000|$|Christ and the <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shed</b> is a polemical woodcut made in 1524 by the Nuremberg artist Barthel Beham, {{one of the}} Little Masters. Created in {{the early}} part of the Protestant Reformation, this woodcut {{illustrates}} the beliefs of the artist, as well as other reformers, about the manipulation of the Catholic hierarchy. His work was influenced by reformers, such as Martin Luther, as well as other artists like Barthel’s older brother, Sebald. This woodcut was created during the height of the peasant revolts and, though they were less severe in Nuremberg than in other parts of Germany, the social implications were greatly felt. Though there is little information on this particular woodcut, it represents much of the political and social aspects of the Reformation, and interpretation provides insight on the artist’s perspective of the era. The distribution of woodcuts was one of the most effective modes of propaganda during the Protestant Reformation. [...] "Christ and the Sheep Shed" [...] depicts the radical sentiment of the period in which it was created, and portrays the wide-ranging effects of the Reformation and religion on all aspects of German culture. The image is unrealistic as an authentic situation. However, it was used as a symbolic interpretation of the Catholic Church’s manipulation over people and their faith.|$|E
5000|$|The {{premise of}} this woodcut {{is based on}} a passage from the Bible, John 10:1-42. This passage articulates Christ as the shepherd, his {{followers}} as the flock, and all others as thieves. [...] "All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved". Barthel used characters in this scene that clearly show the Papacy as the [...] "thieves"; they are climbing the <b>sheep</b> <b>shed</b> and entering through windows in the approach of a thief. At the top of the shed is the Pope, symbolizing his authority and domination over the rest of the church hierarchy. The shed is deliberately shaped by Beham to look like a church, with its steeple and cathedral-like windows, to avoid any confusion of what the scene attempts to depict. Christ is in the front doorway of the shed, as he is the ‘gate’ to be entered through. Also seen are peasants grovelling to the nobility, which demonstrates Barthel’s sympathy towards the peasantry. In the bottom-right corner of the woodcut people are gathered to buy indulgences, portraying the anxiety about salvation. In the background a crucifixion scene is created; what is strange is that it is less visible than the shed and the church hierarchy, showing the insignificance of the actions of Christ himself, and an emphasis on the use of indulgences in the Catholic Church. The scene created by Barthel depicts the mood of Germany in 1524 as a conflicted place between Protestantism and Catholicism, as well as the observations of the artist himself. His depiction of the Papacy as thieves is impractical, yet its reasoning is to exaggerate the situation to make the idea more influential.|$|E
40|$|Samples of settled dust were {{collected}} in 14 animal houses and examined {{for the presence of}} bacterial endotoxin with the Limulus (LAL) test and the gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MSMS) technique, based oil the detection of 3 -hydroxy fatty acids (3 -OH-FAs) as chemical markers of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. The median concentrations of the endotoxin in dust determined with LAL test in <b>sheep</b> <b>sheds,</b> poultry houses, and horse stables were 15, 687. 5 mu g/g, 8, 081. 8 mu g/g, and 79. 3 mu g/g, respectively, while those determined with the GC-MSMS technique were 868. 0 mu g/g, 580. 0 mu g/g, and 496. 0 mu g/g, respectively. Statistical comparison of the results yielded with LAL test and GC-MSMS technique revealed a weak correlation between both methods. Fatty acids with 14 - 16 carbon chains (3 -OH-C- 14 and 3 -OH-C- 16) were predominant in the settled dust of the facilities under study.
