5000|$|The {{processes}} to make yarn short-staple yarn (typically spun from fibers from 0.75 to 2.0") are blending, opening, carding, pin-drafting, <b>roving,</b> <b>spinning,</b> and—if desired—plying and dyeing. In long staple spinning, the process may start with stretch-break of tow, a continuous [...] "rope" [...] of synthetic fiber. In open-end and air-jet <b>spinning,</b> the <b>roving</b> operation is eliminated. The spinning frame winds yarn around a bobbin. [...] Generally, after this step the yarn is wound to a cone for knitting or weaving.|$|R

50|$|Ring {{spinning}} is {{a method}} of spinning fibres, such as cotton, flax or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the throstle frame, which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. Ring spinning is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In ring <b>spinning,</b> the <b>roving</b> is first attenuated by using drawing rollers, then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring flyer. Traditionally ring frames could only {{be used for the}} coarser counts, but they could be attended by semi-skilled labour.|$|R
2500|$|In mule <b>spinning</b> the <b>roving</b> {{is pulled}} off a bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several {{different}} speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause {{a break in the}} yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a [...] "cop", as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than the less skilled ring spinning.|$|R
50|$|Cotton-spinning {{machinery}} {{refers to}} machines which process (or <b>spin)</b> prepared cotton <b>roving</b> into workable yarn or thread. Such machinery can be dated back centuries. During the 18th and 19th centuries, {{as part of}} the Industrial Revolution cotton-spinning machinery was developed to bring mass production to the cotton industry. Cotton spinning machinery was installed in large factories, commonly known as cotton mills.|$|R
50|$|In short draw spinning, <b>spun</b> from combed <b>roving,</b> sliver or wool top, the spinners {{keep their}} hands {{very close to}} each other. The fibres are held fanned out in one hand while the other hand pulls a small number from the mass.

5000|$|Short draw is the {{spinning}} technique {{used to create}} worsted yarns. It is <b>spun</b> from combed <b>roving,</b> sliver or wool top - anything with the fibers all lined up parallel to the yarn. It is generally spun from long stapled fibers. Short draw spun yarns are smooth, strong, sturdy yarns, and dense. [...] Short draw spun yarns also tend to not be very elastic. These characteristics make them good for use in weaving.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>spinning</b> mule, the <b>roving</b> {{is pulled}} off bobbins and {{sequentially}} fed through rollers operating at several different speeds, thinning the roving at a consistent rate. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cop as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than ring spinning. Spinning by the mule machine is an intermittent process as the frame advances and returns. It is the descendant of a device invented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, and produces a softer, less twisted thread that is favored for fines and for weft.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a research work {{to solve the}} safety problem in a textile factory. Accident cases were identified in all departments, which were spinning, dyeing and knitting departments, and general cases within the factory. From the analysis, {{it was observed that}} for the past 5 years, 31 - 42 % of the accidents came from the spinning department with the highest is spinning accidents. Spinning accidents came from two particulars machinces; <b>spinning</b> section and <b>roving</b> machines. The general cause of the accidents was due to carelessness, improper training, and improper attire during work. Based on the finding, suggestions were made, especially for the spinning department workers. Among them were some basic training and also proper attire during work. These suggestions at least to prevent repetitive accidents from occuring...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an optical yarn assessment system for evaluation of twist and structure of twisted yarn. The system comprises a yarn carriage unit, a video microscope and a personal computer. This system was used in conjunction with the well-known tracer fibre technique. This system enables digital images to be grabbed and continuous movies of the yarn to be recorded in order to facilitate the measurement of twist and the analysis of yarn structure. Yarn samples from polyester, viscose and cotton with 35 tex and 485 turns/meter were <b>spun</b> from the <b>roving</b> with 2. 3 % of black fibres on the SKF laboratory ring frame. In order to measure the twist in the rotor yarns with the optical yarn assessment system, a set of yarn samples from same fibres were spun on RU 14 rotor machine with 35 tex and 475 turns/meter. The twist was measured with the optical yarn assessment system and sixty tests of each sample were carried out on the Zweigle D 301. It is clear from the results that there is consistency in the twist of ring-spun yarn measured by the optical yarn assessment system. However, the measured twist with the Zwiegle D 301 is inconsistent in the different yarns. The difference in the mean twist measured with the optical twist measuring system and the double untwist-twist method was not significant at a 5 % probability level when data was analyzed with t test by using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{respiratory}} {{health effects}} of exposure to cotton dust are well documented by epidemiological studies {{as early as the}} 1950 ’s, when Schilling and colleagues found 50 % byssinosis in cotton workers (Schilling, Hughes, Dingwall and Gilson, 1955; Roach and Schilling, 1960; Yih-Ming, Jenn-Rong, Jia-Yih, Ching-Hui and Saou-Hsing, 2003). Despite the remodeling of the old cotton mills and the installation of local ventilation cotton workers still are at risk for occupational lung disease, like byssinosis and chronic bronchitis (Farooque, Khan, Aziz et al, 2008; Ameille, Dalphin, Descatha and Pairon, 2006). Symptoms compatible with byssinosis such as chronic cough, phlegm, chest tightness and dyspnea are typically evident on the first day back to work after an absence of 2 days or more, accompanied by reversible changes in pulmonary function (across-shift drops in FEV 1) (Wang, Zhang, Sun et al., 2008). While the exposure to cotton dust concentration continues, these symptoms are present throughout the workweek and result in severe pulmonary disability and to chronic or permanent functional loss (Christiani, Wang, Pan et al., 2001). We carried out the first epidemiological study in a cotton mill in Greece to investigate the reactions, apart from byssinosis, of the respiratory system on working population exposed to low cotton dust levels. In an attempt to define any relation between symptoms and current dust concentration, was also measured the dust in work area by static samplers while the cotton dust concentration in the personal breathing zone was measured with worn personal dust samplers. METHODS Study population A large group of 443 cotton workers who were enrolled in this study had worked in a cotton textile mill for more than one year, representing the entire working population in the yarn preparation area (opening, cleaning, blowing, carding, combing, <b>roving,</b> <b>spinning</b> and winding). The workers of this study represent the 55, 3 % of the entire working population in the cotton textile industry of Greece, since in the country there are four more cotton mills and the total number of cotton textile workers in Greece is about 800. The distributions of personal characteristics among participants of this study are shown in Table 1. There were 222 males and 221 females in the survey. The sex proportion was not statistically significant. The average age of the male group was longer than the female group. The duration of employment in the industry ranged from 1 - 25 years, while males were predominant against the females. The prevalence of smokers was higher in men and average smoking amount was elevated in the male group. [...] ...|$|R
