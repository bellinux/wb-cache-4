5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of <b>scats</b> had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E
5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert otters are major predators of beavers. A 1994 river otter study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 <b>scats</b> analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any findings of beaver remains in the scat sampled.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within <b>scats</b> or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{droppings}} can {{be referred}} to as <b>scat.</b> Certain <b>scat</b> are called different things; rabbit <b>scat</b> are normally called rabbit pellets, while ungulate <b>scat</b> is referred to as droppings or manure.|$|R
2500|$|Bands such as The Boswell Sisters {{regularly}} employed <b>scatting</b> {{on their}} records, including the high complexity of <b>scatting</b> {{at the same}} time, in harmony. An example is their version of [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". Another famous <b>scat</b> singer is Scatman Crothers, who {{would go on to}} movie and television fame. British dance band trumpeter and vocalist Nat Gonella was a notable <b>scat</b> singer. Some authorities considered <b>scat</b> singing as lacking respectability, including BBC Radio, which did not permit <b>scatting</b> on air in the late 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Sarasota County Area Transit (<b>SCAT)</b> {{provides}} {{public transportation}} for Sarasota County, Florida. <b>SCAT</b> is operated by Sarasota County. It maintains 19 fixed-line bus routes plus a dial-a-ride paratransit service (<b>SCAT</b> Plus).|$|R
5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter <b>scats</b> collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} visiting the flowers of B.telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by nectarivorous mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their <b>scats</b> have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B.telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed {{in the morning and}} evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day.|$|E
5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar {{is more of a}} dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas. Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within the territory of the United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his <b>scats</b> and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.|$|E

25|$|In Mellette County, South Dakota, black-tailed {{prairie dog}} remains {{occurred}} in 91% of 82 black-footed ferret <b>scats.</b> Mouse remains occurred in 26% of <b>scats.</b> Mouse remains could not be identified to species; however, deer mice, northern grasshopper mice, and house mice were captured in snap-trap surveys. Potential prey items included thirteen-lined ground squirrels, plains pocket gophers, mountain cottontails, upland sandpipers, horned larks, and western meadowlarks.|$|E
25|$|Based on 86 {{black-footed ferret}} <b>scats</b> found near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 87% of black-footed ferret diet was {{composed}} of white-tailed prairie dogs. Other food items included deer mice, sagebrush voles, meadow voles, mountain cottontails, and white-tailed jackrabbits. Water is obtained through consumption of prey.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{compounds}} in fish otoliths {{are resistant to}} digestion, they {{are found in the}} digestive tracts and <b>scats</b> of piscivorous marine mammals, such as dolphins, seals, sea lions and walruses. Many fish can be identified to genus and species by their sagittal otoliths. Otoliths can therefore, to some extent, be used to reconstruct the prey composition of marine mammal diets.|$|E
30|$|<b>Scat</b> from leopard cats was {{differentiated}} from <b>scat</b> {{of other}} small carnivores {{in terms of}} the shape and size and/or the presence of species-specific tracks (Grassman et al. 2005). An average diameter of 1  cm for the <b>scat</b> of the leopard cat was used as a reference. Assuming that cannibalism did not occur (Grassman et al. 2005), another criterion for identifying leopard cat <b>scat</b> was the presence of hair ingested while auto-grooming. The diet of leopard cats was investigated via analysis of their <b>scat.</b> <b>Scat</b> was collected from Samcheok in 2006, Goheung in 2011, and Gwangju in 2011 in Korea (Table  1). The <b>scat</b> was placed in a fine mesh nylon stocking and washed to separate the contents. The contents were then sun-dried and stored in 70 % alcohol.|$|R
2500|$|Humor {{is another}} {{important}} element of <b>scat</b> singing. Cab Calloway exemplified the use of humorous <b>scatting.</b> Other examples of humorous <b>scatting</b> include Slim Gaillard, Leo Watson, and Bam Brown's 1945 [...] "Avocado Seed Soup Symphony", in which the singers <b>scat</b> variations on the word [...] "avocado" [...] {{for much of the}} recording. In addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in <b>scat</b> singing through the use of musical quotation. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his <b>scatting.</b> This is called using a compression. The 1958 song [...] "Witch Doctor" [...] by Ross Bagdasarian Sr., creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks, employs the technique of humorous <b>scatting</b> in its chorus of nonsense syllables (oo ee oo ah ah).|$|R
30|$|<b>Scat</b> {{samples from}} the same captive {{individuals}} (n[*]=[*] 8) and 50 <b>scat</b> samples from wild tigers were collected. A QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used, following the manufacturer’s protocol, to extract DNA from the <b>scat</b> samples.|$|R
25|$|Butterflyfish are pelagic spawners; that is, they release many buoyant {{eggs into}} the water, which {{become part of}} the plankton, {{floating}} with the currents until hatching. The fry go through a tholichthys stage, wherein the body of the postlarval fish is covered in large, bony plates extending from the head. They lose their bony plates as they mature. Only one other family of fish, the <b>scats</b> (Scatophagidae) express such an armored stage.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} days of marine aquaria, {{saltwater}} was collected at local beaches. Natural saltwater contains many unwanted organisms and pollutants. Aquarium literature of the time suggests that the most commonly kept marine fish were the percula clownfish, sergeant major damselfish, small, brackish-water pufferfish and <b>scats,</b> jeweled blennies, and blue damsels. Aquariums were equipped with large air compressors, and were heavily aerated and filtered (primarily with undergravel filters, a norm for some time).|$|E
25|$|Endangered Bengal tiger {{populations in}} the {{adjacent}} Project Tiger reserves of Anamalai Tiger Reserve and the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in the Agasthyamalai hills could expand back into this area when it is better protected. In February 2010, tigers were sighted in Kodaikanal forests during a six-day carnivore signs survey. A tigress and her cub were spotted playing in the wild. Forest Department officials are studying survey data to estimate the local tiger population based on indirect evidence like pug marks, <b>scats</b> and scratches.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scat</b> (voiced by Dick Beals) - <b>Scat</b> {{is a young}} Biskitt. He is industrious and brave, but {{sometimes}} his bravery can land him into trouble. <b>Scat</b> is friends with Bump who saves him sometimes from trouble. He is a Dachshund.|$|R
5000|$|Selenotoca multifasciata, or the spotbanded <b>scat,</b> [...] silver <b>scat,</b> striped {{butterfish}} or barred <b>scat,</b> is {{a species}} of perciform fish. It {{is similar to the}} spotted <b>scat,</b> but is more silvery and has bold bars and spots. It is also smaller, only reaching up to 28cm in length. They inhabit brackish mangrove estuaries and coastal freshwater throughout Indonesia, northern Australia and Papua New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|Spoor {{can be used}} in hunting. For example, {{a hunter}} can stick their finger in an animal's <b>scat</b> to measure its temperature. If the <b>scat</b> is cold, the animal is likely far and if the <b>scat</b> is warm, the animal is likely close.|$|R
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or gray wolf pack, adult black bears are not usually subject to natural predation. However, as evidenced by <b>scats</b> with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass of an adult sow with puncture marks in the skull, black bears may occasionally have fallen and still do fall prey to jaguars in the southern parts of their range. In such scenarios, the big cat would have the advantage if it ambushed the bear, killing it with a crushing bite {{to the back of the}} skull. Black bear cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults. Known predators of bear cubs have included bobcats, coyotes, cougars, wolves, brown bears and other bears of their own species. Many of these will stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother. There is a single record of a golden eagle snatching a yearling cub. Once out of hibernation, mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators. Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered stalking the cubs. Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs. However, in current times, American black bear fatalities are overwhelmingly attributable to human activities. Seasonally, tens of thousands of black bears are hunted legally across North America, with many more being illegally poached or trapped. Auto collisions also may claim many black bear lives annually.|$|E
25|$|Tigers will {{occasionally}} prey {{on black}} bears. Russian hunters may occasionally find black bear carcasses showing evidence of tiger predation, and their remains may occur in tiger <b>scats.</b> If {{they manage to}} escape a tiger, black bears will attempt to rush up a tree {{and wait for the}} tiger to leave, though some tigers will pretend to leave, and wait for the bear to descend. One Manchurian tiger was reported to have lured an Asiatic black bear by imitating the species' mating call. Tigers regularly prey on young bears but adult bears are occasionally taken as well. Black bears are usually safe from tiger attacks once they reach five years of age. Although black bears prefer to avoid tigers, they can be extremely tenacious when attacked: Jim Corbett observed a fight between a tiger and the largest black bear he had ever seen, which resulted in the bear managing to chase off the tiger, despite having half its nose and scalp torn off. However, black bears may be less vulnerable than brown bears to tiger predation, due to their habit of living in hollows or in close set rocks, thus making them harder to pursue. At least one fatal attack on a juvenile bear has been recorded in Jigme Dorji National Park, as Bhutan's tiger populations have begun to colonise higher altitude areas. Black bears may steal tiger kills: Jim Corbett twice saw black bears carry off tiger kills when the latter was absent.|$|E
25|$|Bengal tigers {{occasionally}} prey on sloth bears. Tigers usually give sloth bears a wide berth, {{though some}} specimens may become habitual bear killers {{and it is}} not uncommon to find sloth bear fur in tiger <b>scats.</b> Tigers typically hunt sloth bears by waiting for them near termite mounds, then creeping behind them and seizing them by the back of their necks and forcing them to the ground with their weight. One tiger was reported to simply break its victim's back with its paw, then wait for the paralysed bear to exhaust itself trying to escape before going in for the kill. When confronted by tigers face to face, sloth bears charge at them, crying loudly. A young or already sated tiger usually retreats from an assertive sloth bear, as the bear's claws can inflict serious wounds, and most tigers end the hunt if the bears become aware of the tiger's presence before the pounce. A female bear with cubs was observed to stand her ground and prevail in a confrontation against two tigers (one female, one male) in rapid succession. Sloth bears may scavenge on tiger kills. As tigers are known to mimic the calls of sambar deer to attract them, sloth bears react fearfully even to the sounds made by deer themselves. Indian leopards can also be a threat, as they are able to follow sloth bears up trees. Sloth bears occasionally chase leopards from their kills.|$|E
50|$|Scatophagus argus, or {{the spotted}} <b>scat,</b> is {{a species of}} fish in the <b>scat</b> family Scatophagidae. It occurs in two basic color morphs which are called green <b>scat</b> and ruby or red <b>scat.</b> This fish is {{generally}} distributed around the Indo-Pacific region, to Japan, New Guinea, and southeastern Australia. They live in coastal muddy areas, including estuaries, mangroves, harbours, and the lower courses of rivers. They are popular aquarium fish.|$|R
2500|$|Though <b>scat</b> {{singing is}} improvised, the melodic lines are often {{variations}} on scale and arpeggio fragments, stock patterns and riffs, {{as is the}} case with instrumental improvisers. As well, <b>scatting</b> usually incorporates musical structure. All of Ella Fitzgerald's <b>scat</b> performances of [...] "How High the Moon", for instance, use the same tempo, begin with a chorus of a straight reading of the lyric, move to a [...] "specialty chorus" [...] introducing the <b>scat</b> chorus, and then the <b>scat</b> itself. Will Friedwald has compared Ella Fitzgerald to Chuck Jones directing his Roadrunner cartoon—each uses predetermined formulas in innovative ways.|$|R

500|$|The {{giant otter}} is an apex predator, and its {{population}} status reflects the overall health of riverine ecosystems. It feeds mainly on fish, including cichlids, characins (such as piranha), and catfish. One full-year study of giant otter <b>scats</b> in Amazonian Brazil found fish {{present in all}} fecal samples. Fish from the order Perciformes, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of <b>scats,</b> and Characiformes, such as characins, in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, {{to the advantage of}} the probably visually oriented giant otter. Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the giant otter in predation. Hunting in shallow water has also been found to be more rewarding, with water depth less than [...] having the highest success rate. The giant otter seems to be opportunistic, taking whatever species are most locally abundant. If fish are unavailable, it will also take crabs, snakes, and even small caimans and anacondas.|$|E

Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that Beyoncé and [...] "the backing production" [...] ebb and flow as the song proceeds, and added that toward the end, she channels her inner Mariah Carey and ultimately [...] "puts the older star to shame". Similarly, Craig Jenkins of Prefix Magazine praised how effortlessly Beyoncé <b>scats</b> along with the multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|Both {{males and}} females {{establish}} home ranges, and are most active only in certain regions ('core areas') within them. The area of these ranges can vary from prey density, availability of cover and human interference could be significant factors in determining their size. Home ranges might overlap extensively, but occupants show minimal interaction. Aggressive encounters are rare, as servals appear to mutually avoid one another rather than fight and defend their ranges. Agonistic behaviour involves vertical movement of the head (contrary to the horizontal movement observed in other cats), raising the hair and the tail, displaying the teeth and the white band on the ears, and yowling. Individuals mark their ranges and preferred paths by spraying urine on nearby vegetation, dropping <b>scats</b> along the way, and rubbing their mouth on grasses or the ground while releasing saliva. Servals tend to be sedentary, shifting only a few kilometres away even if they leave their range.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scat</b> singing {{can allow}} jazz singers {{to have the}} same improvisational {{opportunities}} as jazz instrumentalists: <b>scatting</b> can be rhythmically and harmonically improvisational without concern about destroying the lyric.
