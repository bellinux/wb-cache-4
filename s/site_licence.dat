25|$|The Central Laboratory at Sellafield is the {{headquarters}} of the National Nuclear Laboratory and is the flagship nuclear Research and Development facility in the UK. It supports newly built reactors, operation of reactors, operations of fuel processing plants and decommissioning and clean-up. The NNL's Central Laboratory is available to run a wide range of radioactive and non-radioactive experimental programmes. In addition, it offers a wide range of analytical services, building on its location on the Sellafield site and considerable expertise of its resident technologists. Customers range from Government and the NDA to <b>site</b> <b>licence</b> companies, utilities, nuclear specialists and universities. The facility has been designed with flexibility and collaboration firmly at its heart. Smaller experiments can be easily set, taking advantage of the modular nature of the laboratories. Larger experiments and rigs can be assembled off site, installed and pre-tested in non-radioactive areas prior to active testing.|$|E

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} by the United Kingdom (UK) to meet the requirement of Article 5 of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. It considers each of the Convention's obligations and explains how the UK addresses them. The report only covers land based civil nuclear power plant as defined in Article 2 of the Convention. The safety of other UK nuclear facilities that fall {{outside the scope of}} this Convention are also regulated to the same standards, so as to ensure that they are operated in a manner that maintains a high level of safety. Within the UK nuclear safety system, there have been no significant corrective actions necessary to comply with the Convention. The UK’s nuclear safety licensing regime has proved to be effective which, together with the high priority given to safety by the UK nuclear utilities, has stood the country well in times of great change.

40|$|The {{basic model}} for {{scholarly}} communication {{in science and}} technology has remained unchanged for over three hundred years, with the journal playing the central role. However, over the past thirty years there has been growing concern as journal prices have increased faster than library budgets and fewer and fewer readers have had access to the journals they need, leading to the well-documented 'serials crises'. The widespread introduction of the internet in the 1990 s has resulted in some improvements in communication, with readers being able to access papers at their desks rather than having to visit the library. Also, with <b>site</b> <b>licences</b> and consortia deals the downward trend in readers has been reversed. However, the fundamental problem remains - the rate of increase in cost to libraries for electronic access continues to be greater than the increase in library budgets. This paper will show how by harnessing the power of the internet, authors will be able to distribute their work to all interested readers - not just those lucky enough to have a subscription. It will describe how universities can take responsibility for archiving their intellectual wealth and making it more widely available. Finally, the paper will show how the adoption of institutional repositories and open access journals could bring about a change in the financial model of journal publishing, bringing cost savings to society and improving communications, while still preserving the important functions of peer-review...|$|R

40|$|As {{networked}} {{information services}} on the Internet continue to grow, so {{the problem for}} libraries of controlling access and management of these services increases. There are three problem areas for libraries: • computer security with regard to open networks: confidentiality, identification and authentication, and document integrity • authorisation: who is authorised to do what on which resources? • cost recovery: libraries will need to develop cost recovery charging mechanisms {{as the amount of}} electronic information increases and the costs of electronic licences rise. Current approaches to networked access to electronic information sources favour user direct access and payment, or institutional <b>site</b> <b>licences.</b> Both methods involve multiple connections and interfaces. The former also requires multiple registration procedures and different payment systems while the latter provides no cost-recovery mechanism for libraries. Moreover both approaches give rise to inflation in information prices. Against this background, smart cards are being introduced in libraries as means of controlling user identity and of electronic payment. But current applications in libraries of campus cards and of public payment cards do not yet integrate all the functionalities required by libraries. The TOLIMAC project aims to meet libraries' requirements in terms of user authentication, authorisation, secure communication and charging mechanism. It has developed a smart card-based management system of networked information services for libraries, providing access control and payment mechanisms. These new functionalities enable libraries to agree a new type of institutional contract with providers, based on actual use of their services. By placing libraries as key intermediaries between users and providers, the TOLIMAC system sets a new electronic information management concept for access control and charging functions.

40|$|Arrays of {{tidal energy}} {{converters}} {{have the potential}} to provide clean renewable energy for future generations. Benthic communities may, however, be affected by changes in current speeds resulting from arrays of tidal converters located in areas characterised by strong currents. Current speed, together with bottom type and depth, strongly influence benthic community distributions; however the interaction of these factors in controlling benthic dynamics in high energy environments is poorly understood. The Strangford Lough Narrows, the location of SeaGen, the world's first single full-scale, grid-compliant tidal energy extractor, is characterised by spatially heterogenous high current flows. A hydrodynamic model was used to select a range of benthic community study sites that had median flow velocities between 1. 5 - 2. 4 m/s in a depth range of 25 - 30 m. 25 sites were sampled for macrobenthic community structure using drop down video survey to test the sensitivity of the distribution of benthic communities to changes in the flow field. A diverse range of species were recorded which were consistent with those for high current flow environments and corresponding to very tide-swept faunal communities in the EUNIS classification. However, over the velocity range investigated, no changes in benthic communities were observed. This suggested that the high physical disturbance associated with the high current flows in the Strangford Narrows reflected the opportunistic nature of the benthic species present with individuals being continuously and randomly affected by turbulent forces and physical damage. It is concluded that during operation, the removal of energy by marine tidal energy arrays in the far-field is unlikely to {{have a significant effect on}} benthic communities in high flow environments. The results are of major significance to developers and regulators in the tidal energy industry when considering the environmental impacts for <b>site</b> <b>licences...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{criticism}} has cast the suburban playhouses of Early Modern London as marginalised institutions, {{in at least}} a topographic if not a symbolic sense.

Arguing that theatres were built in particular locations not just to escape City prohibitions, but to draw on proximate audiences, I provide a brief history of Clerkenwell and place the Red Bull in its local context. By figuring the Red Bull, both in terms of its standard repertoire and its audience, as a prototypical "community theatre," I develop a sociology of dramatic production which understands this Early Modern theatre as a crucial nexus of local solidarity...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 10812 While the {{majority}} of human pathogens infect the body through mucosal <b>sites,</b> most <b>licenced</b> vaccines are injectable. In fact the only mucosal vaccine that is widely used for infant and childhood vaccination programs is the oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin in the 1950 s. While oral vaccines against Cholera, rotavirus and Salmonella typhi have been licenced, the development of vaccines against other enteric pathogens has been slow and challenging. Mucosal vaccines elicit protective immunity at the gut mucosa, in part via antigen-specific secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). This explains the low efficacy of injectable cholera vaccines, which have been abandoned in favour of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs). However, oral vaccines face many challenges including passage through the acidic environment of the stomach followed by the proteolytic environment of the duodenum {{which can lead to}} the destruction of vaccines. The gut innate immune system is also difficult to activate due to its predisposition towards hyporesponsiveness and tolerance. Lastly, adjuvants such as alum, incorporated in injectable vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity are lacking for the oral route...|$|R
