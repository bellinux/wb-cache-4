5|$|The {{music on}} Kaleidoscope Dream draws on R, pop, funk, rock and soul styles, {{as well as}} {{elements}} from electronic and psychedelic music. The album's producers incorporated dense bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> songs, which deal mostly with sex, romance, and existential ideas. Miguel titled Kaleidoscope Dream {{as a metaphor for}} life and wanted the songs to reflect his lifestyle and personality.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Dugan first {{recorded}} <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s to augment his sound designs. He continued making recordings, concentrating on capturing {{the sounds of}} nature.

Dugan is a co-founder and current secretary of People for Legal and Nonsectarian Schools (PLANS), a California non-profit organization incorporated in 1997.|$|E

5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath <b>sounds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|The 808 was {{followed}} in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use samples (for its cymbal and hi-hat sounds) alongside analog <b>sounds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, Roland included {{samples of the}} 808 in its successful Groovebox devices. In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} modeling and sampling. In August 2017, Roland announced the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 reissue with features including an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E

5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices and {{holes in the}} reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks. Alternatively, it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E
5|$|The armies gather outside Winterfell {{the next}} morning. Ramsay brings Rickon out and has him run to Jon while firing arrows at him. Jon rushes to {{intercept}} Rickon {{but just before}} escaping, Rickon is killed by an arrow. Jon charges at Ramsay, who orders the Bolton archers to fire and his cavalry to charge; Davos orders the Stark force to shield Jon. The battle leaves hundreds of Bolton and Stark soldiers dead from hand-to-hand combat and from Bolton arrows, creating a wall of corpses. The Bolton infantry forms {{a circle around the}} Stark forces. Although the giant Wun Wun kills some Bolton soldiers, Tormund panics and sends the Wildlings towards the wall of bodies and Smalljon's forces, who easily cut them down. Jon is trampled by the Wildlings but struggles to his feet. The Stark forces appear doomed when a horn <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance as Petyr Baelish and Sansa arrive with the Knights of the Vale, who smash the Bolton army; Tormund kills Smalljon in the chaos.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> word Rama.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{official}} romanization system for Burmese. There have been {{attempts to make}} one, but none have been successful. Replicating Burmese <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin script is complicated.

However, it only transcribes sounds in formal Burmese {{and is based on}} the orthography rather than the phonology.|$|E
25|$|In Old Chinese (and Classical Chinese, {{which is}} based on it), most words were monosyllabic and there was a close {{correspondence}} between characters and words. In modern Chinese (esp. Mandarin Chinese), characters do not necessarily correspond to words; indeed the majority of Chinese words today consist of two or more characters because of the merging and loss of <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese language over time. Rather, a character almost always corresponds to a single syllable that is also a morpheme.|$|E
50|$|The {{limiting}} factor on {{the speed of}} an airgun, firearm, or light-gas gun is <b>the</b> speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> working fluid—the air, burning gunpowder, or a light gas. This is essentially because the projectile is accelerated by the pressure difference between its ends, and such a pressure wave cannot propagate any faster than <b>the</b> speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium. <b>The</b> speed of <b>sound</b> <b>in</b> helium is about three times that in air, and in hydrogen 3.8 times that in air.|$|R

25|$|Coarticulation is {{the act of}} {{controlling}} a sound in two places at once. A common {{example of this is}} the sound created by rolling an “r” sound while saying a “v” sound. This is called a voiced alveolar trill with labiodental articulation. Similarly, epenthesis is the sound created when beatboxers sing and do percussion at the same time. Contrary to what the sound suggests, heir tongue is not in two places at once. This effect is created by placing percussive <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of words.|$|E
25|$|Shore {{was adamant}} on {{creating}} a unique sound for this series, {{and created a}} unique way of handling the orchestra, dividing it by {{the range of the}} instruments. The choir, soloists and specialist instruments were often (but not always) recorded apart from the orchestra, with many of the choral sessions being conducted by their respective choirmaster, under Shore's supervision. Shore was insistent on not using any electronic <b>sounds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recording of the score, although he did use mock-ups in the preparation of the score.|$|E
25|$|Collectively, {{the species}} of genus Naultinus {{have a very}} wide range over most of New Zealand's land area and yet {{all of them are}} now {{increasingly}} rare and hard to find. This is in stark contrast to anecdotal reports among NZ herpetoculturalists who found them abundant in suitable habitat (such as regenerating bush in the Marlborough <b>Sounds)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s from which they have now all but vanished. The three major factors thought to be responsible for this decline are; habitat destruction, predation by introduced mammalian species and poaching for the illegal pet trade.|$|E
