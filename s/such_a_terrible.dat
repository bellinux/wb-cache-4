25|$|Li {{starred in}} the 1995 film High Risk, where Jet Li plays a Captain who becomes disillusioned after his wife is murdered by crime lords. Along the way, he pairs up with a wacky {{sell-out}} actor, Frankie (played by Jacky Cheung), and proceeds {{to engage in a}} series of violent battles in a high-rise building. The setting {{is similar to that of}} Die Hard and both their Chinese film titles. This movie is notable in that director Wong Jing had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> experience working with Jackie Chan in Jing's previous film City Hunter that he chose to make Cheung's character a biting satire of Chan. Jet Li would later publicly apologise to Chan for taking part in it.|$|E

(Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben—"If you don't have money on you"). Fidelio demands to know why Rocco will not allow for help in the dungeons, especially as he always seems to return short of breath. Rocco says that there is a dungeon down there where he can never take Fidelio, which houses a man who has been wasting away for two years. Marzelline begs her father to keep Leonore away from <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> sight. Rocco and Leonore sing of courage (Gut, Söhnchen, gut—"All right, sonny, all right"), and Marzelline joins in their acclamations.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} the film's sequel 23 years later, Variety noted that though the original film was [...] "intended as {{a cautionary tale}} on the pitfalls of unchecked ambition and greed, Stone's 1987 original instead {{had the effect of}} turning Douglas' hugely charismatic (and Oscar-winning) villain into a household name and boardroom icon -- an inspiration to the very power players and Wall Street wannabes for whom he set <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> example".|$|E

500|$|Bana {{was born}} in Melbourne, Victoria. His father, Ivan, was Croatian {{and worked as a}} {{logistics}} manager for Caterpillar, Inc., and his mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser, originally from near Mannheim in Germany. He has one older brother, Anthony. Bana grew up in Melbourne's Tullamarine, a suburban area on the northern edge of the city, near Melbourne's international airport, and attended Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School. In a cover story for The Mail on Sunday, he told author Antonella Gambotto-Burke that his family had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. [...] "Wog is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> word," [...] he said. He has stated: [...] "I have always been proud of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. I have always been in the company of people of European origin".|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were even}} more {{negative}}, condemning Bara along with the play generally. The theater critic for Munsey's Magazine quoted several negative reviews and compared Bara's acting unfavorably to that of drama school students. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said she fulfilled the promise to be unforgettably bad, calling her acting [...] "freakish". The Sun and New York Herald said Bara's acting was disappointing and the play was [...] "abysmal in intelligence and all that touches {{the art of the}} theatre". In Ainslee's Magazine, Dorothy Parker said the play's authors had taken the line about being remembered for badness [...] "as their working motto", and suggested the crowds at the performances were there to attack the playwrights. In the New-York Tribune, Heywood Broun suggested that the entire production company should fear the wrath of God for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> play.|$|E
500|$|... "Ron and Tammy" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Troy Miller. The episode featured comedian and actress Megan Mullally in a guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy. Mullally is the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived {{the idea for the}} story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table out of the wall after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her. The scene was used in the final episode. Offerman said of filming the diner scenes, [...] "At the end of doing that for a few hours, we said, you know that feels like it was five weeks worth of really good therapy." ...|$|E

The stunt was condemned by Colne Valley MP Kali Mountford, {{who had worked with}} the Falconio family, with [...] "Some reality shows are worthwhile and show people having a laugh, but there is nothing funny about <b>such</b> <b>a</b> personal, <b>terrible</b> tragedy." [...] The search for Falconio was additionally criticized by the eventual winner Charmaine Wilson as being [...] "in bad taste".|$|R

Hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer rain, I never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds; the oaks, too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak with their great boughs as if announcing a tempest. Thou canst play the rational if thou wilt; credit me for once, and let us home ere the storm begins to rage, for the night will be fearful." ...|$|R

2500|$|Méliès began {{shooting}} {{his first}} films in May 1896, and screening {{them at the}} Théâtre Robert-Houdin by that August. At the end of 1896 he and Reulos founded the Star Film Company, with Korsten acting as his primary camera operator. Many of his earliest films were copies and remakes of the Lumière brothers' films, made {{to compete with the}} 2000 daily customers of the Grand Café. This included his first film Playing Cards, which is similar to an early Lumière film. However, many of his other early films reflected Méliès' knack for theatricality and spectacle, <b>such</b> as <b>A</b> <b>Terrible</b> Night, in which a hotel guest is attacked by a giant bedbug. But more importantly, the Lumière brothers had dispatched camera operators across the world to document it as ethnographic documentarians, intending their invention to be highly important in scientific and historical study. Méliès' Star Film Company, on the other hand, was geared more towards the [...] "fairground clientele" [...] who wanted his specific brand of magic and illusion: art.|$|R
60|$|He {{nodded his}} white lock {{and went to}} do my bidding, leaving me not a little disturbed--unreasonably so, indeed. It was a strange story. That this woman had the power of conversing with baboons I knew.[*] That was not so very wonderful, seeing that the Bushmen claim {{to be able to}} do the same thing, and she had been nurtured by them. But that she had been able to muster them, and by the {{strength}} of her human will and intelligence muster them in order to forward her ends of revenge, seemed to me so incredible that after reflection my fears grew light. Still I determined to trek. After all, a journey in an ox waggon would not be <b>such</b> <b>a</b> very <b>terrible</b> thing to <b>a</b> strong woman accustomed to roughing it, whatever her state of health. And when all was said and done I did not like this tale of the presence of Hendrika with countless hosts of baboons.|$|R

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although workers {{compensation}} laws deny workers {{the right}} to sue their employer, it is possible for them to sue a related third party. Within a week of the explosion Williams Bailey, a law firm based in Houston, Texas, placed half-page advertisements in a local newspaper. The adverts read [...] "Were you seriously injured in last week's explosion?", and directed potential clients to the company website. The advert also claims that the firm has extensive experience in explosion-related cases. Fran Deisinger, director of the Milwaukee Bar Association, said of the ad [...] "It's a little disconcerting because it's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> situation here that I think it probably rubs everybody a little wrong,", adding that although he believed the ad to be in poor taste, it didn't breach any rules for lawyer advertising. Although it is unclear whether any workers contacted Williams Bailey, it is known that at least one injured man, and the families of the deceased, have hired personal injury lawyer Bob Habush to represent them, who once before worked on a high-profile industrial case when three people {{died as a result of}} a crane collapse in 1991. On February 7, 2007, he launched a suit against Brennan based on these allegations. J.M. Brennan responded with the following statement: [...] "We are proud of our employees and the response they took in response to the explosion. And we're confident that the results of the official investigation will show that J.M. Brennan's work was reasonable and did not contribute to the cause of the explosion." [...] The suit was settled out of court.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it [...] "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction {{in the history of}} pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
2500|$|David Browne {{reviewed}} the album for Entertainment Weekly and awarded it a [...] "B" [...] rating, calling Enya [...] "even less {{the life of}} the pub" [...] with her new release. [...] "With its layered, breathing-lesson choral harmonies cushioned in sullen keyboards, the album is, except for a few perky moments, wistful to the point of stultification. A gorgeous formula, but perhaps even Enya could use a good stiff belt." [...] The Los Angeles Times issued a three stars out of four rating in a review by Don Heckman. He wrote that Enya remains in her [...] "musical trance ... on an ethereal plateau of her own", which he recognises as a good thing for her fans. The [...] "technical proficiency and the mood-sustaining qualities" [...] of the music, that Heckman called [...] "mysterious" [...] and [...] "rich" [...] coupled with Enya's [...] "angelic, folk soprano" [...] and [...] "nostalgic" [...] piano, flow to make a seamless album that [...] "almost demands that the album be heard in its entirety". Heckman praised Enya for the [...] "remarkable" [...] feat of being the album's sole musician, and concluded with: [...] "If anything can restore the tarnished image of New Age music, this may be it". Rolling Stone magazine reporter Elysa Gardner gave the album three stars out of four. She wrote: [...] "Because Enya's lush, synthladen arrangements rarely come off as bloated or banal, her work typically inspires less ridicule than, say, Yanni's". Gardner picked out [...] "China Roses" [...] as a track that reminded her of the [...] "tranquil radiance" [...] of [...] "Caribbean Blue" [...] from Shepherd Moons, with [...] "Once You Had Gold" [...] sounding [...] "equally tender, with a reassuring lyric and all the prettiness of a Christmas carol". She continued: [...] "Regardless of whether you understand Latin or Gaelic, the atmospheric warmth of [...] "Pax Deorum" [...] and [...] "Athair Ar Neamh" [...] will temporarily convince you that the world isn't <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> place after all". The album received a more critical review from Howard Cohen for The Los Angeles Daily News, saying it does not [...] "disappoint, at least not stylistically" [...] with its [...] "flawless" [...] recording and [...] "gorgeous" [...] sounds, but goes on to write, [...] "She stalls ... drowning in her formula. Two stars".|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the first season of Orange is the New Black, Doggett {{received}} some criticism from different media. Writing for The American Conservative, B. D. McClay claimed that Doggett was a poor and inaccurate representation of American Christians; [...] "Pennsatucky is <b>such</b> <b>an</b> aggressively <b>terrible</b> character" [...] and [...] "her faith is neither well-understood nor well-drawn". Laura Leonard of Christianity Today, supports Clay's view and goes further to say [...] "it was frustrating to see this one painful narrative represent Christian faith on OITNB, a show that masters other aspects of the melting pot so well", speaking about Doggett's background story and conflict with Chapman. Two critics for The A.V. Club also gave negative reviews of Doggett; Todd VanDerWerff says that [...] "Pennsatucky never really comes together as a character {{in the same way as}} some of the others on the show" [...] and Myles McNutt opted to criticize the storyline of the final episode of the first season specifically, saying that it [...] " [...] her like a cartoon villain instead of a real character". Betsy Leondar-Wright accused the series' creators of classism and said that Doggett was an [...] "outrageous Redneck stereotype".|$|R
