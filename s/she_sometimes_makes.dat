Martin, the series centered on seven-year-old Karen Brewer, the stepsister to Kristy Thomas, who is President of The Baby-sitters Club. In this series, Karen is a second grader at Stoneybrook Academy. Much of the books are about Karen going to school, and the many adventures {{that she and her}} classmates have. Karen usually tries to do the right thing, but because she has been through some hard times in her young life, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>makes</b> a mistake. She does, however, learn from the mistakes, and the books do teach valuable lessons.|$|E

Her presence alone is a strong incentive for the Red Wizards of Thay not to attack Aglarond. When she commits herself to battle, the amount of damage she can cause is incredible. <b>She</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>makes</b> her enemies an example, using far more magic than necessary to destroy them in a spectacular fashion. No Red Wizard {{in his right mind}} would face the Simbul, and even her own subjects in Aglarond sometimes fear and avoid her, thinking her mad.|$|E

5000|$|Popura {{is a short}} 17 year-old {{high school}} student who works at Wagnaria. Ironically, she was named after the poplar tree, {{so that she would}} grow tall. She is very {{sensitive}} about her short stature, and many customers believe her to be younger than she really is. Similarly, Sōta, who is one year younger than her, usually regards her as an elementary school student. She is also unable to properly call him by his surname, saying [...] "Katanashi" [...] rather than [...] "Takanashi", even when corrected. She admires Kotori, Sōta's cross-dressing persona, and the Takanashi sisters because of their tall and mature look. She is a hard worker, but <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>makes</b> clumsy mistakes in her job. Despite that, she is chosen to replace Yachiyo as chief of staff {{near the end of the}} series.|$|E

She would wake from those reveries with a laugh, and give me a push to send me rolling down a bank.|$|R
60|$|And {{there was}} a cloud on little Ruth that evening. Yes, indeed. When Tom was looking in another direction, her bright eyes, {{stealing}} on towards his face, would sparkle still more brightly than their custom was, and then grow dim. When Tom was silent, looking out upon the summer weather, <b>she</b> would <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> a hasty movement, {{as if she were}} about to throw herself upon his neck; then check the impulse, and when he looked round, show a laughing face, and speak to him very merrily; when she had anything to give Tom, or had any excuse for coming near him, she would flutter about him, and lay her bashful hand upon his shoulder, and not be willing to withdraw it; and would show by all such means that there was something on her heart which in her great love she longed to say to him, but had not the courage to utter.|$|R
50|$|In the band, {{she looks}} up to Mio the most due to her {{maturity}} {{and the fact that}} she is an experienced bassist, even trying to give Mio chocolate on Valentine's Day. However, <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> unintentionally <b>makes</b> remarks concerning Mio's weaknesses, such as her weight. She also finds Mugi very beautiful, and envies her hair and large eyes, and later starts teaching her how to play guitar when the two are alone in the club room. Since joining, Yui comes to her for advice on playing guitar, as well as maintenance. She gets a tan extremely easily, once during their time at the beach and another during a music festival (even after applying sunscreen). As a result, she frequently gets sunburned as well. She gets lonely very easily, and often worries that everyone in the club will leave her, as they are one year older and eventually will graduate. Due to this, the rest of the girls buy her a turtle to look after, naming it Ton.|$|R
5000|$|Catherine Morland: A 17-year-old {{girl who}} loves reading Gothic novels. Something of a tomboy in her childhood, her looks are {{described}} by the narrator as [...] "pleasing, and, when in good looks, pretty." [...] Catherine lacks experience and sees her life {{as if she was}} a heroine in a Gothic novel. She sees the best in people, and to begin with always seems ignorant of other people's malign intentions. She is the devoted sister of James Morland. She is good-natured and frank and often makes insightful comments on the inconsistencies and insincerities of people around her, usually to Henry Tilney, and thus is unintentionally sarcastic and funny. (He is delighted when she says, [...] "I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.") She is also seen as a humble and modest character, becoming exceedingly happy when she receives the smallest compliment. Catherine's character grows throughout the novel, as she gradually becomes a real heroine, learning from her mistakes when she is exposed to the outside world in Bath. <b>She</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>makes</b> the mistake of applying Gothic novels to real life situations; for example, later in the novel she begins to suspect General Tilney of having murdered his deceased wife. Catherine soon learns that Gothic novels are really just fiction and do not always correspond with reality.|$|E

40|$|In a {{state of}} the world in which there is {{computation}} cost, like in real life, in small enough decisions it is rational not to compute and act like bounded rational. Economic theorists do not take it into account and it may provide the answer for many propositions of Behavioral Economics, including this of Rabin. Rabin structures the situation, such that there is no computation cost, and then it is true that a rational agent, who rejects a lottery of [11,- 10], will reject also a lottery of [∞,- 100]. However, if we structure the situation of real life correctly and take into account computation cost, then a rational agent may not compute in the small lottery and hence may reject it. This behavior will be consistent with the Expected Utility Theory. Another conclusion from the above proposition is that the assumption of rationality of an agent could not be refuted by showing that in real life <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>makes</b> mistakes in small enough decisions. Actually, if there is computation cost and in addition an agent will take the right decisions in probability 1 iff she computes, but there is no computation cost of the question: to compute or not to compute, the This working paper is written under the supervision of Prof. Robert J.

50|$|When Jet Boeke was younger, <b>she</b> would <b>sometimes</b> <b>make</b> {{portraits of}} people in {{exchange}} for food or shelter. During this time, she had met an American illustrator who worked for Sesame Street. She had seen the children {{for the first time}} on American television and was immediately very enthusiastic about it. Back in the Netherlands, Sesame Street had just been getting started. and was slowly becoming popular. She had then gotten in touch with the Sesame Street program. They had asked her to come up with a new idea for the show, and she had suggested that the show read picture books to the audience of the show. The idea of hers had been approved, and the protagonist of the story ended up being her cat, Dikkie Dik. Her cat plays as a huge influence and inspiration to Jet Boeke. Every year, she makes a new series of picture books for Sesame Street by making the stories and then sketch out the drawings. She wishes for the drawings to speak for themselves without any words. After Dikki Dik books would show up for years on television, a demand for them began in regular bookstores. Now Jet Boeke has a wide collection of stories about her orange cat Dikki Dik who will forever be her inspiration.|$|R

50|$|Jessie is {{the most}} impulsive, {{aggressive}} and egotistic of the three. She {{grew up in a}} poor foster family in the snowy mountains (see Tohoku), while her mother focused on Team Rocket. Before she joined Team Rocket, she aspired to be a nurse; however, the school that she wanted to attend wouldn't accept her application. There, she befriended a Chansey (now Blissey) who seemed to be the only Pokémon in the school willing to be her friend. Jessie ended up failing to become a Pokémon nurse. From there, she moved on to Pokémon Tech, a private school. There, she met her future Team Rocket partner, James. She flunked out of school before joining a biking gang, then Team Rocket. She enters various Pokémon Coordinator and Performer contests, usually under an alias that is a variation of her real name, but although <b>she</b> <b>sometimes</b> manages to <b>make</b> it to the finals, she is rarely able to actually win; however, she does finally take center stage and show off her talents when she joins with Pokémon Performers Serena and Shauna in putting on a special Pokémon Showcase in Lumiose City.|$|R

60|$|Elizabeth was {{extremely}} fond of pomp and parade. The magnificence and {{splendor of the}} celebrations and festivities which characterized her reign have scarcely ever been surpassed in any country or in any age. She once went to attend Church, on a particular occasion, accompanied by a thousand men in full armor of steel, and ten pieces of cannon, with drums and trumpets sounding. She received her foreign embassadors with military spectacles and shows, and with banquets and parties of pleasure, which for many days kept all London in a fever of excitement. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> made excursions on the river, with whole fleets of boats and barges in her train; the shores, on such occasions, swarming with spectators, and waving with flags and banners. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>she</b> would <b>make</b> grand progresses through her dominions, followed by an army of attendants--lords and ladies dressed and mounted in the most costly manner--and putting the nobles whose seats she visited to a vast expense in entertaining such a crowd of visitors. Being very saving of her own means, she generally contrived to bring the expense of this magnificence upon others. The honor was a sufficient equivalent.
