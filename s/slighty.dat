And she, as the saying is, was as good as he at all his vile and ranting tricks. She had her companions as well as he had his, and she would meet them too at the tavern and ale-house more commonly than he was aware of. To be plain, she was a very whore, and had as great resort came to her, where time and place was appointed, as any of them all. Ay, and he smelt it too, but could not tell how to help it. For if he began to talk, she could lay in his dish the whores that she knew he haunted, and she could fit him also with cursing and swearing, for she would give him oath for oath, and curse for curse.|$|E

Ten bombers were escorted by forty-two CR.42s, G.50s, and some German Messerschmitt Bf 109s assigned to them. The G.50 mission was aborted due to bad weather that caused too much fuel consumption and the Fiat had to go, leaving only the CR.42 as escort. However, Hurricanes from several units, belonging to 257, 46, and 42 Squadrons intercepted the aircraft and destroyed three bombers and two fighters, while another was lost to mechanical fault or navigation herror, the pilot (Salvatori) was captured. In addition, four bombers eventually force landed, two fighters were destroyed on landing, and another eight fighters landed with damage, with over 20 aviators missing, dead or wounded. British had two fighters <b>slighty</b> damaged. One of the Fiats (MM.5701) was repaired by the British and subsequently evaluated by E.Brown; {{this is one of the}} best conserved CR.42s, and it is owned by an UK museum (Hendon).|$|E

40|$|Construction {{consultants}} often accept work {{based on}} {{good relations with}} the clients without evaluating them. This may affect their performance on construction sites. Consultants need to understand quantitative methods to avoid client-generated risk. The aims of this study are to examine the dominant risk factors generated by the clients, to identify their influential level on consultants, and to examine the actions of management level to handle the risks. The instrument was adopted from Kometa, et al (1995). Ninety-one respondents working in several firms of consultants in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta were sampled. Relative Important Index calculated from the sub-factors and Relative Important Index from the group were adopted to analyze the importance of the factors. The overall risk exposure index was adopted to examine the actions of management level to handle the risks. The concerned factors were client's project feasibility, client's duties, client's financial feasibility, clients past performance, client's project characteristics, client's organizational quality, clients past experience, quality of management clients and client characteristics. The results of this research indicate the opinion of consultant from the classification of A-level that client's organizational quality was the most influential risk factor. This factor is influenced by client's coordination of project interphase. The management of action suggested no danger be anticipated in the near future from this client, client quite satisfactory and monitor client <b>slighty.</b> The consultant from the classification of B-level perceived that client's project characteristics was the most influential risk to consultant's performance.
