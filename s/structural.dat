5|$|<b>Structural</b> {{alignments}} {{can compare}} two sequences or multiple sequences. Because these alignments rely on information {{about all the}} query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a <b>structural</b> alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a <b>structural</b> alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. <b>Structural</b> alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from <b>structural</b> genomics and proteomics efforts, {{and they can be}} used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E
5|$|While {{many animals}} {{are unable to}} {{synthesize}} carotenoid pigments to create red and yellow surfaces, the green and blue colours of bird feathers and insect carapaces are usually not produced by pigments at all, but by <b>structural</b> coloration. <b>Structural</b> coloration means the production of colour by microscopically-structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments: for example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise and green. <b>Structural</b> coloration can produce the most brilliant colours, often iridescent. For example, the blue/green gloss on the plumage of birds such as ducks, and the purple/blue/green/red colours of many beetles and butterflies are created by <b>structural</b> coloration. Animals use several methods to produce <b>structural</b> colour, {{as described in the}} table.|$|E

5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for <b>structural</b> analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great <b>structural</b> strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other <b>structural</b> applications.|$|E

5|$|In Gilroy and Hollister, sixteen {{people were}} injured, and damage totaled $500,000. Chimneys fell (especially on older {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy <b>structural</b> damage afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a court room ceiling collapsed. Damaged <b>structural</b> components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C. Penney had a hole and cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office. At Casa de Fruta, a service station sustained <b>structural</b> damage, as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass.|$|E

The first tenants, accounting firm BDO Nelson Parkhill, moved into their offices in May 1992, followed by further tenants including Ernst & Young in December 1992. Following <b>structural</b> {{completion of the}} tower, the public park was landscaped in early 1993.|$|E
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} <b>structural</b> coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with <b>structural</b> colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a <b>structural</b> blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies covered with a pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Structural</b> {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple <b>structural</b> superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, <b>structural</b> alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. <b>Structural</b> alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. <b>Structural</b> alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Structural</b> {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most <b>structural</b> proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play <b>structural</b> functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E

25|$|<b>Structural</b> {{engineering}} {{theory is}} based upon applied physical laws and empirical knowledge of the <b>structural</b> performance of different materials and geometries. <b>Structural</b> engineering design utilizes a number of relatively simple <b>structural</b> elements to build complex <b>structural</b> systems. <b>Structural</b> engineers are responsible for making creative and efficient use of funds, <b>structural</b> elements and materials to achieve these goals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Structural</b> {{engineers}} {{are responsible for}} engineering design and <b>structural</b> analysis. Entry-level <b>structural</b> engineers may design the individual <b>structural</b> elements of a structure, for example the Beam (structure beams, columns, and floors of a building.

25|$|<b>Structural</b> {{genomics}} {{seeks to}} describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination {{by a combination of}} experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between <b>structural</b> genomics and traditional <b>structural</b> prediction is that <b>structural</b> genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large numbers of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allow scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs. <b>Structural</b> genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or <b>structural</b> homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure. As opposed to traditional <b>structural</b> biology, the determination of a protein structure through a <b>structural</b> genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in <b>structural</b> bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.|$|E
25|$|Pigment color {{differs from}} <b>structural</b> color in that pigment color {{is the same}} for all viewing angles, whereas <b>structural</b> color is the result of {{selective}} reflection or iridescence, usually because of multilayer structures. For example, butterfly wings typically contain <b>structural</b> color, although many butterflies have cells that contain pigment as well.|$|E

25|$|<b>Structural</b> {{engineering}} {{has existed}} since humans first started to construct their own structures.
