25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop's reinvention of the pneumatic bicycle tire in 1888 {{had made for}} a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used on the dirt roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers {{precisely because of the}} smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle <b>suspension</b> <b>spring</b> assemblies. The pneumatic tire made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|E

500|$|In his {{capacity}} as racing advisor to Ferrari, Schumacher {{was present in}} Budapest for the [...] when Ferrari driver Felipe Massa was seriously injured after being struck by a <b>suspension</b> <b>spring</b> during qualifying. As {{it became clear that}} Massa would be unable to compete in the next race at Valencia Schumacher was chosen as a replacement for the Brazilian driver and on 29 July 2009, Ferrari announced that they planned to draft in Schumacher for the [...] and subsequent Grands Prix until Massa was able to race again. Schumacher tested in a modified F2007 to prepare himself as he had been unable to test the 2009 car due to testing restrictions. Ferrari appealed for special permission for Schumacher to test in a 2009 spec car, but Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso were against this test. In the end, Schumacher was forced to call off his return due to the severity of the neck injury he had received in a motorcycle accident earlier in the year. Massa's place at Ferrari was instead filled by Luca Badoer and Giancarlo Fisichella.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the responses of}} the railway vehicle and track components in terms of contact forces and displacements. The considered vehicle model is a five-DOF pitch-plane lumped parameter quarter car model supported on two-dimensional track systems comprising three layers. The car body is linked with the vehicle bogie through secondary <b>suspension</b> <b>springs</b> and damper elements, which is further linked to the wheels through primary <b>suspension</b> <b>springs</b> and damper elements. In modeling of the track, the rail is considered as an infinitely long beam discretely supported by a series of springs, dampers and masses representing the elasticity and damping effects of the rail pads, ballasts, and subgrades respectively. The non-linear Hertzian contact theory is employed to accomplish the dynamic interactions between the lumped mass vehicle and the continuous rail. The drastic effect of one wheel flat to the other perfect wheel-rail contact point is also taken into account...|$|R

5000|$|In the Riefler escapement, {{the energy}} {{required}} to keep the pendulum swinging is instead supplied by bending the short straight spring strip which suspends the pendulum. [...] The {{upper end of the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>spring</b> is not attached to a fixed support as in most clocks, but instead is attached to a heavy metal bearer, which pivots on two aligned knife-edges on its underside which rest on flat agate plates. The bending point of the <b>suspension</b> <b>spring</b> is in alignment with the line of contact of the knife-edges. When the pendulum passes its bottom point, the escape wheel is unlocked and pushes the bearer, and the bearer pivots suddenly on its knife edges by a small angle, flexing the spring. The spring is bent by a small amount in addition to that caused by the swing of the pendulum, and thus provides the impulse for the next swing. So the <b>suspension</b> <b>spring</b> is used for two functions: suspending the pendulum and giving it impulse.|$|E

5000|$|The wagon spring clock: During a {{brief time}} in American clockmaking history, coilable spring steel was not {{available}} in the USA and inventive clockmakers built clocks powered by a stack of leaf springs, similar to what has traditionally served as a <b>suspension</b> <b>spring</b> for wagons.|$|E

50|$|The {{wagon body}} {{rested on a}} frame {{consisting}} of two lattice girders that converged at the front and rear. The girders had holes in them to save weight.
