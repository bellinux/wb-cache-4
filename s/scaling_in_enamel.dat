30|$|The {{concentration}} of trace elements <b>in</b> tooth <b>enamel</b> was determined for 38 extracted human teeth using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

Simple and stepwise multiple regression {{was used to}} identify the correlations between trace elements concentration <b>in</b> <b>enamel</b> and its crystallographic structure, hardness, resistance to crack propagation, shade lightness and carbonate content. The presence of some trace elements <b>in</b> <b>enamel</b> was correlated with the size (Pb, Ti, Mn) and lattice parameters (Se, Cr, Ni) of apatite nanocrystals. Some trace elements such as Ti was significantly correlated with tooth crystallographic structure and consequently with hardness and shade lightness.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the shear bond {{strength}} of orthodontic brackets with two systems of hydrophilic adhesives: (I) a cyanoacrylate adhesive (Smartbond, International Gestenco) and (II) a composite system (Transbond XT and Transbond™ IPM) <b>in</b> two <b>enamel</b> conditions: dry and artificial saliva contaminated. Materials and methods 100 extracted premolars were stored in distilled water at 4 degrees Celsius. The teeth were cleaned, polished, and convenience distributed into 5 groups: (1) composite resin <b>in</b> <b>enamel</b> under dry conditions, (2) cyanoacrylate adhesive <b>in</b> dry <b>enamel</b> condition, (3) composite resin <b>in</b> <b>enamel</b> condition contaminated with artificial saliva before the primer, (4) composite resin enamel condition contaminated with artificial saliva after the primer, and (5) cyanoacrylate adhesive in artificial saliva contaminated enamel condition. The results showed that the adhesive system Transbond XT™ and Transbond MIP obtained the highest values of resistance to debonding <b>in</b> the dry <b>enamel</b> surface. ConclusionsThe adhesive system Transbond XT™ and Transbond MIP I provide an adequate in vitro resistance to debonding <b>in</b> every <b>enamel</b> condition. The system based on cyanoacrylate adhesive Smartbond obtained proper values of resistance to debonding <b>in</b> dry <b>enamel,</b> however it obtained the lowest values <b>in</b> contaminated with <b>enamel</b> artificial saliva conditions, unsuitable for orthodontics, and even some samples were not cemented successfully in vitro under these conditions...|$|R
