Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor directs Amy to write the note {{that led him to}} Craig's house, using a red pen in his jacket; she rummages around and finds the {{engagement}} ring from her husband-to-be, Rory, whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> after he was consumed by the crack in space and time and erased from existence. A similar crack appears behind Craig's refrigerator, and widens.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s a {{specific}} form of surgery known as psychic dentistry emerged in America. Willard Fuller {{was the most}} well known proponent. It was alleged that Fuller could cause dental fillings to appear spontaneously, change silver into golden fillings, straighten crooked teeth or produce new teeth. However, magicians and skeptics have found these claims to be unsupported by solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold fillings {{turned out to be}} tobacco stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling admitted <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> that the filling was already there.|$|E
25|$|However, when Madoka {{appeared}} to retrieve Homura, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> about her duty as the Law of Cycles and her powers, thus Kyubey kept observing her until that point. Having recovered her memories, Homura forces herself {{to complete the}} witch transformation {{at the cost of}} having her soul destroyed, to protect Madoka from the Incubators. At that moment Sayaka and a new girl named Nagisa Momoe, whose witch form is actually Charlotte—the witch that killed Mami—lead Madoka and the others in breaking the barrier to reach Homura's real body. Madoka recovers her memories and power as the Law of Cycles and reaches for Homura, but the latter releases the curse in her Soul Gem which she reveals is not one of despair, but love. With this power, retaining her human form, Homura suppresses Madoka's powers while transcending into what she considers to be a demon.|$|E

500|$|On Carey's 2006 The Adventures of Mimi Tour stop at Madison Square Garden, {{she sang}} [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] while wearing a {{sparkling}} bikini top and black leggings. She introduced the song as a [...] "thank you" [...] to fans for [...] "making this my 17th number one single". Four years later during Carey's Angels Advocate Tour in 2010, {{she had not}} performed the song on the first few runs of the tour. At the show in Phoenix, she told the crowd that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> the song until that night: [...] "I had forgotten about this song the whole tour and I don't know why. Funny I should forget it, considering the title." [...] Dressed in a [...] "form-fitting short dress with a flared, tutu-like bottom" [...] for the first portion of the night, Carey completed the song as the fourth on the set-list.|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> many details. She explained, [...] "I was a little embarrassed with how little I knew about it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a {{practicing}} Hindu, so I had {{to do a lot of}} research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't want to feel like they pigeonholed me, but I felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E
500|$|Stengel {{reported}} {{to spring training}} ill and thin; {{he was unable to}} work out for much of the time the Dodgers spent in Florida. Although the team stated that he had typhoid fever, still common in 1915, Lieb wrote after Stengel's death in 1975 that the ballplayer had gonorrhea. [...] Stengel may have been involved in a well-known incident during spring training when Robinson agreed to catch a baseball dropped from an airplane piloted by Ruth Law—except that it proved not to be a baseball, but a small grapefruit, much to the manager's shock, as he assumed the liquid on him was blood. Law stated that she dropped the grapefruit as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> the baseball, but Stengel retold the story, imitating Robinson, many times in his later years, with himself as grapefruit dropper, and is often given the credit for the stunt. Stengel's batting average dipped as low as the [...]150s for part of the season; though he eventually recovered to [...]237, this was still the worst full season percentage of his major league career.|$|E

500|$|Like {{the first}} chapter, the third chapter is also set in winter, but now focuses on another protagonist named [...] who is half German, half Japanese. One day, {{he goes to}} an {{abandoned}} train station in town he would often frequent to read at since it is so quiet there and meets a girl wearing an eyepatch over her left eye and sitting alone named [...] Chihiro is the younger twin sister of Kei Shindo from Ef: The First Tale and the main heroine of the third chapter in the story. Despite them being mutually shy, Renji comes back to see her at the station every day after school and quickly becomes friends with her. Renji later learns {{that she has a}} severe case of anterograde amnesia, where she can only remember 13 hours' of memory at a time, aside from the events before the accident that led to her current state, which she can recall perfectly. Now, she carries a diary with her which she writes in every day the events of that day so that the next day, after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> everything, she will be able to remind herself of what happened the previous day. Ironically, she has a fantastic memory of anything that happened that is less than thirteen hours old.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 1995, Selena {{contacted}} Leonard Wong {{about the}} perfume samples {{he had made}} for her. According to Wong, Selena told him she would be meeting Saldívar {{the next morning to}} pick up the samples that had been stolen from her. The same day, she told another employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar. At 7:30a.m. (CST) Friday, March 31, Selena rose from her bed, donned green workout sweats, and left for Saldívar's motel room. At the motel, Saldívar told Selena she had been raped in Mexico. Selena took her to Doctors Regional Hospital, where medical staff noticed Saldívar showed [...] "clear symptoms of depression." [...] Saldívar told medical staff she had bled [...] "a little". The staff noticed Selena angrily respond that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because Saldívar [...] "was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country." [...] While driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Quintanilla, Jr. According to Dr. Martinez, Selena had tried to contact him that morning but he could not speak on the telephone because he was performing surgery. At 10:00a.m. (CST), Quintanilla, Jr. contacted Pérez to determine the whereabouts of Selena; she was due to record a song at Q-Productions that morning and had not arrived. Pérez called Selena on her cellular telephone and reminded her of the scheduled recording. She told him <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> the session and she was [...] "taking care of one last [...] business" [...] and would be at Q-Productions soon after. This was the last telephone call Selena answered and was the last time Pérez heard her voice.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiences}} of Brandi Byrd illustrate another problematic case. Byrd {{was out with}} {{a friend who was}} charged with DUI.

She explained that her mother had given them to her after minor surgery and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> about them, but she was charged with two felonies, one for each pill. After sitting in jail for six days, Byrd went to court. The public defender and the drug court counselors told her if she didn't agree to drug court, she would go to prison.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, when Moses {{sought to}} return to Egypt – Tharbis {{is said to have}} {{resisted}} and insisted that he remain in Ethiopia as her husband. He then, being [...] "most skilful in astronomy", cast two rings; one which caused the wearer to become forgetful, and the other to cause the wearer to remember all. He gave the first ring to Tharbis, and wore the second himself, and waited for her oblivious nature to lose interest in retaining him as a husband – and when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> her love for him, he returned to Egypt alone. Some have suggested this period may have started when Moses was 27, and that he remained with Tharbis for forty years; although this number contradicts the traditional sources which suggest that Moses killed an Egyptian overseer when he was approximately 40 years old himself.|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence biographer Sheridan Morley interviewed du Maurier for his 1981 book Gertrude Lawrence. Du Maurier {{was quoted}} as saying she called Lawrence by the {{nickname}} [...] "Cinders," [...] short for Cinderella. Either while negotiating to appear in September Tide or rehearsing it, Lawrence stayed in [...] "a flat in London somewhere," [...] according to what du Maurier told Morley decades later. Boiling water in her tea kettle for a visitor was stressful for Lawrence. Du Maurier also told the biographer that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> all the dialogue she had written for September Tide and that shortly before her interview with Morley she had [...] "been searching my shelves for a copy of the play. ... I cannot remember how Cinders looked, what she wore, far less what she said." [...] Du Maurier's contribution to the Morley biography of Lawrence consists of little more than that.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the prop}} {{version of the}} map made for the films, the lines {{are made up of}} what at first glance are just random letters, but upon closer {{inspection}} are Latin words. The series makes no mention of Harry recovering the map from Moody's office, even though he continued to use it in later books; when asked about this discrepancy, Rowling answered that Harry had indeed sneaked into the office and recovered it in the days following the Third Task, and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> to include this detail in the book. When asked during an online question session, [...] "What child did Harry give the Marauder's Map to, if any?" [...] (after his school years), Rowling responded, [...] "I've got a feeling he didn't give it to any of them, but that James (Harry's eldest son) sneaked it out of his father's desk one day." [...] However, in Cursed Child, Harry is shown to still possess the Marauder's Map and gives it to Professor McGonagall {{to keep an eye on}} his wayward son Albus Potter.|$|E
