40|$|The {{active and}} {{independent}} ensemble is redistributing substrate from source to sink, controlling internal giving and taking by its own. This {{will lead to}} superadditivity {{in comparison to the}} inactive ensemble. The surface area of superadditivity differs from dependent ensembles. The line of strict symbiosis is unchanged. The symmetric independent ensemble will not be irrational or subadditive or show signs of antibiosis as long as internal giving by source and taking by sink ends at b-c= 0 (b/c= 1). The use of brute force and deception shifts this border into an area where the ensemble was inactive before. A subadditive and therefore irrational area appears in asymmetric ensembles as well as in symmetric ensembles with transfer costs. There, giving and taking takes place although the inactive ensemble has a higher productivity. In case the ensemble alternates between a connected and an unconnected phase work cycles appear. In the connected phase a costing good is transferred to become an earning good. In the unconnected phase the starting point for a new cycle is created by over-accumulation in source and by over-consumption in <b>sink.</b> <b>Work</b> cycles may include brute force and deception to further increase the transferred amount within the independent ensemble. A surprising outcome of my model is the observation that a complete rational independent and active ensemble may end in irrationality being less productive than an inactive ensemble. ...|$|E

40|$|Spectrum {{scarcity}} {{is known}} to be main obstacle to scaling of wireless network capacity. Spectrum sharing is a solution to this problem. The unlicensed ISM band is getting crowded by WLAN and WPAN users and devices. Spectrum sharing within the devices of same network is not a problem.

WiFi and ZigBee uses 2. 4 GHz ISM band. Different methods had been adopted to improve the coexistence of ZigBee and WiFi. Some methods are discussed here. Each of them has some disadvantages. To tackle these challenges a new system called WiseBee is used which help in the coexistence of ZigBee and WiFi. It uses a single antenna sink without changing WiFi and ZigBee design. The <b>sink</b> <b>works</b> in following steps: The signal from the RF front end will be processed firstly.
