40|$|The thesis {{contains}} {{the construction of}} a new class of pricing models for credit deriva-tives. The underlying stochastic process models the credit quality of individual obligors within the wider context of all firms that issue debt. The challenge is to reconcile a broad set of statistical and pricing information within a model where the main observables can be computed as integrals or sums of well-known functions, and the other observables are obtainable through efficient numerical schemes. In the first part, we use continuous processes that are based on square-root diffusion processes. Parameterized local volatility is introduced by a measure change and a co-ordinate transformation in such a way that the <b>stochastic</b> process retains <b>integrability.</b> Jumps in the process are introduced by subordinating on a random time-change. With this framework we are able to match empirical data on credit processes. Adding a drift enables us to introduce a measure change to the pricing measure to achieve consistency with market prices. In the second part, we discretise the stochastic process in such a way that node-to-node transition probabilities can be computed as sums of orthogonal polynomials. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{quantitative}} theory of stochastic homogenization for linear, uniformly parabolic equations with coefficients depending on space and time. Inspired by recent {{works in the}} elliptic setting, our analysis is focused on certain subadditive quantities derived from a variational interpretation of parabolic equations. These subadditive quantities are intimately connected to spatial averages of the fluxes and gradients of solutions. We implement a renormalization-type scheme to obtain an algebraic rate for their convergence, which is essentially a quantification of the weak convergence of the gradients and fluxes of solutions to their homogenized limits. As a consequence, we obtain estimates of the homogenization error for the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem which are optimal in <b>stochastic</b> <b>integrability.</b> We also develop a higher regularity theory for solutions of the heterogeneous equation, including a uniform $C^{ 0, 1 }$-type estimate and a Liouville theorem of every finite order.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} difficulties in stochastic homogenization is transferring quantitative ergodic information from the coefficients to the solutions, since the latter are nonlocal functions of the former. In this paper, we address this problem in a new way, {{in the context of}} linear elliptic equations in divergence form, by showing that certain quantities associated to the energy density of solutions are essentially additive. As a result, we are able to prove quantitative estimates on the weak convergence of the gradients, fluxes and energy densities of the first-order correctors (under blow-down) which are optimal in both scaling and <b>stochastic</b> <b>integrability.</b> The proof of the additivity is a bootstrap argument, completing the program initiated in AKM: using the regularity theory recently developed for stochastic homogenization, we reduce the error in additivity as we pass to larger and larger length scales. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we use the additivity to derive central limit theorems for these quantities by a reduction to sums of independent random variables. In particular, we prove that the first-order correctors converge, in the large-scale limit, to a variant of the Gaussian free field. Comment: 118 pages, to appear in Invent. Math.

40|$|The {{qualitative}} {{theory of}} stochastic homogenization of uniformly elliptic linear (but possibly non-symmetric) systems in divergence form is well-understood. Quantitative {{results on the}} speed of convergence and on the error in the representative volume method, like those recently obtained by the authors for scalar equations, require a type of stochastic regularity theory for the corrector (e. g., higher moment bounds). One of the main insights of the very recent work of Armstrong and Smart is that one should separate these error estimates, which require strong mixing conditions in order to yield the best rates possible, from the (large scale) regularity theory à la Avellaneda & Lin for a-harmonic functions that should hold under milder mixing conditions. In this paper, we establish an intrinsinc C^ 1, 1 -version of the improved regularity theory for non-symmetric random systems, that is qualitative in the sense it yields a new Liouville theorem under mere ergodicity, and that is quantifiable {{in the sense that}} it holds under a condition that has high stochastic integrabiliity provided the coefficients satisfy quantitative mixing assumptions. We introduce such a class of quantitative mixing condition, that allows for arbitrarily slow-decaying correlations, and under which we derive a new family of optimal estimates in stochastic homogenization. Comment: 84 pages. In the present version (which is still temporary) we reorganized the paper and updated the introduction and abstract.
