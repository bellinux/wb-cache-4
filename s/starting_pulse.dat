SettingThe pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory at University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital. PatientsPediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Design/InterventionsWe performed a single‐center quality improvement study where the baseline pulse fluoroscopy rate was varied between cases during pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures. Outcome MeasuresIndirect and direct radiation exposure data were collected, {{and the perceived}} impact of the fluoroscopy rate and procedural complications was recorded. These outcomes were then compared among the different set pulse fluoroscopy rates. ResultsComparing pulse fluoroscopy rates of 15, 7. 5, and 5 frames per second from 61 cases, {{there was a significant}} reduction in radiation exposure between 15 and 7. 5 frames per second.

A bifurcation analysis has revealed the onset of periodic motions for λ 6 = 0 (presence of elastic forces inside the system), whilst for λ = 0 nonperiodic motions will appear.

40|$|A thin disk laser {{has been}} {{developed}} which is capable to run at stochastical trigger with an extremly short latency (400 ns) between the electronic trigger and the optical output pulse. The Yb:YAG laser made from a Q-switched oscillator and a multi-pass amplifier delivers pulses up to 50 mJ at 1030 nm (M= 1. 3), independently of the pulse to pulse delay (1. 2 ms to infinity). Yb:YAG exhibits a long lifetime (~ 1 ms) of the excited states, and the disk-laser design provides efficient cooling needed for cw-pumping [1, 2]. The laser was dedicated to the measurement of the muonic Lamb shift (2 S- 2 P energy difference) at PSI Switzerland [3]. From this measurement, a proton radius of 0. 84184 (67) fm was extracted, in discrepancy with previous measurements using different methods. The laser concept had to consider that the muonic hydrogen atoms are formed stochastically and that the lifetime of the 2 S states is only 1 µs.

40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model of GRB pulses in time, suggested in Norris et al. (2005), is extended across energy.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} trans-dental photo-curing {{on the degree of}} conversion (DC) of a resin composite irradiated by a light curing unit operating in different curing modes. Methods: A curing lamp having six different curing modes was used for indirect photo-activation of a Nanocomposite through different thicknesses of tooth tissues. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to determine DC. Three main experimental groups were formed in accordance with the 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 1. 3 mm, tooth thicknesses which were further subdivided into six minor groups formed according to irradiation modes. Control groups employed direct irradiation. Results: For each of the six light curing modes, the average DC decreased with increase in intervening tooth thickness. Among the groups, 0. 5 mm had the highest DC mean values, 21. 5 mm group had the lowest mean values (P< 0. 05). The composite resin showed lower DC mean values when irradiated indirectly compared to control direct curing (P< 0. 05).
