5000|$|For most {{conspicuous}} gallantry on the 15th-16th May 1940, when the platoon {{under his command}} was {{on the south side}} of the River Dyle, astride a blown bridge. During the night a strong attack was beaten off, but about 11 a.m. the enemy again launched a violent attack and pushed forward a bridging party into the <b>sunken</b> <b>bottom</b> of the river. Second Lieutenant Annand attacked this party, but when ammunition ran out he went forward himself over open ground, with total disregard for enemy mortar and machine-gun fire. Reaching the top of the bridge, he drove out the party below, inflicting over twenty casualties with hand grenades. Having been wounded he rejoined his platoon, had his wound dressed, and then carried on in command.Richard Annand's platoon sergeant said later [...] "Mr Annand came to me at platoon headquarters and asked for a box of grenades as they could hear Jerry trying to repair the bridge. Off he went and he sure must have given them a lovely time because it wasn't a great while before he was back for more.During the evening another attack was launched and again Second Lieutenant Annand went forward with hand grenades and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. When the order to withdraw was received, he withdrew his platoon, but learning on the way back that his batman was wounded and had been left behind, he returned at once to the former position and brought him back in a wheelbarrow, before losing consciousness as the result of wounds.|$|E

Here we document rapid loss of molluscicidal bait pellets to earthworms and the resulting adverse effects on slug control. Three years of field studies were conducted at 17 locations with contrasting crops, soil types, residue levels, and tillage management programs. Baits were isolated in covered, <b>sunken,</b> open <b>bottom</b> arenas in the field to exclude removal by slugs, rodents, or birds. Forty hours of nighttime field observations and photographic documentation were collected to support the hypothesis that earthworms were removing slug bait before it had the opportunity to kill slugs. Greenhouse studies were conducted on the gray field slug (Derocerus reticula turn Mueller), in screen-topped arenas to determine the effects on mortality, seedling survival, and egg fecundity in a bait-depleting environment. Field data showed that an average of 17...|$|R
40|$|U zaštitnim iskopavanjima, koja su provedena radi izgradnje zapadne zaobilaznice grada Virovitice, na nalazištu Virovitica-Kiškorija sjever istražen je istočni dio otvorenoga nizinskog naselja latenske kulture. Kao osnovne stambene jedinice izdvojene su kuće i zemunice, uz koje se povezuju i ukopi spremnica, jama, bunara, rovova i kanala. Budući da je istražena veća površina nalazišta, moguće je kvalitetnije upoznati infrastrukturu naselja s objektima koji su povezani u manje cjeline koje pokazuju kako je naselje bilo obiteljski organizirano, s planski podignutim okućnicama. Na osnovi brojnih pokretnih nalaza, posebno keramčkih ulomaka i brončanih fibula, naselje na Kiškoriji pripisano je mokronoškoj skupini, a uz pomoć ulomaka staklenih narukvica, datirano je u razdoblje kasnog latena. In a {{field survey}} {{conducted}} {{for construction of}} the western Virovitica ring-road at an elevation in the western periphery {{of the city of}} Virovitica ceramic fragments were found suggesting the existence of a lowland La Tène settlement. The elevation on which the settlement is situated is on its southern and eastern side surrounded by a low alluvial zone, whereas towards the west it continues in mild sandy elevations. Rescue excavations of the La Tène settlement Kiškorija sjever included an area of 19, 600 m 2. No cultural layers were found in any part of the site, as they were probably destroyed by ploughing. As archaeological units, sunken pit-dwellings, pits, wells, channels, trenches and pillars were identified, which were filled by different kinds of fillings containing numerous archaeological finds, out of which the largest part were fragments of ceramic vessels and house daub, followed by finds of metal, glass and various stone objects. As the main dwelling units the remains of houses and pit dwellings were separated. Only the outlines of house bases were documented in the form of sunken holes for pillars, whereas the floors were not preserved. During excavations, four house foundations with rectangular outlines were identified, most of them oriented north-south (Fig. 1 - 2). The entire infrastructure necessary for undisturbed and independent family life was near the houses, including wells, pits and fences (Fig. 2). The second basic type of dwelling facilities are sunken pit dwellings, mostly of an oval outline, with one or more separate smaller rooms. All pit dwellings have a <b>bottom</b> <b>sunken</b> from 0, 40 to 1, 0 m depth, suggesting the existence of part of the structure above ground. The length of the pit dwellings was from 3, 50 m to approximately 6, 50 m. Pit dwelling SU 248 is notable for its regular rectangular shape and a levelled bottom, confirming the assumption that the sunken structures of the pit dwelling type (Fig. 3) were also used for living. Close to the pit dwellings there are also structures such as containers, wells and pits (Fig. 4). The fillings of the separate pit dwellings contained a significant number of finds, suggesting that after deserting them, the remaining pits were used for refuse − probably by the dwellers of the newly erected neighbouring structures. The value of the excavated area of the Kiškorija sjever settlement is identified also in separating narrower, family-like organized complexes, defined as yards, in which the basic residual units such as houses and/or pit dwellings are arranged along with other necessary infrastructure facilities. The remains of fences include shallow channels approximately 40 - 50 cm wide and even dozens of meters long (Fig. 2). A larger number of pits of various shapes, dimensions and depths was also found, most of which have an oval outline. The fillings of some pits contained a larger number of objects, which suggests that they were used for refuse and were mostly located close to the houses and pit dwellings. Some of the pits can be defined as wells, which are always located near the houses or pit dwellings, confirming a practical activity of the community that was oriented to the accessibility of water as one of the basic living requirements. The majority of the objects found in the fillings of the constructions − mostly pits and pit-dwellings − unearthed {{in the course of the}} excavations of the La Tène Kiškorija sjever settlement were ceramic vessel and house daub fragments; smaller numbers of metal, glass and stone artefacts were documented, which are more significant to the cultural and chronological definition of the excavated part of the settlement. Among the forms of ceramic vessels, fragments of different shapes of pots and bowls as well as kantharoi were separated, which were either made on a potter’s wheel, or hand worked. Among other ceramic objects various forms of weights and whorls and discs with a little hole stand out. Comparisons for isolated ceramic forms can be found at sites of the Mokronog group of Tauriscs, as well as the Scordiscs; some forms have similarities on the opposite bank of the Drava River, in Transdanubia, but also in the indigenous traditions of the Early Iron Age in Podravina. The classification of the Kiškorija sjever settlement to the Mokronog group area of distribution relies upon finds of metal objects, in the first place of Late La Tène bronze brooches of the Beletov vrt and Magdalenska gora types. Apart from brooches, important for chronological definition of the settlement are also numerous finds of arm ring fragments of cobalt blue or purple glass with a D intersection, dated to the Late La Tène period and testifying to the connection with the La Tène sites south and north of the Alps. According to the size of the excavated area, the La Tène settlement at Kiškorija sjever is so far one of the largest excavated prehistoric sites in northern Croatia. The excavations show that it is a lowland settlement with a family structure, where the nuclear family represented the basic social unit of a community. Based on the unearthed finds the settlement can be ascribed to the Mokronog group, i. e. the Tauriscs’ eastern distribution area. In addition, the influence of the material heritage of the neighbouring Scordiscs and the Celtic communities settled in Transdanubia, is evident, along with the heritage of the indigenous Pannonian population. The same picture was documented also in the excavations of the Middle La Tène cemetery in Zvonimirovo, as well as the other Late La Tène lowland settlements found in field surveys in the surroundings of Virovitica and Suhopolje, for which the Kiškorija settlement becomes the basic settlement model. Finds, particularly bronze brooches of the Magdalenska gora and Beletov vrt types, along with glass bracelet fragments, make it possible to date the settlement to the Late La Tène period, its beginnings originating probably by the end of the younger phase of Middle La Tène, as the find of a ceramic fragment, decorated by stamped concentric circles, indicated...|$|R
