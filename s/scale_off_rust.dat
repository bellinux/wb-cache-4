50|$|Approximately 900,000 {{of these}} muskets were {{imported}} during 1861-1865, seeing use {{in every major}} battle from Shiloh onward. Many officers preferred Springfield muskets over the Enfield — {{largely due to the}} interchangeability of parts that the machine-made Springfields offered. But some soldiers liked the Enfield better because its blued steel barrel and fittings {{did not have to be}} continually polished to ward <b>off</b> <b>rust</b> like the bright metal of the Springfield did.|$|R
50|$|Methanesulfonic acid is also {{a primary}} {{ingredient}} in rust and scale removers. It is used to clean <b>off</b> surface <b>rust</b> from ceramic, tiles and porcelain which are usually susceptible to acid attack.|$|R
50|$|Perissodus microlepis is {{a species}} of cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika. This species reaches a length of 11 cm TL. This species {{can also be found}} in the {{aquarium}} trade. It is a scale-eating 'parasite' on other fish species. It occurs in two distinct morphological forms. One morph has mouth parts twisted to the left, enabling it to eat <b>scales</b> <b>off</b> its victim’s right flank. In contrast, the other morph, whose mouth is twisted to the right, eats <b>scales</b> <b>off</b> its victim’s left flank. The relative abundance of the two morphs in populations is regulated by frequency-dependent selection.|$|R
50|$|Plecodus multidentatus is {{a species}} of cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika. This species is a scale-eater, eating the <b>scales</b> <b>off</b> of other fishes. This species can reach a length of 12 cm TL.|$|R
50|$|The Dawgs had {{to shake}} <b>off</b> the <b>rust</b> after falling behind 10-0 early and {{did just that}} by scoring 24 of the game's final 27 points to {{complete}} the SEC schedule at 6-2. Georgia ran their winning streak over the Wildcats in Athens to 15 games.|$|R

50|$|Squirrelfish {{in general}} are of low {{commercial}} importance, but they are frequently taken on a small <b>scale</b> <b>off</b> of Brazil and Venezuela with traps, handlines, and gillnets. They show resilience through the ability to survive for days within traps and to survive in highly polluted waters. They are sometimes marketed fresh. They are commonly displayed in public aquarium facilities due to their beautiful red coloration and distinctively large eyes.|$|R
50|$|Xenochromis hecqui is {{a species}} of cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. It is mainly found at depths of 6-100 m, but has been {{recorded}} somewhat deeper, even in waters virtually devoid of oxygen. This species is a scale eater, consuming the <b>scales</b> <b>off</b> of other fishes, but will also feed on copepods. It can reach a total length of up to 30 cm.

5000|$|Dimensions can be {{measured}} off drawings made on a stable medium such as vellum. All processes of reproduction introduce small errors, especially now that different copying methods mean that the same drawing may be re-copied, or copies made in several different ways. Consequently, dimensions need to be written ("figured") on the drawing. The disclaimer [...] "Do not <b>scale</b> <b>off</b> dimensions" [...] is commonly inscribed on architects drawings, to guard against errors arising in the copying process.|$|R
50|$|Both fighters {{rushed out}} of their corners for round one. Tszyu was {{somewhat}} slower; {{he might have been}} trying to shake <b>off</b> some <b>rust</b> after not fighting for the aforementioned twenty-two months. Mitchell landed some heavy rights to Tszyu's chin, while the champion looked calm and composed. Mitchell outlanded Tszyu in this round. An important point of the fight was when both boxers clashed their heads before round one was finished, and Tszyu came out with a cut around his left eye.|$|R
60|$|He led the {{way through}} the car to the {{platform}} and leaped down. Then he pointed significantly to the rails below them. His companion started. The metal was <b>scaling</b> <b>off</b> in thin strips from the rails, and in some places its thickness had been reduced a quarter of an inch, while in others the projecting edges were torn off, or hanging in iron shreds, so that the wheels actually ran on the narrow central strip. It seemed marvelous that the train could keep the track.|$|R
5000|$|The Vanavāsis ("Tribals") {{were called}} Aboriginals and made {{victims of the}} divide and rule policy of the British. They were {{declared}} to be animists with no religion worth the name. The tribal regions were <b>scaled</b> <b>off</b> as [...] "Protected Areas" [...] to all except Christian missionaries. Now, the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram has begun working in those areas. Sanskar Kendras for women and children, schools, hostels, reading rooms, free dispensaries, and village and cottage industries have been started and are increasing in number throughout all the provinces.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue spruce}} is {{susceptible}} to several needle casting diseases which cause the needles to turn yellow, mottled or brown before they fall <b>off.</b> Various <b>rust</b> diseases also affect the tree causing yellowing of the needles as well as needle fall. Canker caused by Cytospora attacks one of the lower branches first and progressively makes its way higher up the tree. The first symptom is the needles turning reddish-brown and falling off. Meanwhile, patches of white resin appear on the bark and the branch eventually dies.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "Save the Stacker" [...] {{fund was}} set up in Cornell, where as of 2009, it was {{estimated}} that it would take a minimum of $350,000 to clean <b>off</b> the <b>rust</b> and refinish the old equipment, a process that would require workers to climb up {{the left side of the}} 175 ft stacker at its 45-degree angle. As of 2016, the city approved $23,000 from a special fund to make needed repairs. The city's long-range goal is to raise $500,000 within the next two decades for a complete renovation.|$|R

500|$|A {{naturally}} spineless {{variety of}} durian growing wild in Davao, Philippines, {{was discovered in}} the 1960s; fruits borne from these seeds also lacked spines. Since the bases of the scales develop into spines as the fruit matures, sometimes spineless durians are produced artificially by scraping <b>scales</b> <b>off</b> immature fruits. In Malaysia, a spineless durian clone D172 is registered by Agriculture Department on 17 June 1989. It was called [...] "Durian Botak" [...] (Bald Durian). In Indonesia, Ir Sumeru Ashari, head of Durian Research Centre, Universitas Brawijaya reported spineless durian from Kasembon, Malang. Another cultivar is from Lombok, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Douglas {{squirrels}} mostly eat {{seeds of}} coniferous trees such as Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and shore pine (Pinus contorta). They also eat acorns, berries, mushrooms, the eggs of birds such as yellow warblers, and some fruit including strawberries and plums. Douglas squirrels are larder hoarders, storing their {{food in a}} single location or 'larder' called a midden. As the squirrel peels the <b>scales</b> <b>off</b> cones {{to get at the}} seeds, the discarded scales accumulate into piles that can grow to more than a meter across as the same site is used by generations of squirrels.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Ella was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} on record in Canadian waters. It formed on August30, 1978 {{to the south of}} Bermuda, and quickly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward. By September1, Ella reached winds of 125mph (205km/h), and it was expected to pass close to the Outer Banks of North Carolina during the busy Labor Day Weekend. The hurricane became stationary for about 24hours, and later turned to the northeast away from the coast. On September4, Ella reached Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Nova Scotia. It subsequently weakened, passing southeast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The wear {{behavior}} of SiC particle reinforced copper matrix composites was investigated. The SiC reinforcement improves the wear resistance and impedes severe adhesive wear at high loads, while increasing the friction coefficient and the wear {{loss of the}} counterpart. The presence of an iron-rich MML on the worn surfaces of the composites influences the wear behavior effectively. At low loads, the wear mechanism for SiCp/Cu composites is the removal of SiC particles from the matrix by micro-plowing effect or the pulling off of particles. At high loads, interfacial crack propagation induced delamination of the subsurface materials or <b>scaling</b> <b>off</b> of the MML are the main wear mechanisms...|$|R
