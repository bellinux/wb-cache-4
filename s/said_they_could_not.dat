He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remember.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was flying between Kemayoran Airport in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Tabing Airport, the former airport of Padang, Indonesia. Five minutes {{before it was}} scheduled to arrive at Padang, air traffic controllers lost radio contact with the flight. Controllers at Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport, Palembang, Sumatra, reported the aircraft issued a distress signal from the aircraft. The flight crew reportedly <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> land at Padang because of poor weather and bad visibility. The aircraft subsequently crashed into the Indian Ocean, killing all 62 passengers and seven crew aboard the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|An {{instance}} of a Japanese atrocity was {{committed in the}} area of the rubber trees around Trolak. In this area were a number of Argyll and Hyderabad wounded. 2nd Lieutenant Ian Primrose reports that after he regained consciousness from an injury during the fighting he discovered that the Japanese were dividing the wounded into those who said they could walk and those who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> Primrose decided he could walk, which was fortunate as the Japanese soldiers proceeded to shoot and bayonet the wounded who could not. Afterward the survivors were forced to dig graves for the dead and then told to carry the Japanese wounded.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, Egypt's Baseera, the Centre for Public Opinion Research, {{said in a}} poll {{result that}} only eight {{percent of the sample}} were unhappy with El-Sisi's {{performance}} and ten percent of the sample <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> identify their position. The poll showed that 78 percent of the sample said they would vote for Sisi should the presidential elections be held again the next day while 11 percent said they would not. Eighty-nine percent said that there was improvement in the security situation after Sisi's taking office. Seventy-three percent said that fuel has become regularly available since Sisi's election. Meanwhile, 35 percent of respondents believed price controls had improved, while 32 percent believed that they have become worse. Twenty-nine percent of the respondents did not see any change, and three percent were undecided.|$|E
25|$|Sometime after 0100, 12 August, 2nd Battalion {{lost contact}} with C Company on the ridge northward and sounds of combat could be heard coming from that area. When further efforts to reach the company by {{telephone}} and radio failed, the battalion commander sent runners and a wire crew out to try to re-establish contact. He then urged speedy movement of the trains and artillery westward through the pass. But the regimental commander reluctantly held firm to division orders not to move until after daylight. The runners returned and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find the company. The wire crew was missing. Members of the battalion staff had again heard sounds of combat in the company area. They also had seen flares there. This was interpreted to mean that North Korean troops held it and were signaling to allied units. Still unable to contact the division, 5th Infantry now decided to move the trains and artillery out westward {{while it was still}} dark, despite division orders to wait for daylight, seeing too much risk in delaying any longer. The battalion of the 24th Infantry promised by the division had not arrived. About 0400 the trains to moved out. They were to be followed by the artillery, and then the 1st Battalion would bring up the rear. In the meantime, the battalion was to hold open the pass and protect the regimental column. Movement of the trains through the pass should have been accomplished in twenty minutes, but it required hours. During the hour or more before daylight, no vehicle moved more than ten or twenty feet at a time. One of the factors creating this situation was caused when the Medical Company tried to move into the column from its position near the 1st Battalion command post. An ambulance hung up in a ditch and stopped everything on the road behind it until it could be pulled out.|$|E

500|$|United States {{authorities}} {{concluded that}} the killings were the act of a single individual.

500|$|After {{the passing}} of the law, the Tongan {{government}} wrote to the Hawaiian government, the British consul on Hawaii and Hawaiian steamship officials of the ban, that people assisting Mormons in entering Tonga were to be charged $450. [...] Despite Mormon missionaries having to travel through Hawaii to Tonga, the Hawaiian government refused to enforce the ban by denying passport to Mormons applicants, because passport decisions were made by the U. S. Department of State. Hawaii could only warn travelers of the ban. Steamships <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> enforce the ban either because passports of its passengers did not indicate religion.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} of polonium starts from bombardment of bismuth (209Bi) with neutrons at the Mayak nuclear [...] reactors in Ozersk, {{near the city}} of Chelyabinsk in Russia. The product is then transferred to the Avangard Electromechanical Plant in the closed city of Sarov. This of course does not exclude the possibility that the polonium that killed Litvinenko was imported by a licensed commercial distributor, but no one—including the Russian government—has proposed that this is likely, particularly in regard to the radiation detected on the British Airways passenger jets travelling between Moscow and London. Russian investigators have <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> identify the source of polonium.|$|E

[...] The Frankfurter Allgemeine called him [...] "a kamikaze without honour" [...] and commented that the [...] "monument is starting to crack because the foundations are faulty". A German TV station asked fans for their views and received the views of 63,081 votes. 28% <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> support Schumacher any longer.|$|E
500|$|The {{main problem}} with the Act was {{whether or not the}} {{claimant}} had to know he had a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply. The House of Lords had an opportunity to resolve this in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd but [...] "failed spectacularly", making a decision so confused that the Court of Appeal in Harper and others v National Coal Board <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> actually find a ratio decidendi anywhere in the House of Lords' opinion. The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having [...] "a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book". The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{forms of}} {{financial}} aid were studied to determine the academic and personal background of the recipients and if the aid promoted college attendance, academic achievement, and personal development. The subjects were full-time and received scholarships or grants awarded specifically to low-income students; those with other forms of aid were excluded. The recipient group contained 57 men and 51 women; the control group, 45 men and 40 women. The questions were: do recipients earn better grades? if so, is it because of academic ability? do they have fewer academic suspensions? do they remain enrolled longer? {{do they have a}} higher graduation rate? do they earn more credits in two years? The groups were similar in age, marital status, and mother's education; they differed in ACT scores, family income, father's education, and number of dependents in family.

Michael Schumacher, placed fourth before his retirement from a fuel pressure problem on lap 23, shared similar feelings to Montoya: [...] "I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race to go.

500|$|On 15 March 2012, an Afghan {{parliamentary}} probe {{team made}} up of {{several members of the}} National Assembly of Afghanistan announced that up to 20 American soldiers were involved in the killings, with support from two helicopters. [...] They had spent two days in the province on site, interviewing the survivors and collecting evidence. [...] One {{of the members of the}} probe team, Hamizai Lali, said: [...] "We closely examined the site of the incident, talked to the families who lost their beloved ones, the injured people and tribal elders... The villages are one and a half kilometer from the U.S. military base. We are convinced that one soldier cannot kill so many people in two villages within one hour... have been killed by the two groups." [...] Lali asked the Afghan government, the United Nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in Afghanistan. [...] While visiting one of the affected villages, Hamid Karzai pointed to one of the villagers and said: [...] "In his family, in four rooms people were killed – children and women were killed – and then they were all brought together in one room and then set on fire. That, one man cannot do." [...] However, the team later <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> confirm that multiple soldiers took part in the killings.|$|E
500|$|Independent of the LM, the LCL {{had begun}} to change. It {{eventually}} supported Don Dunstan's bills for electoral reform, both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular {{with the arrival of}} Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many {{of the reasons for the}} LM's split had become null. Combined with the LM's declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: [...] "I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what I said in the past and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view." [...] He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only [...] "genuine Liberal party" [...] in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse's stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that [...] "there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor." [...] He said to do otherwise would be to [...] "exist in splendid selfish isolation", and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM's reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as [...] "very conservative". Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.|$|E

2500|$|A humorous story, as told by Tom Greer, was the {{engagement}} a piano player (the outrageous John McDonald) {{to entertain the}} cast on the train {{on the way to}} Melbourne. John could only play upright pianos. The railways rang and <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get the upright around the passageway corners of the train so {{it would be impossible to}} get it on board. Tom Greer demanded it be put on the train somehow even if it meant dismantling the piano and putting it back together - [...] "key by key". In desperation, engineers arrived and took off the side of the carriage, loaded the piano on with a forklift, before replacing the carriage wall. The train was christened Spirit of 96.|$|E
