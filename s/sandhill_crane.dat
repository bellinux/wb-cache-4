5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western pond turtle, the <b>sandhill</b> <b>crane,</b> and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
5|$|The storm left 80,000 Mississippi Power Company {{customers}} without electricity; most of Jackson County's 126,000 {{residents were}} affected by the outage. Operations at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyard's buildings and cranes, {{and at least two}} other shipyards in the state {{were affected by}} the hurricane. Additionally, the storm forced the temporary closure of the Chevron USA refinery at Pascagoula. Facilities at Horn Island in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Buccaneer State Park, and the Mississippi <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Crane</b> National Wildlife Refuge required repairs following the storm; at the latter, damages included the cost of healing a Florida sandhill crane's injured leg. Thirty seafood processing plants were damaged, and one was destroyed. The Red Cross estimated that 200 single-family houses in the state were destroyed, and some 13,200 were damaged, 1,200 of them heavily. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2,290. The overall cost of damage in Mississippi alone approached $1 billion.|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, <b>sandhill</b> <b>crane</b> and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E

5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the <b>sandhill</b> <b>crane,</b> American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT-During spring migration, <b>sandhill</b> <b>cranes</b> (Crus canaden-sis) rely on {{the central}} Platte River valley in Nebraska as a staging area to {{replenish}} depleted energy and nutrient reserves. From mid-February to mid-April 1998 - 2001, we conducted ground and aerial surveys of <b>sandhill</b> <b>cranes</b> in the central Platte River valley. Peak numbers of <b>sandhill</b> <b>cranes</b> (121, 000 - 285, 000 cranes) detected during ground sur-veys occurred in mid-March (1998, 2001) or early March (1999, 2000). From 42 % to 55 % of the cranes occurred in cornfields, 26 %- 38 % in lowland grassland, 7 %- 13 % in alfalfa, and 2 %- 12 % in other habitats (soybean, winter wheat, shrub-grassland, upland grassland). In general, <b>sandhill</b> <b>cranes</b> preferred channel widths> 150 m and avoided channel widths < 100 m. Channel widths at roost sites were significantly wider (P < 0. 001) than channel widths at unused sites (229 m;!;. 2. 9 S. E. vs. 83 m;!;. 2. 1 S. E.).

25|$|Sandhill cranes {{have one}} of the longest fossil {{histories}} of any extant bird. A 10-million-year-old crane fossil from Nebraska is said to be of this species, but this may be from a prehistoric relative or the direct ancestor of sandhill cranes and not belong in the genus Grus. The oldest unequivocal <b>sandhill</b> <b>crane</b> fossil is 2.5 million years old, older by half than the earliest remains of most living species of birds, primarily found from after the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary some 1.8 million years ago. As these ancient sandhill cranes varied as much in size as present-day birds, those Pliocene fossils are sometimes described as new species. Grus haydeni may have been a prehistoric relative, or it may comprise material of a <b>sandhill</b> <b>crane</b> and its ancestor.|$|E
25|$|The Mississippi <b>sandhill</b> <b>crane</b> {{has lost}} the most range; it used to live along most of the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico coast, and its range was once nearly parapatric with that of its eastern neighbor. As of 2013, about 25 breeding pairs exist in an intensively managed population. The Mississippi <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Crane</b> National Wildlife Refugeâ€”established in 1975 when fewer than 35 of the birds existedâ€”has the biggest release program for cranes on Earth, and 90% of the cranes there were raised in captivity. The second viable egg from a two-egg nest was occasionally removed from the nests, starting in 1965, {{to become part of}} a captive flock. This breeding flock is divided between the Audubon Institute's Species Survival Center and White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida. These cranes have produced offspring for annual releases into the refuge.|$|E

40|$|On 30 March 1996 around 1000 h CST, Bob Janssen and Jim Williams of Minnetonka, Minnesota, {{discovered}} a Common Crane (Grus grus) feeding in corn stubble with {{a flock of}} <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Cranes</b> (Grus canadensis) in Section 34 T 9 R 10 Hall County, Nebraska. The Commom Crane associated with the <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Cranes,</b> which were at peak numbers in the Platte River valley. Later that day, several observers, including myself, witnessed the bird in section 32 about 500 yards away, where it mingled with a few hundred <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Cranes.</b> The difficulty in seeing this bird was illustrated {{by the fact that}} during a 2 -hour period, it was visible for less than 32 minutes despite the fact that about 15 observers maintain constant vigilance on the spot where the crane loafed but was obscured by the <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Cranes.</b> It was seen only when it raised its head above the <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Cranes.</b> The following morning (31 March 1996), Thomas Labedz and I located the Common Crane in Section 27 at 0845 h CST. It was feeding in corn stubble with a few hundred <b>Sandhill</b> <b>Cranes.</b> I was able to photograph the bird from a vehicle at a distance of about 300 yards using a 400 mm lens (Figure 1).
