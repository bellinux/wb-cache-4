500|$|The {{financial}} {{legacy of}} the Protectorate consisted, apart from crippling Crown debts, of an unprecedentedly debased coinage. On the second day as Lord President of the Council, Dudley began a process to tackle {{the problems of the}} mint. He set up a committee that looked into the peculation by the officers of the mint and other institutions. In 1551 the government at the same time tried to yield profit and restore confidence in the coin by issuing yet further debased coinage and [...] "crying it down" [...] immediately afterwards. The result was panic and confusion and, to get hold of the situation, a coin of 92.3% silver content (against 25% silver content in the last debasement) was issued within months. The bad coin prevailed over the good, however, because people had lost confidence. Northumberland admitted defeat and recruited the financial expert Thomas Gresham. After the first good harvest in four years, by late 1552 the currency was <b>stable,</b> <b>prices</b> for foodstuffs had dropped, and a basis for economic recovery had been laid. A process to centralise the administration of Crown revenue was underway and foreign debt had been eliminated.|$|E

Monetary policy is the process by which a government, central bank, or monetary authority manages the money supply to achieve specific goals. Usually the goal of monetary policy is to accommodate economic growth in an environment of <b>stable</b> <b>prices.</b> For example, it is clearly stated in the Federal Reserve Act that the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee should seek [...] "to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, <b>stable</b> <b>prices,</b> and moderate long-term interest rates." ...|$|E

Real annual earnings (in 1914 dollars) for all employees (deducting for unemployment) was [...] $566 in 1921 and $793 in 1929, a real gain of 40%. The economic prosperity of the decade led to <b>stable</b> <b>prices,</b> eliminating one major incentive to join unions.
