They had last night no orders to move at present, and I rather think they will remain there, or near there.

You may hear a rumor in New York that they have been shipped in transports from Alexandria--there is no truth in it at all. Grant's Army of the Potomac is probably to do the heavy work. His army is strong and full of fight. Mother, I think it is to-day the noblest army of soldiers that ever marched--nobody can know the men as well as I do, I sometimes think.|$|E
