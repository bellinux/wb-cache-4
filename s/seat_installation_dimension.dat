50|$|A {{child safety}} seat (infant safety seat, child {{restraint}} system, child seat, baby seat, restraining car seat, car seat, etc.) is a seat {{designed specifically to}} protect children from injury or death during collisions. Most commonly these seats are purchased and installed by consumers, but car manufacturers may integrate them directly into their vehicle's design and generally are required to provide anchors and to ensure seat belt compatibility. Many jurisdictions require children defined by age, weight, and/or height to use a government-approved child safety seat when riding in a vehicle. Child safety seats provide passive restraints and must be properly used to be effective. However, research indicates many child safety restraints are often not used properly. To tackle this negative trend, health officials and child safety experts produce child safety videos to teach proper car <b>seat</b> <b>installation</b> to parents and caregivers.|$|R
50|$|The Seoul World Cup Stadium, {{also known}} as Sangam Stadium, is a stadium used mostly for {{association}} football matches.

It is currently the second largest stadium in South Korea after Seoul Olympic Stadium. It was designed to represent {{the image of a}} traditional Korean kite. The stadium has a capacity of 66,704 seats, including 816 seats for VIP, 754 seats for press and 75 private Sky Box rooms, each with a capacity for 12 to 29 persons.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this analytical study were: to select one advanced automotive diesel engine (AAD) concept which {{would increase the}} tank mileage of a 3, 000 pound passenger car from the present 35 mpg to at least 52 mpg; to identify long term component research and development work required to bring the selected concept to fruition; and to prepare a development strategy that will bring the selected concept to a prototype testing phase. Cummins Engine Company has completed this study. The selected concept is a 4 stroke cycle, direct injection, spark assisted, advanced adiabatic diesel engine with positive displacement compounding plus expander and part load air preheating. The engine does not use a liquid coolant nor liquid lubricants.

40|$|International audienceThe {{consideration}} of environmental constraints in production, transport {{and distribution of}} cold energy resulted in reconsidering the practices of <b>installations</b> <b>dimensioning</b> in particular. Their containment {{led to the development}} of secondary refrigerants such as ice slurries to store, transport and distribute the cold energy. These heat transfer fluids should have good thermophysical properties, giving high transport capability, high heat transfer ability as well as low pressure drops. The use of ice slurries can lead to lower flow rates and smaller pumping power compared to single phase fluid. The purpose of the presented work is to study the distribution network of indirect cold systems thanks to a model allowing the evaluation of the influence of various parameters on the operating behaviour of the installation. The available domain for the use of secondary heat transfer fluid (whether in their single phase or two phase form) is determined considering the best design from an energetic point of view. Because of the essential role of the fluid distribution between the production site and consumers, we focus our study on pressure drops and pumping power due to the fluid flow in cooling loops. For each investigated case, the minimum consumption power is obtained with the two phases (solid-liquid) heat transfer fluid (ice slurry) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the reflectivity of light on concrete and asphalt pavement systems. In 1983, the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) published the first recommended practice (RP- 8) for the design of roadway and parking lot lighting. This design method implemented empirically tested factors which were defined as the “reduced luminance coefficients” or the R-Tables. The R-Tables are essential for proper design of light pole <b>installation</b> <b>dimensions,</b> required power, and the distribution of light. The originally tested pavements are not necessarily representative of modern pavement materials used today. Moreover, recent Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are a relatively new light technology consistently implemented in roadway and parking lot design. Therefore, the objective of this research is to reevaluate the reflectiveness of two pavement systems. The reflective properties of each pavements were evaluated considering angles (β and γ) of illuminated light from each varied light source (i. e., incandescent and LED). Research findings concluded that modern concrete pavement is up to 3 times more reflective than modern asphalt pavement. Furthermore, this research also indicates that the angular light reflectivity is not only influenced by the pavement system but also the light source being used to illuminate that surface with respect to varied (α, β, and γ) angles...|$|R
