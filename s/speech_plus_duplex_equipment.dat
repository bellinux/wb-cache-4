40|$|Speech {{intelligibility}} in adverse situations, such as reverberation and noise, is conserved {{until the}} degradations reach certain thresholds. Psychoacoustic studies {{have described the}} properties of speech {{that lead to the}} conservation of its intelligibility under those circumstances. The neural mechanisms that underlie the robustness of intelligibility in these situations, however, are not yet well understood. Here, the cortical representations of speech in reverberation and <b>speech</b> <b>plus</b> noise in reverberation are studied by measuring the cortical responses of human subjects using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they listened to continuous speech narratives. It was hypothesized that the neural processing of speech in reverberation and <b>speech</b> <b>plus</b> noise in reverberation would follow a lack of cortical synchronization as function of the degradations. Encoding models show, however, that the neural encoding of speech in reverberation follow a different mechanism than that of speech in noise. On the other hand, in the absence of noise, it is possible to reconstruct with high accuracy the envelope of reverberant speech, thus demonstrating that the reverberant speech is well encoded by the brain...|$|R

30|$|It is our {{contention}} that the gestures used in the instruction for ANOVA were representational in nature using iconic gestures (indexical points and illustrating gestures) to convey within- and between-groups variance by linking spatial information on the slide with accompanying speech. Thus, the likely role gesture played in this research was to link relevant representations of ANOVA (in the form of concrete examples, equations, and speech) {{as well as to}} encapsulate the basic notion of variance using spatial imagery (circling around the means of all the experimental groups to relay the notion of between-groups variance) as these types of gestures were used predominantly throughout the lecture.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundStudies of orthostatic {{changes in}} {{cutaneous}} micro-perfusion have yielded conflicting results, likely from imprecision of legacy equipment. MethodsPostural flow {{changes in the}} femoral vessels and cervical carotids were measured in healthy normal adults using <b>duplex</b> <b>equipment.</b> Nutrient skin flow was measured using Hyperspectral imager (OxyVu- 2 ™), a newer non-touch measurement technology. ResultsThere are regional variations in cutaneous capillary density, sparse in the abdomen but richer in the forehead and ankle. Orthostatic microvascular congestion displays regional variations reflective of the non-linear pressure–volume relationship in thin walled vessels. There is profound cutaneous deoxygenation (≈ 40 % reduction) in the lower body starting {{at the level of}} the umbilicus and involving all levels below, in the erect posture; upper body is unaffected. Quantitative regional flow is preserved however, with an increase in pulse rate despite a velocity decrease in the femoral vessels. Increasing the arterio-venous gradient by calf-emptying maneuvers resulted in little improvement in cutaneous oxygenation unable to overcome the powerful orthostatic vasoconstriction. ConclusionThere is intense orthostatic vasoconstriction and cutaneous deoxygenation of the lower limbs to a degree not previously suspected. This powerful mechanism may be relevant to an understanding of dysvascular syndromes, particularly those with strong orthostatic features...|$|R

40|$|Detection {{of speech}} in noisy {{recordings}} is challenging, {{especially when the}} noise does not follow the usual whiteness, stationarity and high signal-to-noise ratio assumptions. A robust speech detector can affect significantly the performance of several speech-processing tasks, such as endpoint detection, segmentation and finally recognition, if we deal with real life data as opposed to laboratory or controlled environment recordings. The detector proposed in this paper {{is based on a}} Gaussianity test that employs third-order cumulants of the data to decide on the binary hypotheses of noise only versus <b>speech</b> <b>plus</b> noise. <b>Speech</b> intervals are detected by exploiting the third-order information present in the speech signal. The detector can tolerate a large family of additive noises thanks to its third-order statistics basis. The sample-adaptive and decision feedback variations proposed here provide the detector with tracking ability with respect to both the time variations of speech and the possible non-stationarity of noise.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} weighted {{approaches for}} integrated {{active noise control}} and noise reduction in hearing aids. The unweighted integrated active noise control and noise reduction scheme introduced in previous work does not allow to trade-off between the active noise control and the noise reduction. In some circumstances it will however be useful to emphasize one of the functional blocks. Changing the original optimisation problem to a constrained optimisation problem leads to a scheme based on a weighted mean squared error criterion that allows to focus either on the active noise control or on the noise reduction. It is similarly possible to derive a scheme that allows to focus either on reducing the speech distortion or on reducing the residual noise at the eardrum. In a single speech source scenario and {{when the number of}} sound sources (<b>speech</b> <b>plus</b> noise sources) is {{less than or equal to}} the number of microphones, it is possible to derive a simple formula for the output signal-to-noise ratio of the latter scheme.

40|$|It {{is claimed}} here that {{experimental}} evidence about human speech processing and {{the richness of}} memory for linguistic material supports a distributed view of language where every speaker creates an idiosyncratic perspective on the linguistic conventions of the community. In such a system, words are not spelled in memory of speakers from uniform letter-like units (whether phones or phonemes), but rather from the rich auditory patterns of <b>speech</b> <b>plus</b> any coupled visual, somatosensory and motor patterns. The evidence is strong that people actually employ high-dimensional, spectro-temporal, auditory patterns to support speech production, speech perception and linguistic memory in real time. Abstract phonology (with its phonemes, distinctive features, syllable types, etc.) is actually a kind of social institution – a loose inventory of patterns that evolves over historical time in each human community as a structure with many symmetries and regularities in the community corpus. Linguistics studies the phonological (and grammatical) patterns of various communities of speakers.

Three children were chosen who used single words to communicate but who did not combine words into complete sentences. Three sentence pairs were trained, with each pair having one sentence trained using oral methods and an equivalent one trained using the total communication approach. Both training procedures involved chaining sentence parts, reinforcement, and prompting. Oral methods involved presenting vocal stimuli and requiring vocal responses whereas total communication methods involved presenting vocal and signed stimuli and requiring vocal and signed responses. For the initial sentence pair with each child, an alternating treatments design was used to determine the relative efficacy of the two language training approaches. This was repeated with a second and third sentence pair using a multiprobe technique within a multiple baseline design. Results pointed to the superiority of the total communication approach in facilitating sentence repetition.

The automatic data acquisition technique works using the stenographic transcripts and acoustic data from the German parliamentary <b>speeches</b> <b>plus</b> general acoustic models, trained on different data. The idea of this technique is to generate special finite state automata from the stenographic transcripts.

The first step is the recognition of the speech data using finite state automaton as a language model. The next step is to find, to extract and to verify the match between sections of recognized words and actually spoken audio content. After this, the automatically extracted and verified data can be used for acoustic model training. Experiments show that for a given recognition task from the German Parliament domain the absolute decrease of the word error rate is 20 %. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: This article reviews {{experience}} with arterial injury caused by thoracic outlet syndrome. Special {{emphasis is placed}} on the influence of athletic or work activities on the axillary-subclavian artery system and the mechanism by which the humeral head compresses the axillary artery and the circumflex humeral arterial branches. Methods: Retrospective review identified 34 patients (age range 13 to 67 years) treated for upper extremity symptoms or ischemic complications of thoracic outlet syndrome from 1983 to 1993. Evaluation included assessment of occupational and recreational activities <b>plus</b> <b>duplex</b> ultrasonography and contrast arteriography with positional maneuvers. Results: Twenty-two patients (27 arms) had subclavian artery injury, which was most commonly caused by compression by a bony abnormality (cervical rib, 16; anomalous first rib, two; cervical rib and anomalous first rib, two). Fourteen of the 27 arms had distal embolization. All 27 had surgical decompression of the subclavian artery; 15 required concomitant arterial reconstruction. Twelve additional patients (nine athletes) had axillary artery involvement, all from arterial compression by the head of the humerus during abduction maneuvers; all had concomitant compression of the posterior circumflex humeral artery. Axillary arterial injury included thrombosis (one), aneurysm (two), and symptomatic extrinsic compression only (nine). Five patients with axillary artery involvement were treated without a surgical procedure; of the remainder, three underwent decompression procedures only, and four had direct arterial repair. In both groups all subclavian and axillary artery reconstructions were patent at last follow-up examination (mean 31 months). Conclusion: Most patients with thoracic outlet syndrome who have arterial involvement have a bony anomaly causing subclavian artery compression. This study demonstrates that humeral head compression of the axillary artery and its circumflex branches is a surprisingly common pathologic mechanism. Awareness of this condition affords a better therapeutic approach to arterial injuries caused by thoracic outlet syndrome. (J VASC SURG 1995; 21 : 57 - 70. ...|$|R
