The lightest filter-ing for the cumulative constraint is time-tabling. It has been improved several times over the last decade. The best known theoretical time com-plexity for time-table is O(n logn) introduced by Ouellet and Quimper. We show a new algorithm able to run in O(n), by relying on range min query algorithms. This approach is more of theoretical rather than prac-tical interest, because of the generally larger number of iterations needed to reach the fixed point. On the practical side, the recent <b>synchronized</b> <b>sweep</b> algorithm of Letort et al, with a time-complexity of O(n 2), requires fewer iterations to reach the fix-point and is considered as the most scal-able approach. Unfortunately this algorithm is not trivial to implement. In this work we present a O(n 2) simple two step alternative approach: first building the mandatory profile, then updating all the bounds of the activities. Our experimental results show that our algorithm out-performs <b>synchronized</b> <b>sweep</b> and the time-tabling implementations of other open-source solvers on large scale scheduling instances, sometimes significantly...|$|E
25|$|Resonance of 4 (1994) is a {{collaborative}} music-creation artwork consisting of four adjacent stations, each comprising a small podium bearing a computer mouse, a 16-by-16 grid projected {{onto the floor}} from a video projector above, and a cursor connected to the mouse. Dots can be placed {{in each of the}} grid's cells by clicking with the mouse. A <b>synchronized</b> bar <b>sweeps</b> across all the grids simultaneously, triggering musical notes wherever a dot has been placed. Sound is relayed over a loudspeaker system, and the notes from all four stations are superimposed, although each station has its own musical tone. This work was shown at the Serious Games exhibition at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle in 1996 and 1997 and at the Barbican Arts Centre, London in 1997.|$|R
40|$|Several {{techniques}} are discussed {{which can be}} used to explore laboratory photochemical processes and kinetics relevant to planetary atmospheres; these include time-resolved laser gain-versus-absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) emission studies. The laser gain-versus-absorption method employed tunable diode and F-center lasers to determine the yields of excited photofragments and their kinetics. The time-resolved FTIR technique <b>synchronizes</b> the <b>sweep</b> of a commercial FTIR with a pulsed source of light to obtain emission spectra of novel transient species in the infrared. These methods are presently being employed to investigate molecular photodissociation, the yields of excited states of fragments, their subsequent reaction kinetics, Doppler velocity distributions, and velocity-changing collisions of translationally fast atoms. Such techniques may be employed in future investigations of planetary atmospheres, for example to study polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons related to cometary emissions, to analyze acetylene decomposition products and reactions, and to determine spectral features in the near infrared and infrared wavelength regions for planetary molecules and clusters...|$|R

Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News called the song [...] "one of those polarizing songs, with its Ethel Merman-like <b>synchronized</b> vocal <b>sweeps</b> that do suggest the aquatic, in a 1950s sort of way". Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman labeled the track as a [...] "strikingly beautiful" [...] song. Alex Ross, reporter writing for The New Yorker stated that with [...] "Oceania", Björk [...] "confirmed {{her status as}} the ultimate musical cosmopolitan", acquainted with Karlheinz Stockhausen and the Wu-Tang Clan. Matthew Gasteier from Prefix magazine called the track [...] "the best song on the album", whilst complimenting [...] "its swooping chorus [...] recalls the migration of birds or the time-elapsed drifting of icebergs, a swirl of beauty and power crashing down onto and then rising above the mix. It culminates in the near screech that leads into the sexy-spooky coda". According to Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club, in a positive review, [...] "the electronic flourish strays from her organic vocal focus, but Björk summons {{the same kind of}} tingle with choral language" [...] in the song, [...] "which finds The London Choir reacting to what sounds like a thrilling slow-motion circus act".|$|R
40|$|This report {{introduces}} {{a family of}} <b>synchronized</b> <b>sweep</b> based filtering algorithms for handling scheduling problems involving resource and precedence constraints. The key idea is to filter all constraints of a scheduling problem in a synchronized way in order to scale better. In addition to normal filtering mode, the algorithms can run in greedy mode, in which case they perform a greedy assignment of start and end times. The filtering mode achieves a significant speed-up over the decomposition into independent cumulative and precedence constraints, while the greedy mode can handle up to 1 million tasks with 64 resources constraints and 2 million precedences. These algorithms were implemented in both CHOCO and SICStus. SICSTU...|$|E
40|$|Aim to high {{temporal}} {{resolution of the}} streak image tube in streak camera, the factors which influence the physical temporal dispersion, technical temporal dispersion and time jitter of the sweep circuit were discussed. The streak image tube was optimized, in which a pair of traveling wave deflectors was located before a magnetic solenoid lens. The inner time;varying electric field of traveling wave deflectors was simulated by CST electromagnetic studio. And the propagation velocity of electromagnetic wave was calculated. The results show that when leg length is 8 mm, leg width is 1 mm, interval is 0. 24 mm, pin length is 2. 5 mm, deflector thickness is 1 mm and deflector length is 17. 12 mm, the moving velocity of electrons and propagation velocity of the electromagnetic wave are matching. Based on the electron trajectory tracing method and the Rayleigh criterion, dynamic temporal and spatial characteristics of the streak image tube were analyzed, a dynamic {{temporal resolution}} of 200 fs in single sweep mode, dynamic temporal resolution of 208 fs in <b>synchronized</b> <b>sweep</b> mode, and a dynamic spatial resolution of above 20 lp/mm were obtained. © 2016, Science Press.

40|$|During {{the course}} of an {{evaluation}} of a new series of local anesthetics, the widely recognized limitations of indirect and subjective methods of testing were again apparent. While careful control of the nature and administration of pharmacological agents has been developed to a high degree, a correspondingly rigorous and objective study of the effects of such substances has been largely lacking. Recently, however, Bennett, Wagner, and McIntyre ' have made an important contribution in a study of the effects of local anesthetics on the "A " spike of the action potential of the isolated frog sciatic and arrived at an empirical equation for the evaluation of relative potencies of local anesthetics. The technique to be described here permits examination of the electrical properties of the central and peripheral nervous system, both in vivo and in vitro, under controlled conditions. In particular, observation of the "B " and "C " spike gamut § is possible without the necessity of any unusual precautions. Experience with the use of this technique makes it clear that with a stable amplifier and oscilloscope, a stimulus whose parameters can be precisely controlled, and if the resultant neurogram is synchronized perfectly, reliable and reproducible electrometric correlates of the administration of pharmacological agents can be obtained. Using this type of electrophysiological method a variety of pharmacodynamic studies may be made concerning, for example, local anesthetics, 1, 4 epinephrine, 8 curare, 3 nicotine, 6 veratrine, 7 and the anticholinesterase agents.

An airborne telephotometric device (haze recorder) is now being constructed at the Boston University Physical Research Laboratory to collect the data necessary {{for a study of}} atmospheric haze. It is expected that this present study will indicate the existence of correlations between haze light intensity and parameters significant in aerial photography. The purpose of this thesis is the provide an operational plan including data reduction and preliminary analysis for the first exploratory test flights. 	The haze recorder is being constructed to measure up-welling light intensity in a narrow path from horizon through nadir to horizon. The plane of this sweep rotates in 450 intervals relative to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and a filter wheel <b>synchronized</b> with the <b>sweep</b> from horizon to horizon passes light alternately through blue, green, and red filters. Thus a three-dimensional plot of up-welling light is formed for each of three spectral ranges. A photomultiplier tube transforms this intensity into an electrical signal which, after amplification, is displayed on an oscilloscope tube and photographed. 	[TRUNCATED...|$|R
