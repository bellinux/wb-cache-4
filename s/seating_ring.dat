25|$|The 12-inch/40 calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 gun was {{a typical}} {{built-up}} French heavy gun of its period. It used a Welin interrupted-screw breech and bagged propellant with a de Bange obturator {{to get a good}} gas seal during firing. It was mounted in twin-gun turrets which had a couple of unusual features. First, most of the turret's operating machinery was housed inside the turret, with only an armored tube to protect the ammunition hoists. This made little difference in the overall weight of the turret, but did raise the machinery higher in the ship than the turrets of other nations, which did have implications for stability. Secondly, they used a hydraulic pivot to lift the turret when it rotated; this was lowered onto a <b>seating</b> <b>ring</b> when the turret was in the proper position to fire. Each turret had a nominal 300° of traverse, although each ship had its own specific limitations.|$|E
5000|$|German Scharfschützen were {{prepared}} before the war, equipped with Karabiner 98 and later Gewehr 43 rifles, {{but there were}} often not enough of these weapons available, and as such some were armed with captured scoped Mosin-Nagant 1891/30, SVT or Czech Mauser rifles. The Wehrmacht re-established its sniper training in 1942, drastically {{increasing the number of}} snipers per unit with the creation of an additional 31 sniper training companies by 1944. German snipers were at the time the only snipers in the world issued with purpose-manufactured sniping ammunition, known as the 'effect-firing' sS round. The 'effect-firing' sS round featured an extra carefully measured propellant charge and seated a heavy 12.8 gram (198 gr) full-metal-jacketed boat-tail projectile of match-grade build quality, lacking usual features such as a <b>seating</b> <b>ring</b> to improve the already high ballistic coefficient of [...]584 (G1) further. For aiming optics German snipers used the Zeiss Zielvier 4x (ZF39) telescopic sight which had bullet drop compensation in 50 m increments for ranges from 100 m up to 800 m or in some variations from 100 m up to 1000 m or 1200 m. There were ZF42, Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4), Zeiss Zielsechs 6x and other telescopic sights by various manufacturers like the Ajack 4x, Hensoldt Dialytan 4x and Kahles Heliavier 4x with similar features employed on German sniper rifles. Several different mountings produced by various manufacturers were used for mounting aiming optics to the rifles. In February 1945 the Zielgerät 1229 active infrared aiming device was issued for night sniping with the StG 44 assault rifle.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> {{provides}} a stable, uniform and replaceable shut off surface. Seat are usually screwed in or torqued [...] This pushes the cage {{down on the}} lip of the seat and holds it firmly to the body of the valve. Seat may also be threaded and screwed into a thread cut in the same area of the body. However this method makes removal of the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> during maintenance difficult if not impossible. <b>Seat</b> <b>rings</b> are also typically beveled at the seating surface to allow for some guiding during the final stages of closing the valve.|$|R
40|$|A {{control valve}} that can {{throttle}} high-pressure cryogenic fluid embodies several design features that distinguish it over conventional valves designed for similar applications. Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> contracts more than the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|R
40|$|Intake and {{exhaust valves}} {{operating}} in diesel engines for naval propulsion suffer from several problems {{due to the}} combined and synergistic effects of mechanical stresses and a chemically harsh environment. Degradation mechanisms like wear and corrosion act on different sections of the valve, {{with the result that}} each part undergoes a different kind of damage. The present work particularly focuses on degradation phenomena such as low temperature corrosion and erosive wear on the stem; hot corrosion {{on the bottom of the}} head of the valve; wear on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> In order to prevent the valves from degrading, a possible solution is the application of protective coatings that may extend the service life of the components by preserving the mechanical properties of substrate materials, while improving the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the surface. The objective of this study is the development, testing and optimization of a system of corrosion and wear resistant coatings for the stem, bottom and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of the valves. The analysis of the degradation mechanisms occurring on each section of the valves led to the selection of materials that could be suitable for the protection of the substrate. Specifically, two different kinds of ceramic-metallic coatings were selected for the protection of the stem and the bottom of the valves, while a modification of the state-of-the art coating applied on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> was performed...|$|R
40|$|Pelton turbine is {{an engine}} that {{facilitates}} continuous {{power as a}} wheel or a rotor continually turns due to the pressure of fast moving water through the bucket, where a bucket receives water from the surging nozzle. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume, bucket angle attack, nozzle needle <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> and nozzle needle seat tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University. The comparative study among the different parameters shows that the value of maximum efficiency was 21. 65 %, which was obtained at 90 ° needle <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> and 45 ° needle seat tip, and + 15 % bucket size and 92 ° angle of attack. It was gained likely due to the lightness of the + 15 % bucket compared to the standard bucket and the collision produced by the jet water {{in the middle of the}} bucket, in which the water loading occupied the large area on the surface of the bucket and promoted the increasing speed. It is expected that the result on the appropriate size and angle attack of bucket at specific nozzle <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> and <b>seat</b> tip of this experiment can be manufactured commercially in the future for achieving maximum Pelton turbine efficiency...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lapping {{process is}} {{characterized}} by its low speed, low pressure, and low material removal rate. This process is used in achieving finer surfaces and closer fits, correction of minor imperfections, and maintaining close tolerances. During the process of lapping, the mechanisms of surface formation and removal rate are decisively influenced by the movement type of the individual grains within the lapping abrasive. A gate valve is used to start and {{stop the flow of}} fluid. So the wedge and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of a valve are in continuous pressure of fluid flow and due to opening and closing of valve these component get wear and they need lapping during reconditioning. This paper will share the need, requirement and application of lapping during the reconditioning of valve. This paper will explore the current working condition of lapping machine in valve industry. It will elaborate the effect of abrasive particals, working speed, surface roughness and other related parameters. What are the difficulties they are facing during the valve reconditioning related to lapping, will be disscussed. Current set up and the changes required in this model are suggested with the proposed model. Key words: Lapping process, wedge, <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> abrasive particles. I...|$|R
