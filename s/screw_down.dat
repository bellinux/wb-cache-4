25|$|The typical {{passenger}} service {{consisted of}} two trains per day each way between Owen Sound and Toronto; {{there was only one}} return trip each day from Teeswater to Orangeville. Orangeville had three trains a day to and from Toronto. Freight traffic over the Caledon Hills and the heights near Dundalk required powerful 4-6-0 and 2-8-0 locomotives, which seem to have handled the traffic comfortably, although trains often had to be divided between Mono Road and Charleston (Caledon). The small narrow-gauge engines were able to cope with normal winter weather, but there were major blockages of the line in the 'snowbelt' country above Orangeville, which sometimes closed the line for several weeks. The TG was sometimes unable, for many months, to pay the overtime wages for manually clearing these drifts. There were few public accidents, but a severe toll of industrial fatalities to the operating staff. The most dangerous job was Brakesman, with many young men being crippled or killed when walking along the tops of vehicles to manually <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> brakes, and when manually coupling cars using the highly dangerous link-and-pin couplers. The worst incident on the TG occurred at Arthur when a passenger was killed, by shots fired at a train crew, by drunken members of the Orange Order on July 12 1872.|$|E

60|$|One of {{the first}} topics on which I heard {{conversation}} turning in America {{was that of a}} very interesting book called Main Street, which involves many of these questions of the modern industrial and the eternal feminine. It is simply the story, or perhaps rather the study than the story, of a young married woman in one of the multitudinous little towns on the great central plains of America; and of a sort of struggle between her own more restless culture and the provincial prosperity of her neighbours. There are a number of true and telling suggestions in the book, but the one touch which I found tingling in the memory of many readers was the last sentence, in which the master of the house, with unshaken simplicity, merely asks for the whereabouts of some domestic implement; I think it was a screw-driver. It seems to me a harmless request, but from the way people talked about it one might suppose he had asked for a screw-driver to <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> the wife in her coffin. And a great many advanced persons would tell us that wooden house in which she lived really was like a wooden coffin. But this appears to me to be taking a somewhat funereal view of the life of humanity.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the {{sarcophagus}} started on May 20, 1986, 24 days after the disaster. Subsequent construction lasted for 206 days, from June to late November of the same year. The first task before construction started was to build a cooling slab under the reactor to prevent the hot nuclear fuel from burning {{a hole in the}} base. Coal miners were called up to dig the necessary tunnel below the reactor and by June 24, 1986 four hundred coal miners had dug the 168 m long tunnel. When the building became overly radioactive, it became impossible to directly <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> the nuts and bolts or apply any direct welding to the sarcophagus, so this work was done by robots. The seams of the sarcophagus, however, were not properly sealed.|$|E
50|$|Analog diving watches {{must have}} a water {{resistant}} crown. Some models have the crown mounted in unconventional positions like 4, 8 or 9 o'clock to avert or reduce discomfort from the crown touching the wearers (left) wrist or back of the hand. Often the crown has to be unscrewed to set or adjust the time and date and afterwards retightened to restore the water resistance of the watch and minimize the chance of unintentional operation under water. There are also watch models where a locking handle, separate knob or an extra crown cover has to be manipulated before the crown can be operated. There are however models that have crowns that are operated like the crowns of non diver's analog watches. <b>Screw</b> <b>down</b> or otherwise locking crowns and traditionally operated water resistant crowns can not be operated under water.|$|E

50|$|Driver Axon {{told his}} Fireman Scanlon {{to jump off}} and attempt to apply wagon brakes but, due to the speed the train was travelling, he only managed to apply a few before the train reached the summit and began {{accelerating}} down the 1 in 58 gradient towards Chapel-en-le-Frith. As {{the crew of the}} banking engine reached the summit to let the train continue under its own power, they were alarmed to see Axon's train accelerating away from them, and the guard frantically applying the brakes to his van.At the time of the locomotive failure, Driver Axon could have jumped clear of the then slow-moving train. However, aware of the danger that his train posed to life further down the line, he stayed with his accelerating train despite the scalding steam on the footplate, trying to close the regulator in the hope that this would mitigate the effects of a collision. In the end, he only managed to partly close it, and <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> the engine's tender brakes, but sadly this had negligible effect.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{passenger}} service {{consisted of}} two trains per day each way between Midland Junction (Lorneville) and Toronto; one of these trains extended to Coboconk; {{there was only one}} return trip each day from Sutton to Stouffville. The small narrow-gauge engines were able to cope with normal winter weather, but there was no money for snow clearing after severe storms and Gooderham and Worts sometimes paid for this work in order to maintain their distillery fuel supplies. Sometimes it took a month to clear the line with manual labour. There were few public accidents, but a severe toll of industrial fatalities to the operating staff. The most dangerous job was Brakesman, with many young men being crippled or killed when walking along the tops of vehicles to manually <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> brakes, and when manually coupling cars using the highly dangerous link and pin couplers. The worst accident occurred when the boiler of the Fairlie engine Shedden (see illustration above) exploded at Stouffville on January 31, 1874 due to the safety valves being tied down to increase haulage power, killing three enginemen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Screw</b> <b>Down</b> System (SDS) is {{a typical}} {{hydraulic}} servo control system. It is the key actuator of cold rolling mill. The dynamic performance of SDS has {{a significant effect on}} the accuracy of thickness. Hydraulic servo control system is not always optimal and stable due to highly nonlinear and parameter uncertainties. In this paper, the most important nonlinear relating flow and pressure is analyzed. A nonlinear self-adaptive compensation method is designed. Modeling and simulating the hydraulic servo control system of SDS using this method, the numerical simulation results show that the maximum overshoot and static error of the compensated system are more less than that of without nonlinear compensation. The overshoot of the compensated system is less than 10 % when the cold strip is rolling. So the thickness tolerance of the cold strip can be guaranteed easily. This self- adaptive compensation method can be used to other hydraulic servo control systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{biofouling}} resistant coatings of hydrogel {{containing the}} cationic surfactants benzalkonium chloride and Arquad 2 C- 75 both extended the fouling free period in marine temperate waters. In {{the case of}} BAC the coating stayed clean for 10 - 12 weeks and the Arquad 2 C- 75 for 12 - 14 weeks. Due to the longer life of the hydrogel containing the Arquad 2 C- 75 instrument trials were carried out using this material. An effective method of attaching the coatings to the optical and membrane ports of sensors was developed and allows the coating to be either held in either a <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> or bolted polymer ring. The diffusion coefficient of cationic surfactants in seawater is reduced compared to diffusion coefficients in freshwater. In seawater the diffusion coefficient of benzalkonium chloride {{was found to be}} 2. 44 x 10 - 6 cm 2 s- 1 compared to 7. 78 x 10 - 6 cm 2 s- 1 in distilled water at 25 °C. Careful choice of gas permeable membrane can result in a slightly longer biofouling lifetime, but only by 1 - 2 weeks. At 6 weeks all gas permeable membranes had significant fouling which affected their gas permeability. The diffusion rates of ammonia gas, a gas commonly measured in the sea, through PTFE gas sensor membranes varied between PTFE manufacturers with flux measurements ranging from 0. 05 - 1131 µg cm- 2 h- 1. In addition to the hydrogel testing on instruments within this project a variety of external research groups and environmental agencies are currently testing the hydrogels on their instrumental ports.
