25|$|Using {{techniques}} of seismic sequence stratigraphy the English Permo-Triassic megasequence {{can be divided}} into three sequences bounded at the top and base by local or regional unconformities. Construction of a seismic sequence stratigraphy allows the examination of the interaction of tectonics and sedimentation. On this basis the Cheshire Basin can be divided roughly into two areas - a westerly area close to the western basin margin and an easterly area nearer to the Carboniferous WEM / Red Rock Fault. The Red Rock fault - really a group of faults, is the name given locally to one which happens to throw Carboniferous and Permo-Triassic rocks together. It runs north - south a trend followed by the Kirkleyditch and the Alderley faults.. <b>Seismic</b> <b>interpretation</b> shows that deposition in the western area was essentially post-rift - resulting in packages of parallel reflectors on seismic data.|$|E

In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from <b>seismic</b> <b>interpretation</b> associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted vitrinite map, integrated with all data, indicates that the Coquinas source rock {{in most of the}} eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of transformation ratio, the Barremian and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are. The charge and accumulation simulation model for the pre-salt province suggests a potential reserve in the Cluster area of Santos Basin much larger than that reported, getting numbers to 60 billion barrels of oil reserves.|$|E

5000|$|The goal of <b>seismic</b> <b>interpretation</b> is {{to obtain}} a {{coherent}} geological story from the map of processed seismic reflections. [...] At its most simple level, <b>seismic</b> <b>interpretation</b> involves tracing and correlating along continuous reflectors throughout the 2D or 3D dataset and using these {{as the basis for}} the geological interpretation. The aim of this is to produce structural maps that reflect the spatial variation in depth of certain geological layers. Using these maps hydrocarbon traps can be identified and models of the subsurface can be created that allow volume calculations to be made. However, a seismic dataset rarely gives a picture clear enough to do this. This is mainly because of the vertical and horizontal seismic resolution but often noise and processing difficulties also result in a lower quality picture. Due to this, there is always a degree of uncertainty in a <b>seismic</b> <b>interpretation</b> and a particular dataset could have more than one solution that fits the data. In such a case, more data will be needed to constrain the solution, for example in the form of further seismic acquisition, borehole logging or gravity and magnetic survey data. Similarly to the mentality of a seismic processor, a seismic interpreter is generally encouraged to be optimistic in order encourage further work rather than the abandonment of the survey area. [...] <b>Seismic</b> <b>interpretation</b> is completed by both geologists and geophysicists, with most seismic interpreters having an understanding of both fields.|$|E

30|$|As {{predicted}} by Fitch (1972), prevailing oblique subduction upon the ancient forearc region may have provoked {{the development of}} a bisecting transcurrent fault parallel to the trench axis.

40|$|The recent {{research}} domain of asteroseismology studies the internal structure of stars, {{which is not}} directly observable, through {{the interpretation of the}} frequency spectra of stellar oscillations.

Cyclic CO{sub 2 } stimulations and model designed frac treatments will be used to increase and facilitate oil recovery to improve project economics. The detailed reservoir characterization will be used to create a geological model for use in simulation to arrive at an optimum operating plan to be instituted during the second budget period. Objectives to be accomplished during the third quarter include: (1) Complete petrophysical description on cores from observation wells. (2) Apply petrophysical data to geologic model.
