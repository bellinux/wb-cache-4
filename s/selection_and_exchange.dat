40|$|DNA {{replication}} {{is constantly}} challenged by DNA lesions, noncanonical DNA structures and difficult-to-replicate DNA sequences. Two major strategies {{to rescue a}} stalled replication fork and to ensure continuous DNA synthesis are: (1) template switching and recombination-dependent DNA synthesis; and (2) translesion synthesis (TLS) using specialized DNA polymerases to perform nucleotide incorporation opposite DNA lesions. The former pathway is mainly error-free, and the latter is error-prone and {{a major source of}} mutagenesis. An accepted model of translesion synthesis involves DNA polymerase switching steps between a replicative DNA polymerase and one or more TLS DNA polymerases.

40|$|Farmers‟ rice seed selection, {{acquisition}} and exchange practices, {{and their relationship}} with management of on-farm rice varietal diversity, were studied in two contrasting agro-ecosystems in Nepal. Data came from 135 households using questionnaires, focus group discussions and direct field observations. Seed selection is primarily for maintenance of productivity and purity of a variety. The rigor applied to selection is inversely related to access to quality seed from outside sources. Excluding native varieties with religious or ceremonial values, seed selection procedures for native and modern varieties (MVs) do not differ. Farmers‟ seed selection practices are influenced by whether a variety, be it a native or modern (MV) is grown by many or few farmers, is grown on large or small land areas, on any morphological heterogeneity or an abundance of off-types within the variety and its cultural and religious use. Farmers perceive that varieties and seed batches {{need to be changed}} frequently on a given plot of land to maintain a stable yield. Poorer households often lack resources for rigorous seed selection compared to resource-endowed households. Women {{play a significant role in}} seed <b>selection</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> of genetic materials. Farmers mainly rely on informal networks for seeds but they do also acquire seeds from formal sources and the market. The number of nodal or key seeds sourced by farmers within informal networks is linked to the level of fragmentation of the network. Supporting the on-farm production of quality seeds of native local varieties, increases access to genetic diversity of local crops through seed fairs and community level gene-banks. Elevating the image of native varieties as an important local resource for food, security and sustainable agriculture are recommended as actions to improve the use and conservation of on-farm crop genetic diversity...|$|E

40|$|This study {{critically}} {{explores the}} relationships amongst the global, national, continental and alternative news agencies in South Africa {{and in a}} changing global context of news. It revisits previous studies’ findings on imbalances in global flows {{with a view to}} extending and updating these case studies. An extended-case study approach employing in-depth, open-ended interviews with news agency participants based primarily in South Africa and with the Pan African News Agency in Senegal is undertaken. The study postulates that news agencies do not operate independently of the broader external social environment. News agencies are influenced by changes in the global news environment and impacted upon by socio-economic, political and cultural processes and relations amongst nations. The main findings include firstly, that “intermediary changes” described as “adaptive strategies” at news agencies result from internal and external pressures on their operations of news production, selection and distribution. Internal pressures are identified as changes in ownership, and the gate-keeping function in the <b>selection</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> of news. External pressures are associated with the processes and relations of market-based global capitalism, which, it is theorized, gives rise to changing conditions described as a new phase of neo-liberal globalisation. Another finding related to the first, describes the adaptive strategies at news agencies as signifying a crisis in the global capitalist order and a transition to a post-industrial society. This post-industrial society presents the space for further investigation of the phenomenon of global consciousness, which is a further finding of the study. The prevalence of an alternative form of news production, citizens’ journalism, is seen as an example of an emerging public realm of opinion making, or, the public sphere. The study concludes that explanations for the persistence of imbalances in global news flows in the relationships among news agencies needs revision and updating, and that a global phenomenon, “global consciousness”, presents a challenge to the extreme market forces and the statist government control over media systems worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Background: Traditional agrosystems are {{the places}} were crop species have evolved and {{continue}} to evolve under a combination of human and environmental pressures. A better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of crop diversity in these agrosystems is crucial to sustain food security and farmers’ self-reliance. It requires as a first step, anchoring {{a description of the}} available diversity in its geographical, environmental, cultural and socio-economic context. [br/] Methods: We conducted interviews with farmers cultivating durum wheat in two contrasted traditional agrosystems of Morocco in the Pre-Rif (163 farmers) and in the oases of the Atlas Mountains (110 farmers). We documented the varietal diversity of durum wheat, the main characteristics of the farms, the farming and seed management practices applied to durum wheat, and the farmers’ perception of their varieties. [br/] Results: As expected in traditional agrosystems, farmers largely practiced diversified subsistence agriculture on small plots and relied on on-farm seed production or informal seed exchange networks. Heterogeneity nevertheless prevailed on many variables, especially on the modernization of practices in the Pre-Rif region. Fourteen (resp. 11) traditional and 5 (resp. 3) modern varieties were identified in the Pre-Rif region (resp. in the Atlas Mountains). The majority of farmers grew a single variety, and most traditional varieties were distributed in restricted geographical areas. At the farm level, {{more than half of the}} varieties were renewed in the last decade in the Pre-Rif, a more rapid renewal than in the Atlas Mountain. Modern varieties were more prevalent in the Pre-Rif region and were integrated in the traditional practices of seed production, <b>selection</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange.</b> They were clearly distinguished by the farmers from the landraces, the last ones being appreciated for their quality traits. [br/] Conclusions: The surveyed traditional agrosystems constitute open, dynamic and heterogeneous entities. We suggest that competing factors could favour or limit the cultivation of improved varieties and the erosion of original durum wheat diversity. This first description opens the way to focused further investigations, including complementing variety names with cultural, genetic and phenotypic information and unravelling the multidimensional factors and consequences of modern variety adoption...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{adaptive}} {{divergence between}} populations of a widespread amphibian across its entire elevational distribution which {{is characterized by}} both strong divergent selection and high gene flow, two opposing evolutionary forces. It shows that gene flow opposes divergent selection, but is {{not strong enough to}} prevent the evolution of genetic divergence and adaptation to elevation. Four evolutionary forces influence genetic divergence between populations: Divergent selection, gene flow, random genetic drift and mutation. Whereas the two latter are random processes, divergent selection and gene flow have opposite impacts on genetic divergence. The differentiation of populations that encounter both strong divergent <b>selection</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> many alleles depends on the interplay between divergent selection and gene flow: if gene flow overrules divergent selection, phenotypic differences between populations are caused by phenotypic plasticity. Another important factor is the spatial scale across which the species is distributed in relation to the dispersal distance, this defines the grain of underlying environmental change and influences both divergent selection and gene flow between selective environments. In this thesis, I study divergence across the elevational distribution in the common frog (Rana temporaria). The grain of the environmental change between populations at different elevations is high and there is ample gene flow across the gradient, making this system a steep environmental gradient and ideal to study the evolution of genetic divergence in the face of gene flow. R. temporaria has been intensively studied across the latitudinal gradient, an environmental gradient which spans about the same temperature range on a larger spatial scale and has less gene flow between selective environments. This is a great contrast to the elevational gradient. First, I established how much genetic divergence exists across the elevational gradient, by raising tadpoles that originated from different elevations under common lab conditions. This revealed that genetic divergence evolved. The predominant pattern is countergradient variation, where growth and development rates are higher at the cold end of the environmental gradient. A comparison to the latitudinal gradient, showed that divergence is much weaker across elevation. These results suggest that gene flow is reducing the response to divergent selection by introducing alleles adaptive to other habitats. I then investigated if the divergence is adaptive by carrying out a reciprocal transplant experiment. Tadpoles originating from 500 m and above 2000 m of elevation were raised at four ponds at their home elevation and four ponds that differed in about 1800 m in elevation, which allowed to test adaptation to elevation and adaptation to the pond of origin. Tadpoles performed better at their home elevation, but not at their home pond suggesting that divergence across is indeed adaptive with respect to elevation. Third, I studied the physiological causes of countergradient variation. Tadpoles require more energy to achieve high growth and development rates. One hypothesis is that a higher resting metabolic rate provides higher rates of instantaneous energy releases provided for growth. This is indeed the case, there is divergence in resting metabolic rate and tadpoles from high elevations have higher metabolic needs, supporting the so-called metabolic cold adaptation hypothesis. This thesis established adaptive genetic divergence across elevation in a widespread amphibian and shows that adaptation is constrained by high gene flow despite strong divergent selection...|$|E

30|$|Rice landraces {{have been}} shaped by the interplay between {{adaptation}} to the local environment <b>and</b> <b>selection</b> imposed by farmers who determine which varieties will be grown each year. This {{is in contrast to}} wild rice populations, which proliferate based on their ability to survive and compete under natural conditions. Natural populations tend to be more stable than cultivars in their geographic distributions because the forces of natural selection generally lead to gradual changes over evolutionary time. Several studies carried out on wild rice populations in China have characterized the local diversity of Oryza rufipogon and found varying degrees of differentiation within and between local populations (Song et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2006; Zhou et al. 2003). In contrast, the accelerated evolution provided by intense artificial <b>selection</b> <b>and</b> seed <b>exchanges</b> among local farmers has led to dramatic changes in the genetics of cultivated crops in a relatively short time frame (< 10, 000  years). While the story of rice domestication is still being unraveled based on interpretations of geographic and phylogenetic data (Caicedo et al. 2007; Londo et al. 2006) and analysis of cloned domestication genes (Kovach et al. 2007; Sweeney et al. 2007), it appears that rice was domesticated from diverse gene pools and that gene flow among sub-populations and with wild ancestral populations has created a complex series of events leading to the modern day fabric of rice diversity (Sang and Ge 2007; Sweeney and McCouch 2007), although the possibility of a single domestication event is still debated (Gao and Innan 2008; Vaughan et al. 2008). While the relationships between the earliest domesticates and indigenous landraces surviving in rice-growing regions today are still unclear, signatures of shared ancestry, <b>selection,</b> <b>and</b> introgression are written in the genomes of traditional varieties. Over many generations, rice has become an essential component of the local cultures and customs of rice-growing people across Asia, where rice cultivation has been practiced for thousands of years. Yet there is still a great deal to learn concerning the impact of farmer practices on the preservation, <b>exchange,</b> <b>and</b> continuing evolution of traditional landraces today.

We concur with MTIT findings that conformance testing method-ologies for evaluating the semantic content of minutia templates is essential and inter-operability can be improved by closer adherence to the minutia placement requirement defined in a standard. ...|$|R
40|$|Manioc is an {{important}} root crop in the tropics {{and the most important}} staple food in the Amazon. Manioc is diverse but its diversity has not yet been clearly associated with environmental or social factors. Our study evaluates how variation in edaphic environments and in social factors influences manioc diversity among five ethnic groups of the Amazon region of Colombia. Inventories of landraces, genetic analysis of manioc diversity, visits to farmers’ swiddens and interviews with farmers were carried out during two years of field work. Morphotypic and genotypic diversity of manioc were large. The different ethnic groups of our study cultivate different sweet and bitter manioc landraces which they select and maintain in accordance with their ancestral rules and norms. Differences in available environments among indigenous communities (such as the presence of different soils) did not markedly affect manioc morphotypic or genotypic diversity, while social factors considerably influenced observed manioc diversity. Manioc diversity was explained by two parallel processes of manioc diversification: volunteer seedling <b>selection</b> <b>and</b> manioc seed <b>exchange.</b> We argue that, for a full understanding of manioc diversity, indigenous knowledge, as well as morphological and genetic variation should be taken into account...|$|R
