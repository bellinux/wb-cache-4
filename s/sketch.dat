40|$|This paper {{describes}} the vital role of freehand <b>sketching</b> {{in the design}} process. When designers first tackle a design problem they usually do so by <b>sketching.</b> We will explore the essential elements of <b>sketching</b> that make it so helpful to problem solving.

40|$|<b>Sketching</b> is a {{probabilistic}} {{data compression}} technique {{that has been}} largely developed in the computer science community. Numerical operations on big datasets can be intolerably slow; <b>sketching</b> algorithms address this issue by generating a smaller surrogate dataset. Typically, inference proceeds on the compressed dataset. <b>Sketching</b> algorithms generally use random projections to compress the original dataset and this stochastic generation process makes them amenable to statistical analysis. We argue that the <b>sketched</b> data can be modelled as a random sample, thus placing this family of data compression methods firmly within an inferential framework. In particular, {{we focus on the}} Gaussian, Hadamard and Clarkson-Woodruff <b>sketches,</b> and their use in single pass <b>sketching</b> algorithms for linear regression with huge n. We explore the statistical properties of <b>sketched</b> regression algorithms and derive new distributional results for a large class of <b>sketched</b> estimators. We develop confidence intervals for <b>sketching</b> estimators and bounds on the relative efficiency of different <b>sketching</b> algorithms. An important finding is that the best choice of <b>sketching</b> algorithm in terms of mean square error is related to the signal to noise ratio in the source dataset. Finally, we demonstrate the theory and the limits of its applicability on two real datasets...|$|R

This discussion considers three categories of sketch: thinking <b>sketches,</b> used to focus and guide non-verbal thinking; talking <b>sketches,</b> employed to support discussion of the design with colleagues; and prescriptive <b>sketches,</b> which give instructions to the draftsman in charge of making the finished drawing. 1...|$|R
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the <b>sketch</b> went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T.

He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E

30|$|For {{the section}} on <b>sketching,</b> {{students}} were asked about their level of agreement {{with a variety of}} statements on the utility of the <b>sketching</b> instruction during the latter, non-sketching focused, portions of the course. The <b>sketching</b> survey data, which are collected immediately after the 6 -week <b>sketching</b> portion of the course, revealed that students in the two instructional setting conditions and in the two instructor experience level conditions had largely different perceptions of the <b>sketching</b> instruction itself. But on these items about later utility of the <b>sketching</b> instruction, minimal differences in student perceptions were seen. Overall, these results indicate that, for the most part, these differential experiences during the actual <b>sketching</b> instructions did not translate into differential perceptions of how the <b>sketching</b> instruction served students during the remainder of the course.|$|R
50|$|He was {{attracted}} towards drawing and <b>sketching.</b> He <b>sketched</b> the portraits of many {{persons in the}} family.

40|$|ABSTRACT- This paper {{explores the}} <b>sketching</b> {{behavior}} of designers {{and the role}} of <b>sketching</b> in the design process. Observations from a descriptive study of <b>sketches</b> provided in design journals, characterized by a protocol measuring <b>sketching</b> activities, are presented. A distinction is made between journals that are entirely tangible and those that contain some digitally-produced content (“hybrid journals”). The trend between 2004 and 2006 is an increase in both the average number of <b>sketches</b> {{as well as in the}} percentage of 3 D <b>sketches</b> for hybrid journals. In 2004, tangible journals exhibited a higher average number of <b>sketches</b> over hybrid journals in the user needs and conceptual design stages, but this trend reversed in 2006 where hybrid journals favored more <b>sketches</b> at all design stages. Text was the predominant form of annotation used (ranging from 62 - 98 %), as opposed to dimensions or calculations for both journal types. The industrial design students had significantly more <b>sketches</b> overall and a higher percentage of 3 D <b>sketches.</b> They also tended to annotate more in hybrid journals over tangible journals.

5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series.

The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each <b>sketch,</b> examining some antique, are always played by the same two actors. The <b>sketch</b> parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists.

30|$|Significantly {{higher levels}} of {{agreement}} were reported by veteran instructor group students as compared to control group students for the following aspects/outcomes of the <b>sketching</b> instruction: improved communication with <b>sketches,</b> improved creativity, being a good use of time, increased confidence in <b>sketching</b> ability, serving students well in later engineering courses, usefulness of peer feedback, <b>sketching</b> more frequently in the future, improved visualization skills, and enjoying the <b>sketching</b> instruction. And students in the new instructor group found feedback from their TAs to be significantly more helpful than did students in the veteran instructor group. So students across sections provided favorable opinions about the <b>sketching</b> instruction, but on most aspects, veteran <b>sketching</b> instructor group students provided significantly more favorable opinions than did new instructor group students.|$|R

5|$|An oil <b>sketch</b> {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and Pleasure, and considers it more likely to be a preliminary <b>sketch</b> for a now-unknown work.|$|E

He had exhibited a <b>sketch</b> in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
