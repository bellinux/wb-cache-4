50|$|As with bit rate, the {{standards}} describe several optical power budgets, most common is 28 dB of loss budget for both BPON and GPON, but products have been announced using less expensive optics as well. 28 dB corresponds to about 20 km with a 32-way split. Forward error correction (FEC) may provide for another 2-3 dB of loss budget on GPON systems. As optics improve, the 28 dB budget will likely increase. Although both the GPON and EPON protocols permit large split ratios (up to 128 subscribers for GPON, up to 32,768 for EPON), in practice most PONs are deployed with a <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1:32 or smaller.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fast load {{balancing}} {{is of the}} highest importance to utilize the resources effectively and improve {{the performance of the}} Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) enabled Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Load balancing splits a part of traffic called <b>splitting</b> <b>ratio</b> from the maximum loaded path in to minimum loaded path. One very strong constrain in balancing the load is the tradeoff between the delay to reach the balanced state and the oscillations generated by splitting the load at the balanced state. To avoid oscillations, the <b>splitting</b> <b>ratio</b> must be kept small. However, smaller <b>splitting</b> <b>ratio</b> takes more number of iterations to balance the load. To overcome this constrain in this study, an enhanced variable <b>splitting</b> <b>ratio</b> based algorithm was proposed to reduce the delay without oscillations. The <b>splitting</b> <b>ratio</b> was varied depending upon the difference between the maximum path load and the minimum path load.

5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A traffic {{engineering}} problem consists {{of setting up}} paths between the edge nodes of the network to meet traffic demands while optimizing the network performance. It is known that total traffic throughput in a network, hence the resource utilization, can be maximized if the traffic demand is split over multiple paths. However, the problem formulation and practical algorithms, which calculate the paths and the traffic <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> taking the route constraints or policies into consideration, have not been much touched. This paper proposes practical algorithms that find near optimal paths satisfying the given traffic demand under constraints such as maximum hop count, and preferred or notpreferred node/link list. The mixed integer programming formulation also calculates the traffic <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> for the multiple paths. The problems are solved with the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> of continuous or discrete values. However, the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> solved with discrete values (0. 1, 0. 2 etc.) {{are more suitable for}} easy implementation at the network nodes.

The paths and <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> are calculated off-line, and passed to MPLS edge routers for explicit label-switched path (LSP) setup.

40|$|Numerous applications, such as meso-scale heat exchangers, Lab-on-Chip devices (LOC), {{different}} systems within pharmaceutical and food industry, monodispersed emulsion {{and several other}} microfluidic systems, include two-phase flow through a meso-scale T-junction. When two-phase gas-liquid flow passes through an asymmetric meso-scale T-junction, a mal-distribution occurs. The phenomenon has proven itself to be unavoidable in most cases. In some applications this phenomenon can put the operational system at risk, while in other applications it is actually preferred. The phenomenon is still far from thoroughly understood. Thus {{the objective of this}} thesis is to further investigate this mal-distribution phenomenon. <b>Split</b> <b>ratio</b> for plug flow at a meso-scale T-junction has been investigated. A model for prediction of the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> has been proposed. Physical ingredients for determination of the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> have been focused upon. Much of the conducted work is based on findings in the MSc thesis by Hong et al. (2011) who proved the importance of the bubble length when predicting the <b>split</b> <b>ratio.</b> <b>Split</b> <b>ratio,</b> bubble length and pressure has been measured through experimentation. The T-junction used in the conducted experiments has a main channel, referred to simply as the &# 147;main&# 148;. It is connected in a straight line with one outlet referred to as the &# 147;run&# 148;. The second outlet is connected perpendicularly to the main and the run, and {{is referred to as the}} &# 147;branch&# 148;. All channels have a square shaped cross section with a hydraulic diameter of. Water and air was used as working fluids. For all conducted experiments the flow field took on a plug flow pattern. The branch channel has been observed to be rich in gas for all cases, except when the flow rate in the run is high. The flux in the main also has to be low to reduce the viscous drag forces between the two phases and the inertial forces of the plug. For increasingly high total flow rate in the run, a turning point has been located. When the flow rate exceeds this point the run becomes rich in gas. In both extreme cases (high flow rate in the run and in the branch) separation occurs for sufficiently short bubbles. The occurrence of separation is also highly dependent on the total flux in the main. To retain separation the surface tension has to overcome the viscous drag forces acting on the interface between the two phases. In the centre regime, where bubbles always break up and a plug flow pattern occurs in both outlets, the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> shows a strict relation to the bubble length. This strict relation between the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> and the bubble length were also concluded upon in the MSc thesis by Hong et al. (2011). In the defined centre regime changes in superficial velocities showed to have a negligible effect on the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> in comparison to variation in the bubble length. Long bubbles yields a <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> located closest to perfect distribution. Decreasing the bubble length yields an increase in the void fraction (gas) in the branch. A model for prediction of the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> has been proposed. It is primarily valid within the centre regime, and is based on the time and area averaged Bernoulli equation. The model takes the bubble length into account, and predicts the <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> on the main assumption that an increased amount of energy is lost to friction and separation as the fraction of water in the branch is increased. This while keeping the total fluxes in each of the outlets constant. An anticipated trend has been located through evaluating the model against experimental data. Therefore the model has been concluded upon to be physically sound. </p...|$|E

The gluconate tracer method was used with a penicillin G-producing chemostat culture of the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. For comparison, a 13 C-labeling-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA) was performed for glycolysis and the PPP of P. chrysogenum. For the first time mass isotopomer measurements of 13 C-labeled primary metabolites are reported for P. chrysogenum and used for a 13 C-based MFA. Estimation of the PPP <b>split</b> <b>ratio</b> of P. chrysogenum at a growth rate of 0. 02 h 1 yielded comparable values for the gluconate tracer method and the 13 C-based MFA method, 51. 8 % and 51. 1 %, respectively.

We propose and study a Half-Duplex (HD) solution to avoid the RB disturbance and analyze the different scenarios of reach and <b>splitting</b> <b>ratios.</b> Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
