40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the extent to which ICD- 10 alcohol intoxication codes are used for serious hospitalised injury and the distribution of these codes according to gender, age, injury mechanism and intent, severity of injury, and whether the patient was treated in an Intensive Care Unit. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: New Zealand. Participants: All injury hospital discharges in 2010 that met specified severity criteria. Measurements: Cases which had a measurement of BAC (Y 90) coded, or only a subjective assessment of alcohol intoxication (F 10. 0). Findings: 2. 5 % had a blood alcohol recorded (Y 90) and a further 3 % were coded as being intoxicated but there was no blood alcohol code. All factors investigated were shown to be independently associated with the assignation of codes. Notable findings were the elevated odds of an alcohol code for males, assault and the more severe injuries. Conclusions: Assessment of alcohol intoxication among <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> appears to be very uncommon. The development of a standardised instrument for clinical judgement of intoxication would be highly desirable...|$|R

The analysis has been done using linear regression method on time series dataset for years 1991 - 2010.

The results may show as well that new luxury cars don't increase significantly {{the risk of death}} for car passengers in other vehicles, what may have been due to prevailing share of low risk luxury cars in traffic than the higher risk ones. Very surprising finding is that with increasing alcohol consumption there would be less people <b>seriously</b> <b>injured.</b> The increase in alcohol consumption by 1 % would decrease the number of <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> people by 2. 36 %.

40|$|Millions of cars on {{the road}} today have Event Data Recorders (EDRs). A small {{percentage}} of cars currently have EDR data downloaded, typically hours or days after a motor vehicle crash (MVC). However, real time use of EDR data at the crash scene has the potential to save lives by providing additional quantitative information to emergency medical services (EMS) personnel in order to enhance the decisions they make on how and where to transport <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> (scene triage). This paper presents the results of a population-based statewide study of all individuals involved in a specific type of fatal level crash for an entire year. (This paper reports on a subset of crashes from a statewide study of all fatal crashes for one year.) Based on the data collected for each victim of the crash, triage criteria were recorded and then compared to the victim’s actual type of transport, (ground ambulance vs. air medical), injury severity, outcome, and hospital type (e. g., community hospital or trauma center). The triage criteria collected for these crashes, including “mechanism of injury ” criteria, (e. g., speed of crash), were then compared to data possible to collect from EDRs to determine how often EDR data could potentially be used to complement and potentially enhance triage decision making. A key decision that must be made at the scene of a serious crash {{is whether or not the}} severity of the crash or injuries would warrant a request for air medical transport to a trauma center (instead of ground ambulance transport to a community hospital). For the study group 16 % were transported to a trauma center by ground, 11 % by air.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{variety and}} extent of {{impairments}} occurring after traumatic brain injury {{vary according to the}} nature and severity of the lesions. In order to better understand their interactions and long-term outcome, we have studied and compared the cognitive and neurobehavioral profile one year post onset of patients with and without traumatic brain injury in a cohort of motor vehicle accident victims. MethodThe study population is composed of 207 <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> from the ESPARR cohort. This cohort, which has been followed up in time, consists in 1168 motor vehicle accident victims (aged 16 years or more) with injuries with all degrees of severity. Inclusion criteria were: living in Rhone county, victim of a traffic accident having involved at least one wheel-conducted vehicle and having occurred in Rhone county, alive at the time of arrival in hospital and having presented in one of the different ER facilities of the county. The cohort's representativeness regarding social and geographic criteria and the specificities of the accidents were ensured by the specific targeting of recruitment. Deficits and impairments were assessed one year after the accident using the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale - Revised and the Trail-Making Test. Within our <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> group, based on the Glasgow Score, the presence of neurological deficits, aggravation of neurological condition in the first 72 hours and/or abnormal cerebral imaging, we identified three categories: (i) moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (n= 48), (ii) mild traumatic brain injury (n= 89), and (iii) severely injured but without traumatic brain injury (n= 70). ResultsThe most frequently observed symptoms were anxiety, irritability, memory and attention impairments, depressive mood and emotional lability. While depressive mood and irritability were observed with similar frequency in all three groups, memory and attention impairments, anxiety and reduced initiative were more specific to traumatic brain injury whereas executive disorders were associated with moderate/severe traumatic brain injury. Discussion-ConclusionThe presence and the initial severity of a traumatic brain injury condition the nature and frequency of residual effects after one year. Some impairments such as irritability, which is generally associated with traumatic brain injury, {{do not appear to be}} specific to this population, nor does depressive mood. Substantial interactions between cognitive, affective and neurobehavioral disorders have been highlighted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{target is}} quite high: Germany aims {{to reduce the}} number of {{fatalities}} and <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> by 40 % until 2020 compared to the values of 2010. In order to achieve this aim, great efforts have to be considered. The federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in Germany has committed itself to reach this goal and therefore introduced a Road Safety Concept with 90 tasks which was presented to the public in 2013. One of the central measures described therein is the Road Safety Screening. A basic part of the newly developed Road Safety Screening is the integration of all necessary information in one main database. Traffic data for up to 8 vehicle classes was available due to a nationwide traffic monitoring scheme. As automatic classifiers were used, for the first time speed data was also available showing average speed, v 85 -speed and the percentage of drivers exceeding the signed speed limit. Next to this, road geometry data (i. e. road width, curvature, gradient, superelevation) was integrated into the database as well as data concerning the road condition (i. e. skid resistance, unevenness, rutting depth, mending areas, cracks). Pictures from the inspection tour were also added giving a good overview of the situation. The most important part obviously was the accident data. Based on these data the accident risk described by the value of the safety potential was calculated for all road sections. To provide an easy access to this vast data base for the user, a web platform was created. Based on OpenStreetMap the user can choose between the different parameters described above to be displayed in the map. As more than one layer can be selected, these combinations can help to identify the accident causes (i. e. curvature/excessive speed). Several special accident analyses were also conducted (i. e. motorcycle accidents) and the results summarised in fact sheets for every road section, which can be downloaded directly by clicking on the element of interest in the map. The user of the Road Safety Screening is also supplied with a tool for analysing the accident situation in detail. By combining different parameters like high accident risk, high traffic volume and excessive speed the map is updated accordingly and the user can concentrate on the worst accident black spots that are identified in his area of responsibility. The filtered list of the relevant road sections can be downloaded as xls-file for further reference. Since 2014 the use of the Road Safety Screening as a tool to identify accident black spots and select appropriate measures is compulsory in Baden-Wurttemberg. Up till now more than 600 employees from the administrative bodies concerned with road safety as well as the police have been trained to use the tool and got an individual access. So fare the Road Safety Screening has proved to be a valuable tool in dealing with accident black spots and in helping to achieve the set targets. Baden-Wuertemberg is not going to stop here. More special analyses are already assigned and new ideas for a further improvement of the tool are being developed...|$|R
