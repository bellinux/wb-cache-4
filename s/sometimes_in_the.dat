5|$|Both Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a {{scattering}} of mentions of elves in medical texts, sometimes in Latin and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of amulets, where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness. Most of them have Low German connections.|$|E
5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of vanadium {{in the universe}} is 0.0001%, making the element nearly as common as copper or zinc. Vanadium is detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light from other stars.|$|E
5|$|In {{all species}} {{copulation}} {{takes place at}} the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3–10days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{maritime}} trade routes – <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible {{impact on the}} economic and political standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E
5|$|Yuri Andropov {{appointed}} Ryzhkov {{head of the}} Economic Department of the Central Committee {{where he}} was responsible for overseeing major planning and financial organs, excluding industry. As head of the department he reported directly to Mikhail Gorbachev and as head of the Central Committee's Economic Department he met with Andropov once a week. Ryzhkov became convinced that had Andropov lived at least another five years, the Soviet Union would have seen a reform package similar to that implemented in the People's Republic of China. During Konstantin Chernenko's short rule, both Ryzhkov and Gorbachev elaborated several reform measures, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of opposition from Chernenko.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of all go to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then would they pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E

5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and <b>sometimes</b> <b>in)</b> <b>the</b> Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{published}} by Ellis and White in November 1876, although the date appeared on the imprint as 1877. They issued a second edition in 1877 and a third in 1880. The book was brought out again in 1887 by Reeves and Turner, and in 1896 by Longman. In 1898, two years after Morris's death, a revised text {{was published}} by the Kelmscott Press in an edition limited to 160 paper copies and 6 vellum copies, with wood cuts by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. In 1910 Longman issued an edition in which some passages were replaced with prose summaries by Winifred Turner and Helen Scott. In 1911 the same firm reprinted the original version as volume 12 of The Collected Works of William Morris, with an introduction by May Morris; {{in the absence of}} a critical edition this is the one generally cited by scholars. In recent years Sigurd the Volsung has been frequently reprinted, <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Turner and Scott abridged version.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Epstein and Del Verne split kicking duties (<b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same game). On September 16, 2000, Epstein {{missed a}} 24-yard field {{goal for the}} 2000 team with 3:24 {{remaining}} against to UCLA. Although Michigan got back within field goal range, John Navarre was intercepted on the 15-yard line and the team lost 23–20. In that game, Epstein, who totalled 400 punt yards on 9 attempts, had landed what would become his career high 5 punts inside UCLA's 20-yard line and executed his first career 60-yard punt. On October 14, he executed a 67-yard punt that was downed inside the 20-yard line and became his career long against Indiana. On November 4, Epstein was thwarted on an attempt {{to tie the game}} at the end of regulation when a 57-yard field goal attempt went through the hands of his holder against Northwestern in a 54–51 loss after Northwestern scored a go-ahead touchdown with 20 seconds left. Earlier in the game, he had completed a 6-yard forward pass and a 52-yard field goal. On November 18 against Ohio State in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry game, Epstein scored 8 points (a 25-yard field goal and 5 PATs). He dropped 3 of his 6 punts inside the 20 yard line and posted a touchback when kicking off to Ohio State with 1:18 remaining to force them to attempt to drive from their own 20. He earned his second Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition. Epstein finished the season with 50 points (8–14 FGs and 26–28 PATs) and 55 punts for 2224 yards (40.4 average/19 inside 20). He earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter and placekicker. Epstein was one of 10 finalists for the inaugural Ray Guy Award. Michigan finished the season as Big Ten Co-champions with Purdue and Northwestern.|$|E

5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is <b>sometimes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E
