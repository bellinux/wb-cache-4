5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to <b>seek</b> <b>it.</b> Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} in {{mid-19th century}} America {{for a candidate}} for high office not to appear to <b>seek</b> <b>it.</b> Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass for president, with General William O. Butler his running mate, {{but it would be}} a three-way fight as the Free Soil Party, opposed to the spread of slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate of presidential electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{captured}} Ottoman cannon, Morgan and Alain {{then drive}} the Ottomans from Malta and detonate Ottoman weapon caches {{in the nearby}} caves. Inside, they discover that the Ottomans were really interested in a hidden stone library {{telling the story of}} the Lake of the Moon, which contains the Fountain of Youth, a secret Native American relic which is told that it has the ability to give eternal life, and the secret society, called the Circle of Ossus, who <b>seek</b> <b>it</b> for their own gain. Alain orders Morgan to sail to the New World to search for the Lake, but Morgan is attacked by the Pirate Elizabet Ramsey (Lizzie the Pirate) and is forced to land in the Caribbean islands. After re-engaging and defeating Lizzie, Morgan's men find some navigation charts which guide them safely to New Spain.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the opening}} of the Suez and Panama Canals, the Horn remains part of the fastest sailing route around the world, and so the growth in {{recreational}} long-distance sailing has brought about a revival of sailing via the Horn. Owing to the remoteness of the location and the hazards there, a rounding of Cape Horn is widely considered to be the yachting equivalent of climbing Mount Everest, and so many sailors <b>seek</b> <b>it</b> for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{when the}} Obama {{administration}} proposed regulations that required employer-provided {{health insurance plans}} to cover contraception, Catholic companies such as affiliated universities and EWTN Broadcasting, which believed they should be exempt from the law, sued the government, while Catholic religious leaders campaigned against it in church. The regulation was later altered so that an employee of a religious institution which {{did not wish to}} provide coverage for reproductive health care could <b>seek</b> <b>it</b> directly from the insurer at no additional cost. Catholic religious authorities continued to oppose the plan, while the Catholic Health Association supported it.|$|E
25|$|The Exorcist was {{available}} on home video {{from the early}} 1980s in the UK. After the British Board of Film Classification created the Video Recordings Act in 1984, the film was submitted for a home video certificate. James Ferman, Director of the Board, vetoed the decision to grant a certificate to the film, despite {{the majority of the}} group willing to pass it. It was out of Ferman's concerns that, even with a proposed 18 certificate, the film's notoriety would entice underage viewers to <b>seek</b> <b>it</b> out. As a result, all video copies of The Exorcist were withdrawn in the UK and remained unavailable for purchase for more than a decade.|$|E

25|$|Declarations of war, the {{mobilisation}} of troops, and {{the organisation}} {{of the forces}} all fall within the Royal Prerogative; direct parliamentary approval is not necessary for such, though the Cabinet may <b>seek</b> <b>it</b> nonetheless and the Crown-in-Parliament is responsible for allocating moneys necessary to fund the military. The monarch issues letters patent, known as the Queen's Commission, to commissioned officers in the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and the Royal Canadian Air Force. Further, all regulations for the Canadian Forces are set out by the sovereign in the Queen's Regulations and Orders. Neither the monarch nor the viceroy, however, involve themselves in direct military command; per constitutional convention, both must almost always exercise the Royal Prerogative {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, although the right to unilaterally use those powers in crisis situations is maintained.|$|E
25|$|In Southern Australia, the King George whiting {{is often}} the sole target for {{fishermen}} who <b>seek</b> <b>it</b> for its high quality eating. A number of coastal towns rely heavily on the species as a tourism drawcard for anglers seeking a range of fish and crustacean species, but King George whiting {{is often the}} most desired catch. They are a relatively easy species to catch, with no special baits, rigs or techniques required and are often caught from jetties, beaches and rocks; meaning a boat is not necessary. Simple rigs such varieties of running ball sinker or paternoster rigs are commonly used, with a fixed sinker employed in area of high tidal movement. As mentioned previously, molluscs, particularly the Goolwa cockle are common bait, with varieties of worms, gents, squid, cuttlefish, fish pieces and especially raw king prawn are commonly successful. The larger fish inhabiting deep reefs are often caught on whole pilchards while fishing for snapper and morwong.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{a man was}} sighted who {{approached}} the settlement shouting. When near enough to be heard, he cried that Menéndez had taken the French fort and put all the French to the sword. A procession was formed to go forth and meet the victor. Soon after his triumphant reception in the fort, Menéndez heard of Ribault's party having been wrecked, and learned that a detachment had {{made its way to}} Matanzas Inlet. After an ineffective interview and an offer of 100,000 ducats ransom, the Huguenots surrendered to Menéndez, and met the same fate as their comrades at Fort Caroline. A second party, with Ribault himself, were also slain {{at the hands of the}} Spanish. A few, however, who belonged to the Catholic faith, were spared. The Indians, who had been particularly friendly with the French, resented the Spanish invasion and the cruelty of Menéndez, and led by their chief Saturiwa, made war upon the Spanish settlers. The latter were running short of provisions and mutinied during the absence of Menéndez, who had gone back to Cuba for relief, and who finally had to <b>seek</b> <b>it</b> from the King in person in 1567.|$|E
