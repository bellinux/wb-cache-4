5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he clearly had a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders {{a short time later}} during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E

5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> greatest.|$|E

Still, the royal family and some armed forces fled to the United Kingdom. Some {{members of the royal}} family eventually moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada until the Netherlands was liberated; Princess Margriet was born in Canadian exile.|$|E
25|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the study of}} logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's Organon treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of rhetoric.|$|E

25|$|As an adolescent, Rankin cleaned, sewed, {{and helped}} {{care for her}} younger siblings, in {{addition}} to sharing in the outdoor work and daily farm chores. She helped maintain the ranch machinery, and once single-handedly built a wooden sidewalk for a building owned by her father {{so that it could}} be rented. Rankin later recorded her childhood observation that while women of the 1890s western frontier labored <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> men as equals, they did not have an equal political voice—nor a legal right to vote.|$|E

He employed women in ITEP's coding and card punching groups, believing that female computing staff members are more accurate than males.

The women did the input and quality assurance <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> men and for each month without an error received a 20% raise in salary.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the British Army in 1938 was for Army Tank Brigades, attached as Corps troops, to work alongside the Infantry divisions and break into the enemy defensive positions. The Mobile Division, supported Territorial Army Motor divisions each of two motorised infantry brigades supported by two artillery regiments but no tanks, was to then to create a breakthrough. Initially, the mechanised cavalry regiments of the division, were designed as reconnaissance not fighting formations. The motorised infantry, according to John Burnett-Stuart on 8 September 1937, {{was not meant to}} fight <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tanks they were to protect them during resting and replenishing periods.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{dependencies}} between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. Pāṇini, and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates the constituency notion by many centuries. Ibn Maḍāʾ, a 12th-century linguist from Córdoba, Andalusia, {{may have been}} the first grammarian to use the term dependency in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> constituency concept, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of term logic of antiquity. Dependency is also concretely present in the works of Sámuel Brassai (1800–1897), a Hungarian linguist, and of Heimann Hariton Tiktin (1850–1936), a Romanian linguist.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} the Armenians served <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Norsemen {{who were in the}} Byzantine army. This first {{encounter}} between the Armenian mountain-dwellers and the Norse has been discussed by Nansen, who brings these two elements closer to each other and records: “It was the Armenians who together with our Scandinavian forefathers made up the assault units of Byzantine.” Moreover, Bussel underlines the similarities in the way of thinking and the spirit of the Armenian feudal lords and the northern warriors. He claims that, in both groups, there was a strange absence and ignorance of government and public interest {{and at the same time}} an equally large interest in achieving personal distinctions and a loyalty towards their masters and leaders.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessors, the V3's body {{consisted}} of welded steel tubing covered with treated fabric to save weight and make repairs easier. Its interior {{was divided into}} four sections— the cockpit, where pilot and observer sat <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pilot on the left; the load compartment; the engine compartment; and the tail section. The engine and gearbox were centrally mounted and {{held in place by}} a series of tensioned steel cables, with the gearbox in front of the engine. Two steel tube outriggers extended out from the sides of the fuselage to carry the twin rotors, of three-bladed configuration and wooden construction with a steel spar, which were mounted 12.5m (41ft 0in) apart, far enough that they did not overlap.|$|E

25|$|Modern Romania {{was formed}} in 1859 through a {{personal}} union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. During World War II, Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, fighting <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wehrmacht until 1944, when it joined the Allied powers and faced occupation by the Red Army forces. Romania lost several territories, of which Northern Transylvania was regained after the war. Following the war, Romania became a socialist republic {{and member of the}} Warsaw Pact. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a transition towards democracy and a capitalist market economy.|$|E
25|$|Vodun {{cosmology}} {{centers around}} the vodun spirits and other elements of divine essence that govern the Earth, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing {{the forces of nature}} and human society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodun, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or nation. The vodun are the center of religious life, similar in many ways to doctrines such as the intercession of saints and angels that made Vodun appear compatible with Christianity, especially Catholicism, and produced syncretic religions such as Haitian Vodou. Adherents also emphasize ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead live <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> world of the living, each family of spirits having its own female priesthood, sometimes hereditary when it's from mother to blood daughter.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack on}} Cristot {{had been planned}} {{according}} to the January 1944, 21st Army Group infantry-tank theory, in which an attack was {{to be made in}} waves, with tanks followed by infantry and then more tanks. Experience showed that in close country, tanks must attack <b>side</b> <b>by</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> infantry and even then, casualties for tanks and infantry would be high, as it was extremely difficult for tanks to watch accompanying infantry. The attempts by XXX Corps to advance round the open German flank at Caumont and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division to capture high ground around Le Mesnil-Patry, with tank forces supported by infantry rather than vice versa, were not tried again until Operation Goodwood. Having experienced similar losses to those of the 12th SS-Panzer Division during the first few days, the Anglo-Canadians began to accumulate resources to conduct set-piece attrition attacks. German attacks had similar results; the 12th SS-Panzer Division operation order of 7 June, required the division to throw the Allies into the sea but the attempt was a costly failure. The Germans changed tactics and began to limit counter-attacks to restore a defence in depth, rather than continue the failed counter-offensive against the invasion.|$|E
