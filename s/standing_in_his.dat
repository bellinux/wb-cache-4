25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E

500|$|Darius {{eventually}} {{ordered a}} halt at {{the banks of}} Oarus, where he built [...] "eight great forts, some eight miles distant from each other", no doubt as a frontier defence. In his Histories, Herodotus states that {{the ruins of the}} forts were still <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> day. After chasing the Scythians for a month, Darius's army was suffering losses due to fatigue, privation and sickness. Concerned about losing more of his troops, Darius halted the march at the banks of the Volga River and headed towards Thrace. He had conquered enough Scythian territory to force the Scythians to respect the Persian forces.|$|E

When Gautham's father refused to sell it in favour of distributing it globally for free, the businessman and Rosarios killed his parents. When he refuses to tell Gautham about his parents, Gautham kills him. On {{his way to the}} airport, Gautham passes the school he had attended and hears children singing a rhyme. It reminds him of a similar rhyme he learned from his mother, and he remembers his way back to his house. At his house (a dilapidated villa) Gautham finds a photo of his parents, Chandrasekhar and Kalyani. He later introduces the rice variety at a global convention as [...] "the second green revolution", and the film ends with Gautham <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> field of Golden rice.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Chicago Sun-Times, Nelson stated that he had painted Mirth & Girth over the course of one night, <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> underwear. He said that he had painted it in response to how the city populace revered Washington shortly after his death. Nelson stated, [...] "(i)n Chicago, at this time, Harold Washington is like an icon. He's like a deity." [...] In particular, Nelson painted the portrait after seeing prints of [...] "Worry Ye Not", another poster that depicted a smiling Washington with a blue-robe adorned Jesus Christ, looking down on the Chicago skyline. Nelson later testified that he had based the iconoclastic elements of the painting on a rumor that doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital had discovered female underwear beneath the suit Washington was wearing {{at the time of his}} death. Three weeks after the controversy erupted, in {{an interview}} with the New Art Examiner, Nelson explained that the portrait referenced an existing photograph of Washington holding a cigarette prop at an American Cancer Society event.|$|E

500|$|Continuing his construction, Ellet built two {{footbridges}} {{and joined}} them {{together to form}} an [...] wide suspension bridge. [...] He intended to use this temporary bridge as a scaffold {{for the construction of}} the permanent railway bridge. [...] On July 29, 1848, the bridge builder inaugurated the span in his typical manner; <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> horse-buggy like a gladiator in his chariot, Ellet sped across the bridge, which had railings for only a third of its length at that time. [...] His stunt garnered further publicity for the bridge, and the toll collected from the span proved lucrative; $5,000 was collected {{in less than a year}} since its official opening on August 1, 1848. [...] Disputes arose between the bridge companies and Ellet over their shares of the money, and their relations turned bitter. [...] The companies charged that Ellet was late in his schedule and withheld payment. [...] Ellet retaliated by mounting cannons at the bridge to claim ownership over it. [...] In the end the matter went to court. [...] The bridge companies paid $10,000 to Charles Ellet, and he left the project to work full-time on the Wheeling Suspension Bridge.|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E
