40|$|OBJECTIVE: Results of {{the first}} {{prospective}} randomized clinical trial comparing partial and total portacaval shunt for variceal hemorrhage are reported. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Total portacaval shunts produce subnormal portal pressures, completely diverting hepatic portal flow. Partial shunts maintain higher pressures and preserve hepatopedal flow. No randomized trials of these two approaches have been performed. METHODS: Alcoholic patients with cirrhosis (n = 30) and variceal hemorrhage treated at one institution were randomized to receive partial (8 -mm diameter portacaval H grafts with collateral ablation, n = 14) or total shunts (16 -mm diameter grafts, n = 16). Portography was performed after operation and then yearly. Investigators blinded to shunt type assessed encephalopathy; hospitalizations were reviewed. RESULTS: Child's class, age, and operative urgency were similar {{for the two groups}}. Two patients (with total shunts) died within 30 days. Hepatopedal flow was maintained in 13 partial and 0 total shunt patients (p < 0. 0001). <b>Shunt</b> <b>gradients</b> were 16 +/- 5 compared with 6 +/- 3 cm saline after partial and total shunts (p < 0. 0001). There were no shunt thromboses or variceal hemorrhages. Encephalopathy-free survival was significantly greater after partial shunts (p = 0. 013; life table analysis). Five total compared with zero partial shunt patients required hospitalization for coma (p = 0. 02). Long-term survival was not different for the two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Partial shunts control variceal hemorrhage while maintaining hepatopedal flow and elevated portal pressures. By minimizing encephalopathy rates, partial shunts provide improved quality of survival compared with total shunts...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the instantaneous pressure-flow relationships across secundum atrial septal defects. Simultaneous right and left atrial pressures and the pressure difference (determined with an analog computer) were recorded with matched catheter systems. Biplane cineangiocardiography was used to evaluate the timing of the shunts in various phases of the cardiac cycle. These studies indicated that the major left-to-right <b>shunt</b> and pressure <b>gradient</b> occurred over an interval encompassing late ventricular systole and early diastole. Also, there was augmentation of the left-to-right shunt during atrial contraction. Minute right-to-left <b>shunting</b> and pressure <b>gradients</b> occurred at two times in the cardiac cycle: (1) with the onset of ventricular contraction; and (2) during early ventricular diastole (heart rate, 80 to 100 beats/min). Detection of systemic right-to-left shunts by dye curves was enhanced by relatively slow heart rates (prolonged diastasis) which allowed the shunted blood to flow into the left venrticle. The effects of respiration during phasic changes in intrathoracic pressure resulted in an increasing left-to-right gradient during periods of increasing intrathoracic pressure and a fall in the left-to-right gradient across the defect during periods of decreasing intrathoracic pressure...|$|R
40|$|During brain development, {{progenitor}} cells migrate {{over long}} distances through narrow and tortuous extracellular spaces posing significant {{demands on the}} cell's ability to alter cell volume. This phenotype is recapitulated in primary brain tumors. We demonstrate here that volume changes occurring spontaneously in these cells are mediated by the flux of Cl− along with obligated water across the cell membrane. To do so, glioma cells accumulate Cl− to ∼ 100 mM, a concentration threefold greater than predicted by the Nernst equation. <b>Shunting</b> this <b>gradient</b> through the sustained opening of exogenously expressed GABA-gated Cl− channels caused a 33 % decrease in cell volume and impaired the ability of cells to migrate in a spatially constrained environment. Further, dividing cells condense their cytoplasm prior to mitosis, a phenomenon which {{is associated with the}} release of intracellular Cl− as indicated by a 40 -mM decrease in [Cl−]i. These findings provide a new framework for considering the role of intracellular Cl− in glioma cells. Here, Cl− serves as an important osmotically active regulator of cell volume being the energetic driving force for volume changes required by immature cells in cell migration and proliferation. This mechanism that was studied in CNS malignancies may be shared with other immature cells in the brain as well...|$|R
40|$|The generai aspects and newer {{applications}} of two-dimensional, contrast, and Doppler echocardiography {{in the evaluation}} of congenital heart disease are reviewed. Real-time, two-dimensional (2 -D) has provided a systematic approach to the diagnosis of complex cardiac abnormalities, looking at the heart in terms of separate developmental units, and permitting examination in numerous different planes. Contrast and Doppler echocardiography have allowed visualization of the blood pool and resulting flow patterns within the cardiac chambers and vessels, and provided flow information in simple and complex congenital heart defects. Structure identification, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of <b>shunts,</b> estimation of <b>gradients,</b> and assessment of pulmonary hypertension have been made available. Refinements of the techniques are currently being developed, and, in selected cases, cardiac catheterization may be obviated. Future developments certainly will improve the capabilities of echocardiography by providing a more accurate noninvasive, morpho-functional assessment of congenital heart disease...|$|R

For an input power of about 20 MW, EM simulation results show that an average accelerating gradient of 28 MV/m is achieved which corresponds to a peak accelerating gradient of 35 MV/m, a peak surface gradient of 44 MV/m and peak modified Poynting vector Scmax of 0. 24 MW/mm 2...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between the splanchnic and systemic effects of vasopressin and to measure its efficacy in lowering portal pressure relative to what can be accomplished by zero <b>gradient</b> <b>shunting,</b> intraoperative measurements of cardiac output and relevant pressures were made in 30 patients undergoing selective or total shunts. Vasopressin caused a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, but an insignificant overall reduction in cardiac index (CI). However, in ten patients the decrease in CI exceeded 20 %, suggesting a subpopulation of especially susceptible individuals. High initial CI, age, pre-existent heart disease, and severity of cirrhosis did not predict greater vulnerability. Adding an infusion of nitroprusside regularly reverted CI to control levels, regardless of the extent of cardiac output depression. Vasopressin was 38 % as effective as a subsequent shunt in reducing splanchnic venous pressure. The portal hypotensive action bore no relationship to CI, but the pressure decrease caused by vasopressin was predictive of the reduction that could be achieved by shunting. The effects of the two types of shunts on systemic hemodynamics were minor and remarkably similar...|$|R
40|$|Background. Contralateral {{subdural}} hygroma caused by decompressive craniectomy tends to combine with external cerebral herniation, causing neurological deficits. Material and Methods. Nine patients who underwent one-stage, simultaneous cranioplasty and contralateral subdural-peritoneal shunting {{were included in}} this study. Clinical outcome was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale as well as Glasgow Coma Scale, muscle power scoring system, and complications. Results. Postoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated completely resolved {{subdural hygroma}} and reversed midline shifts, indicating excellent outcome. Among these 9 patients, 4 patients (44 %) had improved GOS following the proposed surgery. Four out of 4 patients with lethargy became alert and orientated following surgical intervention. Muscle strength improved significantly 5 months after surgery in 7 out of 7 patients with weakness. Two out of 9 patients presented with drowsiness due to hydrocephalus at an average time of 65 days after surgery. Double <b>gradient</b> <b>shunting</b> is useful to eliminate the respective hydrocephalus and contralateral subdural hygroma. Conclusion. The described surgical technique is effective in treating symptomatic contralateral subdural hygroma following decompressive craniectomy and is associated with an excellent structural and functional outcome. However, subdural-peritoneal shunting plus cranioplasty thoroughly resolves the subdural hygroma collection, which might deteriorate the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, leading to hydrocephalus...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesSystemic {{inflammatory}} response syndrome is commonly observed in {{coronary artery bypass}} grafts (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CB). The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the systemic and pulmonary levels of cytokines and their correlation with lung function in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization (MR) with CB. MethodsThis study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee, and 13 patients undergoing MR with CB were evaluated. After anesthetic induction and at the end of CB, plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, and TNF-α were determined. The dur ation of CB and surgery, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, alveolar-arterial oxygen <b>gradient</b> (A-a <b>gradient),</b> <b>shunt,</b> and lung compliance were evaluated. Results were submitted to analysis of variance for repeated measurements (*p < 0. 05) and Spearman's correlation coefficient. ResultsWe observed increased levels of cytokines in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage after CB and a direct relationship between the increase in IL- 1 β and decrease in lung compliance (p = 0. 0439), as well as the inverse relationship between the increase in IL- 10 and a decrease in compliance (p = 0. 0325). The increase in IL- 6 was directly related to the duration of CB (p = 0. 012), while the increase in IL- 8 was directly related to the duration of surgery (p < 0. 0001). Levels of interleukin- 1 β, IL- 8, and TNF-α in bronchoalveolar lavage were higher than in plasma.
