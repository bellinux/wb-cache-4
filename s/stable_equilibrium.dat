5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a <b>stable</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a <b>stable</b> <b>equilibrium</b> within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} of Domokos and Várkonyi has curved edges and resembles a sphere with a squashed top. In the top figure, it rests in its <b>stable</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Its unstable equilibrium position is obtained by rotating the figure 180° about a horizontal axis. Theoretically, it will rest there, but the smallest perturbation will {{bring it back}} to the stable point. The mathematical gömböc has indeed sphere-like properties. In particular its flatness and thinness are minimal, and this is the only type of nondegenerate object with this property. Domokos and Várkonyi are interested to find a polyhedral solution with the surface consisting of a minimal number of flat planes. Therefore, they offer a prize to anyone who finds such solution, which amounts to $10,000 divided by the number of planes in the solution. Obviously, one can approximate their curvilinear gömböc with a finite number of discrete surfaces, however, their estimate is it will take thousands of planes to achieve that. They hope, by offering this prize, to stimulate finding a radically different solution from their own.|$|E
25|$|The strict shape {{tolerance}} of gömböcs hindered production. The first prototype of a gömböc was manufactured in summer 2006 using three-dimensional rapid prototyping technology. Its accuracy however was below requirements, and the gömböc would often {{get stuck in}} an intermediate position rather than returning to the <b>stable</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The technology was improved to increase the spatial accuracy to the required level and to use various construction materials. In particular, transparent (especially lightly colored) solids are visually appealing, as they demonstrate the homogeneous composition. Current materials for gömböcs include various metals and alloys, plastics such as Plexiglass, stones such as marble and ceramics, and injection-molded plastic. The balancing properties of a gömböc are affected by mechanical defects and dust both on its body and on the surface on which it rests. If damaged, the process of restoring the original shape {{is more complex than}} producing a new one. Although in theory the balancing properties should not depend on the material and object size, in practice, both larger and heavier gömböcs have better chances to return to equilibrium in case of defects.|$|E

This phenomenon can also be described as a supercritical transcritical bifurcation. However, under certain circumstances, such as nonlinear incidence, nonlinear recovery rate, and vector-borne transmission, a backward bifurcation may occur although R_ 0 < 1 (see [31]). The system exhibits an endemic equilibrium along with a <b>stable</b> disease-free <b>equilibrium.</b> There is then a subcritical transcritical bifurcation at R_ 0 = 1.|$|R
25|$|Suppose {{a system}} is {{thermally}} and mechanically isolated from the environment (isolated system). For example, consider an insulating rigid box divided by a movable partition into two volumes, each filled with gas. If the pressure of one gas is higher, it will expand by moving the partition, thus performing work on the other gas. Also, if the gases are at different temperatures, heat can flow from one gas to the other provided the partition allows heat conduction. Our above result indicates that the entropy of {{the system as a}} whole will increase during these processes. There exists a maximum amount of entropy the system may possess under the circumstances. This entropy corresponds to a state of <b>stable</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> since a transformation to any other equilibrium state would cause the entropy to decrease, which is forbidden. Once the system reaches this maximum-entropy state, no part of the system can perform work on any other part.
