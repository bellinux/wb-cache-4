5|$|William Easton, an {{insurance}} executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed {{to heart disease}} after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, {{where he and his}} janitor, Hank, awaken in vises designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath for long and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and a shotgun aimed at seats of a carousel. It is shown that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.|$|E
5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's baby, {{who has been}} identified as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The armed {{vehicle and}} the {{soldiers}} following the human shield were ambushed in the centre of Struga by a single policeman and a civilian who threw a hand grenade and ran towards the vehicle, carrying three more hand grenades <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> waist. As the hand grenades exploded, gunfire erupted allowing the civilians held as human shields to run away. The policeman and civilian who carried out the ambush were both killed; sources identify the two as reserve policeman Mile Blažević and traffic policeman Željko Filipović. Shortly before 16:00, the Croatian forces counterattacked, causing the bulk of Popović's troops to flee. Popović and his remaining five or six soldiers retreated. At least five SAO Krajina troops were killed and twenty wounded in fighting in Struga. By 18:00, the battalion led by Orlović had lost 80 percent of its personnel to desertion. Prompted by the desertions and heavy shooting in Struga at 19:00, Bogdan Vajagić, the commanding officer of the SAO Krajina units subordinated to the Dvor headquarters, requested that the JNA intervene. The JNA informed Vajagić that a unit was dispatched from Petrinja, allowing him to break off further fighting with the Croatian police and send two platoons as reinforcements to Glina as reinforcements at Vasiljković's request. JNA tanks reached Struga at 19:50 to establish a buffer zone. Croatian forces there offered to leave the village if the JNA provided them with one armoured personnel carrier and escorted them to Hrvatska Kostajnica. The JNA complied with the request. During the fighting, 12 Croatian policemen were killed, along with 20 civilians.|$|E

There was a simple ingenious safety OFF switch, using a magnet that connected two electrical terminals across a point, located close by the engine's surface watertight hatch. The rider would attach a <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ankle with a flexible wire line to the magnet. When he fell off, it would stop the engine.|$|R

The two met by chance in 1994, in London, England. At the time, Olsdal was taking guitar lessons and was on his way home when he met Molko at the South Kensington tube station. Molko, observing that Olsdal had a guitar <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> back, invited Olsdal to watch him perform at a local gig. On the strength of Molko's performance, Olsdal decided that they should start a band. The two formed as Ashtray Heart, named after the Captain Beefheart song of the same name. Molko, however, denied in 2009 that Ashtray Heart was the first name of the band, dismissing this as a rumour and claiming that the band had more names initially.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{hijacking}} {{and shortly}} after the aircraft took off from Xiamen, Jiang approached the cockpit, holding flowers. The security guards let him in; a Time article stated that the guards probably let him through because they believed that Jiang was offering flowers to the pilots as a Moon Festival gift. The article stated that reportedly, once in the cockpit, he opened his jacket to reveal {{what appeared to be}} explosives <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> chest. The article added that Jiang ordered all crew members out of the cockpit, except for the pilot, Cen Longyu, whom he directed to fly to Taipei, Taiwan. The pilot did not comply, instead continuing toward the original destination of Guangzhou. Reports from the official Xinhua News Agency did not explain why the pilot did not accede to Jiang’s demand. Before 9/11, it was standard practice during these events to follow the hijacker’s instructions.|$|E

Joe initially refused to let any of the doctors help Elizabeth and Jake, but Sam managed to convince Joe to allow Jake treatment. Soon after, Jason arrived at GH, and he and Sam fell back into their old pattern and worked together to stop Joe. Jason and Sam then went their separate ways for a few months, but they both maintained a mutual friend in Spinelli and this sometimes caused them to cross paths.|$|E
25|$|Three {{lifeboats}} were dispatched from Northern Ireland to {{the area}} where the aircraft was last seen on radar, along with two helicopters from Prestwick and Anglesey and one from the Strathclyde Police (during daytime hours), and the HMS Penzance, a Royal Navy minesweeper that was conducting training operations 35nm away. Coast Guard rescue teams conducted searches along the shoreline all night and the next day along with officers from the Strathclyde Police Department. Two investigators from the AAIB were also sent to the scene. Some wreckage of the aircraft was quickly found floating in the water (all three doors, the paramedic's bag, the left main landing gear leg, and other light material), with the main wreckage submerged on the seabed. The wreckage was 7.7nm west-northwest of the Campbeltown airport. The fuselage had broken into three main sections: front, centre, and rear. The centre section included the wing. The engines and propellers had been torn from the wings on impact. The paramedic's body was found <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> seat.

25|$|Arriving at Norway during winter, Gudrid is {{amazed that}} {{the trees are}} huge {{compared}} to {{the ones on the}} islands. When the group goes ashore to make camp, they are suddenly attacked by a bear that is awake despite winter. The bear almost kills Thorfinn and Einar, but is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel. A female hunter emerges from the wood and intrudes herself as Hild, daughter of Hrafnkell. Hild skins the bear and lets the group have the meat. While enjoying a bear meat stew, Hild and the group get along quite well, chatting friendly with each other. However, Hild suddenly reveals that she recognizes Thorfinn as the one who killed her father when her home was attacked by Askeladd's warband 8 years before. Thorfinn remembers the attack and admits that he is guilty. Hild almost shoots Thornfinn with her crossbow but hesitates because Karli is <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> back. Hild tell the group that she poisoned the soup and will throw the antidote away unless Thorfinn follow her into the woods alone to face her. Thorfinn agrees, swearing to his comrades that he will not die, nor will he hurt Hild. Thorfinn initially keeps himself at bay while evading Hild's quarrels, but he finally figures out her position and charges her. However, he is taken completely by surprise by Hild's specially crafted crossbow's ability to reload rapidly, taking multiple quarrels to his legs. Thorfinn's comrades arrive despite Hild's threat and try to convince Hild that Thorfinn is not the person he once was, and Thonfinn himself begs for time to atone for his sins. Hild remains unconvinced and is about to finish Thorfinn off, but she sees a vision of her father and her old hunting master which causes her to miss. Although she cannot forgive Thorfinn, she agrees to give him time to try and complete his mission. Hild decides to travel with the group {{to keep an eye on}} Thorfinn and swears that if he shows any signs of abandoning his mission to create a land of peace, she will kill him at last.|$|E
