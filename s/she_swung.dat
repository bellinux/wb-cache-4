5|$|Szent István {{was based}} at Pola (Pula) for the {{duration}} of her career. In fact she rarely left port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fažana Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single, two-day, trip to Pag Island. Only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; {{for the rest of the}} time <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> at anchor in Pola Harbour. She was never even drydocked to get her bottom cleaned.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E
60|$|They {{looked out}} across the harbour. The smoke was pouring from the funnels of the destroyer. Already <b>she</b> had <b>swung</b> around and was {{steaming}} slowly towards the Channel.|$|R
60|$|It was our war-ship Clampherdown, And grimly did <b>she</b> roll; <b>Swung</b> {{round to}} take the cruiser's fire As the White Whale faces the Thresher's ire When they war by the frozen Pole.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind! Look!——" [...] <b>she</b> {{carefully}} <b>swung</b> {{the long}} band of green peel {{over her head}} three times, letting it fall the third. The cat pounced on it, but Mollie swept him off again.|$|R
5|$|On April 6, Dumas {{suffered}} {{what appeared}} to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program Dark Angel. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by General Manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy.|$|E
25|$|By 13:35, Winslow {{reached a}} point {{approximately}} 1,500 yards from her quarry when a white puff of smoke from Antonio Lópezs bow gun signaled {{the beginning of an}} artillery duel which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. Winslow responded with her 1-pounders. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on Winslow, and she soon received several direct hits. The first shot to score on the torpedo boat destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Her crew tried to rig an auxiliary steering system, but <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> broadside to the enemy and a shot pierced her hull near the engine room and knocked the port main engine out of commission. She maneuvered with her remaining engine to evade enemy fire and maintained a steady return fire with her 1-pounders. Wilmington and Hudson brought their guns to bear on the Spanish ship and shore, and the combined fire of the three American warships put the Spanish tugboat out of action while several waterfront buildings caught fire.|$|E
25|$|Shepherd {{was convicted}} of the crime on October 9, 2008, after jurors deliberated for four hours. He was given the maximum {{sentence}} of 99 {{years in prison and}} a $10,000 fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, Shepherd revealed how he murdered Stewart. He pressured her to reveal her new relationship at college, but she refused to answer and grabbed a knife from a table and approached him with it in her hand. <b>She</b> <b>swung</b> at him with the knife and nicked his fingers. Afraid she was going to stab him again, he grabbed her around the neck with one arm and tried to reach the knife with his other hand. He ended up choking her to death out of anger. He later went to the hardware store to purchase a jigsaw. He undressed the body and dismembered it in his bathtub using the jigsaw and other tools. He barbecued the remains on his grills in his patio.|$|E
60|$|While {{he looked}} through the gate a woman stepped from the lodge to open it. In her haste <b>she</b> nearly <b>swung</b> the gate into his face, and would have {{completely}} done so had he not jumped back.|$|R
6000|$|... "And didst see it all, Licinia?" [...] asked Dea Flavia, {{as with a}} lazy {{stretch of}} her graceful arms <b>she</b> {{suddenly}} <b>swung</b> herself round on to her back and looked straight up at the wrinkled old face bending tenderly over her.|$|R
60|$|The Pyrenees shipped two {{heavy seas}} as <b>she</b> was <b>swung</b> off and put once more before it, {{and the first}} mate {{expressed}} a desire to have all that water down in the hold, if only it could be introduced without taking off the hatches. McCoy ducked his head into the binnacle and watched the course set.|$|R
500|$|At daybreak on 28 September 1918, Gorgon, {{in company}} with , {{anchored}} about [...] off De Panne, Belgium {{and opened fire}} about 7:15 on a bridge at Snaeskerke, Belgium at a range of [...] Conditions were not good as both wind and tide were against her. Gorgons stern anchor cable parted and <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> around on her bow anchor so that only her rear turret could bear on the target. No aircraft were made available to spot for her so there was little chance of a hit and she only fired eleven rounds. She, and the other monitors, were attacked {{several times during the}} day by German aircraft with little effect and several coast defense batteries attempted to engage them through the smokescreen put up by the motor launches supporting the operation. She fired thirteen shells the next day in another attempt to destroy the bridge and claimed one hit although this was not confirmed by subsequent observations.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2016, it was {{reported}} that Sheeran had to have stitches on his right cheek after an accident at a party held at the home of Princess Beatrice of York at Royal Lodge, in Windsor, Berkshire. According to this account, singer-songwriter James Blunt was also at the party and joked that he would love a knighthood, at which point Beatrice jokingly said she could arrange it and fetched a ceremonial sword. Blunt got down on one knee while Beatrice held the sword above him and said 'arise Sir James', before <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> the sword over her shoulder unaware that Sheeran was standing behind her. [...] However, Blunt later said that the story was made up, and that Sheeran had cut himself while drunk.|$|E
2500|$|Winx {{was given}} some time off, then {{returned}} to training in January 2017. Her next start was the Apollo Stakes at Randwick, originally scheduled for 11 February but delayed to 13 February due to extreme heat in the Sydney area. Winx broke poorly, then settled in mid pack behind a fast early pace. <b>She</b> <b>swung</b> out three-wide leaving the far turn, then pulled away in the stretch to defeat Hartnell by two lengths. [...] "My only worry going into the race was {{if there was no}} tempo but that went at a good gallop and that really helped," [...] said Bowman. [...] "Chris [...] and his team have done a great job to have her ready after so long away from the races and it's a privilege to be part of this." ...|$|E
60|$|The splash was drowned by {{the roar}} of running cable that {{presently}} stopped with a jar. <b>She</b> brought up, <b>swung</b> to the wind, {{and there was a}} strange quietness on board.|$|R
6000|$|It was our war-ship Clampherdown, [...] And grimly did <b>she</b> roll; [...] <b>Swung</b> {{round to}} take the cruiser's fire [...] As the White Whale faces the Thresher's ire [...] When they war by the frozen Pole.|$|R
60|$|In {{the week}} that {{followed}} Nancy enjoyed herself after her own fashion. <b>She</b> read and <b>swung</b> in the garden, having a hammock hung under the firs. She went far afield, in rambles to woods and lonely uplands.|$|R
2500|$|Imo had {{a crew of}} 39 men {{commanded}} by Captain Haakon From. At 430 feet in length but only 45 feet wide Imo was long and narrow. Because she was in ballast (without cargo), her propeller and rudder were nearly out of the water, making her difficult to steer. She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine with a single 20-foot right-hand propeller able to make 60 revolutions per minute. Due to this propeller, the ship had a [...] "transverse thrust", i.e. while making headway she veered to the left, in reverse <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> to the right. Under these conditions, Imo was at a disadvantage in navigating in tight quarters. [...] "Due to the combined effect of transverse thrust and the length, and depth of SS Imo's hull, and its keel, she was difficult to maneuver".|$|E
2500|$|Lookout {{established}} {{radar contact}} with the Germans at 03:00 on 18 March. The Germans were sailing at [...] just west of north. The British destroyer approached at high speed from ahead and opened fire from about [...] Minutes later <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> around, moving parallel to the Germans, and launched torpedoes. The Germans were completely surprised by this attack and Lookouts radar-directed guns quickly scored hits on TA24 and TA29. TA29 dropped out of formation while the other two ships retreated north. Lookout decided {{to let them go}} to concentrate on the crippled TA29 and circled the German firing continuously with her six 4.7-inch guns from as close as [...] TA29 fought back, her gunners near missing Lookout a number of times, hitting her only with a burst of 20mm shells, which hit some smoke floats and ignited a small fire that was quickly extinguished.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>swung</b> {{round to}} face me, her dose-set eyes ablaze with anger.|$|E
60|$|One was {{the great}} fire on shore, by which the {{defeated}} pirates lay carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the darkness, indicated {{the position of the}} anchored ship. <b>She</b> had <b>swung</b> round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window.|$|R
60|$|Laura gave {{a little}} cry and pointed with her riding-whip. About twenty yards further on, {{by the side of}} the road, was a small white object. <b>She</b> cantered on, <b>swung</b> herself from her horse and picked it up.|$|R
5000|$|While tube {{number six}} {{was still being}} reloaded, Thresher fired two other bow tubes at the freighter, two more at the oiler, and the {{remaining}} full one at the escort; <b>she</b> then <b>swung</b> about and fired one stern tube at the latter. Two torpedoes exploded at 02:46, and the cargo ship sank immediately. One minute later, two [...] "fish" [...] struck the oiler. A tremendous explosion lighted the entire sky, and the ship sank within 15 seconds.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>swung</b> {{herself down}} into my arms, and stood beside me face to face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>swung</b> {{sideways}} on a roller, and gesticulated {{with her}} jib-boom from port to starboard.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>swung</b> {{round as}} if to go, but checked, and looked him frankly in the eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{handed her}} the favour. She placed it amongst the {{collection}} {{at the back of}} her chair and rose, and they danced. Was it dancing? The music throbbed; nay, the musicians seemed suddenly to have been carried out of themselves, and played as they had not played before. Her veins were filled with pulsing fire as <b>she</b> was <b>swung,</b> guided, carried out of herself by the extraordinary virility of the man who held her. She had tasted mastery.|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} felt a strong hand grasp her arm, and with a sudden surge <b>she</b> was <b>swung</b> over a broad shoulder. Quickly she grasped the rough shirt that covered {{the back of her}} would-be rescuer, and then {{commenced}} a battle with the waves that for many minutes, that seemed hours to the frightened girl, hung in the balance; but at last the swimmer beneath her forged steadily and persistently toward the sandy beach to flounder out at last with an unconscious burden in his mighty arms.|$|R
60|$|When {{within a}} quarter of a mile of the shore, the helm was again put down and, as the vessel came partly round, the the anchors were let go. The hawsers ran out rapidly, and the topsail, which was the only sail on her, was let go, the wind {{catching}} it and tearing it into ribbons as it was loosed. There was a jerk and a surge as the anchors brought her up, but at the same moment a great wave struck her head. The cables parted, and <b>she</b> again <b>swung</b> round towards the shore.|$|R
60|$|Ann {{looked out}} of the window thoughtfully for a moment. Then <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> round in her swivel-chair.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, scorn {{kindling}} in her glance. Then <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> round {{to appeal to}} Tressan.|$|E
6000|$|First, it was [...] "Treat my {{daughter}} kind-i-ly," [...] and then <b>she</b> <b>swung</b> into old-fashioned darky camp-meeting hymns, beginning with: ...|$|E
2500|$|Fog {{shrouded}} her {{area during}} {{the last days of}} the month. On 2 April, visibility was still poor, less than [...] At 07:10, she made radar contact with an enemy convoy-four merchantmen and three escorts. At 09:15, she commenced firing at the lead merchant ship. Forty seconds later, she fired at the next ship. <b>She</b> then <b>swung</b> around to bring her stern tubes to bear on a third merchant ship; found herself well inside the escort on the convoy's starboard quarter; continued swinging and fired three stern shots at the escort. Between 08:19 and 08:22, seven hits were heard and felt.|$|R
60|$|Getting off was not easy. <b>She</b> had <b>swung,</b> and her cable, {{sweeping}} the bottom, had fouled the anchor. They hove all on board in a horrible tangle, and for hours the barefooted crew were occupied in dragging the ponderous links about. In the meantime Mossamedes steamed slowly south, {{with a yellow}} smear on her port hand that stood for the coast. The shallows run far to sea, and the charts are not remarkably good. Yusuf had sent her to load sheep {{at the mouth of}} a wady, but stated that she might wait some days before the animals arrived.|$|R
25|$|One {{week later}} Trout {{launched}} two torpedoes {{at what she}} {{thought to be a}} tanker as it emerged from a rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target's bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. Trout opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. <b>She</b> then <b>swung</b> around and fired a stern torpedo and watched Hirotama Maru turn her stern straight up with her screws still turning and slip under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943.|$|R
