50|$|Three {{supply systems}} serve Warsaw inhabitants. Wodociąg Centralny (Central <b>Water</b> <b>Main)</b> is the oldest. It {{was built in}} the 19th century. After many renovations, it is still {{functioning}} and providing water {{for more than half of}} Warsaw's residents. The other supply systems are Wodociąg Praski (Praga <b>Water</b> <b>Main)</b> and Wodociąg Północny (Northern <b>Water</b> <b>Main).</b>|$|R

40|$|Many water {{authorities}} own {{water mains}} that {{date to the}} beginning of the last century. As these assets begin to reach the end of their useful lives, failures are becoming increasingly more common. With only limited financial resources available, water authorities are faced with the challenge of whether to repair or replace damaged water mains. A useful decision making tool in this area is a <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure prediction model. ActewAGL is a water utility operating and maintaining the water supply network in the ACT for the asset owner Actew Corporation. The network consists of in excess of 3000 kilometres of water mains and services approximately 360, 000 customers. Although not currently considered a problem, the <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure rate in the ACT appears to be on the rise. Therefore, Actew recognizes the need to better understand the causes of <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failures and to be proactive in developing policies to most efficiently deal with the effects of failure. The objective of this study was to investigate the methods, parameters and theory used in existing <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure models and to use these findings to develop a customised <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure prediction model taking into account limitations with the type and quality of <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure data available. As a result of this study a number of recommendations were made for further work in order to improve Actew’s ability to monitor system performance and predict <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failures. These are as follows. • Compile historical failure records into a central <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure database and add links to the GIS and asset management systems. • Incorporate physical parameters into <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure data collection processes. • Conduct further testing, validation and improvement of the multivariate statistical models developed in this study. • Conduct preliminary investigations into the development of a physically based <b>water</b> <b>main</b> failure prediction model...|$|R

40|$|In {{major cities}} world wide, {{deterioration}} of water mains is a continuous process; therefore, {{the need to}} improve the condition of water mains becomes crucial. While most municipalities have taken proactive measures in repairing, rehabilitating and replacing deteriorated water mains, more investigation still {{needs to be done in}} order to assist municipalities to make right decisions on limited budgets. Building deterioration models and prioritizing <b>water</b> <b>main</b> rehabilitation are more important than ever. The deterioration of water mains includes structural and functional degradations. The present research focuses on the collection of <b>water</b> <b>main</b> data from municipalities and the analysis of <b>water</b> <b>main</b> breaks as a representative of the structural deterioration.
