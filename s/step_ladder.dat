5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a <b>step</b> <b>ladder.</b> The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E

2500|$|Belknap died {{suddenly}} from a massive {{heart attack in}} Washington, D.C. on Sunday October 12, 1890. The New York Times stated that his death occurred on Sunday between 1:00 A.M and 9:00 A.M., and that he died alone at his residence in the Evans building on New York Avenue. Prior to his death, Belknap had played cards with his friends on Saturday night, then retired upstairs for the evening. Belknap's wife, Amanda, was in New York City at the time. At 8:30 A.M. on Monday morning, Belknap's business associate, John W. Cameron, picked up Belknap's mail {{on the first floor}} of Belknap's home, where he maintained his law office, and proceeded to the second floor, where Belknap lived. Cameron and a maid found that all the rooms had been locked. [...] A janitor was summoned to open the doors, and a <b>step</b> <b>ladder</b> was used to peer into Belknap's bedroom. Belknap had placed his hat and coat on a chair and his lifeless body was found on his bed. His left arm had been raised toward his head with his left hand tightly clenched. The bed clothes were disheveled and he appeared to have struggled for breath. The physician who initially examined the body stated that he had died of apoplexy; however, an autopsy by the coroner revealed that Belknap suffered from heart disease. The War Department was notified and received with [...] "genuine sorrow" [...] the news of Belknap's death, since Belknap had been a popular Secretary of War.|$|E

60|$|So {{they all}} went across the court yard, and {{approached}} the square tower. The guide explained to the boys that formerly the entrance was in the second story, through {{an opening in the}} wall, which he showed them. The way to get up to this opening was by a <b>step</b> <b>ladder,</b> which could be let down or drawn up by the people within, by means of chains coming down from a window above. The <b>step</b> <b>ladder</b> was, of course, entirely gone; but deep grooves were to be seen in the sill of the upper window, which had been worn by the chains in letting down and drawing up the ladder.|$|E

50|$|A stile is a {{structure}} which provides people a passage through or over a fence or boundary via <b>steps,</b> <b>ladders,</b> or narrow gaps.

60|$|It {{turned out}} in the end, however, that he was {{disappointed}} in his expectation of having a good climb; for, when the conductor {{was ready for the}} banquette passengers to take their places, he brought the <b>step</b> <b>ladder</b> and planted it {{against the side of the}} vehicle, and Mr. George and Rollo went up as easily as they would have gone up stairs.|$|E

Paramore goes to the left hand door, and is about to leave the library when he meets Grace entering.) ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the coach was ready, and the {{conductor}} began to call upon the passengers to take their places, {{so that there was}} no more time for deliberation. They were all obliged to take their seats as the conductor called off the names from his way bill. The two ladies entered the coupé in company with the Russian, while Mr. Howland ascended by the <b>step</b> <b>ladder</b> to his seat on the banquette. While the passengers were thus getting seated the postilions were putting in the horses, and in a moment more the diligence set off.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the climbing summits there are also various steep paths, on which hikers with sure-footedness and a head for heights can climb, in places, great heights {{with the aid of}} <b>steps,</b> <b>ladders,</b> metal rungs and railings at various points. Amongst the most popular of these climbing paths are the Häntzschelstiege in the Affensteinen, as well as the Heilige Stiege, the Rübezahlstiege and the Rotkehlchenstiege north of Schmilka.|$|R
60|$|Now, Mrs. Howland's {{real reason}} for not being willing to ride on the banquette, was not the {{difficulty}} of climbing up, for at all the diligence offices they have convenient <b>step</b> <b>ladders</b> {{for the use of}} the passengers in getting up and down. The real reason was, she thought it was not genteel to ride there. And in fact it is not genteel. There is no part of the diligence where people who attach much importance to the fashion of the thing are willing to go, except the coupé.|$|R
60|$|At length {{the time}} arrived for the {{departure}} of our two travellers from Basle. A porter from the hotel carried their trunks to the diligence office, while Rollo and Mr. George walked. When {{they got to the}} place they found the diligence in the archway, and several men were employed in carrying up trunks and carpet bags to the top of it and stowing them away there. In doing this they ascended and descended by means of a long <b>step</b> <b>ladder.</b> The men took Mr. George's trunk and Rollo's and packed them away with the rest. There were several persons who looked like passengers standing near, waiting, apparently, for the diligence to be ready.|$|E
60|$|When the {{passengers}} were seated the <b>step</b> <b>ladder</b> was taken away, {{and a moment}} afterwards the postilion started the horses forward, and the ponderous vehicle began to move down the archway, the clattering of the horses' hoofs and the lumbering noise of the wheels sounding very loud in consequence of the echoes and reverberations produced by the sides and vaulting of the archway. As soon as the diligence reached the street the postilion began to crack his whip {{to the right and}} left in the most loud and vehement manner, and the coach went thundering on through the narrow streets of the town, driving every thing from before {{it as if it were}} a railway train going express.|$|E

5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised <b>step</b> <b>ladders</b> and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|R

60|$|Further {{space was}} {{provided}} by two galleries, one on the north side, supported on iron poles, and entered from the outside by a <b>step</b> <b>ladder</b> studded with large square-headed nails {{to prevent it from}} being slippery. The other went across the west end, and was entered by a dark staircase leading up behind the pews, which further led to the little square weather-boarded tower containing two beautifully toned bells. These were rung from the outer gallery where the men sat. There was a part boarded off for the singers. The Font was nearly under the gallery. It was of white marble, and still lines our present Font. Tradition says it was given by a former clerk, perhaps Mr. Fidler, but there is no record of it. An older and much ruder Font was hidden away under the gallery stairs close to an old chest, where women sometimes found a seat, against the west wall.|$|E
6000|$|Well, the {{congregation}} got into Church--three families by the <b>step</b> <b>ladder</b> to one gallery, {{and the men}} into another, where the front row squeezed their knees through the rails and leant on the top bar, {{the rest of the}} world in the pews, and the children on benches. The clerk was in his desk behind the reading desk--good George Oxford, with his calm, good, gentle face, and tall figure, sadly lame from rheumatism caught when working in the brick kilns. His voice was always heard above the others in the responses, but our congregation never had dropped the habit of responding, and, though there was no chanting, the Amens and some of the Versicles used to have a grand full musical sound peculiar to that Church. People also all turned to the east for the Creed, few knelt, but some of the elder men stood during the prayers, and, though there was far too much sitting down during the singing, every body got up and stood, if [...] "Hallelujah" [...] occurred, as it often did in anthems.|$|E

5000|$|Remaining {{active in}} his final years, Wyllie {{continued}} to sail and paint. His work on the Trafalgar panorama was physically difficult, {{with much of the}} painting being done from <b>step</b> <b>ladders,</b> and on most days the work lasted from 10:00 until 17:00 with a short sleep at lunchtime. His daughter Aileen later remarked [...] "At the time it seemed natural, but now that I am old, I cannot think how he did those hours on ladders in his 79th year." [...] Wyllie died on 6 April 1931 at 102 Fellows Road, Primrose Hill, London, and is buried at St Mary's church, within the grounds of Portchester Castle.|$|R

50|$|It {{began as}} part of Paris, granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1771 to Captain Joshua Fuller and his company of 64 {{soldiers}} as payment for their service to the colony. First settled in 1779, the land was considered superior for pasturage and hay crops, and orchards were large and productive.Mills were built along the Little Androscoggin River. The Paris Manufacturing Company, which was started modestly by Henry Franklin Morton in 1861 at West Sumner, grew into an important manufacturer. Near the Grand Trunk Railway depot in West Paris, it built a factory to make products including sleds, skis, wagons, <b>step</b> <b>ladders,</b> wheelbarrows, ironing boards, children's rolltop desks and other furniture.|$|R
