50|$|Habib ibn Abi Obeida's army arrived {{too late}} to prevent the {{massacre}} of the nobles. Unable {{to take on the}} Berbers by himself, he withdrew his army to Tlemcen to pick up reserves, only to find that city in disarray. The Umayyad garrison commander, Ibn al-Mughira, had, in a state of panic, initiated a series of indiscriminate massacres in a pre-emptive effort to quell an uprising, and ended up provoking that uprising himself. Bewildered and angry, Habib let his fury fall on Musa ibn Abi Khalid, an Umayyad captain who had bravely <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> collecting loyal <b>forces.</b> Accusing him of causing the uprising, Habib ordered Musa's hand and leg chopped off.|$|R
50|$|During the Japanese Occupation of Malaya, the Chinese {{dominated}} Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army conducted {{guerrilla warfare}} against the Japanese occupiers. As only the regular Malay Regiment led by British officers had acquitted itself well until the surrender in Singapore (February 1942), the British {{felt it was}} possible to involve Malays in the resistance against the Japanese but only with extensive training and by working in close co-operation with the <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> British <b>forces.</b> The British desperately needed Malay resistance fighters to operate in Malay dominated areas. During the Japanese Occupation, a number of local Malays formed resistance groups and carried out guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. Resistance units in Pahang were called WATANIAH, derived from the Arabic word WATAN (state). The Wataniah was led by Yeop Mahidin Bin Mohamed Shafiff (known as the Father of Wataniah). Force 136 of the Special Operations Executive was amongst the British formations that co-ordinated the Malayan resistance (including the Wataniah movement) against the Japanese.|$|R
50|$|Gates formed {{up before}} first light. On his right flank he placed Mordecai Gist's 2nd Maryland (three regiments) and the Delaware Regiment, with Baron de Kalb in overall {{command of the}} right wing. On his left flank, he placed Caswell's 1,800 North Carolina militia, left of them were Stevens' 700 Virginians, and behind the Virginians were 120 of Armand's Legion. Gates and staff <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> the reserve <b>force,</b> Smallwood's the 1st Maryland Regiment, about 200 yards behind the battle line. Thus, {{the total number of}} Continentals on the field {{numbered}} 900. Gates placed seven guns along the line, manned by about 100 men. Also present, but whose disposition was unknown, were 70 mounted volunteer South Carolinians. Gates' formation, though a typical British practice of the time, placed his weakest troops against the most experienced British regiments, while his best troops would face only the weaker elements of the British forces.|$|R

It examines the negotiations and changes in family life of those who <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> by looking at spouses', siblings' and parent-children's relations. First, it analyzes the perceptions and imaginaries that non-migrants hold of migrants' life abroad and introduces three possible outcomes for its conceptualization: positive overcompensation, neutral perspective and negative compensation. It also analyzes the positive changes in family dynamics for the individual self-perceptions of those who <b>stay</b> <b>behind.</b> Subsequently, it discusses the role played by the extended family in the household arrangements following emigration. Lastly, it explores the relations and adjustments taking place between return-migrants and those who <b>stayed</b> <b>behind...</b>|$|R
