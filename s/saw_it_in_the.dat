5|$|The 1863 Salon des Refusés was {{the same}} {{exhibition}} where Édouard Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe caused a scandal, yet the attention given to Whistler's White Girl was even greater. The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola's novel L'Œuvre (1886). The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris. It was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} {{plan for}} 2nd Army Group saw the 1st Army in the Bačka region between the Danube and the Tisza, with formations centred around {{the towns of}} Sombor, Bačka Topola and Senta, with the 3rd Cavalry Division held in depth, south of the Danube in the Fruška Gora region. The 2nd Army deployment plan <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baranya and Slavonia regions between Slatina and the Danube, with its formations positioned south of the Drava from just east of Slatina to Valpovo, and around the towns of Osijek and Vinkovci. Of the formations of the 2nd Army Group, two infantry divisions of the 2nd Army were partly mobilised, while the remaining two infantry divisions, the 3rd Cavalry Division, and the two brigade-strength infantry detachments had only commenced mobilisation. To {{the right of the}} 1st Army Group was the 6th Army, an independent formation that was responsible for the defence of the Yugoslav Banat region east of the Tisza. The boundary with the 6th Army ran just to the east of the Tisza to the confluence with the Danube, then south across the Sava through Obrenovac. On the left flank of the 2nd Army Group was the 1st Army Group, which was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia, along the Yugoslav–Hungarian west of Slatina, Yugoslav–Reich and Yugoslav–Italian borders. The army group boundary ran from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka.|$|E
25|$|Although {{others said}} while Whistler's {{painting}} was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting Le déjeuner sur l'herbe.

25|$|As captain against Frank Worrell's West Indian cricket team in England in 1963 Dexter {{was able}} to loosen up after the Ashes and they played an {{exciting}} Test series. After losing the First Test, in the Second Test at Lord's England's first innings rested heavily on Dexter's hard-hitting 70 off 75 balls when he took on the West Indian fast bowlers Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall in an innings that was remembered by all who <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second innings Colin Cowdrey came out to bat with a broken arm with victory, defeat or a tie still possible {{in the last two}} balls, but David Allen blocked them for a draw. England levelled the series in the Third Test thanks to Dexter (4/38 and 1/7) and Fred Trueman (5/75 and 7/44), but lost the last two Tests and the series. In 1964 Dexter was again in charge in the rain-soaked 1964 Ashes series. Famously in the decisive Third Test at Headingley he removed the off-spinner Fred Titmus after he had taken three wickets to reduce Australia to 187/7, still 81 runs behind England. Dexter took the new ball and gave it to Fred Trueman who bowled a series of bouncers which Peter Burge hooked and pulled to 160, hoisting Australia to 389 and a 7 wicket win. Although the change made sense as the new batsman Neil Hawke was fragile against fast bowling and Trueman, the greatest wicket-taker in the world at the time, was playing on his home ground Dexter was heavily criticised for a decision which obviously lost the series. In the Fourth Test Australia made 656/8, but thanks to a stand of 246 between Ken Barrington (256) and Dexter (174) England reached 611 and avoided defeat. It {{was the first time that}} two teams had made 600 runs in an innings in a Test, and their fortunes gripped the cricketing nation, but the inevitable draw meant that Australia retained the Ashes. As some consolation Dexter led Sussex to the finals of the Gillette Cup in 1963 and 1964, and won both, the first trophies in the county's history.|$|E

It was {{discovered}} independently by two Japanese amateur astronomers on September 18, 1965, within 15 minutes of each other, and quickly recognised as a Kreutz sungrazer. [...] It brightened rapidly over the following four weeks as it approached the Sun, and reached apparent magnitude 2 by October 15. [...] Its perihelion passage occurred on October 21, and observers across the world easily <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daytime sky. [...] A few hours before perihelion passage on October 21 it had a visible magnitude from −10 to −11, comparable to {{the first quarter of}} the Moon and brighter than any other comet seen since 1106. A day after perihelion its magnitude decreased to just −4.|$|E
500|$|Ancient Greek {{medicine}} recognizes obesity as {{a medical}} disorder, and records that the Ancient Egyptians <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way. Hippocrates wrote that [...] "Corpulence {{is not only a}} disease itself, but the harbinger of others". The Indian surgeon Sushruta (6th century BCE) related obesity to diabetes and heart disorders. He recommended physical work to help cure it and its side effects. For most of human history mankind struggled with food scarcity. Obesity has thus historically been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity. It was common among high officials in Europe in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations. In the 17th century, English medical author Tobias Venner is credited with being {{one of the first to}} refer to the term as a societal disease in a published English language book.|$|E
500|$|The {{actions of}} the {{committee}} were designed to allow for improved ties between the two countries, although that goal was not shared by {{a large segment of}} Republicans. [...] McCain pressed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, partly because it was [...] "a time to heal ... it's a way of ending the war; it's time to move on," [...] and partly because he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. national interest to do so, in particular envisioning Vietnam as a valuable regional counterbalance against China. [...] In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and McCain, that {{called for an end to}} the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization. [...] During his time on the committee and afterward, McCain was vilified as a fraud, traitor, or [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] by some POW/MIA activists who believed that large numbers of American servicemen were still being held against their will in Southeast Asia. They were angry that McCain did not share their belief and that he sought to normalize relations with Vietnam. [...] McCain's high profile on the Vietnam issue also cost him the friendship of some fellow former POWs; [...] McCain and 1992 independent presidential candidate Ross Perot, who had helped McCain's wife Carol during her husband's captivity, also had a falling out over the POW/MIA issue, which then extended to Perot blasting McCain's remarriage to Cindy McCain. [...] In return, McCain attacked those he saw as profiteers exploiting the families of those missing in action.|$|E

500|$|On 18 March 1941, the 2/3rd Battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard HMS Gloucester, {{arriving}} in Greece and {{landing in the}} port of Piraeus on the following day, after a 22-hour voyage during which their convoy had been attacked numerous times by Axis aircraft. After {{the invasion of the}} country on 6 April, they were moved north to attempt to turn back the German forces. The following day they occupied Veria, and on 12 April the 6th Division was grouped together with the 2nd New Zealand Division and a lone British brigade to form an Anzac Corps. This formation did not last long, however, as the Greek government requested Allied forces withdraw from Greece on 16 April before ceasing organised resistance on 18 April. Due to a series of withdrawals elsewhere, the battalion was forced to pull back from its positions at Veria and did not come into contact with the Germans until 18 April when they attempted to block passage of the Tempe Gorge. Fighting alongside the 2/2nd Battalion and New Zealanders, the rearguard action was successful and enabled the Allies to withdraw to the south. Brigadier Arthur Allen, commander of the 16th Brigade, later wrote of this encounter: [...] "it was a fantastic battle. Everyone was on top, with no time to dig in, and all in the front line, including artillery, Bren carriers and infantry, as well as headquarters, with transport only yards in the rear. Some confusion could be expected in the circumstances, with every weapon firing and aircraft almost continually strafing from above. If you <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cinema you would say the author had never seen battle." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Crown of Castile conquered Gibraltar in the 15th century, the {{aqueduct}} was renovated {{and a pair}} of reservoirs {{was constructed}} around 1694. A medieval reservoir, Nun's Well, still survives at Europa Point in the far south of Gibraltar, though it is unclear who built it and when. When Thomas James <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1770s, he recorded that it was infested with leeches.

2500|$|The {{reference}} to the Antichrist {{is not intended to}} refer to the biblical Antichrist but is rather an attack on the [...] "slave morality" [...] and apathy of Western Christianity. Nietzsche's basic claim is that Christianity (as he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West) is a poisoner of western culture and perversion of the words of and practice of Jesus. In this light, the provocative title is mainly expressing Nietzsche's animus toward Christianity, as such. In this book, Nietzsche is very critical of institutionalized religion and its priest class, from which he himself was descended. The majority of the book is a systematic, logical and detailed attack upon the interpretations of Christ's words by St. Paul and those who followed him.|$|E
