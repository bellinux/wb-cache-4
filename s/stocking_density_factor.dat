In addition, PUFA n - 6 were also increased in the higher <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> group, mainly due to an increase in arachidonic acid (AA) and docosadienoic acid (22 : 2 n - 6). In the muscle polar fraction, the saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) decreased in the animals from the higher <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> group, and this reduction was compensated by an increase in PUFA n - 3 and PUFA n - 6, mainly the FA with 20 - 22 carbons (20 : 4 n - 6 : 22 : 4 :n - 6; 22 : 5 n - 6, 22 : 5 n - 3, and 22 : 6 n - 3). A different profile was observed for the C 18 PUFAs, mainly 18 : 2 n - 6 and 18 : 4 n - 6, which were higher in the lower <b>density</b> <b>stocking</b> group.

The study was based on a 4 -year-old Eucalyptus grandis trial planted in south-eastern Queensland in March 1999 by Greenfield Resource Options P/L. <b>Stocking</b> <b>densities</b> of 250, 1, 000, 5, 000 and 10, 000 stems/ha allowed growth traits in extreme stockings to be compared. High <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> led to greater stand growth and also greater inequality in tree size. The largest trees in high <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> were smaller than those in low <b>stocking</b> <b>densities,</b> however high <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> had more trees in the largest cohort and they were more uniform in size. Consequently the total stem volume of the largest 1, 000 st/ha was similar for all <b>stocking</b> <b>densities,</b> and the total stem volume of the remaining trees increased with <b>stocking</b> <b>density.</b> The allocation of tree biomass skewed away from crown production and towards stem production as <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> (general competition) increased and as stem diameter (competitive status) decreased. Dominant trees in high <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> had similar aboveground biomass accumulation per unit leaf area compared to dominant trees in low <b>stocking</b> <b>densities,</b> but had a larger proportion of biomass allocated to the stem when compared to the crown. Dominant trees in high <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> therefore had similar tree growth efficiency but better stem growth efficiency than dominant trees in low <b>stocking</b> <b>densities.</b> Increased competition appeared to restrict the growth of dominant trees by restricting resource capture rather than by reducing the efficiency of growth, since the tree growth efficiency of dominant trees was not affected by competition. Examination of the stem wood structure revealed that the largest trees in high <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> exhibited more desirable wood properties including more uniform wood density, less variability in wood anatomy, and better branch-shed (hence low knot content) than the largest trees in the low <b>stocking</b> <b>densities.</b> This suggests that densely stocked plantations could be of better value for timber production than lightly stocked plantations. The results illustrate the importance of including stand structure in forest research since a failure to do so will underestimate the productivity of the largest trees in densely stocked stands and does not adequately account for the structural benefits of high <b>stocking</b> <b>density.</b> The findings are based on a young plantation, however they indicate that densely stocked plantations could be used to provide an early cash return from a harvested biomass crop with no detrimental effect on a retained solid hardwood crop of the largest 1, 000 st/ha.

40|$|Macrobrachium rosenbergii (de Man 1879) juveniles (0. 4 g) were cultured in {{experimental}} cages (L Ã— W Ã— H: 2. 5 Ã— 1 Ã— 1 m) in Laguna de Bay, the largest {{lake in the}} Philippines. The following <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> at four replicates each were used: 15, 30, 60 and 90 prawns m âˆ’ 2 of cage bottom. The mean sizes at harvest after 5 months of culture ranged from 14. 3 g for the highest <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> to 26. 3 g for the lowest. The mean size at harvest, daily growth rate and size class distribution were significantly influenced by <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> with those at the lowest <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> showing significantly better growth and overall proportion of larger prawns. Heterogeneous individual growth (HIG) was fairly evident in all treatments. The percentage of blue-clawed males was not influenced by treatment but the mean weight was significantly higher in the lower <b>stocking</b> <b>densities.</b> Both the percentage and mean weight of berried females were significantly higher in the lowest <b>stocking</b> <b>density.</b> Survival was {{the highest in the}} lower <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> (55. 3 %, 54. 0 %, 52. 7 % and 36. 9 % for 15, 30, 60 and 90 prawns m âˆ’ 2 respectively). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) improved with decreasing <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> ranging from 2. 1 to 3. As expected, yield per cropping increased with <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> and ranged from 450 to 1089 g m âˆ’ 2 yr âˆ’ 1 of actual cage area. Production values obtained in the cage cultured M. rosenbergii were comparable to or even higher than those reported from pond culture, given that the <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> used in this study were generally higher than in ponds. The results show that the farming of M. rosenbergii in cages in lakes is a viable alternative to pond culture and has the potential of improve aquaculture production in lakeshore fish farming communities.

40|$|Increased <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> are {{frequently}} reported to depress chicken growth performance, but the mechanisms behind this {{are not fully}} understood. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> on growth performance and digestive microbiota, known to be sensitive to environmental factors. Chickens were reared at 2 <b>stocking</b> <b>densities,</b> 12 or 17 birds/m(2). Growth performance was recorded between d 1 and 39, and litter was scored for quality on d 25, 31, and 37. Digestive microbiota was analyzed along the digestive tract (crop, ileum, ceca) of 3 - and 6 -wk-old chickens by using 2 molecular approaches: a qualitative method (fingerprinting by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis) and a quantitative method (real-time PCR). An increase in <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> was found to negatively affect the feed conversion ratio (+ 3. 1 %) and depress the daily BW gain of broilers (- 5. 5 %) during the period from d 32 to 39 (P <= 0. 05). Litter quality was reduced with the high <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> as early as d 25. At 3 wk of age, <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> strongly affected the fingerprint profiles of the bacterial community, with the highest modifications observed in the crop and ceca (R analysis of similarity = 0. 77 and 0. 69, respectively, P <= 0. 05). At 6 wk of age, significant differences in the fingerprint profiles between the <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> appeared in the crop and ceca (R analysis of similarity = 0. 52 and 0. 27, respectively, P <= 0. 05). The abundance of bacterial groups targeted by real-time PCR was affected by <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> but only to a limited extent. Because digestive microbiota may have consequences on the physiology of the digestive tract, its modification by an increase in <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> may be involved in the reduced growth performance of the bird...|$|R

However, higher <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> result in high microbial counts, creating food safety concerns, {{especially with the}} advent of BSE in recent years. This study explores the impact of production and output price uncertainty on optimal <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> when microbial shedding presents a food safety problem. The optimal grazing pressure is based on the expected utility maximization framework, and a stochastic linear response and plateau production function. Results show that uncertainty and food safety problems lead to lower <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> and lower profits. However, reducing the potential incidence of microbial shedding guarantees future profits to the enterprise, and continuity in production.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> on {{production}} of Mugil platanus fingerlings in laboratory was analyzed. Five <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> were evaluated: 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 mullet/L. After 28 days, the highest growth rate was reported for animals reared {{at the lowest}} <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> (1 mullet/L). Survival rate and water quality were also higher at the lowest <b>stocking</b> <b>density.</b> Although more fingerlings were produced at 10 mullet/L, greater number of animals decreased the water quality, which was reflected in their reduced growth and survival rates. M. platanus fingerlings should be reared in commercial production at intermediate <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> (3 - 5 mullet/L) but higher water exchange rates are recommended for lower ammonia concentration. Key words: fish culture, <b>stocking</b> <b>density,</b> mullet, Mugil platanus. RESUMO. Efeito da densidade de estocagem no cultivo de tainha, Mugil platanus (Günther, 1880) em laboratório.

Our hypothesis was that the high <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> applied under commercial conditions hampers correct learning and performance of mating behaviour. Broiler breeders (Ross 308) were housed at standard <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> (14 females/m 2 or 8 males/m 2 during rearing, 8 birds/m 2 during production) or low <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> (7 females/m 2 or 5 males/m 2 during rearing, 5 birds/m 2 during production) from day 1 to 60 weeks of age. Standard management was applied. During production there were 10 % males per group and group size was 150 birds. The experiment was of a 2 x 2 factorial design, resulting in 4 treatment groups: SL (standard <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> during rearing, low <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> during production), SS, LS and LL; N= 8 groups/treatment.
