The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering interest rates and providing cheap loans {{of more than one}} trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks. On 6 September 2012, the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, through some yield lowering Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E

5|$|While Spain was {{neutral in}} World War II, Franco's sympathies {{remained}} with the Axis powers and he considered entering {{the war on}} their side. He maintained good relations with Nazi Germany and many Francoists remained sympathetic to Nazism. This led Spain to be shunned by the international community, especially the Western European democracies and the United States, in the immediate post-war period. Europe-wide popular demonstrations against the Franco government occurred in 1946. In the 1950s, a thawing of relations occurred as Cold War tensions escalated and Franco's hostility to communism made him a reliable ally. This would result in reluctance {{on the part of}} the US government to <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> which could destabilise the Franco government.|$|E

40|$|We examine measure-theoretic {{properties}} of spaces constructed using certain technique of Todorčević. We {{show that the}} existence of strictly positive measures on such spaces depends on combinatorial {{properties of}} certain families of slaloms. As a corollary we get that if add(N) = non(M) then there is a non-separable space which <b>supports</b> a <b>measure</b> and which cannot be mapped continuously onto [0, 1]^ω_ 1. Also, without any additional axioms we prove that there is a non-separable growth of ω <b>supporting</b> a <b>measure</b> {{and that there is a}} compactification L of ω with growth of such properties and such that the natural copy of c_ 0 is complemented in C(L).

25|$|The Boeing P-8 Poseidon (formerly the Multimission Maritime Aircraft or MMA) is a {{military}} aircraft developed for the United States Navy (USN). The aircraft has been developed by Boeing Defense, Space & Security, modified from the 737-800ERX. The P-8 conducts anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASUW), and shipping interdiction, along with an early warning self-protection (EWSP) ability, otherwise known as electronic <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> (ESM).
