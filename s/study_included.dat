5|$|In 2014, a study {{including}} {{the description of}} Zhanghenglong {{was published in the}} journal PLOS ONE. The <b>study</b> <b>included</b> an almost complete cladogram of hadrosauroid relationships, including Corythosaurus as the most derived lambeosaurine, as sister taxon to Hypacrosaurus. The below cladogram is a simplified version including only Lambeosaurini.|$|E
5|$|The modern view of synapsid {{relationships}} {{was proposed}} by paleontologist Robert R. Reisz in 1986, whose <b>study</b> <b>included</b> features mostly {{found in the}} skull {{rather than in the}} postcranial skeleton. Dimetrodon is still considered a sphenacodont under this phylogeny, but varanodontids are now considered more basal synapsids, falling outside clade Sphenacodontia. Within Sphenacodontia is the group Sphenacodontoidea, which in turn contains Sphenacodontidae and Therapsida. Sphenacodontidae is the group containing Dimetrodon and several other sail-backed synapsids like Sphenacodon and Secodontosaurus, while Therapsida includes mammals and their mostly Permian and Triassic relatives.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The <b>study</b> <b>included</b> the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in the space program, developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E

5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of <b>study</b> <b>included</b> the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler radar station in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall {{over the course of}} a day led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the <b>study</b> <b>included</b> the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, making 35 orbits {{before it was}} destroyed during a controlled impact with Jupiter on September 21, 2003. During this period, it gathered {{a large amount of}} information about the Jovian system; the amount of information was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna failed. The major events during the eight-year <b>study</b> <b>included</b> multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so). It also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 and the sending of an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} more than 200,000 women came to the result that {{admission}} to inpatient care during pregnancy was associated with an 18-fold increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the stay, and a 6-fold increase in risk in the four weeks after discharge, compared with pregnant women who did not require hospitalization.

25|$|However, it {{has been}} shown that the widely {{accepted}} WHO and American Diabetes Association diagnostic cutoff for diabetes of a fasting plasma glucose â‰¥ 7.0mmol/l (126mg/dl) does not accurately identify diabetic retinopathy among patients. The cohort <b>study</b> <b>included</b> a multi-ethnic, cross-sectional adult population sample in the US, as well as two cross-sectional adult populations in Australia. For the US-based component of the study, the sensitivity was 34.7% and specificity was 86.6%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (15.8% had diabetic retinopathy), this leads to a positive predictive value of 32.7% and negative predictive value of 87.6%.|$|E

25|$|Venlafaxine is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which pumps {{it out of}} the brain. The gene encoding P-gp, ABCB1, has the SNP rs2032583, with alleles C and T. The {{majority of}} people (about 70% of Europeans and 90% of East Asians) have the TT variant. A 2007 study found that carriers of at least one C allele (variant CC or CT) are 7.72 times more likely than non-carriers to achieve remission after 4 weeks of treatment with amitriptyline, citalopram, paroxetine or venlafaxine (all P-gp substrates). The <b>study</b> <b>included</b> patients with mood disorders other than major depression, such as bipolar II; the ratio is 9.4 if these other disorders are excluded. At the 6-week mark, 75% of C-carriers had remitted, compared to only 38% of non-carriers.|$|E

The study found that 39% of Mets fans lived in one of the five boroughs of New York, 49% in the tri-state area outside the city and 12% elsewhere. Mets fans {{were more likely to be}} found in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Long Island counties of Nassau and Suffolk, whereas Manhattan, the Bronx, New Jersey, Connecticut, and the counties of Westchester and Rockland, as well as the upper Hudson Valley and the upstate New York region, leaned more towards the Yankees.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{clinical}} trial at Massachusetts General Hospital used the cancer drug Bevacizumab (commercial name: Avastin) to treat 10 patients with neurofibromatosis type II. The result {{was published in}} The New England Journal of Medicine. Of the ten patients treated with bevacizumab, tumours shrank in 9 of them, with the median best response rate of 26%. Hearing improved {{in some of the}} patients, but improvements were not strongly correlated with tumour shrinkage. Bevacizumab works by cutting the blood supply to the tumours and thus depriving them of their growth vector. Side effects during the <b>study</b> <b>included</b> alanine aminotransferase, proteinuria, and hypertension (elevated blood pressure) among others. A separate trial, published in The Neuro-oncology Journal, show 40% tumour reduction in the two patients with NF2, along with significant hearing improvement.|$|E
25|$|The DoD {{working group}} {{conducting}} the study considered {{the impact that}} lifting the ban would have on unit cohesion and effectiveness, good order and discipline, and military morale. The <b>study</b> <b>included</b> a survey that revealed significant differences between respondents who believed they had served with homosexual troops {{and those who did}} not believe they had.In analyzing such data, the DoD working group concluded that it was actually generalized perceptions of homosexual troops that led to the perceived unrest that would occur without DADT. Ultimately, the study deemed the overall risk to military effectiveness of lifting the ban to be low. Citing the ability of the armed forces to adjust to the previous integration of African-Americans and women, the DoD study asserted that the United States military could adjust as had it before in history without an impending serious effect.|$|E
