This incident appeared to involve PCDDs and not PCBs. Dioxins were found in animal feed and eggs in many farms. The maximum values were exceeded twofold in feed and maximally fourfold in some individual eggs. Thus the incident was minor {{as compared with the}} Belgian crisis in 1999, and delivery bans were rapidly cleared.|$|E
60|$|Imagine the {{difference}} in Deronda's state of mind when he left England and {{when he returned to}} it. He had set out for Genoa in total uncertainty how far the actual bent of his wishes and affections would be encouraged--how far the claims revealed to him might draw him into new paths, far away from the tracks his thoughts had lately been pursuing with a consent of desire which uncertainty made dangerous. He came back with something like a discovered charter warranting the inherited right that his ambition had begun to yearn for: he came back with what was better than freedom--with a duteous bond which his experience had been preparing him to accept gladly, even if it had been attended with no promise of satisfying a secret passionate longing never yet allowed to grow into a hope. But now he dared avow to himself the hidden selection of his love. Since the hour when he left the house at Chelsea in full-hearted silence under the effect of Mirah's farewell look and words--their exquisite appealingness stirring in him that deep-laid care for womanhood which had begun when his own lip was like a girl's--her hold on his feeling had helped him to be blameless in word and deed under the difficult circumstances we know of. There seemed no likelihood that he could ever woo this creature who had become dear to him amidst associations that forbade wooing; yet she had taken her place in his soul as a beloved type--reducing the power of other fascination and making a difference in it that became deficiency. The influence had been continually strengthened. It had lain in the course of poor Gwendolen's lot that her dependence on Deronda tended to rouse in him the enthusiasm of self-martyring pity rather than of personal love, and his less constrained tenderness flowed with the fuller stream toward an indwelling image in all things unlike Gwendolen. Still more, his relation to Mordecai had brought with it a new nearness to Mirah which was not the less agitating because there was no apparent change in his position toward her; and she had inevitably been bound up in all the thoughts that made him shrink from an issue disappointing to her brother. This process had not gone on unconsciously in Deronda: he was conscious of it as we are of some covetousness {{that it would be better}} to nullify by encouraging other thoughts than to give it the insistency of confession even to ourselves: but the jealous fire had leaped out at Hans's pretensions, and when his mother accused him of being in love with a Jewess any evasion suddenly seemed an infidelity. His mother had compelled him to a decisive acknowledgment of his love, as Joseph Kalonymos had compelled him to a definite expression of his resolve. This new state of decision wrought on Deronda with a force which surprised even himself. There was a release of all the energy which had long been spent in <b>self-checking</b> and suppression because of doubtful conditions; and he was ready to laugh at his own impetuosity when, as he neared England on his way from Mainz, he felt the remaining distance more and more of an obstruction. It was as if he had found an added soul in finding his ancestry--his judgment no longer wandering in the mazes of impartial sympathy, but choosing, with that partiality which is man's best strength, the closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical--exchanging that bird's eye reasonableness which soars to avoid preference and loses all sense of quality for the generous reasonableness of drawing shoulder to shoulder with men of like inheritance. He wanted now to be again with Mordecai, to pour forth instead of restraining his feeling, to admit agreement and maintain dissent, and all the while to find Mirah's presence without the embarrassment of obviously seeking it, to see her in the light of a new possibility, to interpret her looks and words from a new starting-point. He was not greatly alarmed about the effect of Hans's attentions, but he had a presentiment that her feeling toward himself had from the first lain in a channel from which it was not likely to be diverted into love. To astonish a woman by turning into her lover when she has been thinking of you merely as a Lord Chancellor is what a man naturally shrinks from: he is anxious to create an easier transition.|$|E

Participants were 48 fifth- and sixth-grade students who were randomly assigned to 3 experimental groups (reciprocal style, <b>self-check</b> style, sequential use of the reciprocal and the <b>self-check</b> styles). The results showed that students were moderately accurate in peer- and self-recording with a tendency to overestimate their performance. No difference among the 3 experimental groups in recording accuracy was found. Students who received more accurate feedback outperformed in the chest pass test those who received less accurate feedback.

40|$|Teaching of {{traditional}} dances is mainly done through an educational process where {{imitation of a}} prototype model prevails. In reciprocal and <b>self-check</b> teaching styles, part of the decisions is handed to the students so they are known as student-centered teaching methods. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the effects of the reciprocal, the <b>self-check</b> and the command teaching styles in students’: a) intrinsic-extrinsic motivation, b) enjoyment and c) perceived motivational climate, while being taught Greek traditional dances. An independent group’s post-test comparison experimental design was used in the present study. Seventy university students (19 - 20 years old) were divided into three teaching style groups: a) reciprocal (n= 21, nine males and twelve females), b) <b>self-check</b> (n= 25, eleven males and fourteen females) and c) command (as control group n= 24, eleven males and thirteen females) and were taught Greek traditional dances with the respective teaching style. All scales had acceptable levels of internal consistency (a>. 74). Α two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was used to examine the differences among the three teaching styles and between males and females on the aforementioned factors. Overall, results show that the <b>self-check</b> style triggers a significantly greater increase in intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, enjoyment and autonomy in comparison to the reciprocal and command-teaching styles. It is also connected with a decrease in external motivation and amotivation. Male students seem to opt for the <b>self-check</b> style due to it reinforcing or reducing psychological factors in contrast with the other styles (p<. 05) while female students have a preference for the reciprocal style as well (p<. 05). The implementation of the reciprocal and the <b>self-check</b> styles in teaching traditional dances creates a positive atmosphere which is deemed extremely important for an efficient and qualitative lesson. © 2015, JPES...|$|R

50|$|The barcode {{itself does}} not contain a check digit (in {{contrast}} to—for instance—Code 128), {{but it can be}} considered <b>self-checking</b> on the grounds that a single erroneously interpreted bar cannot generate another valid character. Possibly the most serious drawback of Code 39 is its low data density: It requires more space to encode data in Code 39 than, for example, in Code 128. This means that very small goods cannot be labeled with a Code 39 based barcode. However, Code 39 is still used by some postal services, although the Universal Postal Union recommends using Code 128 in all cases and can be decoded with virtually any barcode reader. One advantage of Code 39 is that since {{there is no need to}} generate a check digit, it can easily be integrated into existing printing system by adding a barcode font to the system or printer and then printing the raw data in that font.|$|E
50|$|Analog {{verification}} {{is built}} {{on the idea that}} transistor level simulation will always be too slow to provide adequate functional verification. Instead, it is necessary to build simple and efficient models of the blocks that make up the analog portion of the design and use those to verify the design. Those models are typically written in Verilog or Verilog-AMS, but could also be written in VHDL or VHDL-AMS. However, simply using a simple functional model is not sufficient. It is also necessary to build a comprehensive <b>self-checking</b> testbench, that thoroughly exercises the design and compare its response against a previously written specification for the design. Furthermore, this testbench should be applied in turn to both the model and the design. In this case, the design is represented with a transistor-level schematic. If both the model and the design pass all tests, and if the testbench is comprehensive, then this confirms that the model is consistent with the design and that the design is consistent with the specification.|$|E
