We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table with us, and the three of us worked {{out the rest of the}} story together.|$|E

A melody he played caught the attention of his wife, and he began to improvise variations on it in styles which reflected the character of some of his friends. These improvisations, expanded and orchestrated, became the Enigma Variations. Elgar considered including variations portraying Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, but was unable to assimilate their musical styles without pastiche, and dropped the idea.|$|E

25|$|Zhang Fei {{was from}} Zhuo Commandery (涿郡), {{which is in}} present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei. In the 180s, {{towards the end of}} the Han dynasty, he and Guan Yu became Liu Bei's followers. As Guan Yu was many years older than Zhang Fei, Zhang {{regarded}} him as an elder brother. When Liu Bei was later appointed as the Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan (平原; present-day Pingyuan County, Dezhou, Shandong) by the Han imperial court, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu served as Majors of Separate Command (別部司馬) under him. The three of them shared a brotherly-like relationship, to the point of sharing the same room. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu also stood guard beside Liu Bei when he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> meetings.

25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression, and {{found it difficult to}} both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because [...] "it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; every time I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a drum set, I would think of that." ...|$|E

Needless to say, I grabbed it. However, we still needed lyrics and Tim dutifully began to put words to the music. The {{vast majority of the}} original Evita score had been done this way: music first, lyrics afterwards. After many weeks of nail biting, Tim was finally cajoled into writing the lyrics that now accompany the music to [...] "You Must Love Me".|$|E

[...] Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel, [...] "Just listen to that! That's old-time religious carnival music!" [...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a table and started writing... And I just got carried away with the whole thing... I just started writing and I couldn't stop. After a period of time, I forgot {{what it was all}} about, and I started trying {{to get back to the}} beginning [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{later said}} that the lyrics take duality as their theme. The song {{originated}} when, {{in response to a}} question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting, McCartney <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said. The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] to be the single's A-side, but McCartney and the band's producer, George Martin, opted for the more commercial-sounding [...] "Hello, Goodbye". The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America. Due to recently imposed regulations against lip-syncing in Britain, none of the clips were aired there.|$|E

500|$|On February 5, 2017, Gaga was the {{headliner}} of the Super Bowl LI halftime {{show and}} [...] "Million Reasons" [...] {{was part of}} the set list. The singer <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her piano inquiring about the audience and started belting the track. At the end she stepped in-between the audience and ended the song by hugging a woman. Tracy Gilchrist from The Advocate commended Gaga and found that the lyrics referred to the political environment in the United States following the election of Donald Trump. During her set at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Gaga performed the Andrelli remix of [...] "Million Reasons". The song serves as the encore to the ongoing Joanne World Tour (2017–2018), with Gaga wearing the pink Joanne hat, a glittery robe coat and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. She starts playing the song on the piano, later standing on top of it.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{singing to}} his own [...] "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," [...] piano accompaniment, such as can be heard on the 1967 {{recording}} of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions, because [...] "it was always a measure of his engagement when he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the keyboard to play." [...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it {{to a level of}} spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 5, 2011, Ocean {{performed}} [...] "I Miss You" [...] at the House of Blues in New Orleans. Dressed in a {{black suit}} with a red-and-white bandana around his head, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> an electric piano to perform it live to end the evening. The crowd also sang along. Alex Rawls of Rolling Stone found his performance to be [...] "warm and soulful". British indie pop band The xx covered the song on February 14, 2013 during their concert in Austin, Texas and later posted the cover on their official blog. Their cover of the song was a duet between Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim accompanied by spare guitar and bass. Their cover of the song was described as [...] "great" [...] by Jenn Pelly of Pitchfork Media, while Sam Weiss of Complex magazine praised the performance saying that the band made the song sound similar to their own material from the album Coexist (2012). Chris Martins of Spin magazine commented that [...] "It's exactly what you'd expect to hear, and it's exactly as beautiful as you'd hope it would be." ...|$|E

500|$|Paul McCartney said {{he came up}} {{with the}} title [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] during one of his first visits to his {{property}} High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road [...] "stretching up into the hills" [...] in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction his personal life was taking in the autumn of 1968, after he had separated from his fiancée Jane Asher, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: [...] "I just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining {{it was going to be}} done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration." ...|$|E
500|$|The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, {{involving}} Levi Richardson, {{a buffalo}} hunter, and [...] "Cockeyed Frank" [...] Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving's wife Mattie, {{and the two}} began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a long table, Richardson turned around and took {{a seat at the}} same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.|$|E
500|$|According to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, [...] "At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and {{director}} Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to inform {{him he was}} on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately {{and go to work}} on Gone with the Wind, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht {{was in the middle of}} working on the film At the Circus for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick {{and director}} Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, [...] "After each scene had been performed and discussed, I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic." ...|$|E

500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides {{working on}} the Dictionary, Johnson also wrote {{numerous}} essays, sermons, and poems during these nine years. In 1750, he decided to produce a series of essays under the title The Rambler that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter Joshua Reynolds: [...] "I {{was at a loss}} how to name it. I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best that occurred, and I took it." [...] These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in The Rambler were to ask [...] "that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others." [...] The popularity of The Rambler took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship. One friend, the novelist Charlotte Lennox, includes a defence of The Rambler in her novel The Female Quixote (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, [...] "you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young, a Richardson, or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule." [...] (Book VI, Chapter XI) Later, she claims Johnson as [...] "the greatest Genius in the present Age." ...|$|E
