According to Cheung, sharecropping is not necessarily exploitative. It will achieve the same efficient allocation as labor markets under competition and zero transaction costs (Cheung, 1968). In the presence of transaction costs, sharecropping can be efficient by lowering the monitoring costs of wage contracts and increasing risk-sharing benefits relative to rent contracts (Cheung, 1969).|$|E

50|$|During the 1990s, the Seahawks' and Mariners' {{respective}} ownership groups {{began to}} question the suitability of the Kingdome as a venue for each team, threatening to relocate unless new, publicly funded stadiums were built. At issue {{was the fact that}} neither team saw their <b>shared</b> <b>tenancy</b> as profitable, as well as the integrity of the stadium's roof as highlighted by the collapse of ceiling tiles onto the seating area before a scheduled Mariners game. As a result, public funding packages for new, purpose-built stadiums for the Mariners and Seahawks were approved in 1995 and 1997, respectively. The Mariners moved to Safeco Field midway through the 1999 season, and the Seahawks temporarily moved to Husky Stadium after the 1999 season.

25|$|The quirks of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, {{including}} the turf {{floor and the}} white roof, gave the Twins a significant home-field advantage that played into their winning the World Series in both 1987 and 1991, {{at least in the}} opinion of their opponents, as the Twins went 12–1 in postseason home games during those two seasons. These were the first two World Series in professional baseball history in which a team won the championship by winning all four home games. (The feat has since been repeated once, by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.) Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team (the Twins had been <b>sharing</b> <b>tenancy</b> in stadiums with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as New Jersey, Las Vegas, Portland, Oregon, the Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina, area, and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals franchise) for elimination due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.|$|R

50|$|This {{means that}} a land {{developer}} can purchase one person's <b>share</b> of a <b>tenancy</b> in common, and then use their position to force a partition sale of the entireproperty.

When choosing the terms of an agrarian contract, the landlord considers the impact of her choice on the probability that she will retain future rights to the rented land. Thus, this model captures the effect of tenure insecurity and property rights on agrarian contracts.

40|$|The land-tenure {{systems in}} rural Asia have been {{experiencing}} {{more or less}} changes due to land policy and rapid technological progress under population pressure. The changes have been most significant in transforming the traditional <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> system.

But actual conditions are different from such a point of view, particularly in case of reciprocal <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> and this type of tenancy system is still widely observed in rural Asia.

40|$|For {{more than}} 2 centuries, economists have been {{interested}} in agricultural contracts, especially landowner-tenant contracts. The early work by Marshall (1890) argued that <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> was inefficient relative to owner cultivation and should not be expected to persist when other arrangements are available. Later D. Gale Johnson (1950) and Cheung (1969) argued that, if landowners can costlessly monitor and enforce tenants’ effort, then <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> can compete effectively with owner cultivation or cash rental. Subsequently, Stiglitz (1974) and Newberry and Stiglitz (1979) introduced principal-agent models in the more realistic case where monitoring is costly to study optimal landowner-tenant risk sharing given the need to study adequate tenant incentives. More recently, Prendergast (2002) suggested that the negative trade-off between effort incentives and risk is tenuous or wrong in principal-agent contracting, including <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> in agriculture. Allen and Lueck (2002) have also argued against risk sharing as a motive for <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> in developed countries {{because of the presence of}} well-developed instruments for risk sharing that are available regardless of tenancy arrangements. Based on transactions costs, they predict that cash rental is more likely than share rental when farmland value is low...|$|E

5000|$|If any joint {{co-owner}} {{deals in}} any way with a property inconsistent with a joint tenancy, that co-owner will be treated as having terminated (sometimes called [...] "breaking") the joint tenancy. The remaining co-owners maintain joint ownership of the remaining interest. The dealing may be a conveyance or sale of the co-owner's share in the property. The position {{in relation to a}} mortgage is more doubtful (see below). For example, if one of three joint co-owners conveys his or her share in the property to a third party, the third party owns a 1/3 <b>share</b> on a <b>tenancy</b> in common basis, while the other two original joint co-owners continue to hold the remaining 2/3s on a joint tenancy basis. This result arises because the [...] "unity of time" [...] is broken: that is, because on the transfer the timing of the new interest is different from the original one. If it is desired to continue to maintain a joint tenancy, then the three original joint co-owners would need to transfer, in the one instrument, the joint interest to the two remaining joint co-owners and the new joint co-owner.|$|R
50|$|While {{complete}} contract {{theory is}} useful for explaining the terms of agricultural contracts, such as the <b>sharing</b> percentages in <b>tenancy</b> contracts (Steven N. S. Cheung, 1969), agency costs are typically needed to explain their forms. For example, piece rates are preferred for labor tasks where quality is readily observable, e.g. sharpened sugar cane stalks ready for planting. Where effort quality is difficult to observe, e.g. the uniformity of broadcast seeds or fertilizer, wage rates tend to be used. Allen and Lueck (2004) have found that farm organization is strongly influenced by diversity {{in the form of}} moral hazard such that crop and household characteristics explain the nature of the farm, even the lack of risk aversion. Roumasset (1995) finds that warranted intensification (e.g. due to land quality) jointly determines optimal specialization on the farm, along with the agency costs of alternative agricultural firms. Where warranted specialization is low, peasant farmers relying on household labor predominate. In high value-per-hectare agriculture, however, there is extensive horizontal specialization by task and vertical specialization between owner, supervisory personnel and workers. These agency theories of farm organization and agricultural allow for multiple shirking possibilities, in contrast to the principal-agency version of sharecropping and agricultural contracts (Stiglitz, 1974, 1988, 1988) which trades-off labor shirking vs. risk-bearing.|$|R
