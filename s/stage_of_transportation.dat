High operating pressure in the pipeline and low temperature cause the formation of methane gas hydrates. The simulation of soil temperature in areas of gas deposits makes it possible to rationally use inhibitors of hydrate formation. The article substantiates the choice of a mathematical model for studying the temperature regime of soils.

30|$|It is {{a matter}} of when AVs will be seen in the road network, and not if. Thus, they are an {{important}} part of transportation planning which requires the development of the appropriate models. The final <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> modeling is the simulation of vehicle movements in the road network which is known as traffic assignment. To that end, there are two major simulations: micro and macro. In micro-simulation, detailed movements and behaviors of the individual vehicles are taken into account in any analysis. The early and basic features of automation (Levels 1 and 2) have prompted some scholars to include AV technologies into micro-simulations [70, 71, 72, 73]. As noted above, the connectedness of AVs has been investigated in signal control policies which resulted in significant reductions in delay [46, 47, 48]. Other studies tend to extend the reach of the existing dynamic traffic assignment models to somehow include AVs [71, 74, 75]. Despite current computational technologies and current modeling knowledge, the scale of micro-simulation is limited to a portion of a city and not the entire city.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of the world’s population suffers from insufficient access to quality health care, partly attributed to the inaccessibility of vaccines for isolated rural areas as well as inconsistent temperature control during transportation. This concept known as “last-mile distribution” {{has become a major}} focus for humanitarian and relief groups, since there is little success in maintaining the efficacy of vaccines during the last <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> To directly address this issue, we have designed and prototyped a mobile cooler that will safely transport and distribute vaccines at their proper storage temperature of 2 - 8 ºC in the developing world, using thermoelectric modules as a solid-state cooling device. Through testing, the second prototype cooler was able to maintain an internal temperature of 3. 3 ºC at a total power consumption of 16. 1 W. This device is actively cooled, unlike current passive cooling containers that utilize ice packs in insulated boxes, unable to control temperature after being opening and closed. The device is primarily used for transportation, though it can be used for storage as long as power is available. This device is intended for young women in developing nations, specifically Uganda, susceptible to human papillomavirus (HPV), in order to deliver the full potency of the vaccine, with the intention to prevent cervical cancer outbreaks. This device has the potential to serve as a successful method of transportation for critical medical supplies...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} local farmers {{was carried out}} to {{identify}} the current curfew practices on cattle at farms and holding grounds in West Timor prior to transport to Java. The survey was also aimed to recognise the potential stressors contributing to body weight loss {{and a lack of}} feed intake in the newly received cattle. There is little known about the current practices on Bali cattle at farms and holding grounds in West Timor before transportation. An interview and observation survey of 150 Bali cattle farmers and 9 traders was conducted in three different regencies throughout West Timor. There was no period of feed and water deprivation practiced by farmers prior to land transportation especially for cattle sold in traditional markets. The deprivation was only held for feedlot cattle for about 18 to 24 hours but then the animals were allowed to access feed and water for approximate 4 to 6 hours before weighing for sale and transportation. The animals were branded with hot iron after being sold. Duration of land transportation was depended on the distance from original farms or holding grounds to ports. As at farms, there were no deprivation practices in holding grounds prior to transport. All of the respondents reported that there was no written rule or protocols provided by government relating to transportation guidelines. In conclusion, the practices of feed and water deprivation, long duration of transportation, branded with hot iron, handling activities, mixing and different types of feeds in some <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> might be potensial stressors contributing to the animals...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate whether}} the accumulation of end products of anaerobic metabolism {{can be used as}} an early indicator of deteriorating conditions during transport of live abalone Haliotis midae. A first series of experiments revealed that the enzyme tauropine dehydrogenase, responsible for the production of tauropine, is present in high activities (54 U g wet weight− 1) in the shell adductor muscle, but D-lactate dehydrogenase, responsible for the production of D-lactate, is the predominantly active enzyme (10 U g wet weight− 1) in foot muscle. The next series of experiments investigated the potential of anaerobic metabolism in the abalone by subjecting the gastropod to either functional anoxia (exercise metabolism) or 6 h of environmental anoxia (seawater gassed with nitrogen). Exercise, primarily powered by the shell adductor muscle, was mainly fueled by glycolysis resulting in the production of tauropine, whereas during 6 h of experimental anoxia, fermentation of glycogen {{led to the formation of}} mainly tauropine in the shell adductor muscle and mainly D-lactate in the foot muscle. The last experiment, investigating changes in these metabolites during simulated (abalone packed in oxygen-filled plastic bags resting on foam sponges soaked in seawater) transportation stress of up to 36 h at 7 and 10 °C, clearly showed that tauropine accumulation in the shell adductor muscle and D-lactate accumulation in the foot muscle is time-dependent. Both metabolites are already produced during the first 6 h of simulated transportation (especially at 10 °C), indicating that aerobic metabolism is impaired at an early <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> Hence, these metabolites can serve as indicators of the conditions abalone were subjected to during transport. Furthermore, abalone use the strategy of metabolic depression in this simulation experiment, as indicated by the decreased glycolytic flux in various tissues...|$|E

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study {{was carried out}} on meat sourced from three slaughterhouses: Dagoretti in Nairobi, Limuru in Limuru and Eldoret Township in Eldoret. The objectives {{of the study were}} to assess the probability of obtaining an Escherichia coli O 157 serotype contaminated carcass at loading, off loading and butchery stages of the transportation value chain, the prevalence of E. coli O 157 serotype contamination of the carcass at the three stages and at the butchery equipment and highlight the unhygienic practices that could lead to the contamination and cross-contamination of the carcasses at each <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> The three slaughterhouses were {{selected on the basis of}} they being the main sources of meat consumed in Nairobi and Eldoret; the former being the capital city of Kenya and the most populated and the latter a stopover town in transit to the western side of Kenya. A total of 250 carcasses were randomly selected for non destructive sampling. Swab samples from a single carcass were obtained from three sites of the carcass, including the rump, the flank and the brisket at the three stages of the transportation value chain; the loading, the off loading and follow up after a day at the butchery. Swab samples were also obtained from four butchery equipment that was constantly in contact with the meat during sale: the cutting/chopping board, the knives/saw, the hooks and the weighing balance. A single carcass delivered to the butchery gave rise to eleven samples giving a total of 2750 samples. E. coli O 157 serotype was isolated through culturing in sorbital MacConkey agar, further purification in MacConkey agar and nutrient agar and then serotyping using card agglutination test. The confirmed serotype were then tested for verotoxin production (both VT 1 and VT 2). The prevalence was determined through running data using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) ver 17. The prevalence data was then modelled to determine the probability of carcass contamination at each stage of sampling. Monte Carlo simulation using winBUGS® software was used to determine the risk of obtaining contaminated carcass at each stage. The meat carrier temperature and humidity were taken using a sling hygrometer. A semi structured questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of the meat transporters and butchery attendants. Observations were made on some of the practices by these key players. The presumptive E. coli O 157 isolates (non sorbital fermentors and with IMViC reaction of ++-) recovery from 2750 samples was 217 (7. 89 %). Only 20 (9. 21 %) of the presumptive isolates were positive for E. coli O 157 serotype. The E. coli O 157 serotype isolates that tested positive for verotoxin production were; one for VT 1, two for VT 2 and one for both VT 1 and VT 2. These were distributed along the transportation value chain of meat from the three slaughterhouses. The prevalence of E. coli O 157 serotype contaminated carcasses was 2. 4 % along the transportation value chain and that of contaminated equipment at the butchery was found to be 0. 6 %. The contamination prevalence at offloading was significantly higher compared to loading (P= 0. 05). The probability of obtaining an E. coli O 157 serotype contaminated carcass at Dagoretti, Limuru and Eldoret respectively was 14, 16 and 19 at loading and 31, 39 and 66 at offloading per 1000 carcasses handled. The temperature in the meat carrier significantly increased (p= 0. 004) during transportation between loading and offloading. The average time taken to transport the meat from the slaughterhouses to the butchery was found to be 65 minutes. The respondents interviewed for the knowledge, attitude and practices were 119 where 87 were butchery attendants and 32 meat transporters. Of those interviewed, 83 (69. 75 %) had worked in the meat industry for at least 5 years but only 19 (16 %) had had formal training on meat hygiene. Most of the butchery attendants interviewed (97 %) said they washed their hands frequently although only 9 % of the butcheries had functional water taps in their premises. The meat transporters did not wash their hands during the transportation although 53 % had said that they did so regularly. Cleaning of the butchery surfaces was done using cold water and soap only and no disinfectant was used. During meat transportation, it was observed that the carcasses were loaded on the shoulders of the transporters and placed on the floor of the carriers or heaped on top of other carcasses. Offloading at the butchery was done by the same person without any change over of clothes. Kraft papers were used to separate the carcasses and avoid staining those beneath with blood. Bacteriological quality of the papers was unknown. These unhygienic practices in combination with the temperature increase during transportation could have led to the significant increase in contaminated carcasses at offloading as compared to loading. Therefore this significant increase was mainly due to cross contamination and bacterial multiplication. There was risk of obtaining contaminated carcasses at the three stages of sampling. The risk increased along the transportation value chain. This was due to poor hygiene practices by both the transporters and butchery attendants who had little information on prevention of carcass contamination. Increase in temperature due to lack of the observation of the cold chain also led to the increase in the prevalence and probability of obtaining a contaminated carcass. E. coli O 157 serotype contamination in the carcass could persist from loading to offloading...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this study was to {{increase}} understanding of the factors that may influence cycling for transportation. First, this study examined associations between sociodemographic factors, population density and transportation bicycling, and described transportation bicyclists by trip purposes, using the U. S. -representative 2009 National Household Travel Survey. Results showed that 1 % of Americans older than five years of age bicycled for transportation in a typical day, and that transportation cycling was inversely associated with age, and directly with being male, with being white, and with population density. Twenty-one percent <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> bicyclists reported trips to work, while 67 % reported trips to social or other activities. These findings indicate that bicycles are used for a variety of trip purposes, which has implications for transportation bicycling research based on commuter data, and for developing interventions to promote this behavior. ^ Next, this study assessed measurement properties of, and associations among, Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory constructs operationalized in relation to transportation cycling adoption. DOI <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> bicycling and a five-item perceived compatibility <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> bicycling score (compatibility) were assessed via Internet-based surveys of downtown Austin employees at two time points 1 - 2 weeks apart. Compatibility was found to be associated with being male, younger age, and higher education, and with DOI <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> bicycling. These results are a launching point for further exploration of DOI applicability to transportation cycling. ^ Lastly, this study assessed the effects of new workplace showers on physical activity behaviors in a select sample of employees recruited from several downtown worksites in Austin Texas USA. Three groups were compared: an intervention group (new showers introduced after baseline) and two comparison groups (one with and one without showers at baseline). No significant differences in changes of physical activity from baseline to follow-up across three study groups were found. One-quarter of participants with new workplace showers and 46. 9 % of those with existing workplace showers at baseline reported ever using the showers. Worksite shower users were highly active at baseline, suggesting a possible early adopter effect, with potential for diffusion.

Design/methodology/approach Consumers took part in an EEG experiment during which they were shown four different narrative videos to identify brain response during specific video segments.

During the story segment of the videos attention, working memory, and emotion were also high, with attention decreasing later on but working memory, emotion, and imagination being evident. Consumer responses to each of the four videos differed. Practical implications The study suggests that narratives can be a useful approach in energy efficiency social marketing. Specifically, marketers should attempt to gain focused attention and invoke emotional responses, working memory, and imagination to help consumers become narratively transported. The fit between story object and story-receiver should also be considered when creating consumer narratives.

This involved the use of routinely published census data and mathematical techniques to predict and analyse passenger flow volumes. [...] Modelling was performed at the trip generation and trip distribution <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> planning. Trip generation was achieved using a library computer program for multiple linear regression analysis. During this stage, the most appropriate traffic zone size was assessed. Results were that an aggregation of census areas was proven more effective than single communities in relating passenger and demographic data. Trip distribution was carried out by applying the gravity model. A computer program, which included testing of the gravity model output, was developed and written by the author for this research. A statistical criterion called the chi-square-test was successfully applied in analyzing output of the gravity model. This test indicated the closeness between gravity model and observed passenger data and was judged superior to the visual method of determining when the gravity model is considered calibrated. The chi-square statistics were also applied in analysis of test year data. [...] Testing of the model was achieved through comparison of predicted passenger data with data collected by actual counts during survey periods of four consecutive years following the base year. The model predicted a linear increase in ridership over the test years, whereas the actual data showed that fluctuations were present.

40|$|THESIS: that {{changing}} transportation technology helped determine {{the limit of}} maximum expansion {{of the city and}} that the physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> have determined the pattern of growth to that limit. Population movements and growth have occurred in two stages: influx into the city and explosion to the suburbs. Transportation technology has advanced in two stages: centripetal, emphasizing a single center, and centrifugal, de-emphasizing one center. There is a correspondence between these <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> population and <b>transportation</b> change. The growth of cities occurs in cycles. In a cycle, the dominant mode <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> sets a pattern of land use which determines later need for transportation, and so on, in a continuous cycle of cause and effect. Along a path <b>of</b> <b>transportation,</b> a stop creates a nodal pattern centered around the stop. If the distance between the stops is long, the nodes retain their identity. If this distance is short, the nodes evolve a linear pattern. Growth occurs primarily in the linear or nodal patterns. A third pattern, spread, results when the pace of growth is so rapid that growth occurs in units the size of the basic network or larger. The network is the sum of the paths of a mode <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> The growth <b>of</b> Philadelphia, Chicago, and Houston demonstrates that: increasing speed <b>of</b> means <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> extends the boundaries of the city outward in proportion to speed, the dominant mode <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> during a cycle of growth establishes its peculiar pattern for future growth, the patterns of urban growth can be categorized as "nodal", "linear", and "spread", and these patterns of urban growth are determined by the physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>transportation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The length based {{engineering}} {{problems such}} as highways, railways etc. acquires three-dimensional topographic data to expose the project details. In view <b>of</b> highway <b>transportation</b> planning projects, to expose the existing situation accurately and rapidly has become a significant problem due to the increased transportation need. Therefore, three-dimensional topographic data is a vital element for analyzing the planning problems in all sides. For length-based transportation planning problems, the significant factor is to reach the accurate highway geometry components such as length and elevation information. Especially, planning <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transportation</b> networks need existing highways and related roads geometry for modeling and giving decisions about the future works. The goal {{of this paper is}} to find out the usage capacity of different gridding sizes with chosen digital elevation derivative models to expose highway profile geometry, and integrated aerial imagery for horizontal geometry. In this point, airborne LIDAR technology gives efficient, accurate and less time-consuming solutions for generating digital elevation models. This study presents the gridding size effects, which are investigated from generated digital elevation models via airborne LIDAR dataset for exposing highway profile in terms o...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{that comes}} into {{existence}} from vital activities is natural necessity. The increased competition {{and the idea of}} arriving to destination rapidly with a minimum lost revealed the alternative transportation systems. In many <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transportation</b> system, decision making tools may be used to get increased benefit. Also innovative technologies like ERP software are important to manage transportation systems effectively. In this study, the most effective ERP software is selected for a firm that services at urban passenger transport sector using two-stage fuzzy decision making technique. In the first stage, after the lack of the software application is determined, the decision of developing the new software by software development department in firm or buying a package program is given. In the second <b>stage,</b> if developing <b>of</b> the new software in firm is selected, the programming language is determined to develop the most effective ERP software application platform using fuzzy decision making technique. On the contrary, if buying a package program is chosen, the most effective package program is selected by using fuzzy decision making techniques...|$|R
