Since the line-widths of intermolecular zero quantum coherence (iZQC) spectrum only depend on the relative inhomogeneity within the correlation distance in the sample, <b>scalar</b> coupling <b>constants</b> can be gained though one-dimensional spectra from the projection of two-dimensional iZQC spectra onto the indirect dimension. However, the existing pulse sequences are not suitable for various spin systems because of the great difference in <b>scalar</b> coupling <b>constants</b> and line denseness in spectra. To solve this problem, a new pulse sequence, which can scale <b>scalar</b> coupling <b>constants,</b> was designed by adding a refocusing pi pulse in the indirect detection period (corresponding to indirect dimension).

40|$|Searches for CP violating {{effects in}} atoms and {{molecules}} provide important constrains on competing extensions {{to the standard}} model of elementary particles. In particular, CP violation in an atom leads to the CP-odd (T,P-odd) polarizability β^CP: a magnetic moment μ^CP is induced by an electric field E_ 0 applied to an atom, μ^CP = β^CPE_ 0. We estimate the CP-violating polarizability for rare-gas (diamagnetic) atoms He through Rn. We relate betaCP to the permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron and to the <b>scalar</b> <b>constant</b> of the CP-odd electron-nucleus interaction. The analysis is carried out using the third-order perturbation theory and the Dirac-Hartree-Fock formalism. We find that, {{as a function of}} nuclear charge Z, betaCP scales steeply as Z^ 5 R(Z), where slowly-varying R(Z) is a relativistic enhancement factor. Finally, we evaluate a feasibility of setting a limit on electron EDM by measuring CP-violating magnetization of liquid Xe. We find that such an experiment could provide competitive bounds on electron EDM only if the present level of experimental sensitivity to ultra-weak magnetic fields [Kominis et al., Nature 422, 596 (2003) ] is improved by several orders of magnitude.

40|$|Multiple {{differently}} exposed {{pictures of}} the same subject matter arise naturally whenever a video camera having automatic exposure captures multiple frames of video with the same subject matter appearing in regions of overlap between {{at least some of}} the successive video frames. Almost all cameras have some kind of automatic exposure feature. Generally automatic exposure is center weighted, so that when a light object falls in the center of the frame the exposure is automatically decreased, whereas the exposure is automatically increased when the camera swings around to point at a darker object. In this paper, it is assumed that the spatial (e. g. projective) coordinate transformation between successive frames of the sequence is known (or equivalently that it is the identity), and the contribution of the paper is an efficient way to estimate the tonal relationship between successive frames of the sequence. In particular methods are proposed to simultaneously estimate the unknown camera response function, as well as the set of unknown relative exposure changes among images, up to a single unknown <b>scalar</b> <b>constant.</b> The method comprises a succession of guesses each of which is a refinement of the previous. The first guess is often sufficient, so that no initial solution needs to be provided by the user. Each subsequent guess is a least squares solution so that no computationally expensive optimization is required. Since the method makes use of all the data, it is extremely immune to noise.

40|$|Abstract—Intermodulation {{products}} arise as {{a result}} of low noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer non-linearities in wideband receivers. In the presence of strong blockers, the intermodulation distortion can deteriorate the spectrum sensing performance by causing false alarms and degrading the detection proba-bility. We theoretically analyze the impact of third-order non-linearities on the detection and false alarm probabilities for both energy detectors and cyclostationary detectors under front-end LNA non-linearities. We show that degradation of the detection performance due to nonlinearities of both energy and cyclostationary detection is strongly dependent on the modulation type of the blockers. We then propose two DSP-enhanced receiver architectures to compensate the impact of nonlinearities. The first approach is a post-processing technique which compensates for nonlinearities effect on the test statistic by adapting the sensing time and detection threshold. The second approach is a pre-processing method that compensates by correcting received samples prior to computing the test statistic. This approach is based on adaptively estimating the intermodulation distortion, weighting it by a <b>scalar</b> <b>constant</b> and subtracting it from the subband of interest. We propose a method to adaptively compute the optimal weighting coefficient and show that it depends on the power and modulation of the blockers. Our results show that the pre-processing sample-based compensation method is more effective, and that clear dynamic range extension can be obtained by using intermodulation compensation without resorting to increasing the sensing time. We also study the impact of uncertainties about the knowledge or estimates for nonlinearity parameters.

The authors have been investigating a suite of modeling and migration methods that are implemented in the wavenumber-space domains and operate on data in the frequency domain.
