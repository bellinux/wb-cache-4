50|$|The {{term was}} {{used on the}} Amiga and Atari ST {{platform}} {{to indicate that the}} disk could be inserted into either machine and it would still boot and run. The secret behind this lies in a very <b>special</b> <b>layout</b> of the first track of the disk which contained an Amiga and an Atari ST bootsector at the same time by fooling the operating system to think that the track resolved into the format it expected. Only a few games used that technique. Three of them were produced by Eclipse Software Design (Stone Age, Monster Business and Lethal Xcess). ST/Amiga Format magazine also used the technique for their coverdisks.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{unshielded}} semiconductor (e.g. {{an integrated}} circuit) {{will tend to}} act as a detector for those radio signals commonly found in the domestic environment (e.g. mobile phones). Such a detector can demodulate the high frequency mobile phone carrier (e.g., GSM850 and GSM1900, GSM900 and GSM1800) and produce low-frequency (e.g., 217 Hz) demodulated signals. [...] This demodulation manifests itself as unwanted audible buzz in audio appliances such as microphone amplifier, speaker amplifier, car radio, telephones etc. Adding onboard EMI filters or <b>special</b> <b>layout</b> techniques can help in bypassing EMI or improving RF immunity.Some ICs are designed (e.g., LMV831-LMV834, MAX9724) to have integrated RF filters or a special design that helps reduce any demodulation of high-frequency carrier.|$|E

50|$|The first renovations {{were started}} on the {{building}} in 1899. The first renovation was the addition of multiple new technologies for the time, which were supposed to make the dorm a more modern building. These renovations included {{the addition of a}} steam heater, electrical lights and modern bathrooms. These first set of renovations were mainly mechanical ones in order for the building {{to keep up with the}} changing times. The next renovation on the building took place in 1912. With this renovation the central hall of the building was removed and was later replaced by two-side halls, which virtually cut the hall into two sections. Both the corridors were named for professors at the school. The two professors who the two corridors are named for are R.B.C. Johnson and Charles Elliott. The next renovations came to the building in 1937. With these renovations the building took on all the same features and characteristics that it has today. To get ready to bring the building into the New Miami look many things were done. The interior of the building was completely redone. This caused the <b>special</b> <b>layout</b> of the space to become a much more unified building. On the exterior of the building all the bricks were sandblasted in order to make it fit in with the other buildings on Miami’s campus. Also a number of the original chimneys were removed.|$|E
50|$|In the Late Bronze Age (14th-13th century BCE), {{at least}} three {{settlements}} existed on the tall. For the time being, only the latest Late Bronze Age stratum could be exposed. Several observations indicate that the tall was the centre of a Late Bronze Age city state: The strong fortifications, the massive architecture, the high percentage (5%) of imported pottery from Cyprus and Greece {{as well as the}} numerous noteworthy single finds. The most remarkable building of this stratum is the massive casemate wall which fortified the settlement at the north-west flank. A charcoal sample from the collapsed walls gave a radio-carbon date between 1450 and 1300 BCE with 95.4% probability. Six rooms in the case-mate wall could be excavated. Three drainage channels from the residential area end in one of the casemates - originally covered with flat stone slabs. At this point, the water flowed into a semicircular basin from where it drained into a deep, almost circular shaft lined with undressed stones. The three channels substitute an older channel from the middle Late Bronze Age stratum which was covered by the casemates of the city wall of the younger Late Bronze Age stratum. South of the casemate wall a large tower was uncovered. This inward-built tower was divided into two rooms paved with small pebbles. The northern room was connected to {{the southern part of the}} casemate wall. It was probably used by the guard. In a later building phase, the southern room was divided by a small wall with two column bases. They probably originally supported wooden columns to carry the roof. A large stone - worked on its base and tapered at the top - found in this room might be a mazzebe (cultic stone). This find and the <b>special</b> <b>layout</b> of the room point to it serving as a small gate sanctuary.|$|E

40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>layouts</b> were {{developed}} for the interconnection of AlSi 1 coated Si-chips with outside bond pads using Au- and AlSi 1 -microwires. Different dual in-line packages and chip-on-board assemblies were tested. High temperature storage, temperature cycling and corrosion testing were used to control the contact stability. Contact resistance was determined using the four point methods and contact failures were investigated by microanalytical methods. Bonded contacts in hermetic packages do not show remarkable changes of the contact resistant even after long testing periods. The behaviour of bonding contacts in chip-on-board assemblies using AlSi 1 -microwires strongly depends on the Ni-Au conductive pattern design on the board. Chemically deposited Ni-Au-layers with 0. 3 #mu#m gold coating gave much better results than galvanically deposited Ni-Au layers with 1. 8 #mu#m gold coating.

40|$|Self-heating is an {{important}} issue for SOI CMOS, and hence, so is its characterization and modeling. This paper sets out how the critical parameters for modeling, i. e. thermal resistance and thermal time-constants, may be obtained using purely electrical measurements on standard MOS devices. A summary of the circuit level issues is presented, and the physical effects contributing to thermally related MOSFET behaviour are discussed. A new thermal extraction technique is presented, based on an analytically derived expression for the electro-thermal drain conductance in saturation. Uniquely, standard MOSFET structues can be used, eliminating errors due to additional heat flow through <b>special</b> <b>layouts.</b> The conductance technique is tested experimentally and results are shown to be in excellent agreement with thermal resistance values obtained from noise thermometry and gate resistance measurements using identical devices. It is demonstrated that the conductance technique can be used confidently over a wide range of bias conditions, with both fully and partially depleted devices...|$|R
