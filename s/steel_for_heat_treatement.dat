40|$|Texture and {{microstructure}} formation during annealing of a 75 % {{cold rolled}} AHS steel, reheated {{at a rate}} of 10 °C/s to ~ 3000 °C/s were studied with the purpose to investigate the interaction between the recrystallization and the austenite formation as well as the possibility of grain refinement. It was found that at ultra-high heating rates, the bcc-fcc phase transformation starts before the completion of recrystallization and the deformation texture is partially retained in the samples after annealing. The crystallographic texture observed in the martensitic phase, which is the product of intercritical austenite transformation in as-quenched samples, i. e., after the double α-γ-α' transformation, is similar to the initial cold rolling texture, which is an indication for the texture memory effect. After ultra-fast reheating with average reheating rates of 1000 °C/s and higher, a significant grain refinement was observed with an average calculated ferrite grain diameter of ~ 2 μm. The obtained final ferrite grain size depends significantly on both the reheating temperature and the heating rate. The same effect is observed in 75 % cold rolled quenching and partitioning <b>steels</b> <b>for</b> <b>heating</b> rates of 400 °C/s, 800 °C/s and 1000 °C/s. In both cases the combination of fine grains, and weak RD/ND-fiber textures produce an increase of strength and ductility compared to material annealed using a conventional heating rate of ~ 10 °C/s.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} artificial neural networks for mechanical properties prediction of constructional steels after heat treatment. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of such input parameteres, such as the chemical composition, the ones of mechanical and heat treatment and dimensions of elements, mechanical properties such as strength, impact resistance or hardness are predicted. Findings: Results obtained in the given ranges of input parameters show very good ability of constructed neural networks to predict described mechanical properties <b>for</b> <b>steels</b> after <b>heat</b> treatment. The uniform distribution of descriptive vectors in all, training, validation and testing sets, indicate about the good ability of the networks to results generalisation.

At {{the same time the}} obtainment of steels, which are qualitatively better, cheaper and more optimised under customers needs is made possible.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{dissolution}} and precipitation behaviour of four different aluminium alloys (EN AW- 6005 A, EN AW- 6082, EN AW- 6016, and EN AW- 6181) in four different initial heat treatment conditions (T 4, T 6, overaged, and soft annealed) was investigated during heating {{in a wide}} dynamic range. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to record heating curves between 20 and 600  °C. Heating rates were studied from 0. 01  K/s to 5  K/s. We paid particular attention to control baseline stability, generating flat baselines and allowing accurate quantitative evaluation of the resulting DSC curves. As the heating rate increases, the individual dissolution and precipitation reactions shift to higher temperatures. The reactions during heating are significantly superimposed and partially run simultaneously. In addition, precipitation and dissolution reactions are increasingly suppressed as the heating rate increases, whereby exothermic precipitation reactions are suppressed earlier than endothermic dissolution reactions. Integrating the heating curves allowed the enthalpy levels of the different initial microstructural conditions to be quantified. Referring to time–temperature–austenitisation diagrams <b>for</b> <b>steels,</b> continuous <b>heating</b> dissolution diagrams <b>for</b> aluminium alloys were constructed to summarise the results in graphical form.

40|$|AbstractDensity, {{diversity}} and assemblage structure of Mesostigmata (cohorts Gamasina and Uropodina) were investigated in nine grassy arable fallows {{according to a}} factorial design with age class (2 – 3, 6 – 8, 12 – 15 years) and plant species (legume: Medicago sativa, herb: Taraxacum officinale, grass: Bromus sterilis) as factors. The response of Mesostigmata to habitat age and plant species was explored because this group belongs to the dominant acarine predators playing {{a crucial role in}} soil food webs and being important as biological control agents. To our knowledge, this combination of factors has never been studied before for Mesostigmata. A further rarely applied aspect of the present study is the micro-scale approach investigating the Mesostigmata assemblage of the soil associated with single plants. Four plots were randomly chosen at each fallow in May 2008. At each plot plant roots and the adjacent soil of five randomly selected plant individuals per plant species were dug out with <b>steel</b> cylinders <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> extraction of soil fauna and measurement of environmental parameters. In total, 83 mite taxa were identified, with 50 taxa being new to Austria. GLM analysis revealed a significant effect of plant species on mite density, with significantly more mites in B.  sterilis than in T.  officinale samples, and M.  sativa samples being intermediate. This was in contrast to the assumption that the mite density is highest in M. sativa samples due to the propagation of plant quality effects to higher trophic levels. These results were probably caused by a higher amount of fine roots in grass samples leading to high densities of Collembola, which are preferred prey of predatory mites. Mite density did not significantly differ between the three age classes. A canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) showed that the mite assemblage exhibited a weak yet significant separation between plant species, and a highly significant separation between age classes. Accordingly, different mite assemblages were found for the three age classes, while only few mite species were clearly associated with a single plant species. Finally, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the mite assemblage was best explained by soil organic carbon, total density of Collembola and water content...|$|R
