5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, {{though he had}} little military experience and protested he was not <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town {{on the main road}} from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.|$|E
5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> philosophy.|$|E

5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1942, the Auxiliary Staffel were created. By mid-1943, Luftflotte 1 {{was given}} four Staffeln while Luftflotte 4 and Luftwaffe Kommando Ost (Luftwaffe Command East) were given six and two respectively. In {{the first half}} of 1943, 12 Nachtschlachtgruppen ("night battle groups") had been formed, flying a {{multitude}} of different types of aircraft, including the Ju 87, which proved itself ideally <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> low-level slow flying needed.|$|E

5|$|The E3 Harelbeke {{is part of}} {{the spring}} {{classics}} season. It is therefore <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riders who ride in the several other similar races through {{the early part of the}} season, such as the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, the Tour of Flanders and the Dwars door Vlaanderen, which are often raced over the same roads.|$|E
5|$|The United States' {{investment}} in infrastructure such as highways and bridges {{coincided with the}} increasing availability of cars more <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher speeds that better roads made possible, allowing people to live {{beyond the confines of}} major cities, and instead commute to and from work.|$|E

5|$|To {{service the}} {{enlarged}} network, Grønlandsfly began acquiring DHC-7s, planes particularly <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> often severe weather conditions in Greenland. The first was delivered on 29 September 1979, followed by more {{over the next}} decade. These planes remain in active service, serving every airport except Nerlerit Inaat near Ittoqqortoormiit, whose operation is handled by Air Iceland under contract with Greenland Home Rule.|$|E
5|$|With a good {{level of}} {{socialisation}} {{at an early}} age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed {{seems to have a}} perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.|$|E
5|$|After 90 league {{games and}} 24 goals, Berger was {{purchased}} by Ottmar Hitzfeld's Borussia Dortmund in 1995 for a reported £500,000. In August 1995 {{he played in the}} DFL-Supercup, as Dortmund beat Borussia Mönchengladbach to win the title. While Dortmund {{went on to win the}} Bundesliga title in the 1995–96 season, Berger was frequently used as a substitute, making 12 of his 25 league appearances from the bench. Hitzfeld preferred to employ Berger as a defensive midfielder as he considered him to be most <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role.|$|E

5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|Before the Rose Bowl, Shaughnessy lent help {{to his old}} {{associate}} George Halas of the Chicago Bears, {{which in}} Sid Luckman, had found a quarterback well <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> T formation. Before the NFL Championship Game against the Washington Redskins, Shaughnessy devised a series of counter plays to confuse their opponent, which on game film had shown a tendency to shift linebackers {{in the direction of}} the motion man. His preparations helped Chicago rout Washington, 73–0.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E

5|$|Greenhouses convert solar {{light to}} heat, {{enabling}} year-round {{production and the}} growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain {{an important part of}} horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.|$|E
5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
5|$|Sucker Punch began {{planning}} {{the game as}} early as 2010, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the Infamous series onto {{a new generation of}} hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions {{they would like to see}} on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open world design.|$|E

2500|$|The helmet may be {{described}} {{by the number of}} bolts which hold it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corselet, and the number of vision ports, known as lights. For example, a helmet with four vision ports, and twelve studs securing <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corselet, would be known as a [...] "four light, twelve bolt helmet", and a three-bolt helmet used three bolts <b>to</b> secure <b>the</b> bonnet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corselet, clamping the flange of the neck seal between the two parts of the helmet.|$|R
