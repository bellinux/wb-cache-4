Free Voice's author proposed that Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's royal election laws be changed to allow only local candidates for the throne ("Piast kings") and that the landed gentry abandon their faith in divine providence as the only force able to deliver the fatherland from all dangers. It further called for reclamation of all Crown land to repair the royal treasury, limiting the liberum veto laws, eliminating landless gentry from participating in the Sejm and Sejmiks, and that the szlachta be covered by a 10% income tax as until the late 18th century the gentry was virtually exempted from all taxes.|$|E

The null hypothesis of this study was that there would be no significant difference between a token <b>economy</b> <b>system</b> in comparison to social praise on the manifest behaviors of learning disabled students. The following research question was examined in this study: What are the effects of a token <b>economy</b> <b>system</b> in comparison to social praise on the manifest behaviors of learning disabled students? Literature relevant to this study revealed that a token <b>economy</b> <b>system</b> can be an effective method for changing or controlling student behavior (Mathur, 1996; Rhode, Morgan, & Young, 1983; Turkewitz, O’Leary, & Ironsmith, 1975; DeMartini-Scully, 2000). Some cautions suggested in the study were also noted. Token <b>economy</b> <b>systems</b> can be time-consuming and costly (Lovitt, 1978).

50|$|Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, in {{an attempt}} to {{strengthen}} the greatly weakened Commonwealth, King Stanislaus Augustus put into effect a series of reforms to strengthen Poland's military, political <b>system,</b> <b>economy,</b> and society. These reforms reached their climax with the enactment of the May Constitution in 1791, which established a constitutional monarchy with separation into three branches of government, strengthened the bourgeoisie and abolished many of the privileges of the nobility as well as many of the old laws of serfdom. In addition, to strengthen Poland's international standings, King Stanislaus signed the Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790, ceding further territories to Prussia in exchange for a military alliance. Angered by what was seen as dangerous, Jacobin-style reforms, Russia invaded Poland in 1792, beginning the War in Defense of the Constitution. Abandoned by her Prussian allies and betrayed by Polish nobles who desired to restore the privileges they had lost under the May Constitution, Poland was forced to sign the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, which ceded Dobrzyn, Kujavia, and a large portion of Greater Poland to Prussia and all of Poland’s eastern provinces from Moldavia to Livonia to Russia, reducing Poland to one third of her original size prior to the First Partition.|$|E
50|$|According to one approach, the traditionalist {{point of}} view, {{though not in}} a {{political}} sense, was represented in Congressmen like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, C.Rajagopalachari, Purushottam Das Tandon, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Maulana Azad, who were also associates and followers of Gandhi. Their organizational strength, achieved through leading the clashes with the government, was undisputed and proven when despite winning the 1939 election, Bose resigned the Congress presidency {{because of the lack}} of confidence he enjoyed amongst national leaders. A year earlier, in the 1938 election, however, Bose had been elected with the support of Gandhi. Differences arose in 1939 on whether Bose should have a second term. Jawaharlal Nehru, who Gandhi had always preferred to Bose, had had a second term earlier. Bose's own differences centred on the place to be accorded to non-violent as against revolutionary methods. When he set up his Indian National Army in South-east Asia during the Second World War, he invoked Gandhi's name and hailed him as the Father of The Nation.It would be wrong to suggest that the so-called traditionalist leaders looked merely to the ancient heritage of Indian, Asian or, in the case of Maulana Azad and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Islamic civilization for inspiration. They believed, along with educationists like Zakir Husain and E W Aryanayakam, that education should be imparted in a manner that enables the learners also to be able to make things with their own hands and learn skills that would make them self-supporting. This method of education was also adopted in some areas in Egypt. (See Reginald Reynolds, Beware of Africans). Zakir Husain was inspired by some European educationists and was able, with Gandhi's support, to dovetail this approach to the one favoured by the Basic Education method introduced by the Indian freedom movement. They believed that the education <b>system,</b> <b>economy</b> and social justice model for a future nation should be designed to suit the specific local requirements. While most were open to the benefits of Western influences and the socio-economic egalitarianism of socialism, they were opposed to being defined by either model.|$|E
