2500|$|Initial reviews—somewhat {{clouded by}} the controversy—were mixed, with {{negative}} reviews predictably {{focusing on the}} show's racy content. The Los Angeles Times called the show [...] "a prolonged dirty joke" [...] that [...] "is without cleverness or style or subtlety. Its sex jokes are delivered by the shovelful, like manure." [...] Variety called the show [...] "forced and derivative", [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "predictable and silly" [...] while conceding that the sex is [...] "no more outrageous than daytime <b>soapers,</b> no more outspoken than Three's Company." ...|$|R
50|$|Sid and Bernie soon {{set their}} sights on {{a bunch of}} young ladies on holiday from the Chayste Place {{finishing}} school. The ringleader of the girls is blonde and bouncy Babs (Barbara Windsor). In charge of the girls is Dr. <b>Soaper</b> (Kenneth Williams), who is fervently pursued by his lovelorn colleague, the school's matron, Miss Haggard (Hattie Jacques). The girls soon leave for Ballsworth Youth Hostel, where Babs and her friend Fanny change the room numbers on Dr. Soaper's and Miss Haggard's doors and convince Dr. <b>Soaper</b> that the female washroom is the male washroom, which is where Miss Haggard is. During an outdoor aerobics session led by Dr <b>Soaper,</b> Babs' bikini top flies off and is caught by Dr. <b>Soaper.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Joe Soap was a {{photographic}} comic series {{published in the}} British comic book Eagle, from issue 12 (dated June 12, 1982) until issue 45 (dated January 29, 1983). It was written by Alan Grant and John Wagner, with photography by Gary Compton. Another character {{of the same name}} appeared in Cracker and The Beezer. The humorous strip featured Joseph <b>Soaper,</b> a self-styled hardboiled [...] "enquiry agent", who was in reality a down-trodden and occasionally incompetent private detective. Nicknamed Soap due to his softness, <b>Soaper</b> spent his days mired in unprofitable or even ludicrous cases, which weren't helped by his tendency to miss obvious clues and antagonise both clients and police. The character of Joe Soap would reappear during the late 1980s, this time in drawn form, in a comic strip/puzzle feature which would be published in both the Eagle Summer Special and the Eagle Annual of that year. Titled Could You Be a Joe Soap?, readers were encouraged to read the story carefully and try to spot in both the frames and speech balloons all the clues Joe missed. In the final panel, after realising that he has got everything completely wrong, Joe would almost always end up exclaiming [...] "Oh no! Where did I go wrong this time?", or words to that effect.|$|E
50|$|During the 16th century Dronfield {{with its}} sheep farmers had a {{significant}} number of families working in the wool trade, engaged in spinning and weaving and also the production and selling of cloth. <b>Soaper</b> Lane, being next to the river, was the centre of the soap-making and tanning industry in the town, with a dye works also situated there. In 1662 Dronfield was granted a market by Charles II, but in the 18th century, due to the proximity of Sheffield and Chesterfield, the market went into decline and ceased to exist.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Irving {{remained}} with the Wyndhams as [...] "juvenile lead" [...] until September 1859. In November 1856 Wyndham was Rolando in Tobin's The Honey Moon; in May 1857 he revived Macbeth, with Mrs. Wyndham as Lady Macbeth and Irving as Banquo; in December {{of that year}} they were successful with the pantomime Little Bo Peep, with Irving as [...] "Scruncher, captain of the Wolves". A final performance at the Royal, doomed to destruction {{in order to make}} way for a post-office, took place on 25 May 1859, when Wyndham played Sir Charles Pomander in Masks and Faces; Mrs. Wyndham played Peg, and Irving played <b>Soaper.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, Johnson was {{not without}} some {{experience}} and authority. Prior to the raid {{he served as a}} scout for Gen. Forrest, just missing the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, in south-central Tennessee, rejoining Forrest at the Confederate base of operations in Corinth, Mississippi. Johnson was ordered by Forrest to go to Henderson, Kentucky, to give a secret message to Mr. D. R. Burbank, a former employer of Johnson's. Just before launching the raid, Johnson's partisans camped at the <b>Soaper</b> Farm in Henderson. With thirty-five men by Johnson's later count (other counts say 32), formed by combining three-man guards for Breckinridge with recruits from Kentucky, Johnson formed a group of partisan rangers that would engage in guerrilla warfare.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the film}} was mostly positive, according to reviews cited at IMDb, with the notable exception of V.A. Musetto in the New York Post who said, [...] "If {{the plot of the}} Argentine <b>soaper</b> Puzzle seems familiar, that's because it's nearly identical to the story in the French movie Queen To Play." [...] Comparing this film to Lucrecia Martel's The Headless Woman, in which Maria Onetto starred in 2008, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, [...] "Although Puzzle is a much smaller, less ambitious film without the ominous political subtext of Ms. Martel's masterwork, its story...has implications about sexual inequality in Argentina's middle class." [...] Holden also notes that Smirnoff served as Martel's casting director on the 2008 film. The A.V. Club says, [...] "its conclusion is pleasing and not at all pat, a portrait of a woman who's learned she deserves to keep some things for herself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some soapmakers prefer [...] "melt and pour" [...] {{because the}} process is simple and safe, {{allowing}} the soapmaker to concentrate more on the aesthetic aspects of soap making. Because it avoids the need to handle lye, a hazardous and very caustic chemical, it is a hobby even children can enjoy under adult supervision. Unlike cold-processed soap, which requires a period of [...] "curing" [...] to allow saponification to complete and excess water to evaporate, the [...] "melt and pour" [...] process is completed once the base has cooled and hardened. The meltable base is usually naturally rich in glycerine, a by-product of saponification which has humectant and emollient properties, whereas commercial soap bars have often had this component removed. As with the rebatching method, it {{can be considered a}} misnomer to refer to the melt and pour process as soap making. The process has much in common with candle making using meltable wax which, using a similar process, can be scented, dyed and shaped on a small or large scale of production. Adding value to a melt and pour soap base involves augmentation by colouring, scenting, shaping and wrapping the bars, but the general characteristics of the soap, such as transparency or opacity, lathering, pH, fat content and hardness, will be implicitly those of the manufactured base. Melt and pour does not give the <b>soaper</b> complete control over the ingredients; for example, over the choice of fat to use. Conventional cold process or hot process soaps do not melt readily once they have saponified; the exceptions are clear glycerin soaps, and white soap made from white coconut oil. Melt and pour bases are typically manufactured from these types of soap.|$|E
