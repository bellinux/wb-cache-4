40|$|Our {{previous}} research demonstrated that repetitive tone stimulation <b>shortened</b> <b>the</b> perceived {{duration of the}} preceding auditory time interval. In this study, we examined whether repetitive visual stimulation influences the perception of preceding visual time intervals. Results showed that a time interval followed by a high-frequency visual flicker was perceived as shorter than that followed by a low-frequency visual flicker. The perceived duration decreased as {{the frequency of the}} visual flicker increased. The visual flicker presented in one hemifield <b>shortened</b> <b>the</b> apparent time interval in the other hemifield. A final experiment showed that repetitive tone stimulation also <b>shortened</b> <b>the</b> perceived duration of preceding visual time intervals. We concluded that visual flicker <b>shortened</b> <b>the</b> perceived duration of preceding visual time intervals {{in the same way as}} repetitive auditory stimulation <b>shortened</b> <b>the</b> subjective duration of preceding tones...|$|R

5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted.

The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as it was an important strategic bridgehead.

However, in the situation that had developed, retaining it was no longer possible.|$|E

The soundtrack in the film is deceptive. As in Lang's M, the film's music and sound are a subtle mix of actual silence with accompanying music and more or less realistic sound effects. Lang worked with his German editor Conrad von Molo directly on the post-production process.

5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> preseason.

5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E

5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Although the Calendar Round {{is still}} in use today, the Maya started using an {{abbreviated}} Short Count during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 k'atuns. For this reason, {{there is no direct}} correlation between the Long Count and the European calendar. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the Gregorian date of 12 November 1539. Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation. The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems {{with the rest of the}} Maya region. The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> Postclassic period. Radiocarbon dating of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|HMS Unicorn was an {{aircraft}} repair ship and light aircraft carrier {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the late 1930s.

To <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> time required to replenish the BPF's carriers, the ship was based in the Admiralty Islands and in the Philippine Islands until the Japanese surrender in August.

Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 October.

5|$|Operation Swath-10 (also {{known as}} Bilogora '91) was planned by the Croatians {{to regain control}} of the Virovitica–Lončarica–Grubišno Polje road, cutting off and {{destroying}} the TO forces deployed {{in the area of the}} road (the northernmost part of western Slavonia captured by the TO or the JNA). Those objectives were also designed to deny the Banja Luka Corps support if it attempted to break through towards Virovitica; control the last remaining supply route between Zagreb and Slavonia; <b>shorten</b> <b>the</b> Croatian defensive positions, and improve troop and civilian morale. The offensive was originally scheduled for 15 October, but was postponed for two weeks due to the unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade and the special police. The plan of operation called for the ZNG to first cut off the two TO battalions on the Bilogora Mountain within 48 hours, with the second stage of the offensive destroying the trapped TO force. The operation was authorised by Colonel Miroslav Jezerčić, commander of Bjelovar Operational Zone, on 7 October.|$|E
