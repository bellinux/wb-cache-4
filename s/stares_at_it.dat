60|$|Mr. Guppy {{has been}} biting his thumb-nail during this dialogue, {{generally}} changing the thumb {{when he has}} changed the cross leg. As {{he is going to}} do so again, he happens to look at his coat-sleeve. It takes his attention. He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> aghast.|$|E
60|$|Even {{the long}} drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy's spirits. He {{is so low}} that he droops on the {{threshold}} and has hardly strength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece, painted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him like a charm. He recovers in a moment. He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with uncommon interest; {{he seems to be}} fixed and fascinated by it.|$|E
50|$|Rick {{goes home}} and discovers {{his parents are}} not there. He then pulls out a box from a drawer, opens it, and finds his father's hand gun. He takes off his glasses, shakes, and intently <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5000|$|As Chuck plays [...] French {{composer}} Gabriel Fauré's Sicilienne on {{the piano}} at his home, he is interrupted when Howard arrives to deliver groceries. They discuss the Sandpiper case as well as Jimmy's employment at Davis & Main. Chuck is reluctant about Jimmy joining D&M, though Howard says it was mostly thanks to Kim's efforts that D&M were willing to hire him. After Hamlin leaves, Chuck returns to his piano, turns on the metronome, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> silently.|$|E
60|$|I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Was it his? It {{was like}} it, certainly. Yet that k? and those s's? I almost wondered.|$|R

5000|$|Haircut: Ernest {{walks into}} Earl the Barber's shop and asks {{him to make}} him look like a [...] "Wall Street tycoon." [...] However, the barber always misunderstands him, and instead fanatically styles his hair into {{something}} that rhymes with the word [...] "tycoon" [...] (e.g., a [...] "baby baboon," [...] a [...] "clock set on noon," [...] "large feet in a cartoon," [...] a [...] "deadbeat raccoon", etc.) Whatever the hairstyle, Ernest initially is aghast, but then <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> thoughtfully in the mirror and says, [...] "It could work." ...|$|E
50|$|Ho-jung {{notices a}} ring on Kyo-in's little finger and {{comments}} on it. Kyo-in removed the ring from his hand, {{and said that}} he had bought it a long time ago for his love. Then he says that he'll give it to the woman that he'll love in the future. Ho-jung protests that no woman will accept it with that kind of history. Kyo-in puts the ring on her palm and tells her that she doesn't have to wear but to please keep it for him. Ho-jung <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> realizing that the woman he had bought the ring for many years ago was her. She slowly puts it on her finger and smiles at him. The couple gently nudge their heads together and smile happily.|$|E
5000|$|Felix has {{prepared}} edicts which condemn the Christians; he proclaims his {{allegiance to the}} Roman gods. Aria: Dieux des Romains, dieux nos pères / [...] "Gods of the Romans, our fathers, I will serve your wrath". Pauline enters in a rather dream-like state. Her father tells her that he believes that she shares his hatred of the Christians and asks her to read the edict which he {{has prepared}}. As she <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and, at his insistence hesitatingly reads the edict aloud, she is privately horrified at its strictures. In reinforcing his beliefs, Félix affirms his convictions. (Cabaletta): Mort à ces infâmes, Et livrez aux flammes / [...] "Death to those vile men! And to the flames send, / Their children and their wives,/ Their gold and their goods." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{inspector}} drew {{a little}} pamphlet {{from his pocket}} and passed it across. Wingate took it into his hands, opened <b>it</b> and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in surprise.|$|R

50|$|The case is {{apparently}} wrapped up with Carlo being the killer. After Marcus drops off the wounded Gianna at the hospital, he {{heads back to}} the scene of the crime, he realizes that Carlo could not have murdered Ulmann because they were together only for a few seconds before Marcus saw her at the window. Marcus then enters the murder victim's apartment and after looking around, finally remembers what he saw in a mirror reflection which he thought was a portrait that night is the face of the killer. When he turns back, the killer appears in front of him, finally revealed to be Carlo's insane mother Martha. In a flashback, Carlo is still a child and witnesses his mother stabbing her husband because he tried to have her committed to psychiatric hospital. Carlo, traumatized, picks up the bloody knife and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> then Martha entombs her husband's body in a room of the house.|$|E
5000|$|At this point, SAM {{discovers that}} the Plague cannot {{withstand}} pure air. Hearing this, Darius {{with the help}} from the nano forge needs to repair the terraformer {{to bring back the}} atmosphere. S.A.M explains due to their underground depth they would have to break surface fast to stop Plague from over running Mars. Mason decides the quickest way to the surface is to latch on one of the Queens tentacles during her ascension. He finds the terraformer that Hale destroyed, traverses it's Plague infestation within and repairs it, killing off the Plague. The Red Faction along with Marauder forces soon arrives at the terraformer to secure the area. After a brief conversation with Frank, Mason looks at the terraformer to see the clouds start to dissipate after years of dust storms. A thunderstorm starts to appear off at a distance and sunlight breaking through the clouds. Darius pulls out the Franklin medallion he received from Kara and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> SAM warns Darius of high concentration of radiation coming into the atmosphere to which Mason replies [...] "Easy there genius. That's the sun." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{believe in}} magic {{and the power}} of {{following}} passions to lead to instances of backwards causality. In his autobiography there is an illustration of Devant making a ghost disappear 'in front of a critical audience' which, as a title alone, has parallels to painting pictures if you ask me....About the time Harry Pye first suggested time was right for a Devant themed show, I was sorting through some books I hadn't touched since they had come into my possession via my polymath cousin, Ricky Rhubarb. The first chapter of the first book was a sketch of Augustus John basically saying he was a bit hit or miss but when his work clicked 'one <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with amazement as if this were a Maskelyne and Devant trick and one saw a box floating in mid air'. My jaw slackened and I read on to discover the next chapter was a poetical tip toe through the dichotomy of magic and science. Reaching for my lighter I found it gone. Coincidence? No I don't smoke any more.|$|E

60|$|He {{had laid}} one {{page of the}} paper before them, with his {{forefinger}} upon an item in the left-hand top corner. Then he discreetly withdrew. Frank <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in horror.|$|R

50|$|As the van is now broken down, {{the group}} proceed to London on foot {{where there is}} greater {{likelihood}} of food and supplies and where they can better communicate with Beacon, a larger military base. They discover London (which is overgrown with wild, unkempt vegetation) populated with multitudes of dormant, unstimulated hungries. By using a gel that blocks their scent and moving quietly, they manage to sneak past the hungries, shooting several in the head along the way, eventually finding shelter in an abandoned hospital. When they try to leave the next day, they realize the hospital has been surrounded by a greater horde of hungries, possibly from their gunfire the day before. Melanie offers to lead the hungries away - as she alone cannot be attacked, essentially by being one - and the group agrees. She wanders around the area, exploring houses and experiencing childish wonder at the domestic and everyday objects she has never before encountered. She chases and devours a cat, then captures a small dog to use as bait to distract and lure the hungries away from the hospital so the group can escape. After leaving the hospital, Melanie sees a poster of a cat, and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> while Helen asks her if {{she would like to}} have a cat. Melanie quips that she already had one.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after Tony has a {{ramp and}} {{electric}} wheel chair installed onto the banister but insists Annie waits until later on {{to try it}} out. Annie, stifled from {{not being able to}} practice walking (a recently acquired strength) and feeling rebellious, ventures downstairs then outside to make a call to Luke for him to come see her and explore the grounds. As she wheels herself about, she stumbles upon the overrun English maze and <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for a while until she is approached by the mysterious man at her mother's grave. He says his name is Timothy Brothers and he grew to know her mother quite well after working for Mr. Tatterton for so long. He asks her if she would like him to wheel her into the maze and maybe see the cottage. She hesitates at first but quickly agrees, and they set off, talking about Heaven all the while. Annie becomes suspicious right away thinking not even a longtime employee should know all that [...] "Timothy Brothers" [...] knows about her mother, but she ignores it until they get into the cottage. They sit and talk awhile about Heaven, until Mr. Brothers reveals he's actually Troy Tatterton. He tells Annie the story of his life and how close he grew to Heaven, leaving out the relationship they had. He helps Annie walk a little and grows concerned when Annie tells him about Tony's weird behavior. He suggests that she should go home. He finally wheels her back after sometime for fear of Tony being angry at her for leaving and not letting anyone know where she went. When she gets back to Farthy, Tony and the servants are in an uproar looking for her but are relieved she is back. Tony yells at her and orders her up to her room. Tony later comes in and, thinking Annie is really her grandmother Leigh, attempts to rape her like he did Heaven. Fortunately, Tony snaps out of his confusion before accomplishing his initial intentions.|$|E
40|$|Comunicació presentada a la 2016 8 th International Conference on Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications (VS-Games), celebrada els dies 7 a 9 de setembre de 2016 a Barcelona, Espanya. This paper {{combines}} Audio Signal Processing and Virtual Reality (VR) {{content to}} create novel immersive experiences for orchestral music audiences. In VR, the auralization of sound sources of recorded live content remains still a rather unexplored topic. We aim {{to build a}} multimodal experience, where visual and audio cues bring a sonic augmentation of the real scene. In the particular scenario of orchestral music content, {{our goal is to}} acoustically zoom on a particular instrument when the VR user <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> This work aims to improve the learning aspects of music listening, either for education or for personal enrichment. We use audio signal processing to separate different sound sources (instruments) in a acoustic scene (orchestral music recording). Given the signals captured by multiple microphones and the musical score of the piece, our system is able to isolate the different instruments. From the processed separated tracks, we use a binaural rendering technique to emphasize a give instrument. For these experiments we used original content from top European orchestras...|$|E
