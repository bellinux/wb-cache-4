50|$|Locking {{the output}} shaft with a gear is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} dog clutch selector. The dog clutch is a sliding selector mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the selector to move {{back and forth on the}} shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a <b>selector</b> <b>fork</b> that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Sequential manual {{transmissions}} work {{by providing}} the driver {{with the ability to}} select the gear directly before or after the gear currently engaged. Usually the shift lever is pulled back to select the adjacent higher gear and pushed forwards to select the adjacent lower gear. On a true sequential gearbox, the shift lever operates a ratchet mechanism that converts the fore & aft motion of the shift lever into a rotary motion. This rotary action turns a selector drum (sometimes called a barrel) which has three or four tracks machined around its circumference. Running in the tracks are the <b>selector</b> <b>forks,</b> either directly, or via selector rods. These tracks deviate around the circumference and as the drum rotates, the <b>selector</b> <b>forks</b> running in the tracks are moved to select the required gear. Only a true sequential transmission has a shift mechanism that operates in this way.|$|R

40|$|The {{tractive}} force {{has to be}} interrupted during a gear-shifting operation in a manual vehicle transmission, leading into a decrease of speed while changing gears during the acceleration process. Therefore in a racing application, the shifting time has to be as short as possible so that the required performance of a racing car can be achieved. The following dissertation describes {{the development of a}} transmission control system to enable gear changes within a manual gearbox, which was designed for the Formula Student racing series. Various solutions were developed on the basis of reviewed literature, technical data of components and experiences of Formula Student teams. Following this, a comparison of the concepts by means of a utility analysis identified the pneumatic actuation of <b>selector</b> <b>forks</b> to be the most suitable concept. This was mainly due to the expected shifting time, the weight, and its advantageous energy supply requirement. After the selection of the actuators and the position sensors, the system was implemented into the drivetrain to check the tment and the technical feasibility. To draw conclusions regarding the shifting time and to prove the functionality of the system, an open test bench was constructed. Additionally, the hardware and software had to be developed to enable the test run. After the manufacturing and assembling of the test bench, the optimal settings for the test run were determined. By comparing the achieved shifting time of alternative solutions, an improvement in the driving performance of a Formula Student race car is probable...|$|R
50|$|Most modern forks {{also are}} {{suspended}} on springs and control fork movement by damping through adjustable valving to control movement by controlling {{the flow of}} fork oil. The larger the orifice, the more free the flow and the less damped the <b>fork.</b> A <b>selector</b> atop the <b>fork</b> engages the desired hole size or valve and corresponding damping rate in compression, while usually the lower tube has a mechanism to control rebound (extension) damping.|$|R
