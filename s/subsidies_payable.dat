50|$|Where council tenant rents {{are high}} in {{comparison}} to guidelines issued by the Department of Communities and Local Government, the restriction applies the <b>subsidy</b> <b>payable</b> to local authorities and not the individual claimant. This is done through the Rent Rebate Subsidy Limitation Percentage. Rent Rebate is normally paid at a subsidy rate of 100%. Where rents are high the amount payable by the DWP is the percentage derived from dividing the average rent for the authority by the target rent figure. The cost of this is then met by Housing Revenue Account (the total borough funds for council tenants).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the incidence of}} the most important UK rent subsidy, housing benefit (HB). It exploits changes to housing benefit in 1996 and 1997 that reduced the maximum <b>subsidy</b> <b>payable.</b> The research design is {{based on the fact that}} the changes only applied to new claimants and not to pre-existing claimants. We use difference-in-differences to estimate the size of the treatment effect. We show that the changes did have an effect on the level of housing subsidy with an estimated fall of 10 – 15 % in benefit receipt in the treatment group relative to the control group. There is also evidence that rents paid fell by 6 – 11 %. We find no evidence this can be explained by a fall in housing consumption by the treatment group. Our estimates imply that between 60 % and two-thirds of the incidence of the subsidy reduction was on landlords...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the economic benefits to the UK economy from arms exports might not be that great. Surveys suggest that almost two-thirds of those that lose their job in the defence industry either retire or find new work within one year and arms exports are heavily subsidized by the UK government. Thus any cut in such exports would reduce the annual <b>subsidy</b> <b>payable</b> by the British taxpayer. However, in addition to the direct economic benefits from defence exports there might be indirect effects. Hartley and Hooper (Does trade follow the flag? A study of the UK trade and security policy, Centre for Defence Economics, University of York, 1998) considered whether UK arms exports might lead to higher civil exports. This paper examines this hypothesis. It estimates import demand functions for three countries (Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea) and for {{the world as a whole}} over the period 1970 - 1997. The results suggest that UK arms exports do not stimulate UK civil exports. ...|$|R

Under this system, long-term low interest rate loans in the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP) are predominantly allocated to financially weak local government. This paper confirms that under this system, {{the allocation of}} FILP funds provides a tacit <b>subsidy</b> for interest <b>payable</b> (compared to the high interest rate {{that would have to}} be paid if funding were underwritten by private financial institutions) to prefectures of financially weak prefectural government. In addition, it is difficult for the market to be a restraint as prefectures with financially weak prefectures do not issue prefectural bonds. This suggests that if authorization to issue bonds was granted, it would lead to fiscal management with a greater issuance level of prefectural bonds...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} the administration of the Ethanol Production Grants Program (EPGP). Objective, criteria and scope The objective of the audit was to examine the effectiveness of Industry’s administration of the EPGP, including relevant advice on policy development. To form a conclusion against the objective, the following high level audit criteria were used: 	the grant application process was accessible and attracted high quality applications; 	the assessment process adopted was consistent, transparent and cost effective; 	advice to the delegate was complete and robust and funding decisions were sound; 	funding distribution is consistent with the program’s objectives and appropriate arrangements are in place to manage successful projects; 	appropriate monitoring and reporting arrangements are in place; and 	relevant government entities provided sound advice to assist with policy development and government decision making. The ANAO examined program administration since 2007 – 08, given the difficulty in identifying and locating detailed records relating to the program’s early administration. However, the ANAO’s examination of the policy development process and decisions by government covers the period from the EPGP’s establishment in 2002. The ANAO does not have a role in commenting on the merits of government policy. This audit does not involve an assessment of the administration of other (non-EPGP) government initiatives to support the Australian ethanol industry, except to the extent necessary for an understanding {{of the history of the}} EPGP. Methodology In conducting the audit, the ANAO reviewed: documents of the departments of Industry and Science, the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury and Finance, including policy documents, ministerial correspondence, reports, guidelines and operational documents; examined relevant Cabinet submissions, memoranda and decisions; interviewed departmental staff; and {{examined the}} grants administration process. The ANAO also invited EPGP recipients to provide representations about their experience as grant recipients and, in particular, Industry’s administration of the program; however, no submissions were received. Overall conclusion Originally introduced in 2002 - 03 as a short term (12 month) <b>subsidy</b> <b>payable</b> to eligible domestic ethanol producers, the Ethanol Production Grants Program (EPGP) was extended by successive Australian Governments and will end on 30 June 2015 at a cost to the Commonwealth of some 895  million over the program’s life. The key program objective was to support the production and deployment of ethanol produced from locally derived feedstocks as a sustainable transport fuel in Australia. Intended outcomes were to: improve the long term viability of the ethanol industry in Australia; increase the capacity of the ethanol industry to supply the transport fuel market; and encourage the use of environmentally sustainable fuel ethanol as an alternative transport fuel in Australia. Five program participants have received financial assistance under the EPGP, which is a grants program currently administered by Industry. Overall, Industry 2 ̆ 7 s administration of the EPGP since 2007 - 08, the period examined in this performance audit, has been generally effective. EPGP program arrangements were generally fit for purpose and largely consistent with the Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s grants administration framework. The department also implemented a sound arrangement for monitoring grant recipients 2 ̆ 7 compliance with key program requirements. Had the program continued beyond its planned closure in 2014 - 15, there would have been opportunities for the department to improve its public performance reporting on achievement against the program’s objectives and outcomes, which is currently limited to reporting on the number of companies that receive payments under the program. The Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision to close the EPGP was informed by a consistent body of analysis and advice—provided to successive governments since the program 2 ̆ 7 s earliest days—drawing attention to shortcomings in the overall policy approach and the likelihood that program costs would exceed benefits. Prior to the EPGP 2 ̆ 7 s establishment and at key decision points, the administering department and central co-ordinating agencies offered candid advice on value for money, drawing on past Australian and international experience and the findings of two key reviews (in 2008 and 2014) which had concluded that the benefits of the program were modest and had come at a high cost. These assessments of value for money are underlined by the program 2 ̆ 7 s limited success in achieving key objectives and outcomes. After 12 years of operation and some 895  million in government support directed towards improving the long-term viability of the domestic ethanol industry, in 2014 only three domestic producers (up from two in 2002) were operating, and an expanded Australian ethanol industry based on market priced feedstock was considered unlikely to be commercially viable in the absence of the EPG rebate. The ANAO has not made recommendations in this audit, as the EPGP is scheduled to close from 30 June 2015. While there was scope for the administering departments to develop a more effective performance reporting framework as a basis for assessing outcomes, Industry and the central agencies did provide candid advice to government on the modest performance of the program against its objectives, drawing on Australian and international experience and two reviews of the program; with decisions to continue the program until 2014 – 15 made by successive governments...|$|R
