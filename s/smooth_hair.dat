500|$|An early {{report by}} a Colonel Hawker {{described}} the dog as [...] "by {{far the best}} {{for any kind of}} shooting. He is generally black and no bigger than a Pointer, very fine in legs, with short, <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> and does not carry his tail so much curled as the other; is extremely quick, running, swimming and fighting....and their sense of smell is hardly to be credited...." ...|$|E
500|$|Social {{pressures}} at {{the time}} were heavily influencing these Americans (women) to have, straight hair, like white people did. This resulted in the Black is beautiful movement, wherein African Americans wore their long natural hair, that was however, untreated and unmodified. More recently, hair-extensions have become widespread. Scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have straight <b>smooth</b> <b>hair.</b> Amelia Jones points out that dolls for children, such as Barbies, add to this pressure, citing as an example a new, black Barbie with straight hair. Blacks, she believes, should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to [...] "tame" [...] their hair.|$|E
2500|$|Long coat: The thick, {{slightly}} coarse outer coat lies close {{over the}} body and may be flat or slightly waved, but never curly. Undercoat is very dense and normally lighter in color than the outer coat. The hair on the front sides of the legs and the head is short and <b>smooth.</b> <b>Hair</b> on the ears diminishes in length {{from the base of}} the ears to the tips. The hair on the neck, the buttocks, the tail, and the back side of the legs is longer resulting in a ruff at the neck, breeches on the buttocks and backs of the legs, and feathering on the tail. [...] The males can have a [...] "lion's mane".|$|E
60|$|Psmith <b>smoothed</b> his <b>hair</b> at {{the glass}} and turned round again.|$|R
50|$|A hot comb (also {{known as}} a {{straightening}} comb) is a metal comb {{that is used to}} straighten moderate or coarse hair and create a <b>smoother</b> <b>hair</b> texture. A hot comb is heated and used to straighten the hair from the roots. It can be placed directly on the source of heat or it may be electrically heated.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman on}} the couch <b>smoothed</b> her <b>hair</b> once more, with a smile of gratification.|$|R
6000|$|... [Picture: She was {{a little}} brown mouse of a woman, with soft dark eyes, [...] <b>smooth</b> <b>hair,</b> and a clear olive complexion] ...|$|E
60|$|This inquiry was {{abruptly}} {{addressed to}} his mother, who, in response, glanced appealingly at Mary {{and raised a}} startled hand to her <b>smooth</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling, my darling," [...] {{said the}} mother, {{stroking}} her child's soft <b>smooth</b> <b>hair.</b> [...] "I don't want to scold you;--I {{never want to}} scold you. I hate scolding anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had finally}} <b>smoothed</b> his <b>hair,</b> so {{she lifted her}} hands and put back her head.|$|R
5000|$|Boar bristle brush: Tightly spaced boar-hair {{bristles}} {{are designed}} to increase tension while brushing, to <b>smooth</b> the <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|She had <b>smoothed</b> her <b>hair</b> and was {{carrying}} a tea-tray. They both looked at her as though fascinated.|$|R
60|$|She {{was very}} handsome, in the stately style {{destined to become}} rather massive in middle life. A tall girl, with large dark-blue eyes, ivory outlines, and a gloss of {{darkness}} on her <b>smooth</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
60|$|He was for {{the first}} time seeing a smart woman. This dark, slender, fine-nerved girl, in her plain, rough, closely-belted, gray suit, her small black Glengarry cocked on one side of her <b>smooth</b> <b>hair,</b> her little kid gloves, her veil, was as delicately {{adjusted}} as an aeroplane engine.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Morrell's chuckle made {{answer for}} him, and after {{time enough to}} put down his hat, he came in, rubbing his hands and smiling, and making short nods round the table. [...] "How d'ye do, Mrs. Putney? How d'ye do, Miss Kilburn? Winthrop?" [...] He passed {{his hand over the}} boy's <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> and slipped into the chair beside him.|$|E
60|$|He was hesitating, shy as boys are. Lettie {{laid her}} hand on his head and stroked his <b>smooth</b> fair <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} she had <b>smoothed</b> her <b>hair</b> and tidied her dress, Marguerite caught herself singing quite cheerfully to herself.|$|R
60|$|She {{showed no}} sign of disappointment. She sat up and looked into the fire, <b>smoothing</b> her <b>hair</b> {{mechanically}} with her hands.|$|R
6000|$|At the Temple gate {{he again}} paused, dismounted, and sought {{his way into}} one of the small booths {{occupied}} by scriveners in the neighbourhood. A young man, with lank <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> combed straight to his ears, and then cropped short, rose, with a cringing reverence, pulled off a slouched hat, which he would upon no signal replace on his head, and answered with much demonstration of reverence, to the goldsmith's question of, [...] "How goes business, Andrew?"--"Aw the better for your worship's kind countenance and maintenance." ...|$|E
6000|$|But at {{this point}} his {{conclusions}} were denied (as will sometimes happen) by his introduction to an Englishman--a Major Somebody, who, with <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> and blond moustache, neat eyes and neater clothes, seemed a little anxious at his own presence there. Shelton took a liking to him, partly from a fellow-feeling, {{and partly because of}} the gentle smile with which he was looking at his wife. Almost before he had said [...] "How do you do?" [...] he was plunged into a discussion on imperialism.|$|E
6000|$|But the children's {{heads were}} deservedly pain and grief to the Carbonel senses, and Mary was impelled {{to go and}} make a speech in school, {{desiring}} that no more curl-papers should appear there on Sundays, and recommending that all hair should be kept short, as her own and her sister's had been, till the fit age for the [...] "turning up" [...] was attained. She called up Susan Pucklechurch and Rachel Mole, who had nice <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> neatly parted in the middle, and declared them to be examples {{of the way that}} heads ought to appear.|$|E
6000|$|When {{this had}} been done, he kissed his father twice, <b>smoothed</b> the <b>hair</b> back from the pale, damp forehead, and whispered,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Fast {{as she can}} she hurries, {{something}} ominous, {{her steps}} trembling, [...] She does not tarry to <b>smooth</b> her <b>hair</b> nor adjust her cap.|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head in silence. Rutherford sat down, his chin resting in his hands. She came across to him, and <b>smoothed</b> his <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|A second {{young lady}} {{presently}} {{came out of}} the house, across the piazza, descended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom I have spoken. This second young lady was also thin and pale; but she was older than the other; she was shorter; she had dark, <b>smooth</b> <b>hair.</b> Her eyes, unlike the other's, were quick and bright; but they were not at all restless. She wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons, and a long, red, India scarf, which, on the front of her dress, reached to her feet. In her hand she carried a little key.|$|E
60|$|And men {{and women}} chanted the {{response}} in that quaintly harsh tone which the Magyar language assumes when it is sung. The brilliant sunlight played on the <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> of the girls, the golds, the browns and the blacks, and threw sharp glints on the fluttering ribbons of many colours which a light autumn breeze was causing to dance gaily and restlessly. The whole village was hushed save for the Litany, the clinking of the metal chains as the choir-boys swung the censers and the frou-frou of hundreds of starched petticoats--superposed, brushing one against the other with a ceaseless movement which produced a riot of brilliant colouring.|$|E
6000|$|The Governor's {{decaying}} [...] "mansion" [...] stood {{upon the}} main street of Elmville within a few feet of its rickety paling-fence. Every morning the Governor would descend the steps with extreme care and deliberation--on account of his rheumatism--and then the click of his gold-headed cane would be heard as he slowly proceeded up the rugged brick sidewalk. He was now nearly seventy-eight, but he had grown old gracefully and beautifully. His rather long, <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> and flowing, parted whiskers were snow-white. His full-skirted frock-croak was always buttoned snugly about his tall, spare figure. He wore a high, well-kept silk hat--known as a [...] "plug" [...] in Elmville--and nearly always gloves. His manners were punctilious, and somewhat overcharged with courtesy.|$|E
60|$|She <b>smoothed</b> her <b>hair</b> {{and dropped}} back, {{but for a}} while her head and throat moved with the sickening motion of a {{captured}} wry-neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{always love}} you the same, Jon, {{whatever}} you do. You won't lose anything." [...] She <b>smoothed</b> his <b>hair</b> gently, and walked away.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is comfortable," [...] he said, as {{his mother}} bathed his face and hands and <b>smoothed</b> his <b>hair.</b> [...] "Where are the girls, mother?" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Boyd had {{described}} everyone to Arthur except young Raggles, who painted {{still life with}} a certain amount of skill, and Clayson, the American sculptor. Raggles stood for rank and fashion at the Chien Noir. He was very smartly dressed in a horsey way, and he walked with bowlegs, as though he spent most of his time in the saddle. He alone used scented pomade upon his neat <b>smooth</b> <b>hair.</b> His chief distinction was a greatcoat he wore, with a scarlet lining; and Warren, whose memory for names was defective, could only recall him by that peculiarity. But it was understood that he knew duchesses in fashionable streets, and occasionally dined with them in solemn splendour.|$|E
60|$|An {{insurance}} adjuster, {{who was a}} frat-brother to Carl and Ray, {{though he}} came from Melanchthon College. A young lawyer, ever so jolly, with a banjo. A bantling clergyman, who was spoken of with masculine approval because he smoked a pipe and said charmingly naughty things. Johnson of the Homes and Long Island Real Estate Company, and his brother, of the Martinhurst Development Company. Four older men, ranging from thin-haired to very bald, who had come with their wives and secretly looked at their watches while they talked brightly with one another's wives. Five young men whom Carl could not tell apart, as they all had <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> and eye-glasses and smart dress-shirts and obliging smiles and complimentary references to his aviating. He {{gave up trying to}} remember which was which.|$|E
60|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the dinner-table were a girl of fourteen and a boy of twelve; the former, of a much larger frame than her mother, and in its most awkward and uncouth stage, hardly redeemed by the keen ardour and inquiry that glowed in the dark eyes, set like two hot coals beneath the black overhanging brows of the massive forehead, on which the dark <b>smooth</b> <b>hair</b> was parted. The features were large, the complexion dark but not clear, and the look of resolution in the square-cut chin and closely shutting mouth was more boy-like than girl-like. Janet Brownlow was assuredly a very plain girl, but the family habit was to regard their want of beauty as rather a mark of distinction, capable of being joked about, if not triumphed in.|$|E
60|$|With great ebony brushes he <b>smoothed</b> his <b>hair</b> till it {{shone like}} silver under the light; then he, too, {{came out on}} the gloomy staircase.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cornelia Barns, an elf-eyed {{girl with}} <b>smooth</b> brown <b>hair,</b> turned {{up with the}} picture that was brilliantly comic and not like {{anything}} else in the world".|$|R
6000|$|I prythee, Nurse, come <b>smooth</b> my <b>hair,</b> [...] And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe, And trimly turn my silken sheet [...] Upon my quilt {{of gentle}} blue.|$|R
