40|$|The {{clinical}} {{incidence of}} <b>squeaking</b> {{has been reported}} with increasing frequency, with ceramic-on-ceramic bearings seemingly most affected. This study investigated potential causes of <b>squeaking</b> in hard-on-hard hip bearings through 2 sets of experimental conditions. Bearing clearance appeared to affect the incidence of <b>squeaking</b> in metal-on-metal surface arthroplasties. The addition of third-body particles to the interface for total hip arthroplasties also affected the incidence of <b>squeaking.</b> In both studies, the incidence of <b>squeaking</b> correlated well with elevated friction. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that a likely cause of <b>squeaking</b> in the hip arthroplasty is adverse tribological conditions caused by suboptimal lubrication. There are numerous factors that may cause the suboptimal lubrication, and therefore, it is unlikely that an individual cause for <b>squeaking</b> will be identified...|$|R

5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet <b>squeak</b> or yelp if attacked.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to call}} the album Abracadabra, until they discovered that another band had already used it.

Other suggestions included Bubble and <b>Squeak,</b> Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups <b>squeak</b> to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E
40|$|Ceramic-on-ceramic {{bearings}} in THA are {{a popular}} alternative to overcome wear concerns in traditional metal-polyethylene bearings. However, <b>squeaking</b> is a potentially worrisome phenomenon in ceramic-on-ceramic THAs which we observed {{in some of}} our patients. We reviewed all 42 patients who underwent 43 ceramic-on-ceramic noncemented THAs {{during the time of}} the study. <b>Squeaking,</b> defined as a reproducible sound of <b>squeaking,</b> clicking, or grating, occurred in nine of 43 implants (20. 9 %). Standard radiographs were normal. We used CT imaging to determine cup anteversion and inclination angles, comparing the <b>squeaking</b> hips with those of a randomly selected control group, but found no differences. We then hypothesized specific design features (stem size, cup size, head size, and neck length of the head) would be risk factors for <b>squeaking.</b> We found a difference in neck length between <b>squeaking</b> and nonsqueaking implants. A neck length of − 4  mm or shorter resulted in a relative risk of 5. 56 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 14 – 27. 01) for <b>squeaking.</b> We found a high incidence of <b>squeaking</b> in our population, and we believe this phenomenon is an underreported side effect of these types of bearings. A short neck length of the femoral implant was a risk factor for <b>squeaking</b> in ceramic-on-ceramic THA...|$|R

40|$|We {{designed}} and implemented an in vitro bench test to simulate and identify potential biomechanical causes for hip <b>squeaking</b> with alumina ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surfaces. All bearings were third-generation alumina ceramic with a 32 -mm head {{coupled with a}} 56 -mm acetabular component with a 32 -mm ceramic insert. Conditions for testing were normal gait, high load, stripe wear, stripe wear in extreme load, metal transfer, edge wear with extreme load, and microfracture. Each condition was tested two times in dry conditions and two times in a lubricated condition with 25 % bovine serum. <b>Squeaking</b> was reproduced in all dry conditions. It occurred quickly with high load, stripe wear, or metal transfer. Once <b>squeaking</b> occurred, it did not stop. <b>Squeaking</b> disappeared for all conditions when {{a small amount of}} lubricant was introduced. In lubricated conditions, <b>squeaking</b> was only reproduced for the material transfer condition. Our observations suggest <b>squeaking</b> is a problem of ceramic-ceramic lubrication and that this noise occurs when the film fluid between two surfaces is disrupted. Material (metal) transfer was the only condition that led to <b>squeaking</b> in a lubricated situation...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh <b>squeak</b> in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and <b>squeak</b> is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering <b>squeak</b> when arguing with other males.|$|E

40|$|Large {{diameter}} metal-on-metal bearings (MOM) {{are becoming}} increasingly popular, {{addressing the needs of}} young and more active patients. Clinical data has shown excellent short-to-mid-term results, though incidences of transient <b>squeaking</b> have been noted between implantation and up to 2 years post-operative. Geometric design features, such as clearance, have been significant in influencing the performance of the bearings. Sets of MOM bearings with different clearances were investigated in this study using a hip friction simulator to examine the influence of clearance on friction, lubrication and <b>squeaking.</b> The friction factor was found to be highest in the largest clearance bearings under all test conditions. The incidence of <b>squeaking</b> was also highest in the large clearance bearings, with all bearings in this group <b>squeaking</b> throughout the study. A very low incidence of <b>squeaking</b> was observed in the other two clearance groups. The measured lubricating film was found to be lowest in the large clearance bearings. This study suggests that increasing the bearing clearance results in reduced lubricant film thickness, increased friction and an increased incidence of <b>squeaking...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{incidence}} of <b>squeaking</b> with ceramic-onceramic total hip arthroplasty (THA) after 10 years of follow-up and the potential complications that could occur related to this phenomenon. One hundred THAs implanted between November 1999 and December 2000 were evaluated. Incidence of <b>squeaking</b> was investigated clinically with a questionnaire. Implant positioning was analyzed on x-rays and computer tomography. Of the 100 THAs, 5 patients presented with <b>squeaking.</b> All of them were active, sporty, and heavy men. Functional scores were comparable with nonsqueaking patients. There was no malpositioning on the x-ray analysis, no wear, and no loosening.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} aimed {{to review the}} {{characteristics}} and influencing factors of <b>squeaking</b> after ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to analyze the possible mechanisms of the audible noise. Data Sources: The data analyzed in this review were based on articles from PubMed and Web of Science. Study Selection: The articles selected for review were original articles and reviews found based on the following search terms: “total hip arthroplasty”, “ceramic-on-ceramic”, “hip squeaking”, and “hip noise. ” Results: The mechanism of the <b>squeaking</b> remains unknown. The possible explanations included stripe wear, edge loading, a third body, fracture of the ceramic liner, and resonance of the prosthesis components. <b>Squeaking</b> occurrence is influenced by patient, surgical, and implant factors. Conclusions: Most studies indicated that <b>squeaking</b> after CoC THA was the consequence of increasing wear or impingement, caused by prosthesis design, patient characteristics, or surgical factors.

40|$|This paper reports results {{related to}} the {{phenomenon}} {{referred to as a}} “glottal squeak” (coined by [1]). At present, nothing is known about the conditioning and the articulation of this feature of speech. Our qualitative acoustic analyses of the conditioning of <b>squeaks</b> (their frequency of occurrence, duration, and f 0) found in Aberystwyth English and Manchester English suggest that <b>squeaking</b> may be a result of intrinsically tense vocal fold state associated with thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle recruitment [2] required for epilaryngeal constriction and vocal-ventricular fold contact (VVFC) needed to produce glottalisation [3]. In this interpretation, we hypothesise that <b>squeaks</b> occasionally occur during constriction disengagement: at the point when VVFC suddenly releases but the TAs have not yet fully relaxed. Extralinguistic conditioning identified in this study corroborates findings reported by [1]: females are more prone to <b>squeaking</b> and the phenomenon is individual-dependent...|$|R
