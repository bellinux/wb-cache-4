60|$|How great was {{the general}} <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> may {{be judged by the}} fact that the {{population}} of Germany decreased by half during the war, and in Bohemia the slaughter was even greater. At the commencement of the war the population of Bohemia consisted of 3,000,000 of people, inhabiting 738 towns and 34,700 villages. At the end of the war there were but 780,000 inhabitants, 230 towns, and 6000 villages. Thus three out of four of the whole population had been slaughtered during the struggle.|$|E

Accordingly, when she had gained her bedchamber, bolted herself in, and began to meditate on the scene she had just witnessed, the most terrific pictures of <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> presented themselves to her imagination; among which, a full-length portrait of Mr. Peter Magnus borne home by four men, with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of bullets in his left side, was among the very least. The more the middle-aged lady meditated, the more terrified she became; and at length she determined to repair to the house of the principal magistrate of the town, and request him to secure the persons of Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman without delay.|$|E

Rashi wrote several Selichot (penitential poems) mourning the <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> the <b>destruction</b> of the region's great yeshivot.

60|$|But meanwhile--and {{here comes}} the horror of it--our {{technical}} instruction is honest and efficient. The public schoolboy who is carefully blinded, duped, and corrupted as {{to the nature of}} a society based on profiteering, and is taught to honor parasitic idleness and luxury, learns to shoot and ride and keep fit with all the assistance and guidance that can be procured for him by the most anxiously sincere desire that he may do these things well, and if possible superlatively well. In the army he learns to fly; to drop bombs; to use machine-guns to the utmost of his capacity. The discovery of high explosives is rewarded and dignified: instruction in the manufacture of the weapons, battleships, submarines, and land batteries by which they are applied destructively, is quite genuine: the instructors know their business, and really mean the learners to succeed. The result is that powers of destruction that could hardly without uneasiness be entrusted to infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence are placed in the hands of romantic schoolboy patriots who, however generous by nature, are by education ignoramuses, dupes, snobs, and sportsmen to whom fighting is a religion and killing an accomplishment; whilst political power, useless under such circumstances except to militarist imperialists in chronic terror of invasion and subjugation, pompous tufthunting fools, commercial adventurers to whom the organization by the nation of its own industrial services would mean checkmate, financial parasites on the money market, and stupid people who cling to the status quo merely because they are used to it, is obtained by heredity, by simple purchase, by keeping newspapers and pretending that they are organs of public opinion, by the wiles of seductive women, and by prostituting ambitious talent to the service of the profiteers, who call the tune because, having secured all the spare plunder, they alone can afford to pay the piper. Neither the rulers nor the ruled understand high politics. They do not even know {{that there is such a}} branch of knowledge as political science; but between them they can coerce and enslave with the deadliest efficiency, even to the wiping out of civilization, because their education as slayers has been honestly and thoroughly carried out. Essentially the rulers are all defectives; and there is nothing worse than government by defectives who wield irresistible powers of physical coercion. The commonplace sound people submit, and compel the rest to submit, because they have been taught to do so as an article of religion and a point of honor. Those in whom natural enlightenment has reacted against artificial education submit because they are compelled; but they would resist, and finally resist effectively, if they were not cowards. And they are cowards because they have neither an officially accredited and established religion nor a generally recognized point of honor, and are all at sixes and sevens with their various private speculations, sending their children perforce to the schools where they will be corrupted for want of any other schools. The rulers are equally intimidated by the immense extension and cheapening of the means of <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b> The British Government is more afraid of Ireland now that submarines, bombs, and poison gas are cheap and easily made than it was of the German Empire before the war; consequently the old British custom which maintained a balance of power through command of the sea is intensified into a terror that sees security in nothing short of absolute military mastery of the entire globe: that is, in an impossibility that will yet seem possible in detail to soldiers and to parochial and insular patriotic civilians.|$|E

50|$|Slathered {{in blood}} and gore, Saxon warlord Uhtred of Bebbanburg hacks {{his way through the}} ninth century in the {{exciting}} fifth installment to bestseller Cornwell's Saxon Tales series (following Sword Song). This action-packed novel continues the saga of warfare for supremacy in Britain, a brutal period when Saxon and Danish swords, battleaxes, and treachery ruled the day. By now, Alfred the Great is old and feeble, unwilling and unable to repel the Danish invaders. He relies on trusty pagan warlord Uhtred, but Uhtred's temper and an unexpected violent act force Uhtred to break his oath of loyalty to Alfred and flee north with his men, intending to reclaim his ancestral home. En route, they face marauding Danish armies, betrayal, battles for a pirate treasure, and the curse of a vicious Danish witch, only to eventually be manipulated back into fighting for Alfred. Vivid descriptions of merciless battlefield <b>slaughter,</b> rape, <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> are artfully related by a masterful storyteller. Uhtred is victorious in some battles, but the outcome of others will {{have to wait for the}} sequel.|$|R

As Collot {{was accused}} of excessive <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> and he suspected that he might soon be arrested and executed, he opposed Robespierre during the Thermidorian Reaction, when he presided over the Convention during the initial session. Despite this change of heart, Collot d'Herbois {{was accused of}} complicity with Robespierre, the two having previously been colleagues on the Committee of Public Safety, but was acquitted. Denounced a second time, he defended himself by pleading that he had acted for the Revolution; but, in March 1795, he was condemned with Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac and Billaud-Varenne to transportation to Cayenne, French Guiana, where he exerted a brief revolutionary influence before dying of yellow fever in 1796.|$|E

25|$|The Nazis {{proceeded}} to administer Athens and Thessaloniki, while {{other regions of}} the country were given to Nazi Germany's partners, Fascist Italy and Bulgaria. The occupation brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population. Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–1942, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and collaborators, the country's economy was ruined, and the great majority of Greek Jews were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The Greek Resistance, {{one of the most effective}} resistance movements in Europe, fought vehemently against the Nazis and their collaborators. The German occupiers committed numerous atrocities, mass executions, <b>and</b> wholesale <b>slaughter</b> of civilians <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> of towns <b>and</b> villages in reprisals. In the course of the concerted anti-guerilla campaign, hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1,000,000 Greeks left homeless.

When he asked Richard to save a village of people, Richard replied [...] "I don't 'Save'", until Cale said that afterward they were going to go and cut a path of <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> through Legarion forces, to which Richard immediately strikes a heroic pose and proclaims [...] "We need to save these people!" [...] For instance, when Cale had his throat slashed by a Black Dwarf, Richard used a fire spell to cauterize the wound and carries Cale away from the mountain, despite his frequent assertions that he never saves anyone. He has also saved the life of a small boy for no good reason as well as saving an entire village from flooding at Cale's request. He can also be seen as strangely naïve after commenting that he thinks he hears Benn'Joon getting hurt in the distance by Cale when actually they made love just after kissing passionately. Characteristically he assumes that Cale was hurting her and offered to bury the corpse.|$|E
40|$|Benedict Arnold {{was a man}} {{who could}} have been a “founding father” of America, but instead became a {{national}} villain. His brutal attack on Connecticut epitomizes this transformation: the moment where an abstract idea of betrayal completes its evolution to the <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> of his neighbors and their homes. Focusing on this significant but unfortunately forgotten incident addresses some of the major challenges of any discussion about this complex and confusing American figure. It also directly links Arnold’s story with the stories of his friends and colleagues, something that has never been done before. The combination of these two approaches puts the focus on Arnold’s effects rather than his motives, and on the victims rather than the attacker. Moreover, it reframes his “treason” as “homegrown terror,” a term that resonates with modern readers and whose definition echoes the 18 th century word “parricide,” used by many contemporaries to describe Arnold’s actions...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Recent {{epizootics}} {{of highly}} contagious OIE List A diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, {{classical swine fever}} and avian influenza (AI), led {{to the implementation of}} stamping-out policies resulting in the depopulation of millions of animals. The enforcement of a control strategy that is based only on the application of sanitary restrictions on farms and that involves the culling of animals that are infected, suspected of being infected or suspected of being contaminated, may not be sufficient to avoid the spread of infection, particularly in areas that have high animal densities, and thus results in mass depopulation. In the European Union, the directive that imposes the enforcement of a stamping-out policy (92 / 40 /EC) for AI was adopted in 1992, although it was drafted in the 1980 s. The poultry industry has undergone substantial changes in the past 20 years, mainly resulting in shorter production cycles and in greater animal densities per territorial unit. Due to these changes, infectious animal diseases are significantly more difficult to control because of the greater number of susceptible animals reared per given unit of time and to the difficulties in applying adequate biosecurity measures. The <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> of large numbers of animals is also questionable from an ethical poin...|$|E

40|$|Summary: African {{swine fever}} (ASF) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases of pigs, caused by a complex DNA virus that produces no neutralising antibodies in infected animals. After being introduced into a seaport in Georgia in 2007 through contaminated food waste, ASF has spread rapidly through countries of Eastern Europe, underscoring the extreme threat posed by the disease, not only to the European Union but to all the world’s major pig producing regions. ASF also continues to spread, sometimes unchecked, on the African continent. Many ships, trucks and aircraft travel daily from Africa and infected countries in Europe to every continent, raising fears that the scenario of ASF introduction into Georgia could be repeated in other regions of the world. This article summarises the potential risk of the ASF virus entering the European Union and China from both epidemiological scenarios (Eastern Europe and the African continent). Key to controlling ASF are: risk analysis-based prevention and surveillance; application of strict biosecurity measures; <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction</b> of sick and carrier animals and their contaminated products; and joint work and collaboration among all sectors involved (farmers, veterinarians, hunters, government departments). Lack of a vaccine and an effective treatment severely hampers control of the disease, posing the greatest scientific challenge of our time. However, it is possible to eradicate the disease, even without a vaccine, as evidenced by a number of countries in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, which did so in epidemiological and social circumstances very similar to those observed in affected areas today...|$|E
40|$|Leora Auslander writes that: “Human beings need {{objects to}} {{effectively}} remember and forget; {{and we need}} objects to cope with absence, with loss and with death. ” This text discusses the personal memories and thoughts about my own Jewish family history {{in the context of}} the holocaust, which are embedded in the design of a picture, embroidered in wool on canvas, that I made in the mid- 1990 s in memory of my great-grandmother, Anna Binderowska. The picture was displayed in the exhibition “Hand Made Tales,” curated by Carol Tulloch at the Women’s Library, Whitechapel, London in 2011, when I was also asked to lecture about it at the related conference. Anna, who married in 1864 and had a large number of children, lived and died in the poor Jewish district of the Polish city of Słonim, then in the Russian Pale of Settlement. Four of her children, including my grandfather, Morris, emigrated and settled in Manchester, England in the mid- 1890 s. Never having been to Słonim, I invented a naive, comforting, idyllic vision of Anna’s gravestone in the old Jewish cemetery in the town, under fallen leaves and a blue sky. Researching that cemetery’s specific history twenty years later for Carol Tulloch’s conference, I found that in July 1942, SS Brigadeführer Eric Naumann, in command of Himmler’s special SS Einsatzgruppen B battalion, reached Słonim. The little town became an infamous killing ground, a place of mass Jewish <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b> As all over Poland, the town’s Jewish cemeteries, including Anna’s gravestone, were smashed one by one. This text reflects finally on the fact that Naumann was tried at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal and executed in 1951.

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{analyses}} {{the cases of}} political repressions in the Mongol Empire, Golden Horde and other Turkic-Mongol states of the 13 th– 16 th centuries. Author investigates different types of repressions: against rivals during the struggle for the throne, officials who incurred the anger of monarchs, rebellious cities and their citizens. So, the political rivals often justified their right to the throne referring to the Great Yasa of Chinggis Khan, and hence, the punishment of the vanquished rivals usually was based as well on the Chinggis Khan’s principles of the “Law and Order”: ambiguity of these principles (since the Great Yasa, as it seems, was not a written code of laws but only a system of rules and principles proclaimed by Chinggis Khan or his successors, who attributed them to him) allowed the winners to avenge their rivals following the formal legal norms. Thus, the charge of violation of the Great Yasa was a universal one allowing {{to solve the problem}} of of getting rid of a dangerous rival. The punishment of disgraced officials was justified by other arguments that differed from charges of rebellion of the Chinggisid family members. But Chinggisid rulers also used some “standard” accusations such as treason, support of usurpers, bribery. Since in most cases such acts also contradicted to the principles of the Great Yasa (as they were interpreted by the Chinggisids), the formula “put to yasa” was frequently used in verdicts on such cases. At last, we can also include the destruction of the resisting and insurgent cities in terms of political repressions. Reprisals against foreign cities that resisted the Mongol conquerors, was an integral part of the military strategy of terror facilitating the voluntary surrender of the following cities. In this case, the Chinggisids did not need any legal basis for the <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b> However, in case of the rebellion of their own cities against the legitimate monarch, the latter, dealing with them accordingly, always represented his actions as the restoration of law and order. So, despite the fact that in most of such cases repressions were result of personal decision of the monarch, or revenge, or coup d’etat, etc., we can make sure that almost all of such repressions (with rare exceptions) were presented only as a punishment of criminals, traitors, bribe-takers and so on...|$|E

30|$|The {{modernization}} of Japan after Meiji Restoration motivates its originally latent arrogant concepts and desires, such as self-centered, impulse of expansion, and upstart mentality and imposing manner caused by its rapid rise and despising other East Asian countries and people. Exposed to the education, demonstration, encouragement and cooperation of Western imperialism and racialism behaviors and theories, Japan invaded and colonized the whole East Asia {{and then the}} whole Asia. The leadership and elites of Japan, of course, made up many reasons for such invasion and colonization, including the grandiose excuses of Asian Independence and East Asian Association Campaign. The self-deception of such excuses was self-evident {{in front of the}} direct occupation, <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> looting; moreover, there were the disregarded desires, plans and goals for conquering China and Asia that were then expressed in public by the Japanese elites. Japan’s invasion caused overwhelming disastrous consequences to East Asia and even the whole Asia. It interrupted the ongoing modernization process of East Asia, especially that of China, including the process moving towards constitutionalism. It further interrupted the modernization process of other Asian countries. Thus, Japan destroyed the generally formed international order and balance of power of East Asia, resulting in more in-depth intervention, interference and colonization of Western imperialism towards East Asia and the whole Asia, and in particular, helping the Soviet Union in expanding its sphere of influence in East Asia and the whole Asia and inducing a lot of disastrous events. Generally speaking, Japan basically played a passive role for the modernization transformation and constitutionalism of the whole East Asia region {{from the end of the}} 19 th century to the first half of the 20 th century. Even to this day, Japan’s elites (including intellectuals) still lack of deep introspection; in fact, even the people of the victim countries still lack of full recognition and understanding, only treating the passive influence as the acts of aggression, including <b>slaughter,</b> humiliation, looting <b>and</b> <b>destruction.</b> After joining the US-led Western camp, Japan (including its elites and common people) discarded the external pressure and reason for introspecting and self-criticizing Japan’s crime in the past. Furthermore, Japan’s democratization and Chinese government’s waiver of holding Japan to account over the war (including occupation and compensation) made Japanese government and people exempt from or at least weaken their moral obligations for the aggression and brutal war.|$|R
