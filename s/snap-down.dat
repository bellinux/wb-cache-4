50|$|Key {{features}} of a military-specification jacket (as opposed to a civilian version) are one-piece back (some knock-off jackets have a seam across the shoulder blades; this seam causes discomfort during long flights in a confined position) and lack of side-entry hand-warmer pockets under the large <b>snap-down</b> patch pockets (apparently, the military designers did not want their pilots to be seen standing around with their hands in their pockets and believed {{that a lack of}} hand-warmer pockets would force pilots to be more productive and appear more professional) and no interior pocket.|$|E
5000|$|The suit {{featured}} a chest-mounted control and instrument panel which could fold out for use or fold {{flat against the}} chest when not needed. The suit also {{featured a}} metal [...] "hula hoop" [...] ring on the back, which would allow a solo cosmonaut who fell on his back to roll onto his side and use {{his arms and legs}} to stand. The suit had two <b>snap-down</b> visors, providing differing levels of sun protection, in addition to a clear visor. The outer visor was coated in gold for reflectivity.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the actual}} design would vary {{slightly}} {{depending on the}} manufacturer, and even among contracts within a single manufacturer, all A-2 jackets had several distinguishing characteristics: a snap-flap patch pocket on either side {{that does not have}} hand warmer compartments (hands in pockets were considered unfit for a military bearing), a shirt-style <b>snap-down</b> collar, shoulder straps (or Epaulets), knit cuffs and waistband, a back constructed from a single piece of leather to limit stress on the garment, and a lightweight silk or cotton inner lining with a leather hang strap (not a loop) and military spec tag attached just below the back collar.|$|E
50|$|Other key {{features}} include horsehide or goatskin leather for the shell, dual-knit waist and wrist cuffs, full-length brass zipper, two brass grommets under each armpit for ventilation, a metal hook under the collar to fasten {{the top of}} the opening, and <b>snap-down</b> collar so the tips won't blow around from propwash and jetwash. Seams on the arms of the jacket run along the backside of the pattern, so as not to interfere with movement of the arms along the sides of the torso in confined spaces. Military specifications did not provide for insulation of the A-2 model.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{flight jackets}} are usually {{associated}} with the MA-1, a now-obsolete U.S. military jacket, which is mostly found in sage green. It is made with flight silk nylon and usually has a blaze orange lining, with the specification tag in the pocket, though earlier models had a sage-green lining and the specification tag on the neck area. It has two slanted flap pockets on the front, two inner pockets, and a zipped pocket with pen holders on the left sleeve. The lighter weight version of the MA-1 {{is known as the}} L-2B flight jacket, which in turn, replaced both the original L2 and L2A jackets, which all three differentiate from the MA-1 as they have <b>snap-down</b> epaulets and no inside pockets. The military flight jackets currently used today are the CWU-45P (for colder weather) and the CWU-36P (for warmer weather); both are made from Nomex.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a linear array of tilting mirrors used to attenuate the various wavelengths in a DWDM optical signal. Attenuation of 21 dB at <b>snap-down</b> {{was achieved by}} the tilting mirrors, substituting for a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) in a commercial dynamic spectral equalizer (DSE). Linear fill factor of 92 % was achieved, allowing closely spaced wavelength channels to be individually attenuated. A two layer polysilicon process with a thick epi-poly mirror was used to fabricate the SLM. Initial mirrors had a radius of curvature of 25 cm. A novel accelerated HF-H 2 SO 4 etch allowed 100 m wide mirrors to be undercut in 12 min with no etch release holes.

40|$|We {{developed}} a distributed-parameter model (partial differ-ential equations and associated boundary conditions) that de-scribe the coupled torsion and bending {{motions of the}} Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) using the extended Hamilton prin-ciple. The work done by the electrostatic field is expressed {{in the form of}} a potential energy. It is found that coupling between the torsion and bending motions appears in the boundary con-ditions. The nonlinearity is mainly due to the application of the electrostatic forces and moments. Nonlinear terms appear only in the boundary conditions. The developed model provides a basis for a thorough study of the static and dynamic behaviors of the electromechanical device. The static response of the DMD for different DC loads shows the occurrence of pull-in (<b>snap-down)</b> instability at critical voltage values corresponding to the collapse of the yoke to mechanical stops. Estimates of the voltage, an-gle, and deflection at pull-in are given. The dynamic behavior of the DMD is analyzed by plotting the natural frequencies versus the applied DC voltage. We conducted a study of the sensitivity of the static and dynamic behaviors of the micromirror to vari-ations in the geometric parameters of the DMD. It is found that the thickness and width of the hinges are the key parameters in-∗Address all correspondence to this autho...|$|E
40|$|Assembled MEMS {{structures}} {{provide a}} unique design opportunity by overcoming the inherent planarity of MEMS devices, allowing for added flexibility and new application areas. However, external assembly {{of these devices}} is frequently problematic. Force and displacement controls are often imprecise at the microscale resulting in damage to the device. In contrast, self-assembling MEMS structures can avoid external manipulation and therefore can {{be less likely to}} suffer damage. Self-assembly, though, requires the added complexity of integrated actuation. One type of integrated actuation is driven by scratch drives. Scratch drive actuation is an electrostatic phenomenon that results when a suspended plate with an attached bushing is attracted to a flat plate. The attraction causes <b>snap-down</b> and zippering, pushing the bushing forward. When the charge is released, the plates separate, but the bushing remains in position, causing a horizontal displacement. This process can be repeated to generate forward motion. This paper demonstrates a new CAD capability, the modeling of scratch drive actuation. Modeling any type of self-assembly necessarily involves extensive contact analysis capabilities. In the case of scratch drives, a full actuation cycle [...] consisting of pull-in, zippering, and release [...] must be modeled. This capability will be demonstrated by considering a polysilicon scratch drive actuator that was developed by researchers at the University of Tokyo. Their findings show that the distances the scratch drives travel in each step are approximately 0. 1 m and depend on the peak voltage, suspended plate length, and bushing height. Now, with CAD advances, such as fully coupled electro-mechanical contact analysis and post contact analysis, these devices can be simulated accur [...] ...|$|E
40|$|December 2013. ""A Dissertation Presented to The Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. "Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Mahmoud Almasri. Includes vita. In this research, a novel MEMS {{variable}} capacitor with two capacitive cavities for energy harvesting was developed {{that use the}} wasted energy associated with undesirable mechanical vibrations to power microelectronic sensors and actuators widely found in structures and systems surrounding us. The harvested power, though very small, can {{have a profound effect}} on the usage of microsensors. First, the self-powered sensors will no longer require regular battery maintenance. Second, the self-powered chip is a liberating technology. On a circuit board, it can simplify the connection. On a commercial jet, the sensors can greatly simplify cabling. The design, fabrication, modeling and complete set of characterization of MEMS {{variable capacitor}}s with two-cavity are presented in details in this thesis. The MEMS variable capacitors are unique in its two-cavity design and use of electroplated nickel as the main structural material. The device consists of 2 x 2 mm² movable capacitive proof mass plates with a thickness of 30 [mu]m suspended between two fixed electrodes forming two vertical capacitors. When the capacitance increases for one cavity, it decreases for the other. This allows using both up and down directions to generate energy. The suspended movable plates are supported by four serpentine springs with a thickness of 3 - 5 [mu]m that are attached to the address lines on a silicon substrate only at the anchors' points which is made of electroplated nickel. The serpentine suspension beams are made with a width, thickness and total length (four serpentine turns) of 15 [mu]m, 5 [mu]m and 1485 [mu]m. Five gold stoppers with height of 2 - 4 [mu]m were electroplated on the fixed plates to prevent <b>snap-down</b> of the movable plates by overwhelming electrostatic force. SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 thin layers were patterned on the fixed plates to insulate the stoppers and enhance the dielectric property of capacitive cavities.
