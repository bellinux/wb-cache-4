40|$|Background:   To {{introduce}} {{our experience}} of using the free neurovascular flap from great and second toe. Methods:   Thirteen patients (fifteen fingers) sought surgical treatment for soft tissue defects of the hand at our medical institutin between March 2006 and September 2009. In two patients, fibular side skin-nail flaps of great toe were applied to cover the dorsal defect of distal thumb. In twelve, {{in the treatment of}} pulp defect of finger with fibular <b>side</b> <b>flap</b> of great toe or tibial <b>side</b> <b>flap</b> of second toe. In one, in the treatment of defect of distal middle with composite flap with distal digital bone of second toe. Results:   All flaps were survived. The average subjective satisfaction score was 8. 08 (range 4 - 10). Nine patients (69 %) experienced cold intolerance, and 2 patients (15 %) dysesthesia. The Semmes-Weinstein sensitivity score was between 3. 47 and 4. 72 on the flap, and 0 - 4. 18 on the donor site. The mean two-point discrimination was 6. 8 mm (range 4 - 12). Grip strength was 10 % less than in the unaffected hand. The proximal interphalangeal mobility loss was less than 15 degrees. Conclusions:   Our results indicated that these free flaps from toe are useful for patients with a small soft-tissue defect in hand...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{interaction}} of a wake with a half-span flap on radiated noise are examined. The incident wake is generated by bars of various widths and lengths or by a simplified landing gear model. Single microphone and phased array measurements are used to isolate the {{effects of the}} wake interaction on the noise radiating from the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge and <b>flap</b> cove regions. The effects on noise of the wake generator's geometry and relative placement with respect to the flap are assessed. Placement of the wake generators upstream of the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge is shown to lead to the reduction of <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge noise by introducing a velocity deficit and likely altering the instabilities in the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge vortex system. Significant reduction in <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge noise is achieved with a bar positioned directly upstream of the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge. The noise reduction benefit is seen to improve with increased bar width, length and proximity to the flap edge. Positioning of the landing gear model upstream of the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge also leads to decreased <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge noise. In addition, flap cove noise levels are significantly lower than when the landing gear is positioned upstream of the flap mid-span. The impact of the local flow velocity on the noise radiating directly from the landing gear is discussed. The effects of the landing gear side-braces on <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge, <b>flap</b> cove and landing gear noise are shown...|$|R

5000|$|The {{difference}} between the “Land” and “Maritime” versions is how the outer cummerbund is attached at the front and where the quick-release handle is located. Both comes with an internal cummerbund which overlaps across the stomach and is secured with Velcro. The [...] "Maritime" [...] version has a solid center panel and two <b>side</b> <b>flaps</b> with Velcro panels underneath of them. Each side of the cummerbund attaches to the Velcro on its corresponding side. The release handle {{is located at the}} top of the front panel near the wearer's neck which allows ambidexstrous use. This version provides the wearer with a wide, uninterrupted section of webbing on the center of the vest which allows pouches for multiple magazines to be placed on the center of the body for easy access. On the Land version the external cummerbund wraps around and overlaps over the user's stomach and is secured under a single center flap rather than the two <b>side</b> <b>flaps</b> of the [...] "Maritime" [...] version. The release handle on the [...] "Land" [...] vest is located on the left side of the front panel, just above where the cummerbund wraps around.

The dominant source of flap noise is identified as the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edges, which exceeds that radiated by the midspan region by more than 10 dB. The turbulent surface eddies at the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge have scales on the order of one-half the flap chord. The installation of flap actuator fairings at the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge reduces the noise radiated from that location by 10 to 15 dB. The cross-correlation technique extracts airframe noise radiated by specific surface locations from the tunnel background noise, even when the noise is 25 dB higher than the measured airframe noise level...|$|R
40|$|PIV {{measurements}} of the flow {{in the region of}} a <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge are presented for several blowing flap configurations. The test model is a NACA 63 (sub 2) - 215 Hicks Mod-B main-element airfoil with a half-span Fowler flap. Air is blown from small slots located along the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge on either the top, bottom or side surfaces. The test set up is described and flow measurements for a baseline and three blowing flap configurations are presented. The effects that the flap tip jets have on the structure of the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge flow are discussed for each of the flap configurations tested. The results indicate that blowing air from a slot located along the top surface of the flap greatly weakened the top vortex system and pushed it further off the top surface. Blowing from the bottom flap surface kept the strong side vortex further outboard while blowing from the side surface only strengthened the vortex system or accelerated the merging of the side vortex to the flap top surface. It is concluded that blowing from the top or bottom surfaces of the flap may lead to a reduction of <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge noise...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft noise {{analysis}} {{has been a}} principal topic regarding environmental issues for aviation industry and research community. Besides noise abatement procedures the focus is leaning more towards reduction at the source itself. Noise prediction for optimization purposes of existing technologies as well as integration within design processes of aircraft is required more than ever. Relatively new and still under development, yet already proven to be beneficial is the approach of noise prediction within conceptual aircraft design. To succeed it requires a componential and parametric prediction approach with dominating noise sources adequately represented and modeled. One missing source in such a prediction scheme is the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge. Recent research efforts have again indicated potential dominance of this noise source. Due to complexity of the source mechanisms and practicability limitations {{it is difficult to}} investigate the contribution of the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge on the overall aircraft noise. Therefore, a parametric and componential simulation approach is applied to perform a <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge {{noise analysis}}. For this purpose a semi-empirical prediction model is implemented within an existing parametric aircraft noise analysis module. The aim of the current research study is to analyze the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge noise and provide more insight and knowledge of its potential dominance...|$|R

In Lake Rotoiti in the central North Island of New Zealand the main breeding period occurs between April-July (autumn-winter) with a second breeding period occurring from October-January (spring-summer). The total breeding length time from peak egg laying {{to the release of}} juveniles is estimated to be 28 weeks for the autumn-winter period and 19-20 weeks in spring-summer breeding groups. This difference is attributed to warmer temperatures speeding up the egg development process. In stream populations this growth period has been shown to take around 25-26 weeks in P. planifrons, and up to 60 weeks for P. zealandicus in Otago streams.|$|R
50|$|When a {{pharyngeal}} flap is used, a flap of {{the posterior}} wall {{is attached to}} the posterior border of the soft palate. The flap consists of mucosa and the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. The muscle stays attached to the pharyngeal wall at the upper <b>side</b> (superior <b>flap)</b> or at the lower <b>side</b> (inferior <b>flap).</b> The function of the muscle is to obstruct the pharyngeal port at the moment that the pharyngeal lateral walls move towards each other. It is important that the width and the level of insertion of the flap are properly constructed, because if the flap is too wide, the patient can have problems with breathing through the nose, which can result in sleep apnea. Alternatively, a postoperative situation can be created with the same symptoms as before surgery. Some complications are possible; for example, the flap's width can change because of contraction of the flap. This results in a situation with the same symptoms of hypernasality after a few weeks of surgery. Also a fistula can occur in 2.4% of the cases.|$|R
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} investigate a flap side-edge vortex, which is a contributor to airframe noise. The flowfield investigation showed that the peak turbulent stresses were contained in the shear layer that rolled tip to form the flap side-edge vortex. The wake from the main element was also entrained by the side-edge vortex. The near-field pressure fluctuations where the turbulent shear layer impinged on the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge were broadband in nature from a Strouhal number of 10 to 50. Hot-wire measurements on the downstream vortex identified a broadband instability centered around a Strouhal number of 13. 2. A porous side-edge treatment {{was applied to the}} half-span flap to modify the flap side-edge flowfield. The effect of applying a porous side edge was to reduce the Reynolds stresses contained within the vortex and the shear layer that formed it. The porous material also had the effect of displacing the vortex further away from the flap surface. This led to a reduction in the broadband pressure perturbations measured at the <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge. Compared with the accuracy of the measurements of the aerodynamic forces, the aerodynamic impact of the porous <b>flap</b> <b>side</b> edge was almost negligible...|$|R
40|$|Sixty {{patients}} in whom a biliary endoprosthesis was inserted were randomized to receive: (1) placebo, (2) aspirin, or (3) doxycycline, {{to study the}} effect on the process of sludge formation. After 2 months all endoprostheses were changed, and the amount and composition of the sludge in the patent stents was analyzed. Half of the patients dropped out. The major component (56 %) of the sludge of all groups was protein. No insoluble residue was present. Major deposits of sludge were found at irregularities in the stent wall (<b>side</b> <b>flaps).</b> Both doxycycline and aspirin reduced the dry weight of the sludge. Doxycycline significantly reduced the amount of protein, but scanning electron microscopy still showed abundant bacterial growth. Aspirin reduced the content of all sludge components including protein, suggesting that it decreases "stickiness" of bile. Surprisingly, doxycycline significantly decreased the death rate in the 2 months of the study. We present further evidence for a primary role of protein deposition {{in the early stages of}} stent occlusion. This process can be partly inhibited by doxycycline and probably also by aspirin, which could lead to a significant increase in stent patenc...|$|R

It is usually less than 3 cm thick but may reach a height and width of a metre (yard) or so. There is often a central lobe with two <b>side</b> <b>flaps.</b> The consistency is firm and leathery but also fragile.
