40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on {{accurate}} prediction of Morton effect problem including journal asymmetric heating and the corresponding long period amplitude oscillations using a nonlinear time transient rotordynamic simulation. For {{the analysis of the}} Morton effect problem, variable viscosity Reynolds equation and three-dimensional energy equation are coupled via temperature and viscosity, and solved simultaneously. Three-dimensional heat transfer equations of bearing and shaft are modeled by a finite element method, and thermally coupled with the fluid film via heat flux boundary condition. Asymmetric heat flux into the synchronously whirling rotor is solved by the orbit time averaged heat flux from fluid film to the spinning journal surface. The journal orbit is calculated by the nonlinear transient dynamic analysis of rotor-bearing system with variable time step numerical integration scheme. For the computation time reduction, modal coordinate transformation is adopted for dynamic and thermal transient analysis. This research explains how the thermal bow induced imbalance force develops in spinning journal with time, and how the vibration level is affected by the thermal bow vector. This dissertation is also focused on a new modeling method of three-dimensional thermo-elasto-hydro-dynamic cylindrical pivot tilting pad journal bearing (TPJB). For the computational efficiency, modal coordinate transformation is utilized in the flexible pad dynamic model, and pad dynamic behavior is represented only by means of modal coordinate.

The large angle-of-attack range of the trailing wire required two different model configurations. The first configuration, using full-scale wire lengths suspended between steel stanchions, was mounted on a flush four-degree-of-freedom wall balance. The second configuration, used a 15 -scale grooved cylinder model with an ogive nose mounted on a six-degree-of-freedom sting balance. Wall balance wire data, valid for higher angles of attack, were integrated with low angle-of-attack sting balance data. Empirical relationships for the normal and axial force coefficients were verified with historical references for tested clean circular cylinders and extended for the grooved configurations. Existence of a side force coefficient due to circulation caused by the helical grooves was discovered, expressed analytically, and verified with flow-visualization techniques.

40|$|Homopolymer {{adsorption}} from a dilute solution on an interacting (attractive) surface under <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> is {{studied in}} the framework of a Hamiltonian model. The model makes use of the density of chain ends n 1,e and utilizes the concept of the propagator G describing conformational probabilities to locally define the polymer segment density or volume fraction ¿; both n 1,e and ¿ enter into the expression for the system free energy. The propagator G obeys the Edwards diffusion equation for walks in a self-consistent potential field. The equilibrium distribution of chain ends and, consequently, of chain conformational probabilities is found by minimizing the system free energy. This results in a set of model equations that constitute the exact continuum-space analog of the Scheutjens-Fleer (SF) lattice statistical theory for the adsorption of interacting chains. Since for distances too close to the surface the continuum formulation breaks down, the continuum model is here employed to describe the probability of chain configurations only for distances z greater than 2 l, where l denotes the segment length, from the surface; instead, for distances z¿ 2 l, the SF lattice model is utilized. Through this novel formulation, the lattice solution at z= 2 l provides the boundary condition for the continuum model. The resulting hybrid (lattice for distances z¿ 2 l, continuum for distances z> 2 l) model is solved numerically through an efficient implementation of the pseudospectral collocation method.

The calculations were made for the room temperature structure using the quasiharmonic approximation in which the effects of varying temperature were simulated by varying the short-range force constants. In this way we were able to show that the crystal has a low-frequency optic branch of Σ 2 symmetry which displays softening and instability for wave vectors q in the vicinity of q = 0. 3 a* where a* is the first reciprocal-lattice vector along the [l 00] direction. This is in agreement with experimental neutron scattering results and implies a transition to an incommensurate phase. Full sets of dispersion curves at 130 K for the [l 00] direction are presented. We also present comparisons of the calculated and experimental low-frequency Σ 2 and Σ 3 branches at 130, 145, and 250 K. We show, by decomposition of the squares of the normal-mode frequencies into a sum of Coulomb and short-range components, that the balance between these two kinds of interatomic forces is very delicate. This decomposition also shows that a transition to an incommensurate phase is very likely for both the selenate and isomorphous structures.

First, an approach {{in terms of the}} free energy associated with the magnetic body is presented to derive the <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> for magnetization vector field. Then, the dynamic effects due to the gyromagnetic precession are introduced. Both Landau-Lifshitz and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation are presented. Phenomenological Gilbert damping is analyzed in terms of Rayleigh dissipation function. In chapter 2 the study of magnetization dynamics in uniformly magnetized particles is addressed. In particular, first the static Stoner-Wohlfarth {{model and the}}n magnetization switching processes are analyzed. In addition, novel analytical techniques to study magnetization dynamics under circularly polarized external fields and magnetization dynamics driven by spin-polarized currents are introduced and deeply discussed. In this respect, it is shown how some behaviors indeed observed in experiments, can be explained in terms of bifurcations of fixed points and limit cycles of the LLG dynamical system. As a further step, in chapter 3, the assumption of magnetization spatial uniformity is removed and the problem of studying thin-films reversal processes of technological interest is addressed. In this respect, as preliminary step, the issue of the computation of magnetostatic fields, which is still the bottleneck of micromagnetic simulations, is illustrated together with the mostly used methods at this time. Then, a comparison of damping and precessional switching processes in thin-films is performed, showing that fast precessional switching can be considered spatially quasi-uniform and, therefore, its crucial aspects can be analyzed by means of uniform mode theory discussed in chapter 2. Finally, a uniform mode analysis is applied to the fast switching of granular tilted media which represents {{one of the most promising}} solutions for high density magnetic storage in future hard disks. In chapter 4, the problem of the geometrical integration of LLG equation is considered. In particular, the mid-point rule time-stepping is applied to the LLG equation. In fact, it is shown that the fundamental properties of magnetization dynamics, embedded in the continuous model, are reproduced by the mid-point discretized LLG equation regardless of the time step. In addition, since the resulting numerical scheme is implicit, special and reasonably fast quasi-Newton technique is developed to solve the nonlinear system of equations arising at each time step.

Variations of bed profile and the maximum depth of scour hole with time were discussed, and compared with those under a <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition.</b> Flow characteristics, such as, velocity distribution, bed shear stress and pressure on the scoured bed were also measured at several stages of scour. Modeling the distributions of the bed shear stress measured in scour hole in a experiment, variations of scour hole profiles with time are simulated by solving numerically the continuity equation of the bed material in non-equilibrium states. The validity of the present method is conformed by comparisons of the numerical results with those of experiments under static and dynamic conditions of sediment motion. In addition, field observations of scour profiles were carried out at a downstream reach of hollow squared blocks in the Manganji River in Hyogo Prefecture, and the observed scour profiles and velocity distributions were similar to those in the experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium</b> are {{of special interest}} to civil engineers. For a rigid body to be in <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium</b> the <b>condition</b> is that net force and net torque acting on the body should be zero. That clearly signifies that if equal weights are placed on either sides of a balance, the balance should be in equilibrium, even if its beam is not horizontal (we have considered the beam to be straight and have no thickness, an ideal case). Thus, although the weights are equal, they will appear different which is puzzling. This also shows {{that the concept of}} equilibrium is confusing, especially neutral equilibrium is confused to be stable equilibrium. The study not only throws more light on the concept of <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> but also clarifies that a structure need not be firm and steady even if it is in <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{equivalent}} {{magnetic noise}} spectral densities of off-diagonal GMI based magnetometers exhibit significant low frequency excess noise, proportional to 1 /f noise. As {{it represents a}} serious limitation to the ultimate sensing performances of high sensitivity magnetometers, possible sources of this 1 /f noise are under investigation. Low frequency magnetization fluctuations have been proposed as the noise source {{in the case of}} classical GMI-based sensors. Here, we apply this model to off-diagonal GMI-based magnetometers. This requires the inclusion of magnetization fluctuation noise sources, in addition to white noise sources from electronic conditioning in the GMI effect equations. A pessimistic scenario is presented, predicting the upper limit of low frequency excess noise from material characteristics. The equivalent magnetic noise level is then computed from the sensitivity of each term of the sensing element impedance matrix to the magnetization angle at the static working point (for both axial and circumferential static magnetic field) and to conditioning circuitry. Based on this, it appears that magnetization fluctuations similarly affect all modes of operation of the two-port network sensing element, inducing identical impedance fluctuations. It also appears that this noise depends only upon the <b>static</b> <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition.</b> This condition is governed by the effective anisotropy of the magnetic wire and by both axial and circumferential static components of the working point...|$|R
