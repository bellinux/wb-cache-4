50|$|A <b>street</b> <b>elbow</b> (sometimes {{called a}} street ell or service ell) {{is a type}} of {{plumbing}} or piping fitting intended to join a piece of pipe and another fitting at an angle. The difference between a <b>street</b> <b>elbow</b> and a regular elbow {{is the nature of the}} connections on either end.|$|E
5000|$|Instead, a <b>street</b> <b>elbow</b> has {{a female}} fitting (hub or FIP) {{on one end}} and a male pipe or MIP fitting on the other end. The {{advantage}} of the <b>street</b> <b>elbow</b> {{is that it can}} be connected directly to another fitting without having to use an additional short connecting piece called a pipe nipple.|$|E
5000|$|Street elbows are {{available}} in 90°, 45° and 22.5° bends. They {{can be used in}} water supply, drainage, sewers, vents, central vacuum systems, compressed air and gas lines, HVAC, sump pump drains, and any location where plumbing fittings would be used to join sections of pipe.The Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code of Canada (B149.1) states [...] "...a <b>street</b> <b>elbow</b> or a street tee shall not be used in a piping system".|$|E
50|$|The cost of {{installation}} is {{high because}} of the number of elbows and small pieces of pipe required. The largest cost outlay with modern plastic drain pipes is labor. Use of <b>Street</b> <b>elbows</b> is helpful.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile, the feverish contact of {{the crowded}} street had, strange to say, {{increased}} his loneliness, while the ruder joviality of its dissipations {{began to fill}} him with vague uneasiness. The passing glimpse of dancing halls and gaudily whirled figures that seemed only feminine in their apparel; the shouts and boisterous choruses from concert rooms; the groups of drunken roisterers that congregated around the doors of saloons or, hilariously charging down the <b>streets,</b> <b>elbowed</b> him against the wall, or humorously insisted on his company, discomposed and frightened him. He had known rude companionship before, but it was serious, practical, and under control. There was something in this vulgar degradation of intellect and power--qualities that Clarence had always boyishly worshiped--which sickened and disillusioned him. Later on a pistol shot in a crowd beyond, the rush of eager men past him, the disclosure of a limp and helpless figure against the wall, {{the closing of the}} crowd again around it, although it stirred him with a fearful curiosity, actually shocked him less hopelessly than their brutish enjoyments and abandonment.|$|R
50|$|The {{historical}} site and surrounding recreational city park are protected and {{maintained by the}} City of St. Petersburg. They are located near {{the eastern shore of}} Boca Ciega Bay, at Park <b>Street</b> North and <b>Elbow</b> Lane (17th Avenue) in the city.|$|R
60|$|I had but to {{walk down}} the <b>street,</b> through <b>elbowing</b> throngs of grooms, pages, men-at-arms, and archers, till I found the Paris Gate, whence the {{windmill}} was plain to behold. It was such an old place as we see in Northern France, plain, strong, with red walls which the yellow mosses stain, and with high grey roofs. The Maid's banner, with the Holy Dove, and the Sacred Name, drooped above the gateway, and beside the door, on the mounting-stone, sat the boy, Louis des Coutes, her page. He was a lad of fifteen years, merry enough of his nature, and always went gaily clad, and wearing his yellow hair long. But now he sat thoughtful on the mounting-stone, cutting at a bit of wood with his dagger.|$|R
2500|$|A {{neighbor}} of Riis, {{who was the}} city editor of the New-York Tribune, recommended Riis for a short-term contract. Riis did well, and was offered the job of police reporter. He was based in a press office across from police headquarters on Mulberry Street. [...] "Nicknamed 'Death's Thoroughfare'", Riis's biographer Alexander Alland writes, [...] "It was here, where the <b>street</b> crooks its <b>elbow</b> at the Five Points, that the streets and numerous alleys radiated in all directions, forming the foul core of the New York slums." ...|$|R
6000|$|These I say {{to myself}} are but frail {{memorials}} of the mighty men who flourished {{in the days of}} the patriarchs: but who, alas! have long since smouldered in that tomb towards which my steps are insensibly and irresistibly hastening. As I pace the darkened chamber, and lose myself in melancholy musings, the shadowy images around me almost seem to steal once more into existence, their countenances to assume the animation of life--their eyes to pursue me in every movement! Carried away by the delusions of fancy, I almost imagine myself surrounded by the shades of the departed, and holding sweet converse with the worthies of antiquity! Ah, hapless Diedrich! born in a degenerate age, abandoned to the buffetings of fortune--a stranger and weary pilgrim in thy native land--blest with no weeping wife, nor family of helpless children; but doomed to wander neglected through those crowded <b>streets,</b> and <b>elbowed</b> by foreign upstarts from those fair abodes where once thine ancestors held sovereign empire! ...|$|R
