5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E
