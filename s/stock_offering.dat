5|$|In {{response}} to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's first public <b>stock</b> <b>offering</b> in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio. As {{a result of the}} strikeand the financial state of the companyseveral animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} offers {{evidence that}} common <b>stock</b> <b>offerings</b> for small OTC firms {{have a more}} negative mean announcement period stock return than do large OTC firms. Motivated by this finding, we examine whether the firm size results documented for OTC <b>stock</b> <b>offerings</b> hold for AMEX and NYSE <b>stock</b> <b>offerings.</b> We extend the research on several fronts. First, we show that the firm size effect found for OTC <b>stock</b> <b>offerings</b> holds for AMEX and NYSE <b>stock</b> <b>offerings.</b> Second, we offer evidence that this firm size effect cannot always be explained by issue costs. In addition to the above extensions, we conduct a series of regression tests and establish that firm size, along with signaling variables, are significant factors when accounting for stock returns. Our regression tests demonstrate that firm size is the only explanatory variable that is consistently statistically significant...|$|R

5|$|On February 16, {{the company}} {{announced}} it had filed its registration for the IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Burger King began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BKC on May 18, 2006. The stock sale generated $425million in revenue, the largest IPO of a US-based restaurant chain on record. The proceeds from the sale were used by the company help pay back a loan taken out taken by the company in February used to pay dividends to the investment firms. According to one analyst at Renaissance Capital, Wall Street investors were not alarmed by the large payout due to the increased financial stability of the company resulting from changes made by the investor groups during the interim between the purchase in 2002 and the <b>stock</b> <b>offering.</b> Incoming CEO John W. Chidsey backed the payouts, stating that the financial firms spent considerable time and capital turning the company around.|$|E
5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a <b>stock</b> <b>offering</b> of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} {{downturn}} and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public <b>stock</b> <b>offering.</b> By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to pay any back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of {{issuance}} expenses in explaining the fall in stock value for OTC <b>stock</b> <b>offerings</b> that raise cash for debt reduction purposes. It estimates that {{over half of the}} sample's - 2. 79 % two-day fall in stock value can be accounted for by issuance expenses when using a lower bound measure of issuance expenses. This estimate contrasts with the one-fifth estimate suggested by NYSE/AMEX studies that examine <b>stock</b> <b>offerings</b> that raise cash primarily for non-debt reduction purposes. The influence of issuance expenses is shown to be substantially greater when combination offerings are deleted, an upper bound measure of issuance expenses is employed, or the sample is restricted to those offerings with the greatest issuance expenses per outstanding share...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} of common <b>stock</b> <b>offerings</b> reaches different conclusions concerning {{the impact of}} issue costs on stock value. We identify factors that can best explain the different findings—most prominent are the issue costs measure and the listing. We investigate 323 common <b>stock</b> <b>offerings</b> and find that $ 61 of every $ 100 fall in stock value {{can be attributed to}} issue costs. The respective dollar amounts for the samples of OTC, AMEX, and NYSE firms are $ 72, $ 69, and $ 38. These findings suggest that the collective impact of the negative wealth effects from managerial signaling may be less important than generally assumed. Mikkelson and Partch (1986) and Hull and Fortin (1993 / 1994) are the only studies to examine in detail the impact of issue costs on announcement period stock returns for equity offerings. These two studies reach different conclusions. Mikkelson and Partch (1986) find that offering costs are a relatively smal...|$|R
