5|$|Another {{important}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Egypt {{during the}} reign of Djedkare Isesi is the Abusir papyri. These are administrative documents, covering a period of 24 years during Djedkare's reign; they were discovered in the mortuary temples of pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre and queen Khentkaus II. In addition to these texts, the earliest letters on papyrus preserved to the present day also date to Djedkare's reign, dealing with administrative or private matters.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are {{the main}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Badami Chalukya history. Among them, the Badami cave {{inscriptions}} of Mangalesha (578), Kappe Arabhatta record of c.700, Peddavaduguru inscription of PulakeshinII, the Kanchi Kailasanatha Temple inscription and Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple inscription of VikramadityaII (all in Kannada language) provide more evidence of the Chalukya language. The Badami cliff inscription of PulakeshinI (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of PulakeshinII (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old Kannada script.|$|E

5|$|It is {{slightly}} larger than Pallas, though significantly more massive. Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Many of the regnal {{dates of}} the East Anglian kings are {{considered}} unreliable, often being based upon computations. Some dates have presented particular problems for scholars: for instance, during the three-year-long period of apostasy {{that followed the}} murder of Eorpwald, {{when it is not}} known whether any king ruled the East Angles. The main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the early history of the kingdom's rulers is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais was a Norman, and {{a native}} of Bayeux; {{he may have been}} a member of one of its {{clerical}} dynasties. His mother's name, Ascelina or Anselma, is given in Durham's records; his father, whose name is unknown, became a monk at the monastery of Saint-Calais in Maine, and may previously have been a knight. Although St-Calais is generally referred to as Saint Calais or St-Calais, the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> his life, the monastic chronicle of Symeon of Durham, does not call him such.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|De Materia Medica is {{the prime}} {{historical}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which {{otherwise would have been}} lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{principal}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the Andes was Charles Wiener's 1880 book Pérou et Bolivie ("Peru and Bolivia"), {{which contained}} 1,100 engravings from which Hergé could base his own illustrations. In this way, small details about Andean costume and material culture were accurately copied. Part of the ceremonial costume {{worn by the}} Incan priest was based upon a colour painting of Mexican Aztecs produced by Else Bostelmann for the National Geographic Society which Hergé had a copy of in his files. He ensured that his depiction of the Peruvian trains was accurate by basing them upon examples found in a two-volume picture encyclopedia of railways published by Librarie Hachette in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In 893 Asser wrote a {{biography}} of Alfred, called the Life of King Alfred. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, {{which was part of}} the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and possibly with other works.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived, because of the destruction of its monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian sees that occurred as the result of Viking raids and settlement. The main primary sources for information about Anna's life and reign are the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in Northumbria by Bede in 731, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, initially written in the ninth century, which mentions Anna's death. The mediaeval work known as the Liber Eliensis, written in Ely in the twelfth century, is a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Anna's daughters Æthelthryth and Seaxburh, and also describes Anna's death and burial.|$|E

5|$|Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot {{coined the}} {{binomial}} Dromaiusater in 1817. In 1906, Walter Baldwin Spencer coined the name Dromaiusminor {{based on some}} Pleistocene subfossil bones and eggshells found on King Island the same year, believing {{they were the first}} physical evidence of an emu from there. William Vincent Legge also coined a name for these remains, Dromaiusbassi, but at a later date. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, Walter Rothschild stated that Vieillot's description actually referred to the mainland emu, and that the name D.ater was therefore invalid. Believing the skin in Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris was from Kangaroo Island, he made it the type specimen of his new species Dromaiusperoni, named after the French naturalist François Péron, who is the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the bird in life.|$|E
5|$|The Omnem {{constitution}} at {{the beginning}} of the Digest is the only <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of Gaius, Ulpian, Papinian and Paulus. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' Responsa; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, Dupondii; second, Edictales; third, Papinianistae; fourth, Lytae.|$|E
5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
