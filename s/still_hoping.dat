5|$|In {{his last}} {{surviving}} letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> for {{the settlement of}} the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf. He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the Church of the Frari. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661, Francesco after 1677.|$|E
5|$|After the Rye House Plot of 1683, {{an attempt}} to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and {{gathered}} supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, {{where he had been}} greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E

5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{rift between}} Khrushchev's Soviet {{government}} and North Vietnam was clearly obvious in August 1964, when the Soviet Union responded {{in a relatively}} muted fashion after the U.S. conducted air strikes against North Vietnamese Navy bases {{in retaliation for the}} Tonkin Gulf incident. Despite the Soviets’ lack of response, the North Vietnamese leadership restrained itself from criticizing the Soviet government, as they were <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> that Khrushchev would supply North Vietnam with the anti-aircraft weapons required to defend against further U.S. air attacks. However, the event which occurred in Moscow in October 1964 worked in North Vietnam's favor, as Khrushchev was removed from power. Keen to counteract Chinese influence in the region, a new Soviet government led by Alexei Kosygin sought to end a defense pact with North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 31 May Howe's fleet {{closed with}} the French, making {{full use of}} the {{advantage}} of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted. During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more. Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to draw Howe away from the convoy.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{the writer}} was <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> {{for a return}} to the {{political}} stage, this time with the Nationalist Democratic Party, which came to power under Nicolae Iorga. To this goal, he approached Internal Affairs Undersecretary Nicolae Ottescu, requesting appointment as prefect, but was refused. During the same period, Caragiale was occasionally involved in events affecting the cultural scene. In May 1930, he was present at a banquet in honor of Italian author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the ideologue of Futurism. Organized by the Romanian Writers' Society and the Italo-Romanian Cultural Association, it was also attended by many other cultural figures, most of which, including artist Marcel Janco and the writers Ion Vinea, Jacques G. Costin, Ion Minulescu and Camil Petrescu, were associates of the magazine Contimporanul. In January 1934, linguist and publisher Alexandru Rosetti signed a contract with Caragiale, through which the latter agreed to complete Sub pecetea tainei and have it published by Rosetti's Editura Fundațiilor Regale.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield (disagreeing with Harris & Barr pp146–7) {{argues that}} Haig was still aiming for {{relatively}} limited objectives, but with bigger bites across a wider front {{as he had}} wanted to do since 1915, and that he was aiming for “soft-spot infiltration”, although <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> for a complete enemy breakdown which would allow deep cavalry exploitation.|$|E
25|$|In March 1926, after thwarting a {{kidnapping}} attempt against him (Zhongshan Warship Incident), Chiang abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers, imposed restrictions on CCP members' {{participation in the}} top leadership and emerged as the pre-eminent Kuomintang leader. The Soviet Union, <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to prevent a split between Chiang and the CCP, ordered Communist underground activities to facilitate the Northern Expedition, which was finally launched by Chiang from Guangzhou in July 1926.|$|E

25|$|After his release, Warner stocked shelves at a Hy-Vee {{grocery store}} in Cedar Falls for $5.50 an hour. Warner often notes this as the {{starting}} point when telling of his rise to NFL stardom in 1999. He also mentions his increased dedication to Christianity that occurred around 1997. Warner also returned to Northern Iowa and worked as a graduate assistant coach with the football team, all the while <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to get another tryout with an NFL team.|$|E
25|$|Pijon next {{appeared}} {{as one of}} six brigadiers in André Masséna's 15,391-man division {{in the order of}} battle for the Castiglione Campaign. On 29July, the brigades of Pijon and Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire were attacked by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's Austrians at Rivoli Veronese. Outnumbered 22,000 to 10,000, the French were defeated with losses of 1,200 killed and wounded, and 1,600 men and nine guns captured. The Austrians counted 800 casualties. <b>Still</b> <b>hoping</b> to block Wurmser's advance, Masséna deployed Pijon and Claude Perrin Victor at Piovezzano near Pastrengo the next day.|$|E
25|$|At around 12:30 Miloradovich {{tried to}} speak to the rebel troops and was fatally shot by Pyotr Kakhovsky and stabbed by Yevgeny Obolensky. Wilhelm Küchelbecker {{attempted}} shooting Grand Duke Michael. Another negotiator, Metropolitan Serafim, was forced away from the square. Nicholas, <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to avoid bloodshed, ordered an intimidating cavalry charge against the rebels. It miserably failed as horses lost balance and fell on icy pavement. As time passed by, civilians flooded the square, forming a dense circle around the loyalists troops. Nicholas feared that the mob may overwhelm his troops after sunset. Worse, he saw his own soldiers defecting to the rebels.|$|E

25|$|Medwin {{moved to}} Genoa, {{where he worked}} assiduously on a play, Prometheus portarore del fuoco (Prometheus the Fire-Bearer). Though never {{published}} in English, it was translated into Italian and published in Genoa in 1830, where it was reviewed enthusiastically. In typical fashion, Medwin dedicated the play {{to the memory of}} Shelley. Genoa, however, turned out to be only an interlude, as Medwin was expelled for writing a tragedy called The Conspiracy of the Fieschi, which alarmed the Genoese authorities, believing it to be anti-government propaganda. By January 1831 Medwin, without his family, was back in London, <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to earn a living as a writer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Still</b> <b>hoping</b> {{to provoke}} an attack, the 250 Ngāi Te Rangi fighters at Pukehinahina {{enlarged}} the existing trench and banks and transformed the pā {{into a system}} of two redoubts, including a honeycomb of rua, or anti-artillery bunkers. While the main redoubt was garrisoned by Ngāi Te Rangi, the smaller one was manned by about 30 members of the Ngāti Koheriki hapu and another 10 men from Piri-Rikau and other hapu. With timber scarce in surrounding swampland, palisading was frail, but {{the location of the}} redoubt on a hilltop, and the total span of the palisading gave their enemy the impression of greater strength than it actually possessed. The total garrison of Gate Pā was about 230.|$|E
25|$|While Mozart was in Paris, {{his father}} was {{pursuing}} opportunities of employment for him in Salzburg. With {{the support of the}} local nobility, Mozart was offered a post as court organist and concertmaster. The annual salary was 450 florins, but he was reluctant to accept. By that time, relations between Grimm and Mozart had cooled, and Mozart moved out. After leaving Paris in September 1778 for Strasbourg, he lingered in Mannheim and Munich, <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to obtain an appointment outside Salzburg. In Munich, he again encountered Aloysia, now a very successful singer, but she was no longer interested in him. Mozart finally returned to Salzburg on 15 January 1779 and took up his new appointment, but his discontentment with Salzburg remained undiminished.|$|E

25|$|By 7 September the 5th Army was {{threatened}} with being {{split in two}} by the Second Army coming from {{the east and the}} Sixth Army’s northern outflanking of Kiev. The Stavka refused permission initially for the 5th Army to withdraw, as they were <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> for results from a counterattack by the Bryansk Front. By 9 September Stalin had finally given authority for the 5th Army to withdraw but by then it was trapped, and on 20 September Potapov and his command group were taken prisoner. In the disastrous battle, the German forces encircled forces from the 5th, 21st, 26th, and 37th Armies, captured Kiev, and claimed 665,000 prisoners (Soviet sources assert that the total strength of the Southwestern Front was 677,000 of which 150,000 had escaped).|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{planned to}} make a transatlantic flight from New York to Rome on 10 July 1927 but the plan did not materialize. Three days after the failed attempt, she was <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> {{to become the first}} woman to cross the Atlantic. Phillips signed a one-year {{contract}} for picture rights with the theatrical producer Oliver Morosco for the attempt. Though she made several plans, New York to France, New York to London, New York to Leningrad she did not complete any of the trips and appears to have stopped flying by 1930, when she was working in a beauty parlor at the Hotel Ansonia in New York City. Her husband died in Manhattan in 1936 and in the 1940s Phillips drove a taxi in New York City.|$|E
25|$|After Warner was {{cut from}} the Packers' {{training}} camp in 1994, {{he got a job}} working the night shift as a Night Stock Clerk at a local Hy-Vee grocery store, in addition to his work as an assistant coach at Northern Iowa. While Warner was working as an assistant coach, the couple were living in Brenda's parents' basement in Cedar Falls. Brenda's parents were killed in 1996 when their Mountain View, Arkansas home was destroyed by a tornado. Warner and Brenda married on October 11, 1997, at the St. John American Lutheran Church, the same place where the service for Brenda's parents was held. Warner was <b>still</b> <b>hoping</b> to get an NFL tryout, but with that possibility appearing dim and the long hours at the Hy-Vee for minimum wage taking their toll, Warner began his Arena League career.|$|E
