5000|$|Burt {{works to}} {{commission}} {{although he has}} also designed pieces such as garden benches or public seating {{that can be made}} to order as 'standard' ranges. Some of his early commissions emphasised the playful dexterity of making wood do seemingly impossible things. A chair for an annual competition run by the arts development agency Southern Arts carried this exuberance to extremes, responding to a brief set by the organisation’s literature development officer to design and make a chair that has wit and speaks of its interest. Burt forced the idea of the essential framework or 'exo-skeleton' of a piece of furniture to the furthest point in his Ruminative Chair (1989) made of wych elm, English elm, burr elm and sycamore, replete with a floating <b>seat</b> <b>pad,</b> twisted stems, inlays, and moveable balls set at the ends of the arms, in a gothic-like seat. The chair was intended to make the impossible look plausible.This chair is about as close to postmodernism as Burt allows himself to get. He has focused more recently on a cleanliness of line and, sometimes, a subtle and sinuous curve (for example in the complex edge of his Leaf Table (2007) or the Pyramalised dresser 1. These designs combine dexterity of hand skill with the advances made possible by computer assisted drawing technology. In Burt’s view, using sophisticated equipment as a means of advancing practice is both plausible and efficient. He may find a wistful and reflective admiration for the honest toil and tools of the Arts and Crafts furniture makers, but his work has to survive in a challenging contemporary marketplace, and the high prices that are charged for this commissioned work necessarily take into account high labour and studio costs as well as the intensive design and fitting stages of complex pieces for sometimes mercurial clients.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Introduction. The high {{prevalence}} of {{low back pain}} in drivers of commercial motor vehicles is well-documented. A number of interventions to reduce low back pain in commercial motor vehicle operators have focused on reducing exposures to wholebody vibration (WBV). Objective. An intervention to be evaluated for the trucking industry is an air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> designed to reduce exposure to WBV. The effectiveness of the <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> in semi-trucks {{has not yet been}} established. Results from a previous pilot study involving 12 -ton and 16 -ton vibratory rollers used by Seattle Public Utility drivers suggest that the <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> is not effective at very low speeds (1 - 3 mph). Methods. The current study measures, characterizes and compares WBV exposures in nine truck drivers who operated their trucks over the same roads. WBV exposures were compared between their existing air-suspension seat and the air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> which sat on top of their existing seat. This study uses a Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the seat pad’s effectiveness in reducing WBV exposures relative to their existing air-suspension seat. Results. Overall, the truck drivers' vibration exposures were above daily vibration action values set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> did not significantly reduce WBV exposures relative to the WBV exposures experienced with their existing air-suspension seat. Conclusions. In the semi-trucks evaluated in this study, the air-filled ballistic <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> was not effective in reducing WBV exposures. The <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing WBV exposures in public transportation buses and cars. The answer for why the air-filled seat pads were not effective in semi-trucks may lie in a future analysis of the power spectral densities, which shows the vibration exposures as a function of frequency. Buses and cars produce more high frequency vibration energy, and the air-filled <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> has been shown to be effective in these vehicles when travelling at moderate to high speeds. Trucks may produce less high frequency vibration energy, and this may have diminished the air-filled seat pad’s effectiveness in the semi-truck evaluated in this study...|$|E

It is necessary to understand the level of Whole-Body-Vibration (WBV) exposure since it affects comfort and health performance of humans. Objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the exposure levels in operators of construction vehicles. In addition, preventive strategies, which are needed to reduce low back pain problems due to WBV, will be investigated. Ten operators of vehicles were selected where the vehicles were chosen so that those are vastly used in the construction sector. In this study, it was selected three construction vehicle types: excavators, backhoes and roller vibrators. A questionnaire survey was carried out with each operator regarding their profession, age, working experiences, health and exposure duration. The vibration exposure levels induced on operators bodies were measured using a tri axial vibration meter (SV 106) attached to a <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> accelerometer. The operator was instructed to sat on seat-pad accelerometer and WBV exposures in three directions (i. e., vertical, fore-and-aft and lateral) were measured.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} health risks to operators of large and small load-haul-dump (LHD) vehicles exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV), based on criteria established in ISO 2631 - 1, ISO 2631 - 5, and EU Directive 2002 / 44 EC. Studies simultaneously evaluating health risks based on all three standards are limited. Operator WBV exposure was measured in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 using a tri-axial <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> accelerometer. According to ISO 2631 - 1, four of the seven large LHD vehicle operators and three of six small LHD vehicle operators were exposed to WBV above the 8 -hour vibration dose value (VDV) health guidance caution zone (HGCZ). According to the EU Directive 2002 / 44 /EC criteria one of the seven large LHD vehicle operators and one of the six small LHD vehicle operators were exposed to WBV above the VDV daily exposure limit. However, health risks predicted by ISO 2631 - 5 criteria only placed one of seven large LHD vehicle operators and one of the six small LHD vehicle operators in the high probability of an adverse health effect category. Thus, the probability of adverse health effects, associated with WBV exposure during LHD vehicle operation, is suggested to be greatest based on the ISO 2631 - 1 8 -hour VDV HGCZ and lowest based on ISO 2631 - 5 Sed criterion values...|$|E

In the current study, operators’ WBV exposure was measured in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 using a tri-axial <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> accelerometer at the operator/seat interface. WBV exposure was evaluated along all three orthogonal axes by frequency-weighted RMS acceleration and vibration dose value. Result of the study shows that mean frequency weighted RMS acceleration along Z-axis is dominant as compared to X and Y axis. In the case of VDV exposure, the mean VDV along Z-axis is also higher as compared to X and Y axis however magnitude of mean vector sum of VDV is lower compared to the Z-axis. The predicted health risk of operators based on daily RMS exposure shows that only 3. 6 % of drill machine operators were found between the recommended upper and lower limit of health caution zone of ISO standard 2631 - 1. However, based on VDV evaluation method, all the drill machine operators were found above the recommended upper limit of health caution zone of ISO standard 2631 - 1.

Building and maintaining transport infrastructure is essential for economic and social development of a country. The high costs of repair and maintenance of the existing road networks required to manage the road repair and maintenance and regular planning for this process. Due to daily usage of newly constructed roads, the quality condition of roads, decreases with the time. As a result, discrete faults such as bumps, depressions or potholes are appearing on the road surface. These unevenness and undulations of road surface along longitudinal profile of the road causes vertical oscillations in moving automobiles and its effects on the passenger as Whole Body Vibration. Uneven pavement or road surfaces cause discomfort and fatigue to the passenger directly. The objectives of the current study is to investigate the condition of the road surface both using vibration measurements and visual inspections and to determine possible methods to assess the existing road condition based on the vibration measurements.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial & Manufacturing EngineeringThe use of forklifts to move {{material}} {{is very common}} in large manufacturing companies. Exposure to whole body vibration from industrial vehicles such as forklifts {{has been associated with}} low back pain and also with the degeneration of intervertebral disc. Predicted health risks, associated with the operation of forklifts, based on ISO 2631 - 1 criteria are limited and have not yet been determined according to ISO 2631 - 5 criteria. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the whole body vibration exposure levels during the operation of different types of forklifts and to quantify WBV exposure levels using ISO 2631 - 1 and ISO 2631 - 5 standards. Hence, health risks predicted by ISO 2631 - 1 and 2631 - 5 criteria are reported and compared in this study. This research was conducted at a local aircraft manufacturing company in Wichita, KS. Vibration exposure was measured according to procedures established in ISO 2631 - 1. A triaxial <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> accelerometer was used to measure vibration exposure at the operator/seat interface. Vibrations were measured passively with the use of a battery-operated datalogger while employees drove their forklifts during a normal work day. The results were compared in accordance to frequency-weighted r. m. s values, vibration dose values, equivalent compressive stress Sed and the R factor. According to ISO 2631 - 1 criteria, two forklift operators were identified to have a high risk of exposure and three forklift operators were identified to have a moderate risk of exposure in accordance with health guidance caution zone (HGCZ) boundaries with A (8) as a measure. Similar results were achieved from the Sed and R factor values which were the measure of ISO 2631 - 5. Adverse health effects on the lumbar spine according to ISO 2631 - 5 were always lower than the risks predicted by ISO 2631 - 1 criteria. But, VDV (a measure of ISO 2631 - 1) showed similar results with ISO 2631 - 5 measures...|$|E
40|$|Background Farmers {{experience}} {{a high rate}} of low back pain (LBP), with a lifetime prevalence of up to 75 %. Whole body vibration exposure has been recognized as a significant physical risk factor associated with LBP. The agriculture sector has high whole body vibration exposures related to various machine types; however, little research has assessed vibration exposure in farming due to the inconvenience and cost of direct data collection. Prediction modelling is potentially a cost-efficient way to estimate directly measured exposure. Objectives The objectives of this study are to 1) measure the physical exposure of whole body vibration in Saskatchewan farmers and understand its magnitude and variability between farm machinery; and 2) use farm, vehicle, and task characteristics to determine any predictive relationship with directly-measured whole body vibration exposures among Saskatchewan farmers. Methods A 1 -year field study with 3 repeated farm visits was conducted for whole body vibration measurements on 21 farms within a 400 km distance of Saskatoon. Whole body vibration was assessed using a tri-axial accelerometer embedded in a standard rubber <b>seat</b> <b>pad</b> according to international standards (ISO 2631 - 1). Whole body vibration data were summarized by machinery type into standardized metrics of root-mean-squared accelerations (RMS), peak, crest factor, and vibration dose value (VDV). Vehicle characteristics were gathered by on-site observations supplemented by open access vehicle descriptions through manufacturers. Farm characteristics and farmer’s self-reported whole body vibration exposure were collected via questionnaires. A manually stepwise method was conducted to build mixed-effects models for both RMS and VDV outcomes. Results A total of 87 whole body vibration measurements were gathered from 8 machine types: tractor, combine, pickup truck, grain truck, sprayer, swather, all-terrain vehicle, and skid steer. The average measurement duration was 85 minutes. The mean vector sums were RMS 0. 78 m/s², peak 19. 34 m/s², crest factor 27. 64, and VDV 10. 02 m/s 1. 75. The fixed effects of ‘horsepower’, ‘vehicle transmission type’, ‘farm size’, and ‘farm commodity’ explained 44 % of the variance in RMS; while ‘horsepower’, ‘seat suspension type’, ‘loading frequency’, ‘tire tread type’, ‘jerk/jolt frequency’, ‘seat bottom-out frequency’, ‘farm commodity’, and ‘farm size’ explained only 20 % of VDV variance. Conclusion High mechanical vibration and shocks from a range vehicle types call for action to reduce agricultural whole body vibration. Although VDV is relatively difficult to predict through farm and vehicle features collected in the present study, RMS can be predicted to a moderately useful degree. Predictors identified via modeling can help explain the variances of whole body vibration exposures and may also serve as new surrogates for future whole body vibration exposure assessment...|$|E
40|$|The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) {{standard}} ISO 2631 [1, 2] provides three {{methods for}} evaluation of human exposure to vibrations that contain occasional shocks or impacts. Part 1 of the standard specifies the running r. m. s. or maximum transient vibration method (MTVV) and the fourth power vibration dose value (VDV). Part 5 of the standard provides a method of computing the stress in the lumbar spine for humans exposed to multiple shocks. Alem et al [3] have reported application of these methods to data for tactical ground vehicles. This paper reports and compares VDV and spinal stress evaluations of more than 90 hours of vibration and shock measurements on North American locomotives engaged in through freight operations. The measurements evaluated in this paper were obtained for full crew shifts on 19 freight locomotive runs on mainline track in locations from New York to California. The shifts ranged in duration from 187 minutes to 497 minutes. The average speeds for the shifts were from 21. 0 mph to 54. 6 mph. All measurements were made on locomotives hauling freight trains in regular revenue service. Data Acquisition and Processing The results reported here were computed using test data acquired from a tri-axial <b>seat</b> <b>pad,</b> accelerometer at a sample rate of 400 Hz with an anti-aliasing filter corner frequency of 100 Hz. The VDVs and the lateral and longitudinal spinal stress values were computed directly from the acquired test data according to the procedures specified and described in [1] and [2]. The vertical spinal stress values were computed by converting the as-acquired test data to a sample rate of 160 Hz for input to the vertical spine model, as required in [2]. The conversion of the test data from the as-acquired sample rate of 400 Hz to the required sample rate of 160 Hz involved up sampling or interpolating the test data to an equivalent sample rate of 800 Hz, band limiting the resultant data with a low-pass filter corner frequency of 60 Hz and finally down sampling or decimating the 800 Hz data to a sample frequency of 160 Hz. Discussion The vertical VDVs computed according to [2] for the 19 shifts ranged from 2. 68 to 9. 33 m/s 1. 75. In all but one case, the vertical values were greater than the values for the lateral or longitudinal directions. Note that the health guidance in [1] puts the lower boundary of the health guidance caution zone at a VDV value of 8. 5 and the upper boundary at 17 m/s 1. 75.
