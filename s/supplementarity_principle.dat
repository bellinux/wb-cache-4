Our contribution is {{to argue that}} the conflict between the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) stems mainly from disagreement on the cost issue. We argue that the three main concerns promoted by the EU in The Hague. First, a 50 % national emission ceiling (the <b>supplementarity</b> <b>principle),</b> second the use of carbon sinks, and third an international market control system. These issues can be solved by removing all restrictions on free greenhouse gas (GHG) trade and by establishing the World Trade Organization as an international authority. The US will face considerably higher costs than foreseen at the negotiations in Kyoto and will have strong incentives to free ride. Our main hypothesis is that the EU proposal on supplementarity made the US turn to free riding. Thus, to make the US stay in an international GHG emissiontrading scheme, the EU must reconsider and acknowledge US claims for cheaper reduction options and the right to trade ‘hot air’. This point is important. If the US does not participate, the increase in emissions will be much higher than the emission reductio...|$|E

We argue that three main concerns promoted by the European Union in The Hague, i. e. a 50 % national emission ceiling (the <b>supplementarity</b> <b>principle),</b> the use of carbon sinks and an international market control system, can be solved by less restrictions on free GHG trade and by establishing the World Trade Organization as an international authority. Because the US face much higher future reduction costs than the EU, the US will be imposed considerably higher costs than the negotiations in Kyoto were based on. Thus, to make the US stay in an international GHG emission- trading scheme, the EU must reconsider and acknowledge US claims for cheaper reduction options and the right to trade ‘hot air. ’ This point is important. If the US do not participate, the increase in emissions will be much higher than the emission reduction following the EU supplementarity proposal.

40|$|Based on 18 {{national}} allocation plans (NAPs) {{submitted to}} the European Commission for phase II (2008 - 2012) of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), we find that, on average, the ET budgets in phase II are only about 2. 6 % below historical emissions in 2005, about 3. 1 % lower than the budgets in phase I (2005 - 2007), and 3 % below projected emissions in 2010. While the EU- 15 Member States (MS) intend to reduce emissions by about 8 - 11 %, the implied excess allocation in the new Member States lies between 17 % and 31 %. Compared with a cost-efficient split of the required emission reductions, the ET budgets in the EU- 15 MS are generally too large. Thus, in total, the burden for the non-trading sectors (households, tertiary and transport) is too high. Furthermore, the high shares of governments' intended and companies' possible use of Kyoto mechanisms challenge the <b>supplementarity</b> <b>principle.</b> Our detailed analyses of the allocation methods of these NAPs (across countries and phases) suggest that MS should adhere to the concepts and methodologies developed in phase I. This implies that only a little {{progress has been made}} towards achieving more efficient and more harmonized allocation rules across MS. Untapped potentials to improve environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency crucially hinge on the outcome of the Commission's review process...|$|E
40|$|Certified {{emission}} reductions (CERs) from Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{projects have}} traditionally {{served as an}} indirect link between cap and trade systems around the world. However, since 2010, import restrictions have increased. Reasons for import limitations include the <b>supplementarity</b> <b>principle,</b> genuine concerns about the environmental integrity of CERs and social benefits of CDM projects, pressure from domestic emissions mitigation industries, concerns about competition in the industries in which reductions take place, {{as well as the}} attempt to pressure advanced developing countries to accept national emissions commitments under a future international climate policy regime. It is shown that import limitations lead to a decrease in CER prices and a race to generate CERs as quickly as possible. Such effects are visible in the CDM market after the EU announced its import limitations. The exclusion of CERs from specific project types will distort the CDM supply curve and increase the CER price unless the marginal abatement costs of the excluded project type are above the CER world market price. Similarly, exclusion of CERs from specific host countries will increase the price. Substantial differences are found in CER access to national carbon markets around the world. Policy relevanceCDM regulators could try to improve access of CERs to cap and trade schemes through improvements to additionality testing, standardizing baseline and monitoring methodologies and stakeholder consultation. However, regulators should be aware that standardization is no panacea, and controversies may resurface if standardized additionality determination (e. g. through benchmarks or positive lists) are applied for a certain period and found to be problematic. However, domestic policy concerns such as an unwillingness to send money abroad to buy credits, an inability to control market prices, and competitiveness impacts cannot be resolved by CDM reforms. If, despite such reforms of the CDM, blatant protectionism continues, a challenge before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) could be launched to stop discrimination of service exports from specific countries...|$|E
