5|$|Because {{the filming}} {{was done by}} the actors using {{hand-held}} cameras, much of the footage is shaky, especially the final sequence in which a character is running down a set of <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> the camera. Some audience members experienced motion sickness and even vomited as a result.|$|E
5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> rubber cover. Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E

25|$|The plan of Cave 1 shows one of {{the largest}} viharas, but is fairly typical of the later group. Many others, such as Cave 16, lack the {{vestibule}} to the shrine, which leads straight off the main hall. Cave 6 is two viharas, one above the other, connected by internal <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> sanctuaries on both levels.|$|E
25|$|In another {{scene where}} the {{characters}} played by Amelia Bence, Petrone and Magaña argue, {{the latter was}} supposed to fall down the stairs but doubted his ability to do so. Demare stood {{at the top of}} the <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> his back to it and rolled down, to demonstrate that the scene could be done without undue risk. This was in fact the sequence shown in the movie.|$|E
25|$|In the foyer, to {{the right}} of the door leading to the library, was a set of plain marble <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> an {{intermediate}} landing and single turn which lead to the third floor. Behind the steps was a conservatory with a bay window facing northwest. From the intermediate landing, a door in the northeast wall gave out onto an orchestra balcony overlooking the ballroom. The base of the balcony is decorated with corbels, plaster drapery, and guttae.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} is plastered and painted blue, encircled granite base and sections defined by pilasters where iron structures that support that roof are affixed, lined with wooden lathes painted in blue. The main doorways {{are in the}} east, north and west preceded by three ample <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> iron guardrail and ceramic flooring. In {{the centre of the}} building is the primitive buvette thermal spring recessed into an octagonal plan with similar pavement, and protected by iron grate, painted green (with faceted basins on angles). The fountain is protected by a cylindrical bell-shaped structure. Around the building is a raised wing, accessed by an intermediary landing of <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> black and white ceramic floors and iron guard painted green, decorated by stylized voluptuous motifs. These structures also integrate lamps on their angles into the high columns, with globe of lighting surrounded by several stylized arms (the globe lighting repeated from the ceiling). A gutter runs along the lowest part of the interior with drains in the corners. A centralized apparatus opens the six central rotary panels; by using a vertical iron rod, moved by a lever, allows the windows to be opened simultaneously. The rooftop is a grid of horizontal rods with bearings that run north to south supporting the weight of the structure.|$|E
25|$|In 1884 she {{purchased}} {{an unfinished}} farmhouse in the Santa Clara Valley and began building her mansion. Carpenters were hired {{and worked on}} the house day and night until it became a seven story mansion. She did not use an architect and added on to the building in a haphazard fashion, so the home contains numerous oddities such as doors and stairs that go nowhere, windows overlooking other rooms and <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> odd-sized risers. Many accounts attribute these oddities to her belief in ghosts.|$|E
25|$|The Wildhearts {{formed in}} late 1989, after Ginger was sacked from the Quireboys. An often-told story {{from this time}} period is that Ginger decided {{to start his own}} band after falling down a flight of <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> a bottle of Jack Daniel's but {{emerging}} with the bottle intact. Had the bottle smashed, he would have slit his wrists with the shards, but instead he resolved to form a band in which he could exercise his songwriting skills, rather than just playing guitar as in his previous bands. Throughout the band's career, Ginger has written almost all the songs himself.|$|E

It features face brickwork with decorative rendered panels along the parapet and in a broad band across {{the middle of the}} facade. At street level, offices open directly off the street. There is a later cantilevered awning with mock gabled roofs over the western end of this level. The eastern end is obscured by a set of concrete fire escape <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> offices beneath. Cantilevered off the rear wall parapet are two small landings with later gabled roofs, which formerly serviced two rear staircases between the upper and lower seating tiers.|$|E

500|$|Doctors {{working at}} the USC Medical Center were {{recruited}} to play the ones who try to save E.T. after government agents take over Elliott's house. Spielberg felt that actors in the roles, performing lines of technical medical dialogue, would come across as unnatural. During post-production, he decided to cut a scene featuring Harrison Ford as the principal at Elliott's school. It featured his character reprimanding Elliott for his behavior in biology class and warning {{of the dangers of}} underage drinking.

500|$|The 1971 {{nomination}} form {{noted that}} the then-current state of the building {{was in a state}} of neglect. After passing through the vestibule, the front area served as the postal sorting rooms, office and mail boxes. In this area, the original iron columns are visible between the wood panels of the clerks' windows. The tile floors were noted to be an alteration, but the second floor stair landing likely had its original tiling remain.

500|$|Many 20th-century {{historians have}} {{stressed}} the potential military strength of Castle Rising; R. Allen Brown, for example, concluded that [...] "defence... was the overwhelming consideration in [...] design and construction", {{and argued that}} the keep would {{have been used as}} a final refuge in the case of attack during a siege. Beric Morley and David Gurney believe that the military strength of the castle could not have failed to impress contemporaries. Sidney Toy suggested that the forebuilding would have made an effective defensive feature, enabling the defenders to attack intruders {{as they made their way}} up the <b>stairs,</b> <b>with</b> Morley and Gurney describing it as [...] "a deadly and near impregnable approach to the castle's interior".|$|E

500|$|The {{movie star}} {{served as an}} {{illustration}} of hero worship in American culture, and the painted masks he dons represent his performances. Actors and spectators alike are portrayed as unintelligent automatons, their mouths yapping senselessly as they respond to Hollywood films and to hand signals from film directors. One scene repeatedly loops the same shot of a man climbing a flight of <b>stairs</b> <b>with</b> the word [...] "SUCCESS" [...] atop it, representing the actors' vain attempts to find fulfillment and advancement in his career. Film historians William Moritz and David E. James have compared this to a similar scene involving a washerwoman in the Dadaist [...] post-Cubist film Ballet Mécanique (1924). Other segments in the A Hollywood Extra are also frequently repeated, like views of the city lights, and shots of [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "No Casting" [...] signs. This further exemplifies the protagonist's constant struggle to succeed in Hollywood.|$|E
