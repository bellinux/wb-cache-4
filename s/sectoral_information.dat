40|$|Inflation is a {{far from}} {{homogeneous}} phenomenon, a fact often neglected in modeling consumer price inflation. Using a novel methodology grounded in theory, the ten sub-components of {{the consumer price index}} (excluding mortgage interest rates), are modeled separately and forecast, four-quartersahead. Equilibrium correction models in a rich multivariate form employ general and <b>sectoral</b> <b>information,</b> and take account of structural breaks and institutional changes. Our methods allow for longer lags than conventionally considered in VARs, but in a parsimonious manner. Sign priors are imposed on long-run effects and automatic model selection is used to select parsimonious models from more general ones. The models throw light on sectoral sources of inflation, useful to monetary policy. Data for 1979 to 2003 are used for model selection, and pseudo out of sample forecasting performance to the end of 2007 is examined. Aggregating the weighted sub-component forecasts indicates gains are made over forecasting the overall index using these methods, and also substantial gains over forecasting using benchmark naïve models. To extend this work, including <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> such as an explicit treatment of tax policy, regulatory information and announced administered price rises, should further enhance these forecasting methods. ...|$|E

We discuss the implications of such incentive regulation for international specialization and the conditions for trade openness to be still welfare-improving. More specifically, we append to an otherwise standard 2 × 2 Heckscher-Ohlin model of a small open economy a continuum of intermediate sectors producing non-tradable goods used in tradable sectors. Those goods are produced by local firms which are privately informed on their technologies but are regulated by a domestic regulator. Even when domestic regulation is optimally designed at the <b>sectoral</b> level, asymmetric <b>information</b> generates distortions which cannot be corrected. The small country becomes relatively richer in the factor which is informationally sensitive so that asymmetric information might reverse patterns of trade. Free trade is Pareto-dominated by autarky when it exacerbates the distortions due to asymmetric information. As an aside, our methodology provides a constrained First Welfare Theorem under asymmetric information of general interest beyond our trade model...|$|R

It proposes a framework for characterising the decentralised governance of innovation projects in sectors, identifying: 1) the boundaries between firms and technological partners; 2) the specialisation of actors in types of activities; 3) the speed of change in the collaborations between firms and technological institutes. The empirical analysis is based on the data of more than 10, 000 innovation projects conducted between 1997 and 2003. The results show a strong re-organisation of the innovation networks in the sector during the period, attributed mainly to a shift from investments in middleware to software-related innovation activities, the re-specialisation of the subsidiaries of multinational companies, and the emergence of private research institutes as central nodes inside the sectoral innovation system. innovation projects; knowledge networks; <b>sectoral</b> innovation systems; <b>information</b> technology; communication technology; ICT industry; innovation policy; Brazil; innovation organisation; tax incentives; decentralised governance; collaboration; specialisation; private research institutes. ...|$|R

This widely examined empirical conundrum, often referred to as “Kaldor paradox, ” naturally raises the question whether commonly used measures of ULC growth (such as total economy ULC) are a meaningful measure of mounting imbalances and persistent losses of trade competitiveness. Therefore, we propose a new ULC growth index that exploits disaggregated <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> and focuses on export-relevant sectors only.

A number of trade barriers such as import tariffs and domestic support have limited the scope for trade in biofuels. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the implications of U.

We utilize the GTAP-BIO model, which was developed as a customized version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model capable of analyzing domestic and trade policy issues associated with biofuels (Birur, 2010). We supplement this model with updated and detailed <b>sectoral</b> level <b>information</b> on feedstock crops, different types of first and second generation biofuels and their byproducts. This highly refined data base facilitates the model for simulating changes in cropping patterns at individual crop level, land use changes, commodity prices, etc. We analyze the following policy scenarios in this study: (a) implementation of volume requirements consistent with the U. S RFS 2 volumes for the year 2022 relative to a starting point of the base year 2004, (b) reduction in the ethanol specific import tariff from 54 ¢/gallon to 45 ¢/gallon, so that there will be “parity” between the U.

Starting from January 2003, the survey has been deeply revised and enlarged according to the Commission recommendations so as to cover the whole Market Service sector (Nace Rev. 1. 1 Sections H, I, J, K, part of O, with different degrees of detail). The survey is now based a sample of over 2, 100 firms, stratified both by sector of activity (like already done since 1998) and geographic partitions; the units’ allocation to strata is optimal in the Neyman sense, with some integrations to deal with the pre-exiting panel and in order to include the most important Italian firms belonging to the target sectors. The aim of this paper is discussing the quality of the survey in terms of transparency and reliability. The methodological upgrading of the sampling design is hereafter discussed as well as each step of the new procedure. To begin with, the analysis of the Italian service sector is presented, which enables to set the necessary assumption in determining the survey frame, the selection of sampling units and the weighting system. The theoretical sampling design is thus explained with reference to sampling unit, stratification variables, units’ allocation to strata, as well as the various step of the whole procedure in terms of statistical treatment of non responses, weighting, aggregation steps sampling and non-sampling errors. Furthermore, using the first year of information collected, the remarkable gain in precision of the new sample is analysed, together with its reliability in terms of accuracy of estimates. The analyses of the design effect shows that, also when dealing with qualitative series, the Neyman allocation to strata considerably improves the precision of estimates in comparison both to the stratified proportional design and to the simple random one.

40|$|When similar {{patterns}} of expansion and contraction are observed across sectors, {{we call this}} a business cycle. Yet explaining the similarity and synchronization of these cycles across industries remains a puzzle. Whereas output growth across industries is highly correlated, identifiable shocks, like shocks to productivity, are far less correlated. While previous work has examined complementarities in production, we propose that sectors make similar input decisions because of complementarities in information acquisition. Because information about driving forces has a high fixed cost of production and a low marginal cost of replication, it can be more efficient for firms to share the cost of discovering common shocks than to invest in uncovering detailed <b>sectoral</b> <b>information.</b> Firms basing their decisions on this common information make highly correlated production choices.

A decline in the manufacturing sector growth rate will negatively affect the growth rate of the services sector, in both the short-run and long-run meanings. Second, we show that manufacturing development not only promotes the incentives of savings, but also accelerates the pace of technological accumulation. Third, an increased share of the manufacturing sector in middle-income economies can enhance the utilization of human capital and economic institutions. Our empirical findings indicate that the manufacturing sector is still the key engine of economic growth for middle-income economies...|$|E

40|$|The central {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the {{dimensions}} of labour market adjustment in Jamaica. The paper adopts a microeconometric approach, relying on new and more detailed Jamaica Labour Force Survey data for the period 1983 - 2006. Over this period, Jamaica has experienced significant expansion in its external trade which has been characterized by a severe import bias. Also, during this time, Jamaica's agricultural and manufacturing sectors experienced declines in their respective employment shares of 44 % and 36 % while service sectors expanded. One chapter of the thesis explores the empirical link between expanding trade flows and manufacturing labour market adjustment. The thesis also explores whether {{and to what extent}} sectoral labour market adjustment in Jamaica has been accommodated by an accompanying occupational transformation. Central to analyzing the issue of occupational adjustment however, is the careful definition of what constitutes a skill in order to elucidate the role of skill specificity in labour market adjustment. The thesis then investigates the incidence of unemployment in Jamaica in an attempt to identify key factors leading to escape from unemployment within a low skilled, high-unemployment, developing country context. The study finds an important role for worker characteristics, trade and industry information in affecting labour market adjustment in Jamaica. Using occupational skill definitions due to Dolton and Kidd (1998), the study also finds that most of the occupational and sectoral mobility in Jamaica, over the review period, took place among unskilled manual workers. As such, the Jamaican employed labour force experienced very little skill upgrading over the 24 year period covered. The very limited up-skilling observed over the review period was due to the emergence of relatively more highly skilled, sales and distribution related occupations. As far as adjustment costs are concerned, across all mobility types, simple sectoral moves were- in general, relatively less costly; with occupational transformation playing an accommodative role to the <b>sectoral</b> adjustment. Industry <b>information,</b> educational qualifications, geographic location, gender and the degree of skill specificity and were all critical determinants of the type of adjustment observed in the Jamaican labour market. Finally, the thesis underlines the very high incidence of long-term unemployment among uneducated, unskilled, young males in Jamaica. The study reveals negative duration dependence in the Jamaican labour market and suggests a critical role to be played by worker training in affecting unemployment escape probabilities...|$|R
40|$|Mandatory {{data breach}} {{notification}} laws are a novel and potentially important legal instrument regarding organisational protection of personal information. These laws require organisations that {{have suffered a}} data breach involving personal information to notify those persons that may be affected, and potentially government authorities, about the breach. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) has proposed {{the creation of a}} mandatory data breach notification scheme, implemented via amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). However, the conceptual differences between data breach notification law and information privacy law are such that it is questionable whether a data breach notification scheme can be solely implemented via an information privacy law. Accordingly, this thesis by publications investigated, through six journal articles, the extent to which data breach notification law was conceptually and operationally compatible with information privacy law. The assessment of compatibility began with the identification of key issues related to data breach notification law. The first article, Stakeholder Perspectives Regarding the Mandatory Notification of Australian Data Breaches started this stage of the research which concluded in the second article, The Mandatory Notification of Data Breaches: Issues Arising for Australian and EU Legal Developments (‘Mandatory Notification‘). A key issue that emerged was whether data breach notification was itself an information privacy issue. This notion guided the remaining research and focused attention towards the next stage of research, an examination of the conceptual and operational foundations of both laws. The second article, Mandatory Notification and the third article, Encryption Safe Harbours and Data Breach Notification Laws did so from the perspective of data breach notification law. The fourth article, The Conceptual Basis of Personal Information in Australian Privacy Law and the fifth article, Privacy Invasive Geo-Mashups: Privacy 2. 0 and the Limits of First Generation Information Privacy Laws did so for information privacy law. The final article, Contextualizing the Tensions and Weaknesses of Information Privacy and Data Breach Notification Laws synthesised previous research findings within the framework of contextualisation, principally developed by Nissenbaum. The examination of conceptual and operational foundations revealed tensions between both laws and shared weaknesses within both laws. First, the distinction between <b>sectoral</b> and comprehensive <b>information</b> privacy legal regimes was important as it shaped the development of US data breach notification laws and their subsequent implementable scope in other jurisdictions. Second, the sectoral versus comprehensive distinction produced different emphases in relation to data breach notification thus leading to different forms of remedy. The prime example is the distinction between market-based initiatives found in US data breach notification laws compared to rights-based protections found in the EU and Australia. Third, both laws are predicated on the regulation of personal information exchange processes even though both laws regulate this process from different perspectives, namely, a context independent or context dependent approach. Fourth, both laws have limited notions of harm that is further constrained by restrictive accountability frameworks. The findings of the research suggest that data breach notification is more compatible with information privacy law in some respects than others. Apparent compatibilities clearly exist as both laws have an interest in the protection of personal information. However, this thesis revealed that ostensible similarities are founded on some significant differences. Data breach notification law is either a comprehensive facet to a sectoral approach or a sectoral adjunct to a comprehensive regime. However, whilst there are fundamental differences between both laws they are not so great to make them incompatible with each other. The similarities between both laws are sufficient to forge compatibilities but {{it is likely that the}} distinctions between them will produce anomalies particularly if both laws are applied from a perspective that negates contextualisation...|$|R

The results show that the marginal cost functions in the sectoral model are in general a bit steeper than in the FADN estimations, when elasticities by the value one are applied. Major differences between organic and non-organic milk production could not be observed. Adjusting the slope of the marginal cost functions to the empirically estimated ones leads to slightly different forecast results.

40|$|Many {{nations have}} {{undergone}} significant trade liberalization {{in the last}} twenty years even as they have increased their use of contingent protection measures. This {{raises the question of whether}} some of the trade liberalization efforts, at times accomplished through painful reforms, are undone through a substitution from tariffs to non-tariff barriers. Among the new forms of protection, antidumping is the most relevant, as its use has spread from few developed countries to a large set of developing countries, which are now among the most intense users of this instrument. Thus, it is an open question whether industries seek to use antidumping measures to rebuild the protection lost during trade liberalization efforts. This paper uses a newly developed database to examine to what extent the use of antidumping in a large set of countries is determined by the reduction of applied sectoral tariffs. The data set includes information on 29 developing and 7 developed countries from 1991 through 2002. After controlling for time-varying <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> as well as macroeconomic conditions, we find evidence of a substitution effect but only for heavy users of antidumping among developing countries...|$|E

An adequate and effective provision of climate information – from historical observations through to seasonal forecasts, and multi-decadal climate change projections – is critical to inform planning and decision-making in climate-sensitive sectors. Central to this are the end-users of climate information and a growing emphasis on tailored climate information and services shaped by user needs. However, knowledge {{about the use of}} climate information across European economic sectors is limited. This paper identifies the spectrum of <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> requirements across a number of sectors including agriculture, forestry, energy, water, tourism, insurance, health, emergency services and transport sectors, drawing from an online survey (n = 462) and interviews with (potential) users of climate information (n = 80). This analysis reveals shared opportunities across sectors including the potential application of decadal climate predictions. In addition, common barriers and enablers to the uptake of climate information were also noted including the format of the information provided, the need for compatibility with existing in-house systems, and the perceived credibility and trust of information providers. This analysis also points towards a perceived increasing fragmentation of available information and the desire amongst end-users for a European body able to centralise and coordinate climate data. We highlight some of the current factors that still need to be adequately addressed in order to enhance the uptake and application of climate information in decision-making across European economic sectors...|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} a large-scale flooding {{in the province}} of South-Holland in the economic centre of the Netherlands. In traditional research, damage due to flooding is computed with a unit loss method coupling land use information to depth-damage functions. Normally only direct costs are incorporated as an estimate of damage to infrastructure, property and business disruption. We extend this damage concept with the indirect economic effects {{on the rest of the}} regional and national economy on basis of a bi-regional input output table. We broaden this damage estimation to the concept of vulnerability. Vulnerability is defined as a function of dependence, redundancy and susceptibility. Susceptibility is the probability and extent of flooding. Dependency is the degree to which an activity relates to other economic activities in the rest of the country. Input–output multipliers form representations of this dependency. Redundancy is the ability of an economic activity to respond to a disaster by deferring, using substitutes or relocating. We measure redundancy as the degree of centrality of an economic activity in a network. The more central an activity is, the less it encounters possibilities to transfer production and the more vulnerable it is for flooding. Vulnerability of economic activities is then visualized in a GIS. Kernel density estimation is applied to generalize point information on inundated firms to <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> in space.

The government must be prepared to prevent and counteract the bleeding-edge techniques of warfare that is to work out measures, to oppose enemy’s information weapons, to gain information superiority, to develop a society thatis immune to disinformation, to elaborate a concept of information warfare counteraction. The authors have examined both foreign and Russian sources of law which define the requirements for the government activities to oppose information warfare. They also refer to the opinions of foreign and Russian researchers, politicians and public figures who have commented on the concept and features of such political and legal constructs as information warfare and information weapons. The problem of information warfare must be identified as a profoundly serious and damaging threat. This paper provides the features of information warfare and the methods to resist it as well as the proposals to amend the domestic legislation to create conditions for an accurate understanding of this political and legal phenomenon. In addition, it points out that the amendment of the Information Security Doctrine is not sufficient to counterbalance the threat of information warfare. In a certain document it is necessary to recount all notions, requirements and methods for the government actions aimed to gradually change the situation, particularly, the development of <b>sectoral</b> (<b>information</b> security) legislation, specialists training to {{be able to deal with}} informational and psychological aggression forming public opinion through the government-run mass media, etc. </p...|$|E
40|$|Did the World Bank's policy-based {{lending to}} Kenya in the 1980 s allow Kenya to {{undertake}} adjustment, or to postpone it? The answer is mixed, says the author. Success was greatest in trade liberalization (and exchange rate depreciation), {{and to a}} lesser extent in export development [...] and these reforms would probably not have occurred without steady Bank lending. But one could argue that budget support through funds from the International Development Association may have helped Kenya postpone critical public sector reform [...] in the civil service and social sectors and in divestiture of parastatals (including the National Cereals and Produce Board). Was aid to Kenya (including the Bank's) overgenerous? The author concludes that, based on reform behavior and performance, Kenya may deserve less aid than Ghana (Africa's best performer) but it does not exhibit the same aid dependency as other donor favorites in the region. But its public investment program did a poor job in ranking priorities, and growing reliance on grants and counterpart funds undoubtedly contributed to more consumption spending by government, particularly on the civil service and parastatals. Implementation of structural adjustments in Kenya was often lethargic and sometimes even contrary to stated policies, says the author. And despite a fairly stable political climate, commitment to the adjustment program was patchy and intermittent. Reforms ostensibly undertaken were in fact not always implemented. In principle, for example, an auction market for government paper was created, but in practice financial institutions typically undertook up most of that paper"by arrangement. "And restrictions on movement of maize were removed but reimposed. Moreover, the design of the structural adjustment loans appears, in retrospect, to have been faulty. Too many conditions [...] too general, and based on dated <b>sectoral</b> <b>information</b> [...] were attached to each loan, in part because of political considerations. And the Bank released credit tranches when conditions were met in letter but not in spirit. The adjustment program benefited in the second half of the 1980 s from lessons learned in the first half of the decade, particularly concerning trade liberalization and export development. But the design and dimensions of reform in the agricultural sector were too limited to achieve significant restructuring of the sector, and political interests effectively sabotaged the program. The second attempt at adjustment was also undermined by increasing financial laxity. The experience in Kenya underlines the difficulty of implementing structural adjustment under either financial laxity or extreme financial stringency. Note, too, that many things have changed in Kenya since this study was completed in the early 1990 s.

40|$|Services {{industry}} {{has emerged as}} an important sector underpinning the economy, especially those in developed countries, and spanned to lower tier countries through inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and globalisation. Producer services, as a significant service component, experienced the growth in terms of activity and establishments in the metropolitan areas and then shaped (or reshaped) their most central district (area). Ho Chi Minh City, as the largest city of Vietnam, {{plays an important role}} as a gateway city in attracting FDI which is believed a hitch for the current fast economic growth after the country promulgated the open policy in 1986. Within this context, producer services have emerged in this city. It was found that their growth closely relates to the flows of FDI. That outcome suggests that there are important differences between Non- Vietnamese and Vietnamese firms in the development of this sector and in the spatial patterns. The aim of this research is to explore the role of producer services and identify how their growth, through the numbers and types, influences Ho Chi Minh City in the spatial aspects; particularly the research focuses on the location of producer service firms in the city's central area. The outcome of the research will provide insight on the link between the producer service {{and the development of a}} large city of an emerging economy. In a local planning perspective, the thesis, as one of the first specific studies on the producer services in Vietnam, has it own enthusiasm to contribute its understanding and findings to the current urban planning to cope with the rapidly changing economy in a global era. In search of the role of producer services in the national economy and their spatial influences, the research has used the Yellow Pages Data as the major approach for its analyses due to the current lack of data on service employment and limited <b>sectoral</b> <b>information.</b> Questionnaire and interviews survey have also been carried out to enrich and justify the information. Given an important factor that the emergence of producer services in Vietnam relied on FDI, the analyses of the research basically based on the nationality framework in order to uncover the significance of the two groups of firms: Non Vietnamese and Vietnamese. The research has also embedded the city planning policy as its implication in order to provide insightful information for the future location and growth of producer services.

40|$|International audienceMeteorological reanalysis {{datasets}} {{are being}} {{widely used in}} a number of studies relating to the climate impact on energy. Reanalyses have the specific advantage of being complete through the process of physical/dynamic representation of the climate system which provides internally consistent fields across most surface atmospheric variables {{as well as in the}} atmospheric column up to the stratosphere. The present communication deals with the use of the ERA-Interim reanalysis for the production of datasets of climate variables relevant to energy. The work took place within the European Climatic Energy Mixes (ECEM) project in the framework of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C 3 S) <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Information</b> Service (SIS). ECEM is primarily focused on users in the energy sector who are interested in sub-daily and daily variability for the following variables at the near surface: air temperature, dewpoint temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity. There are differences between estimates from the reanalysis and station observations. Bias adjustment is a process to adjust the reanalysis onto observational distributions. The aim of this communication is to present the construction of novel bias-adjusted datasets of the climate variables listed above. ERA-Interim was compared against observations. The bias was computed as the mean of the differences (model minus observations). As the users in energy sector are much more interested in the extremes of the distribution, our approach is based on the adjustment of the whole ERA-Interim distribution, using a different statistical distribution for each variable. In other words, we have modified the parameters of different distributions (depending on the variable), altering those calculated from ERA-Interim to those based on gridded station or direct station observations. For wind speed, the two-parameter Weibull distribution computed from ERA-Interim was adjusted to that computed for each station contained in the HadISD dataset. The scale and shape parameters computed at stations were bi-linearly interpolated to each ERA-Interim grid box. A similar approach but with adjustment of means and standard deviations was used for the dewpoint contained in the HadISD dataset and for air temperature but with the E-OBS datasets. The relative humidity is computed from these two variables. For precipitation daily totals, E-OBS and gamma distribution were used. For surface solar irradiance, the statistical distribution of ERA-Interim is adjusted to that of the satellite-derived HelioClim- 3 v 5 dataset. This is done on a so-called clearness index, which is the ratio of the irradiation at ground level to that at the top of atmosphere. Once the clearness index adjusted, the adjusted irradiation is computed. The comparison between initial and bias-adjusted data against station observations and gridded observation products has demonstrated the benefit of performing bias-adjustment and has provided an assessment of the quality of the novel datasets.
