A cyclic voltammetry (peak current) procedure has been developed and successfully applied to the measurement of electroactive surface areas of the porous Cu. For porous Cu samples with pore sizes 75 - 1500 µm and porosities 0. 5 - 0. 8, the volumetric and gravimetric specific geometric, electroactive and real surface areas are in the ranges of 15 - 90 cm- 1 and 5 - 45 cm 2 /g, 200 - 400 cm- 1 and 40 - 130 cm 2 /g, and 1000 - 2500 cm- 1 and 400 - 800 cm 2 /g, respectively, varying with pore size and porosity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cretaceous rudists, with thick, multilayered, bimineralic (aragonite and low-Mg calcite) shells, {{have been}} studied {{for the effects of}} {{meteoric}} diagenesis on their textural and chemical attributes. The original fine, compact, prismatic or cellular-prismatic microstructures oflow-Mg calcitic layers have been preserved frequently, despite the vagaries of their subsequent diagenetic histories. These layers usually suffered only partial recrystaUization, which caused fusion of crystal units, rounding of prism comers, and partial cementation confined to intercryslalline and intraparticle pore spaces. In contrast, he originally aragonitic parts of the shell usually suffered either complete dissolution or, at best, retained some vestiges of their crossed-lamellar or complex crossed-lamellar, microstructures. Synsedimentary submarine diagenetic events, such as borings by endolithic fauna, internal micritic and/or peloidal sedimentation, and submarine aragonite and/or high-Mg calcite cements within the primary inter- and inlrapanicle pore spaces, were coeval with rudist accretion. The subsequent meteoric ementation has been characterized bythe formation of bladed and equam ferroan calcites which occluded the residual primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>porosities.</b> Diagenetic stabilization of aragnnite to diagnetic low-Mg calcite and low-Mg calcite to diagenetic low-Mg calcite {{is believed to have been}} a two-stage process. Initially, Sr and Na have been partially depleted during an early meteoric diagenetic phase (calcitization of metastable phases), with expulsion of Sr at a slower ate than that of Na. This stage is followed by incorporation of more Mn, Fe, and Mg due to precipitation oflate ferroan calcite.

The study area is composed entirely of granitic rocks. A total of Nine RVES were made along three profiles of three sounding stations each within an area of 2 km 2. Geophysical sounding data obtained were used to produce Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) curves, electrical pseudosections, geoelectrical sections and anisotropy polygons of the area.

This paper discusses the nature of diagenetic alteration of the Citarate carbonate rocks based on petrographic analyses of twenty surface samples. Carbonate rocks from bottom to top comprise algae packstone, packstone-grainstone, coral-algae packstone, and foraminifer wackestone-packstone. Fragments of coral, coralline red algae, and large foraminifera are the dominant bioclasts in most of the observed samples, whereas echinoids and bivalves are less abundant; they are set in a recrystallized micrite matrix. Planktonic foraminifera are abundant only in few samples.

The FA Formation conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone consists lithofacies of mixed fluvial and fluvio-deltaic transitional origin, while the overlying FB 1 Formation includes alternating organic rich black shale and sandstone of marine deposit. The medium- to coarse grained fluvio-deltaic quartz arenite in upper part of FA Formation is characterized by pervasive authigenic quartz cementation that reduced the porosity and permeability in the early stage of burial history. This provides a resistant framework for subsequent diagenetic modification and also inhibits fluid flow during burial diagenesis. In contrast, the clay and unstable detrital grains rich fluvial arkosic to sub-arkosic sandstones that escaped early quartz cementation show considerable pressure solution at grain contacts. These arkosics were less porous and permeable when deposited but transformed to diagenetic aquifers {{as a result of}} dissolution of detrital grains during diagenesis and subsequent precipitation of authigenic mineral cements in the resulting <b>secondary</b> <b>porosities.</b> From the proximal to distal basin and within sample suites, there is no considerable chemical variation in the petrographic distinct generations of the precipitated illite and chlorite suggesting their precipitation from a near equilibrium homogenous pore-fluid. The predominance of 1 M(t) illite polytype in most lithologies reflects precipitation of the clay minerals and probably other cements in an environment with high fluid/rock ratio. Dolomite, anhydrite, barite, and Fe-oxides are the main crystallized authigenic minerals aside illite and Fe-rich chlorite clay minerals.

This investigation indicated that the stratigraphic succession in the outcrop consists of a basal claystone unit, overlain by marly limestone unit, overlain inturn by reefal limestone unit. In the subsurface, a thick evaporate succession underlies the area. None of the boreholes in the islands have penetrated the basement. The evaporate succession comprises about eight prominent salt domes in the islands.

These oxidizing fluids mixed with deep orogenic metalliferous fluids, set in motion by the Taconic orogeny, and were partially reduced to aqueous ulfide. At this stage, barite, galena...|$|R
40|$|Well logs, cores, and {{petrographic}} {{analyses of}} selected wells in the Levelland and Slaughter fields {{have revealed that}} the lower San Andres Formation consists of up to five vertically repeating depositional cycles. Each depositional cycle primarily consists of a shoaling upward sequence of subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal facies. Subtidal sediments contain dolomudstones, packstones, wackestones, and grainstones with bioturbation and stylolitization. Fossil allochems include bivalves, crinoids, foraminifers, brachiopods, and lesser quantities of corals and bryozoans; nonskeletal grains include pellets, oolites, and lesser oncolites. Intertidal sediments are primarily composed of packstones, wackestones, and grainstones with laminites, burrows, and lesser quantities of algal stromatolites. Skeletal grains include bivalves, crinoids, and lesser foraminifers; nonskeletal grains include pellets and intraclasts. Supratidal sediments are typically anhydrite interlaminated with dolomite. Algal stromatolites, fenestrae (bird 2 ̆ 7 s eye) structures, tepee structures, desiccation cracks, pisolites, and collapse breccia occur in this facies. ^ Petrographic analyses of the lower San Andres reveal the following facies: crinoidal, mudstone, spiculitic, crinoidal-bioclastic, fusulinid-bioclastic, bioclastic, pelletal, oolitic, peloidal-intraclastic, pisolitic, algal-laminated, and anhydrite. ^ Petrographic and geochemical analyses have revealed that the most common diagenetic processes within the lower San Andres are as follows: (1) micritization, (2) cementation, (3) dolomitization, (4) compaction, (5) dissolution, (6) anhydritization, (7) silicification, (8) fracturing, (9) stylolitization, and (10) pyritization. ^ Porosity and permeability are variable in the study area. The commonest porosity types are the moldic, vuggy, interparticle, intraparticle, intercrystalline, and minor cavernous. Anhydritization resulted in lowering primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>porosities</b> in the study area. ^ Sedimentary structures indicating possible subaerial exposure surfaces are common in the study area. These include tepee structures, desiccation cracks, fenestral fabric, and breccia. ^ Stable oxygen and carbon stable isotopes were tested {{for the first time}} in the study area as possible indicators for subaerial exposure surfaces. A test suite of selected samples from cycles 4 and 5 of the Mobil 360 (Levelland Unit) were analyzed for oxygen and carbon stable isotope content. Shifts in the abundance of oxygen isotopes were recognized along subaerial exposure surfaces. Comparison of the core description with stable isotopic analysis reveals that the latter may be a valuable technique in recognizing subaerial exposure surfaces in the dolomites of the lower San Andres Formation, although, further work and tighter sampling are required in order to establish the validity of this approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Prehistoric and {{traditional}} ceramics contain {{a wide range}} of tempers (non-plastic inclusions), including sand, sherd (grog), sponge spicules, phytoliths (siliceous bark ash), diatomite, organic fibers, shell, calcite, mica and asbestos. The use of these materials in traditional and archaeological ceramics and their association with cooking pottery and thermal shock resistance are examined. The thermal shock parameters that are relevant to low-fired ceramics are identified and tested. The primary factor in the thermal shock resistance is identified as fracture toughness. By increasing the amount and size range of temper additions, and by selecting tempers that are platy and fibrous, fracture toughness can be enhanced. <b>Secondary</b> factors include <b>porosity,</b> thermal expansion and relative strength. These parameters are tested employing fracture energy and thermal expansion measurements, and quench tests...|$|R
