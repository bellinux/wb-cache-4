The resulting picture is therefore smooth, however, {{there is a small}} shift in the pitch of the audio.

40|$|Combining the {{characteristics}} of motor with fast response speed, an electric-drive automated mechanical transmission (EMT) is proposed as a novel type of transmission in this paper.

In addition, the control algorithm is developed to improve the shifting quality of the PHEV equipped with the EMT in all its evaluation indexes. The key techniques of changing the driving force gradient in preshifting and shifting compensation phases {{as well as of}} predicting the meshing speed in the gear meshing phase are also proposed.

40|$|Large civil tiltrotors {{have been}} {{identified}} to replace regional airliners over medium ranges to alleviate next-generation air traffic. Variable rotor speed for these vehicles is required for efficient high-speed operation. Two-speed drive system research has been performed to support these advanced rotorcraft applications. Experimental tests were performed on two promising two-speed transmission configurations. The offset compound gear (OCG) transmission and the dual star/idler (DSI) planetary transmission were tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center variable-speed transmission test facility. Both configurations were inline devices with concentric {{input and output shafts}} and designed to provide 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 output speed reduction ratios. Both were designed for 200 hp and 15, 000 rpm input speed and had a dry shift clutch configuration. Shift tests were performed on the transmissions at input speeds of 5, 000, 8, 000, 10, 000, 12, 500, and 15, 000 rpm. Both the OCG and DSI configurations successfully perform <b>speed</b> <b>shifts</b> at full rated 15, 000 rpm input <b>speed.</b> The transient <b>shifting</b> behavior of the OCG and DSI configurations were very similar. The shift clutch had more of an effect on shifting dynamics than the reduction gearing configuration itself since the same shift clutch was used in both configurations. For both OCG and DSI configurations, low-to-high <b>speed</b> <b>shifts</b> were limited in applied torque levels in order to prevent overloads on the transmission due to transient torque spikes. It is believed that the relative lack of appreciable slippage of the dry shifting clutch at operating conditions and pressure profiles tested was a major cause of the transient torque spikes. For the low-to-high <b>speed</b> <b>shifts,</b> the output <b>speed</b> ramp-up time slightly decreased and the peak out torque slightly increased as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased. This was caused by slightly less clutch slippage as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} for specific age-related deficits in tasks of verbal fluency. Objective: The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate training and transfer effects after 3 weeks of telephone-based verbal fluency training in old age. Methods: Participants were assigned to one of three training groups, an active control group, or a no-contact control group. Training consisted of 15 sessions of 6 min each over a period of 3 weeks. For the training tasks, different versions of the verbal fluency task were used, each targeting a specific underlying cognitive process (i. e., processing <b>speed,</b> <b>shifting,</b> or inhibition). To measure transfer effects, a neuropsychological test battery including Digit Symbol Substitution, Trail Making, Go/No-Go, Digit Span, N-Back, and a verbal learning and memory test was administered before and after training. Results: Our findings revealed training gains for initial letter fluency training and phonemic switching training, but not for excluded letter fluency training. Moreover, after initial letter fluency training and phonemic switching training, transfer to other verbal fluency tasks was found. In addition, phonemic switching training led to improvement in an untrained short-term memory task. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that a telephone-based cognitive intervention of overall 90 min significantly improved cognitive performance in healthy older adults above and beyond the improvements in the active control group. The findings provide the basis for cognitive interventions that could easily be integrated into everyday lifestyles and are still targeting specific cognitive functions...|$|E
40|$|Paint {{and surface}} {{treatment}} processes {{in a car}} paint shop are {{to a large extent}} automated and performed by robots. Having access to tools that incorporate the flexibility of robotic path planning with fast and efficient simulation of the processes is important to reduce the time required for introduction of new car models, reduce the environmental impact and increase the quality. The current version of the software for simulation of spray painting developed at the Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre relies on measured droplet size distributions that can be used as input to the simulations. This thesis discusses techniques {{that can be used to}} simulate the droplet size distributions and therefore reduce the need for costly and complicated measurements. Surface tension plays an important role during breakup as it acts to stabilize the droplets. On the small scales of droplets from 1 - 100 &# 181;m in diameter it is a strong force yet localized to the interface between the droplet and the surrounding medium. It is therefore crucial to have control over the interface and to this end a novel method for reconstructing the interface of the droplet is described. The method relies on approximation by Radial Basis Functions using a technique that enables the omission of small length scale structures in order to obtain a smooth representation that is suitable for numerical discretization. Droplet size distributions have been simulated with the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model with promising results. A modification taking into account the large viscosity of the paint is introduced and the parameters of the model are tuned to the case of rotary bell spray painting commonly used in automotive industry. Results show that the model is able to capture the overall shape of the size distributions and that it captures the effect of the bell rotation <b>speed,</b> <b>shifting</b> the distributions toward larger or smaller droplets. </p...|$|E

40|$|Vehicle powertrains with a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) have a large freedom in controlling the engine speed and the torque at the wheels. Due to rotating inertias within the engine and transmission, {{the response of the}} vehicle during large engine <b>speed</b> <b>shifts</b> may appear reluctant or even counteractive. To overcome this behaviour, the CVT is augmented with a planetary gear set and compact steel fl ywheel. The new transmission seamlessly combines two contradictive features: the driveability in terms of the pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. This can be achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds which is possible by the large ratio-coverage of the CVT. The latently impassive pedal-to-wheel response that normally would emerge is now eliminated by the gear set and the flywheel. In this paper two control strategies for the engine throttle valve and the CVT ratio <b>shift</b> <b>speed</b> are presented and analysed. The control laws are able to realize high driveability and fuel economy at the same time. Results from simulations will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thirty healthy adults {{completed}} a mediolateral weight-shifting balance task {{in which they}} were instructed to shift their weight to visually displayed target regions. A model-based filter and three different moving average filters employing 10, 34, and 58 samples were applied to the center of pressure visual feedback that guided the activity. The effects of filter selection on both the displayed feedback and the shift performance were examined in terms of shift time and non-minimum phase behavior. Shift time relates to feedback delay and <b>shift</b> <b>speed,</b> whereas non-minimum phase behavior relates to the force applied in shift initiation. Results indicated that increasing the number of samples in moving average filters (indicative of stronger filtering) significantly increases <b>shift</b> <b>speed</b> and <b>shift</b> initiation force. These effects indicate that careful selection and documentation of data filtering is warranted in future work and suggest opportunities for strategic filtering of visual feedback in clinical weight-shifting balance activities in order to improve outcomes based on such feedback...|$|R
