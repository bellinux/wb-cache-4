40|$|Objective— To compare acute {{fixation}} {{stability and}} insertion effort of cortex bone <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> {{and without a}} shaft inserted in lag fashion in equine metacarpal (metatarsal, MC(T) III) bone. Methods— <b>Screw</b> types <b>with</b> independent variables of screw diameter (4. 5 or 5. 5 mm) and shaft type (without shaft, with 20 -mm shaft, or with 25 -mm shaft) were studied. Bone specimens cut from distal equine MC(T) III condyles were used. After screw insertion in lag fashion into 2 bone blocks with an instrumented device, shear tests were conducted in a mechanical testing machine. Outcome variables of peak insertion torque, insertion energy, stiffness, yield strength, and displacement at 3 kN of load were compared. Results— The effects of screw design were substantial. <b>Screws</b> <b>with</b> shaft were 30 % to 40 % stiffer and 60 % to 70 % stronger than screws without shaft. <b>Screws</b> <b>with</b> shaft could tolerate 80 to 95 kg more force than screws without shaft before yielding. At 3 kN load, the displacement <b>with</b> <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> shaft was 55 % to 60 % of that <b>with</b> <b>screws</b> without shaft. <b>Screws</b> <b>with</b> a long shaft tended to perform better than those with a short shaft. There {{was no difference in}} the shear stiffness, shear yield strength, or shear displacement between the 2 screw diameters. Although larger diameter screws required more insertion effort, and <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> a short shaft required the most insertion energy, these differences were small. Conclusions— Cortex <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> a long shaft of 4. 5 - or 5. 5 -mm diameter provide better stability in equine MC(T) III condyle bone with less insertion effort compared with those with a short shaft or no shaft. Clinical Significance— Cortex bone <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> a shaft inserted in lag fashion should be considered for the fixation of equine MC(T) III condylar fractures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> PMMA cement {{augmentation}} {{have been}} shown to significantly improve the fixation strength in a severely osteoporotic spine. However, the efficacy of screw fixation for different cement augmentation techniques, namely solid <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> retrograde cement pre-filling versus cannulated <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> cement injection through perforation, remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the difference in pullout strength between conical and cylindrical screws based on the aforementioned cement augmentation techniques. The potential loss of fixation upon partial screw removal after screw insertion was also examined. Method The Taguchi method with an L 8 array was employed to determine the significance of design factors. Conical and cylindrical pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> solid or cannulated designs were installed using two different screw augmentation techniques: solid <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> retrograde cement pre-filling and cannulated <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> cement injection through perforation. Uniform synthetic bones (test block) simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a platform for each screw design and cement augmentation technique. Pedicle screws at full insertion and after a 360 -degree back-out from full insertion were then tested for axial pullout failure using a mechanical testing machine. Results The results revealed the following 1) Regardless of the screw outer geometry (conical or cylindrical), solid <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> retrograde cement pre-filling exhibited significantly higher pullout strength than did cannulated <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> cement injection through perforation (p = 0. 0129 for conical screws; p = 0. 005 for cylindrical screws). 2) For a given cement augmentation technique (screws without cement augmentation, cannulated <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> cement injection or solid <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> cement pre-filling), no significant difference in pullout strength was found between conical and cylindrical screws (p > 0. 05). 3) Cement infiltration into the open cell of the test block {{led to the formation of}} a cement/bone composite structure. Observations of the failed specimens indicated that failure occurred at the composite/bone interface, whereas the composite remained well bonded to the screws. This result implies that the screw/composite interfacial strength was much higher than the composite/bone interfacial strength. 4) The back-out of the screw by 360 degrees from full insertion did not decrease the pullout strength in any of the studied cases. 5) Generally, larger standard deviations were found for the screw back-out cases, implying that the results of full insertion cases are more repeatable than those of the back-out cases. Conclusions Solid <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> retrograde cement pre-filling offer improved initial fixation strength when compared to that of cannulated <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> cement injection through perforation for both the conically and cylindrically shaped screw. Our results also suggest that the fixation screws can be backed out by 360 degrees for intra-operative adjustment without the loss of fixation strength. </p...|$|R

40|$|Expansive pedicle screws {{significantly}} improve fixation {{strength in}} osteoporotic spines. However, the previous literature does not adequately address {{the effects of}} the number of lengthwise slits and the extent of screw expansion on the strength of the bone/screw inter-face when expansive <b>screws</b> are used <b>with</b> or without cement augmentation. Herein, four designs for expansive pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> different numbers of lengthwise slits and different screw expansion levels were evaluated. Synthetic bones simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a comparative platform for each screw design. The prepared speci-mens were then tested for axial pullout failure. Regardless of <b>screw</b> design, <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> cement augmentation demonstrated significantly higher pullout strength than pedicle screws without cement augmentation (p 0. 05). Taken together, our results show that pedicle <b>screws</b> combined <b>with</b> cement augmentation may greatly increase screw fixation regardless of <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> or without expansion. An increase in both the number of slits and the extent of screw expansion had little impact on the screw-anchoring strength.

Axial compression and bending loads were imposed on the models before and after cycling testing as well as load to clinical and catastrophic failure. Results: Minimum change in stiffness was observed before and after fatigue for all groups. The final stiffness to bending forces was statistically similar in all groups, but stiffness to axial compression was statistically significant different: Group A approached significance with respect to groups B and C (P = 0. 017, 0. 009), whereas stiffness in group B and C was statistically similar (P = 0. 93).

It is suggested that self-tapping <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> 10  mm diameter showed better joint performance in maximum load capacity and dissipated energy than did 8  mm screw connections. Self-tapping <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> fully threaded shanks showed better initial stiffness on the joint than did half-threaded screw connections, but also showed less ductility. Further, both fully threaded and double-threaded sections also provided the joint with higher maximum load and better dissipated energy than did connections using <b>screws</b> <b>with</b> half-threaded shank. The nailing approach of using self-tapping screws is a key to influencing the structural performance of a joint. The results indicated that toe-nailing approach is superior to the face-nailing approach in the maximum load capacity, initial stiffness, and dissipated energy of a beam–girder connection. A self-tapping <b>screw</b> connection <b>with</b> derived allowable loading capacity for Japanese cedar glulam structure could compete as a viable bolt connection for use in wood-framed construction.|$|R
