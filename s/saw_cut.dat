60|$|One {{would think}} {{that he might have}} known by the {{connection}} in which Raymond used it,--for {{he said that he had}} bent the teeth out so as to make the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> a good wide kerf, and so he might have supposed that the kerf was the cut in the wood which a saw makes in going in. The reason why boys find it so difficult to saw, is because the teeth do not generally spread very much, and so the kerf is narrow. Still, the back of the saw would run in it well enough, without sticking, if they were to saw perfectly straight. But they generally make the saw twist or wind a little, and then the back of the saw rubs upon one side or the other; and sticks. Now, Raymond's plan was to make the teeth set off, each side, so far as to make the kerf very wide, and then he thought that Caleb would be able to make it go, especially as the saw was very narrow.|$|E

50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} involves {{removing a}} thin layer at the surface of hardened PCC using closely spaced diamond saw blades. The level surface is achieved by running the blade assembly at a predetermined level across the pavement surface, which produces <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> grooves. The uncut concrete between each <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> breaks off more or less at a constant level above the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> grooves, leaving a level surface (at a macroscopic level) with longitudinal texture. The result is a pavement that is smooth, safe, quiet and pleasing to travel.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example is}} {{to modify the}} roto-milling head to create slots in {{concrete}} slabs for the dowel bar retrofit process. The typical process is to <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement, the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture, and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness. This special milling process shortens the time to create slots from the traditional method which is labor-intensive.|$|E
50|$|Jointing varies {{little from}} other {{concrete}} slabs. Joints are tooled with a rolling jointing tool prior to curing or <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> after curing. Curing consists of covering concrete with 6 mil. plastic sheeting within 20 minutes of concrete discharge. However, this {{contributes to a}} substantial amount of waste sent to landfills. Alternatively, preconditioned absorptive lightweight aggregate as well as internal curing admixture (ICA) have been used to effectively cure pervious concrete without waste generation.|$|E

50|$|A {{dowel bar}} {{retrofit}} (DBR) {{is a method}} of reinforcing cracks in highway pavement by inserting steel dowel bars in slots cut across the cracks. It is a technique several states have successfully used to address faulting in older jointed plain concrete pavements. The typical approach is to <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture (grout) and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness.|$|E
50|$|Many parts kits were {{imported}} into the U.S. {{in the early}} 2000s with the receivers demilled incorrectly (they had been <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> instead of torch cut). This prompted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives {{to send a letter}} in 2007 to distributors asking for the receiver pieces back which was then forwarded to many of the final purchasers. The letter only asked for the receiver pieces back, but as these had key parts welded onto them (such as the magazine well) it is likely some receiver pieces were returned with vital portions of the firearm still attached. Parts kits available on the secondary market have since risen in value and many of the ones that are available are incomplete.|$|E

40|$|The {{products}} and value recovered by two log-making systems — mechanised and manual — were compared in two Pinus radiata D.

Mechanised log-making was carried out with an Ergo HS 16 harvester fitted with an OPTI computerised measuring and log-making system. At each site both log-making systems were used on the same set of trees. In the manual system, logs were marked for cutting, but the <b>saw</b> <b>cuts</b> were not made. The marks were then removed and the stems converted to logs by the harvester. Forty-three trees were processed at Santa Margarita and 39 trees at Poninquil.

50|$|The 2010-2011 season <b>saw</b> <b>CUT</b> win {{two major}} regular season tournaments {{on its way}} to the second {{national}} championship in three years. In mid February the team traveled to Tampa, FL and won the Florida Warmup over a field where 8 of the 9 teams had competed at Nationals the previous year. A few weeks later in early March, CUT competed in the Stanford Invite, a high-level tourney where 13 of the 18 teams qualified for 2011 Nationals. CUT went undefeated on the weekend, winning the tournament with a +46 goal differential. Over Carleton's spring break, the team drove from Minnesota to Wilmington, North Carolina to play in Easterns which also featured a strong field, 10 of the 16 teams in attendance earning a spot at the big dance later in the year. This was CUT's first tourney loss of the season, losing in a close battle with 2010 champs Florida in the semifinals.|$|E
5000|$|Points {{per inch}} (25 mm): The most common {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point per inch than there are teeth per inch (e.g., a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 teeth per inch, and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 teeth per inch). Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of teeth per inch throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the <b>saw</b> <b>cut</b> easier.|$|E

40|$|The {{calibration}} of eddy-current measurement {{systems is}} a long-standing problem in nondestructive evaluation. Eddy-current probe calibration {{is needed for}} several reasons: to compensate for different probe sensitivities, to set detection thresholds, to validate instrument setup and operation, and to perform quantitative flaw sizing. 1, 2 The most frequently used calibration method is to scan the probe being calibrated over simulated defects such as electrical-discharge-machined (EDM) slots, <b>saw</b> <b>cuts,</b> or laboratory-produced fatigue cracks. This method has the virtue of calibrating probe and instrument {{at the same time}} and it can be performed on the same material as that to be inspected. But it has a number of disadvantages as well. First, a large number of artifact standards must be generated, certified, and maintained, resulting in considerable expense. Second, the signals from EDM slots and <b>saw</b> <b>cuts</b> are not equivalent to the signals from actual defects. 3 Third, it is questionable whether quantitative flaw sizing can be performed using such a calibration method. Even if laboratory-produced cracks were to be used for routine calibration (a prohibitively expensive option), the accuracy of calibration or quantitative sizing could be compromised by the occurrence of crack closure effects. ...|$|R
