5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak <b>soon</b> <b>came.</b> A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to be}} any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E

5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|Cape {{announced}} that he had stopped publication, but he secretly leased the rights to Pegasus Press, an English-language publisher in France. His partner Wren Howard took papier-mâché moulds of the type to Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus Press was shipping its edition to the London bookseller Leopold Hill, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> {{to the attention of the}} Home Office. On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the book to be seized.|$|E
5|$|It <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> time to {{name the}} new highway, and an {{upcoming}} visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth {{proved to be the}} focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to swing out, revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} at Alexandria, Cleomenes {{was greeted by}} Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> to respect him and promised to send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents. However, before he could fulfill his promise, Ptolemy died—and with him any hope for Cleomenes to return to Greece, as the weak Ptolemy IV ascended the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of John's see of Caithness in 11891190 was undoubtedly intended to extend Scots {{authority in the}} region. The new bishopric was not uncontroversial and John <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> into conflict with Harald Maddadson and the Bishop of Orkney, Bjarni Kolbeinsson. The conflict, presented as a dispute over the collection of monies for the papacy (a form of Peter's pence), was appealed to Pope Innocent III, who wrote to Bishop Bjarni and the Bishop of Rosemarkie (or Ross) to prevent John from interfering with the collection.|$|E
5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than {{a few of his}} earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E

5|$|Amin retaliated {{against the}} {{attempted}} invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging {{the army of}} Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and {{at least twice as}} many civilians, had disappeared. The victims <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} {{from the}} pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E
5|$|Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging—he {{would die}} in 1940—Chandler moved {{to fill the}} {{leadership}} void in the faction. He <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> {{to believe he was}} destined to become President of the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices—Logan was 63—and Kentucky's senior Senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.|$|E

5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|Poulenc's wealthy family {{intended}} him for {{a business}} career in the Rhone Poulenc family company and did not allow him to enrol at a music college. Largely self-educated musically, he studied with the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became his mentor after the composer's parents died. Poulenc <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> {{under the influence of}} Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became {{one of a group of}} young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence. During the 1930s a much more serious side to his nature emerged, particularly in the religious music he composed from 1936 onwards, which he alternated with his more light-hearted works.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some {{historians have}} conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have {{stemmed from a}} personal belief that his wife Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E

5|$|Though Fox was {{initially}} worried about an entire episode {{set in the}} other universe, they <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> to appreciate the storyline. The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor. Many {{thought it was a}} good indicator of what the rest of the season had to offer, while others appreciated the numerous popular culture references that set the two universes apart.|$|E
5|$|Abu'l-Aswar {{is first}} {{recorded}} by the history of Matthew of Edessa in 1040, when the Armenian nobleman Abirat, who had become embroiled in the dispute between Gagik I's sons Ashot IV and Hovhannes-Smbat III, came to Dvin. Fearful of the latter's displeasure, Abirat with 12,000 horsemen sought Abu'l-Aswar's protection. Abu'l-Aswar initially welcomed Abirat {{and gave him a}} high position, but <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> to mistrust him, and had him killed, whereupon Abirat's lieutenant Sare departed for Ani with Abirat's supporters. Despite their kinship, {{at about the same time}} Abu'l-Aswar attacked David of Tashir. The Shaddadid army, numbering an impossible 150,000 according to Matthew of Edessa, captured much of Tashir, but David was able to assemble a broad alliance against Abu'l-Aswar. David himself fielded 10,000 troops, Hovhannes-Smbat III of Ani sent 3,000 men, the King of Kapan sent 2,000, and even the King of Georgia sent 4,000, while David also secured the public backing of the Catholicos of Albania. As a result, Abu'l-Aswar was defeated and evicted from Tashir.|$|E
5|$|Count Horn {{directed}} the Prince of Holstein-Beck {{to take the}} village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action. The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn {{up in front of}} Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but <b>soon</b> <b>came</b> under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.|$|E
