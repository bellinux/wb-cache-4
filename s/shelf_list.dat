The catalog, issued annually, is in three parts: an author & title catalog, a subject catalog, and a <b>shelf</b> <b>list.</b> Cumulative supplements are issued quarterly. A central idea in the depiction of entries in the catalog is the abandonment of the main entry concept.

This study assesses {{the impact on the}} organization of a library collection if the call number is not changed to fit into the <b>shelf</b> <b>list</b> sequence. The research questions examined are: "Is it necessary to adjust the book number to maintain alphabetic order of items within a class and, if not, how does this affect the call number display in an OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog) ? " Data were collected from books cataloged at a large, academic, research library that uses the Library of Congress Classification scheme. Three basic steps were used to analyze the sample: (1) a description of the type of copy used in book processing; (2) call number analysis to assess how many call numbers were changed; and (3) of those changed cal...|$|E

Meg Atwater-Singer is the Access Services Librarian at theUniversity of Evansville. When was {{the last}} time your library did an inventory? Librarians love to build {{collections}} that connect and fulfill patrons’ information needs. But do you really know what’s on your library’s shelves? What percentage of your collection is lost, missing, or in poor condition? Prior to these projects, the University of Evansville Libraries (UEL) collections had never been inventoried. This session will describe UEL’s various inventory projects, including their scope, technical details, and the labor involved. Over time, UEL’s inventory projects evolved from matching a system generated <b>shelf</b> <b>list</b> for the most heavily used Library of Congress classifications to a whole library barcode scanning project. UEL can say with confidence that 96 % of the collection was on the shelves. Come away inspired to replicate this success at your library...|$|E

40|$|A {{local model}} for support of {{periodic}} academic program reviews by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE) has developed and evolved at the Ball State University library. The process of devising a format to systematically report library holdings statistics to support program reviews and other collections development duties began in 1975; from 1975 to 1979, library holdings for the university's 48 departments were mapped. During the next 5 -year ICHE review cycle, additional call numbers and <b>shelf</b> <b>list</b> measurements were added {{in response to}} curriculum changes. In 1985 a two-part document was developed for each department to support accreditation reviews. The {{first part of the}} document, a library holdings survey for the department, was a quantitative assessment of classified monographs and serials following the Research Library Group Subject Conspectus. The second part was a narrative detailing financial summaries and notable library resources and services, including: related reference works, microform and other non-print collections; course-related library instruction; and interlibrary loan and other document-delivery services. Library staff initiate meetings with each department's chair and interested faculty to obtain feedback relating to these documents or other issues. Significant literature on library support for academic program reviews and accreditation visits is reviewed, and future directions are considered.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} into Austin Clarke’s personal library which was conducted {{as part of}} the UCD Irish Virtual Research Library and Archive (IVRLA) series of demonstrator research projects. Austin Clarke (1896 - 1974) was a major Irish poet and his personal library forms {{a large part of the}} 5, 000 volumes that comprise the Poetry Ireland Library which is now housed in UCD Library Special Collections. Clarke’s library offers fascinating insights into the intellectual life of mid-twentieth-century Ireland and into specific textual influences on Clarke’s own work. The research project focused on the issue of cultural production and the influence of international literature and literary criticism on such production. The remit of the IVRLA demonstrator projects was to provide digital research resources and to show how digital repositories could not only provide access to archival research materials but could also present material in new ways and suggest themes for further research. This project did so through highlighting Clarke’s activity as a professional reviewer and the diversity of his personal library (both of which demonstrate an intense engagement with a wide range of literary genres, cultures, languages, and periods) as well as by holding a symposium on transnational elements in Irish poetry. The paper additionally reports on the process of selecting appropriate outputs for digitisation (a selection of Clarke’s reviews together with visual representations of the reviewed volumes as well as a provisional <b>shelf</b> <b>list</b> of Clarke’s library and a selected list of his reviews and essays) and suggests directions for further research...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} two projects relevant to the interests of this conference which are active at the Johns Hopkins University. These are, first, the conversion of the <b>shelf</b> <b>list</b> of the University Library to machine -readable form, and, second, the design and operation of a new type of computer-based circulation system. These activities were initiated and are being carried out at Johns Hopkins as part of an operations research and systems engineering study of university libraries, under the sponsorship of the National Science Foundation. The leadership in initiating and directing this study has from the beginning been that of Robert H. Roy, Dean of the School of Engineering Science and Chairman of the Department of Operations Research of the University. The Project team has been fortunate throughout in having a close and cordial working relationship with the staff of the Johns Hopkins University Library. From providing a field for examination and case study of systems problems, to sympathetic and responsive reception of proposals for action, the Library has been friend, teacher, and subject all at once. This fortunate and indeed essential state of affairs has been due above all to the perception, the vision, and the understanding of the University Librarian, John Berthel. The support of the National Science Foundation has been crucial. The cost of the work is small in terms of the long-range objectives which are at stake here, but without the far-sighted support of NSF these undertakings could not have been attempted at all. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
