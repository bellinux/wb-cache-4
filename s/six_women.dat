On the October 4, 2004 edition of Raw, three candidates were named as potential contenders for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday; Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates.

At Taboo Tuesday, Michaels won the fans vote and faced Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship, however, Michaels was unable to win the match after Edge interfered and speared Michaels, allowing Triple H to pin him.|$|E

All the obese women showed a decrease in haemoglobin oxygen saturation when asleep, which occurred predominantly during periods of rapid eye movement sleep. That the fall in oxygen saturation was significantly greater (p less than 0. 05) in the obese non-responders suggests that central as well as mechanical factors may be important for the genesis of nocturnal hypoxia and is evidence for a disturbance of central nervous function in some obese women...|$|R
