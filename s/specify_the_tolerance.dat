40|$|Abstract: Every {{mechanical}} part is fabricated with {{variations in}} size and shape in the real world. Thus, tolerances are assigned to <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> zone corresponding to the allowable range of variation in the design shape within which the entire shape element must lie after the manufacturing process. Geometric tolerances constrain the size and the thickness of an individual shape element or its relative position and orientation {{with respect to the}} related datums. The eVect of the tolerances given to the datums should be propagated to the orientation and the location tolerances in the proper order of precedence. This paper proposes a mathematical foundation for representing the propagation of geometric tolerances while considering the order of precedence of the datums. The eVect caused by the tolerances of the datum can also be mathematically handled while considering the datum order of precedence...|$|E

Thereby, we concentrate on comparing the efficiency of important classes of time integration schemes, namely time adaptive Rosenbrock, singly diagonally implicit (SDIRK) and explicit first stage singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. To make the comparison fair, efficient equation system solvers need to be chosen and a smart choice of tolerances is needed.

The progress on grid adaptability testing for wind turbines or wind farms is very slow. At present, most wind turbines run in the power system without grid adaptability testing, and so the safe and stable operation of the power system is under threat. For example, at the beginning of 2011, a grid fault occurred in the northwest of China. This accident initially caused fluctuation of the grid voltage, dropping the grid frequency, which led to numbers of wind turbines disconnecting from the grid. The accident caused a serious threat to the safe and stable operation of the power system. Accident reporting and investigation showed that poor grid adaptability of wind turbines was the main reason for this accident, which emphasized the necessity and urgency for grid adaptability testing of wind turbines.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a system}} and method of compressing a DTM {{to be used in}} an Auto-GCAS system using a semi-regular geometric compression algorithm. In general, the invention operates by first selecting the boundaries of the three dimensional map to be compressed and dividing the three dimensional map data into regular areas. Next, a type of free-edged, flat geometric surface is selected which will be used to approximate terrain data of the three dimensional map data. The flat geometric surface is used to approximate terrain data for each regular area. The approximations are checked to determine if they fall within selected <b>tolerances.</b> If <b>the</b> approximation for a specific regular area is within <b>specified</b> <b>tolerance,</b> <b>the</b> data is saved for that specific regular area.

The result will approximate the given animation within a user specified tolerance which can be adjusted to give the required level of detail.

The present study assessed the adsorption effectiveness of HCl-modified eucalyptus leaves in fluoride removal from synthetic solutions. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetics, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, as well as pH (2 - 12), initial concentration (5 - 30 mg/L), adsorbent dose (0. 1 - 1 g/L), and temperature (25 - 45 0 C) were investigated on defluoridation. Results: The results with the maximum removal efficiency of 90 % was obtained in pH = 10, initial concentration = 5 mg/L, and adsorbent dose = 0. 1 g/L.
