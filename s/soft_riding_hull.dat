50|$|Mystique's {{suspension}} {{tuned for}} a <b>softer</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|R
50|$|This system {{allowed the}} {{suspension}} {{to achieve an}} unusually <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> quality.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{chooses the}} [...] "SOFT" [...] selection, {{to provide a}} <b>softer</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>softer</b> <b>ride</b> {{because of}} {{the layout of the}} tire's plies and {{because of the}} flex of the {{sidewalls}} more stable contact with the road service.|$|R
50|$|The Visa {{featured}} a soft but well-damped, long-travel, fully independent suspension (Coil-sprung MacPherson struts at the front, with coil sprung trailing arms at the rear) {{that contributed to}} a <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> similar to the CitroÃ«n 2CV, but without extreme bodyroll.|$|R
50|$|Airmatic - air suspension, an {{evolution}} of the suspension system introduced on the W220, using compressed air instead of steel springs to provide a <b>softer</b> <b>ride</b> with better handling characteristics {{at the same time}} and adaptive electronic control (known as Adaptive Damping System) to sense road and driving conditions and produce a sportier or <b>softer</b> <b>ride.</b> Airmatic also allows the vehicle to be raised by pressing a button in order to increase ground clearance while lowering the body at higher speeds. Airmatic is the standard suspension system for all S-Class models apart from the S 600, S 63, and S 65 AMG which are all equipped with Active Body Control as standard.|$|R
50|$|The MacPherson strut front {{suspension}} {{was replaced}} with more conventional double A-arm suspension (Also known as double wishbone suspension) which gave the Mark III a much <b>softer</b> <b>ride</b> on the road' but did give cars fitted with the larger, heavier engines distinct understeer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>riding</b> of <b>Hull</b> was {{vacated by}} Liberal MNA Roch Cholette on 9 April 2008.|$|R
25|$|Recently, a {{variation}} of the traditional seat stay that bypasses the seat tube and connects further into the top tube was patented by Volagi Cycles. This frame element added length to the traditional design of seat stays, making a <b>softer</b> <b>ride</b> at the sacrifice of frame stiffness.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, the {{suspension}} of the cars was replaced by another Moulton design, the hydrolastic system. The new suspension gave a <b>softer</b> <b>ride,</b> but it also increased weight and production cost. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{aircraft}} {{allow the}} pilot {{to select the}} ride [...] "hardness", to choose between how closely the aircraft tries to keep itself {{close to the ground}} and the forces exerted on the pilot. The F-111 used a switch to select for a hard, medium or a <b>soft</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sales for the 1967 model, {{which was}} most notably {{distinguished}} by a slight facelift, {{the addition of}} optional disc brakes, and a slightly <b>softer</b> <b>ride,</b> dropped by nearly half, to 22,062. A stereo tape player was optional. It would be 1971 before the Toronado would match its first-year sales mark.|$|R
5000|$|A new [...] "luxury" [...] model became {{available}} starting for 1969, available in only the hardtop body style. The 'Grande' featured a <b>soft</b> <b>ride,</b> 55 lb of extra sound deadening, {{as well as}} deluxe interior with simulated wood trim. It was popular with buyers with 22182 units sold through 1969.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, save me!" [...] {{cried the}} girl, and one {{glance at her}} told Dick {{that she was not}} over sixteen and as {{beautiful}} as any maiden he had ever seen. She was attired in true western style and wore on her mass of shining curls a big, <b>soft</b> <b>riding</b> hat.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s Raleigh {{made its}} small-wheeled RSW 16 with balloon tires {{so it would}} have a <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> like the fully {{suspended}} Moulton Bicycle. Other manufacturers then used the same idea for their own small wheelers. Examples include the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) Commuter, the Trusty Spacemaster and the Stanningley (UK)-made Bootie Folding Bicycle.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{weight was}} key to {{allowing}} cars {{such as the}} Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and the Cadillac in the 1950s and 1960s {{to have a more}} comfortable ride quality. The downside is that weight also contributes to poor fuel efficiency. From simple physics, <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> is actually caused by the ratio of the weight to the spring stiffness.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} in all UK models {{was replaced}} by a Hydrolastic system in 1964. The new suspension created a <b>softer</b> <b>ride,</b> but it also increased weight and production cost; in 1969 the original rubber suspension reappeared except on 1275 GT, Clubman and Cooper S models. Many other production changes occurred {{over the life of the}} Mark I Mini.|$|R
50|$|From an {{engineering}} perspective, the Xantia's biggest advance was the suspension. From launch, {{the more expensive}} models were available with an enhanced version of the XM's Hydractive, Hydractive II or H2, computer-controlled version of the hydropneumatic self-leveling suspension. This used extra suspension spheres to allow a <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> in normal conditions, but taut body control during hard braking, acceleration or cornering.|$|R
2500|$|Finally, {{manufacturers}} have also introduced the [...] "comfort bike" [...] category, {{to combine the}} <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> and upright posture of cruisers with a more conventionally styled bike. Comfort bikes have such features as fenders, suspension seatposts and forks, and large padded saddles with giant springs. All of these features are copied from cruisers, but redesigned to look more like regular road or hybrid bikes.|$|R
5000|$|Metropolitans {{have the}} very <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> {{preferred}} by Americans at the time, {{instead of the}} firmer suspension preferred in Europe. Markedly American, the styling was considered outlandish compared with the more sober British-styled models in the British Motor Corporation lineup. Brian Sewell commented in 2007 that the car was [...] "damned" [...] in England [...] "as a preposterous aberration incorporating the worst of everything American." ...|$|R
50|$|Oswald Parent (September 30, 1925 in Hull, Quebec - July 4, 2011) was a Quebec {{politician}} and chartered accountant. He was the Member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1956 to 1976 (Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1956 to 1968) for the <b>riding</b> of <b>Hull.</b> A {{member of the}} legislature for 20 years, Parent was the longest serving MLA/MNA for the <b>Hull</b> <b>riding.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Examples of {{the torque}} tube were the American cars of the Ford brand up through 1948, {{including}} over 19,000,000 Model Ts. Ford used the less expensive transverse springs {{that could not}} take forward thrust. For many of those years, Chevrolet used the torque tube to compete in cost, while Buick used it {{so as to be}} able to use coil springs for a <b>softer</b> <b>ride</b> than leaf springs.|$|R
50|$|Maryse Gaudreault (born July 6, 1959 in Quebec City, Quebec) is a Quebec provincial politician. She is the Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the <b>riding</b> of <b>Hull.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{served as}} the Member of the National Assembly of Quebec (MNA) for the provincial <b>riding</b> of <b>Hull</b> from 1998 until 2008, {{as a member of}} the Quebec Liberal Party caucus.|$|R
50|$|Damper {{and spring}} specifications: 90 mm bump, 80 mm rebound with bounce {{frequency}} at 1.43 Hz at front and 1.80 Hz at the rear. Despite being sports oriented, these figures imply a <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> and inherently decrease track performance. As {{can be seen}} from the McLaren F1 LM, McLaren F1 GTR et al., the track performance potential is much higher than that in the stock F1 due to fact that car should be comfortable and usable in everyday conditions.|$|R
2500|$|When the W {{was absorbed}} into the York and North Midland Railway in 1845 and into George Hudson's growing empire, the railway was rebuilt as a double track steam-worked railway and {{connected}} to the Y's York to Scarborough Line being built at Rillington junction. [...] Through rail journeys became possible from Whitby to the industrial districts of the West <b>Riding,</b> <b>Hull,</b> Manchester, Liverpool, London and other destinations. Whitby became accessible to day-trippers and holidaymakers. [...] To encourage traffic George Hudson formed a company to develop the West Cliff in Whitby, building roads and hotels before work stopped at Hudson's downfall in 1849.|$|R

500|$|Compared to {{previous}} generations, the LS 430 featured {{a greater number}} of model configurations and options. While sharing the same body style, variants were differentiated by chassis configuration and onboard equipment. Models with the Euro-tuned sport suspension, sold as the [...] "Touring" [...] package in the U.S., featured larger, high-speed brakes. These brakes were also standard on European market models. Fully optioned models with height adjustable air suspension, tuned for a combination of <b>soft</b> <b>ride</b> and responsive handling, were sold in the U.S. as the [...] "Ultra Luxury" [...] edition.|$|R
50|$|The Mk II's MacPherson strut front {{suspension}} {{was replaced}} with more conventional double A-arm suspension to give the car a <b>soft</b> 'freeway' <b>ride,</b> which gave the larger engines distinct understeer.|$|R
2500|$|Balloon tires became {{available}} in 1925. They were [...] all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible â typically [...] â giving a <b>softer</b> <b>ride.</b> The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so [...] (rim diameter) Ã [...] (tire width) wheels has {{about the same}} outer diameter as 30 in (76cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an inner tube to hold the pressurized air; tubeless tires were not generally in use until much later.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Small launch {{vehicles}} {{present an}} economically viable method for placing small satellites into orbit. These launch vehicles {{would be even}} more attractive to satellite customers if they could provide a <b>softer</b> <b>ride</b> to orbit. Passive whole-spacecraft vibration isolation systems have been developed for small launch vehicles to greatly reduce the dynamic launch loads. To date, two types of isolation systems have been designed. The first is a single-axis âSoftRide â axial isolation system that provides isolation for predominantly axial loads. This type of system has been flown successfully three times on the Taurus/GFO mission in February 1998, th...|$|R
50|$|The brakes {{were now}} {{controlled}} using a hydraulic mechanism. The suspension featured synchromous springing, a suspension configuration already {{seen on the}} manufacturer's larger models {{and based on the}} Dubonnet system for which General Motors in France had purchased the license. The General Motors version, which had been further developed by Opelâs North American parent, was intended to provide a <b>soft</b> <b>ride,</b> but there was some criticism that handling and road-holding were compromised, especially when the system was applied to small light-weight cars such as the Kadett. By the end of 1937 33,402 of these first generation Kadetts had been produced.|$|R
50|$|Comparisons to the Lexus ES 300, {{which was}} roomier and <b>softer</b> in <b>ride,</b> {{generally}} favored the Lexus {{as the more}} appealing buy for the average luxury car buyer, whereas the Vigor was stiff and small.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States, {{the term}} [...] "van" [...] refers to {{vehicles}} that, like European minibuses, are even larger than large MPVs and are rarely seen being driven for domestic purposes â except for [...] "conversion vans". These possess extremely large interior space {{and are often}} more intended for hauling cargo than people. Most vans use body-on-frame construction and are thus suitable for extensive modification and coachwork, known as conversion. Conversion vans are often quite luxurious, boasting comfortable seats, <b>soft</b> <b>rides,</b> built-in support for electronics such as television sets, and other amenities. The more elaborate conversion vans straddle the line between cars and recreational vehicles.|$|R
