Classification of expert comments was relatively straightforward in that many interviewees identified consistent material.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for underwater robotic intervention systems {{around the world}} in several application domains requires more versatile and inexpensive systems. By using a wireless communication system, supervised <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> have freedom of movement and, at the same time, allows the operator to get camera feedback and supervise the intervention. On the other hand, the typical data rate of the wireless submarine channels is generally very limited, requiring the application of advanced compression techniques. In this paper we present the DEBT (Depth Embedded Block Tree) algorithm for the progressive compression of images with region of interest (ROI). The results demonstrate advantages with other compression algorithms, and the possibility of executing the algorithm in real time on ARM-based embedded low-power computers...|$|R
40|$|For {{navigation}} of <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> various machine based vision {{systems are}} used. Ultrasonic systems {{are one of}} the cheapest, but some limitations reduce their performance. This paper is devoted to improvement of a data acquisition speed and noise robustness of such systems. These goals were achieved using simultaneous data acquisition along a few different directions using orthogonal complex coded series as probing signals, parallel correlation processing of the received signals by individual digital signal processors (DSP) and determination of the coordinates of the obstacles detected using the tri-aural approach. In order to increase the environment scan speed, electronically steered ultrasonic phased arrays are used with the different code sequences for each direction. The data exchange with the host computer is performed via the LON Works interface. Ultrasonic image formation and analysis algorithms are discussed. ...|$|R

More precisely, the user of the cart can get walking assistance by holding specifically designed handle bars supporting both arms. This construction is fully integrated in a prototypical robot designed as a shopping cart. Keywords—Walking aid; <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> shopping cart. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for underwater robotic intervention systems {{around the world}} in several application domains requires of more versatile and inexpensive systems. One example of such applications is the archaeology, where experimented divers study and reconstruct the history, recovering key objects in order to classify and preserve them properly. Moreover, this task is especially dangerous at deeps below 50 meters, where the archaeologist needs more sophisticated diving equipment and degree of experience due to high risk to which it is exposed caused by possible decompression situations. The use of supervised <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> can help to this task. To achieve this goal, a wireless communication system can provide freedom of movements to the robot and, at the same time, will allow the operator to get camera feedback and supervise the intervention.

40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{activity in}} robotics, relatively few advances {{have been made}} in the area of human-robot interaction. The most successful interfaces in the recent RoboCup Rescue competition were teleoperational interfaces. However, some believe that teams of robots under supervisory control may ultimately lead to better performance in real world operations. Such robots would be commanded with high-level commands rather than batch sequences of low-level commands. For humans to command teams of <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> in a dynamically changing environment, the human-robot interface will need to include several aspects of human-human communication. These aspects include cooperatively detecting and resolving problems, making using of conversational and situational context, maintaining contexts across multiple conversations and use of verbal and non-verbal information.

40|$|Robotic outpost based {{exploration}} {{represents a}} fundamental shift in mission design from conventional, single spacecraft missions towards a distributed risk approach with many miniaturized <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> and sensors. This approach can facilitate wide-area sampling and exploration, and may consist of a web of orbiters, landers, or penetrators. To meet the mass and volume constraints of deep space missions such as the Europa Ocean Science Station, the distributed units must be fully miniaturized to fully leverage the wide-area exploration approach. However, presently there is a dearth of available options for powering these miniaturized sensors and robots. This group is currently examining miniaturized, solid state batteries as candidates {{to meet the demand}} of applications requiring low power, mass, and volume micro-power sources. These applications may include powering microsensors, battery-backing rad-hard CMOS memory and providing momentary chip back-up power.
