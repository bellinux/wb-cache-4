40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Air {{compressors}} are {{a significant}} industrial energy user and therefore a prime target for industrial energy audits. The project goals were to develop a software tool, AIRMaster, develop a methodology for performing compressed air <b>system</b> <b>audits,</b> and conduct field audits to refine the methodology and assess savings potential from six common Operation and Maintenance (O&M) measures. AIRMaster and supporting manuals are designed for general auditors or plant personnel to evaluate compressed air system operation with simple instrumentation during a short-term audit. AIRMaster provides a systematic approach to compressed air <b>system</b> <b>audits,</b> analyzing collected data, and reporting results. AIRMaster focuses on inexpensive Operation and Maintenance measures, such as fixing air leaks and improving controls, that can significantly improve performance and reliability of the compressed air system, without significant risk to production. An experienced auditor can perform an audit, analyze collected data, and produce results in 2 - 3 days. AIRMaster reduces {{the cost of an}} audit, thus freeing funds to implement recommendations. AIRMaster proved to be a fast and effective tool. In seven audits AIRMaster identified energy savings of 4, 056, 000 kWh, or 49. 2...|$|E

Total implementation costs were $ 94, 700 for a project payback period of 0. 6 years.

Inspection is the examination of the food or food control systems, raw materials, manufacturing and distribution process, all these being achieved according to standards. Certification is the procedure by which the certification authority (organisation) of ensures in writing that the food and food control systems are according to standards.

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{businesses}} are inherently process-driven. Consequently, {{the use of}} business-process driven systems, usually implemented on top of service-oriented or cloud-based infrastructures, is increasing. At the same time, the demand on the security, privacy, and compliance of such systems is increasing as well. As a result, the costs—with respect to computational effort at runtime as well as financial costs—for operating business-process driven systems increase steadily. In this paper, we present a method for statically checking the security and conformance of the system implementation, e. g., on the source code level, to requirements specified on the business process level. As the compliance is statically guaranteed—already at design-time—this method reduces the number of run-time checks for ensuring the security and compliance and, thus, improves the runtime performances. Moreover, it reduces the costs of <b>system</b> <b>audits,</b> {{as there is no}} need for analyzing the generated log files for validating the compliance to the properties that are already statically guaranteed...|$|E
40|$|Internal {{management}} <b>system</b> <b>audits</b> {{are sometimes}} seen as policing activities focusing on compliance and documentation rather than something {{that contributes to}} improvements. Previous {{research has focused on}} what to change in order to make auditing more business-relevant; fewer studies provide focus on how these changes can be operationalised. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand how internal audits can be carried out in a way that is perceived to add value beyond verifying compliance towards a standard. This study is based on action research in a global company in the consumer electronics sector. The study confirms that internal audits can add value beyond verifying compliance, acting as a generative mechanism for business-relevant improvements. However, this requires both short- and long-term changes in the auditing process; examples of changes are decreased time from audit to report, closer dialogue with management by the establishment of a sponsor role linking management and auditors, and giving up the cyclic audit programme in favour of a programme aligned with business objectives, strategies, and risks...|$|E
40|$|It aims {{to provide}} {{information}} on the general principles of quality, quality management and quality challenges in health care. The challenge of quality is founded on the basic principle of {{reducing the number of}} errors, which is still a great challenge for health care. Latest research demonstrates that almost every tenth patient suffers from preventable harm and adverse effects related to their care and that variation among health care providers is large and cannot be explained by patient characteristics. The Working Party started its work a few years ago. A survey was carried out which demonstrated that the concepts and principles relating to quality management in health care differ from one country and culture to another. The same was true for quality <b>system</b> <b>audits</b> and the principles for their credibility and authorisation (accreditation and certification). Since then many projects in health care have demonstrated that the general management and quality assurance principles apply well for health care.
