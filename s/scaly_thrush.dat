50|$|It was {{previously}} considered a subspecies of the <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush</b> (Zoothera dauma) is {{a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae.|$|E
50|$|A {{striking}} identification {{feature of}} both sexes in flight is the black band on the white underwings, a feature shared with the <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush</b> is very secretive, preferring dense cover. It nests in trees, laying {{three or}} four dull green eggs in a neat cup nest. It is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range of}} insects, {{earthworms}} and berries.|$|E
50|$|The Sri Lanka thrush or Sri Lanka <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush</b> (Zoothera imbricata) is {{a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae. This bird is a {{non-migratory}} resident breeder found in south western wetlands of the island of Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|This large, heavily {{patterned}} thrush {{is similar}} in appearance to the <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush,</b> {{to which it is}} usually considered a subspecies. It has warm olive-brown to buff upperparts and whitish underparts with heavy black scaling. It has twelve tail feathers. The <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush</b> is smaller and has fourteen tail feathers. It has a cheerful song similar to the Siberian thrush. Among thrushes, only the blue whistling thrush typically attains a larger size. The Amami thrush ranges in length from 29 to 31 cm and weighs approximately 172 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 16.4 to 17.3 cm, the bill is 3.1 to 3.3 cm and the tarsus is 4.1 to 4.5 cm.|$|E
50|$|Zoothera imbricata was {{formerly}} {{treated as a}} race of the <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush.</b> It belongs in a group, possibly a superspecies, formed by that species and Z. lunulata, Z. heinei, Z. machiki, Z. talaseae, Z. margaretae etc., Z. imbricata being smaller, longer billed and rufous below.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is said to}} make terribly eerie bird cry [...] "hyoo hyoo" [...] noises that {{resemble}} that of the <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush.</b> In the movie Akuryōtō (originally by Seishi Yokomizo), the catchphrase [...] "nights where the nue cry are dreadful" [...] refers to this fact.|$|E
50|$|This {{ecoregion}} {{is completely}} {{contained within the}} Endemic bird area of Sri Lanka. Out of sixteen bird species categorized as near-endemic, two species, the green-billed coucal and the white-throated flowerpecker are indigenous. The green-billed coucal and the Sri Lanka whistling-thrush are listed as threatened. The ashy-headed laughingthrush, red-faced malkoha and <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush</b> are the other threatened species.|$|E
50|$|The town's attractions {{include the}} golf course, trout streams, Victoria Park, and boating or fishing on Lake Gregory. Victoria Park is an {{attractive}} and well-used oasis. It is popular with birdwatchers at quieter times because of the good opportunities for seeing species, particularly the Indian blue robin, pied thrush or <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush</b> lurking in the denser undergrowth. The Kashmir flycatcher is another attractive bird species in the park.|$|E
50|$|The dark-sided thrush (Zoothera marginata) is {{a species}} of bird in the thrush family Turdidae. It {{is also known as}} the lesser brown thrush, the long-billed ground-thrush, and the dark-sided ground-thrush. The species is {{monotypic}} (lacking subspecies) and is closely related to a number of thrushes in the genus Zoothera, including the long-billed thrush and the widespread <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush.</b> It was described by Edward Blyth in 1847 based upon a specimen collected in Rakhine in Burma (Myanmar).|$|E
50|$|In Japan, {{they are}} {{considered}} a bird that makes cries at night, and the word {{can be seen in}} the Kojiki and the Man'yōshū. The owner of this crying voice was traditionally described as a yellow-red bird as big as a Columbidae, but nowadays there is the accepted theory that it is the <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush.</b> Since the people of the Heian Period regarded the sorrowful sounding voices of this bird as an ill omen, they were considered to be a wicked bird,and it is said that when the emperor or nobles heard its crying voice, they would make prayers that nothing disastrous would happen.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} races {{which are now}} often split into a varying number of {{separate}} species. Z. aurea (White's thrush), including the questionable subspecies Z. a. toratugumi, is the migratory Siberian and north-east Asian form. Z. neilgherriensis (Nilgiri thrush) is resident {{in the hills of}} southwest India. Z. imbricata (Sri Lanka thrush) is endemic to the hills of Sri Lanka and is particularly distinctive, being smaller, long-billed and rufous below. Z. dauma (<b>scaly</b> <b>thrush)</b> breeds in the Himalaya and migrates to the foothills in winter. Z. d. horsfieldi (Horsfield's thrush) is resident in Indonesia on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa. Z. d. major (Amami thrush) is restricted to the Amami Islands in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna of {{the reserve}} {{exhibits}} {{a high degree of}} variety and endemicity. Some of the noteworthy species include mountain hawk-eagle, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, jungle nightjar, Sri Lanka blue magpie, yellow-eared bulbul, brown-capped babbler, orange-billed babbler, dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka bush warbler, Sri Lanka whistling thrush, spot-winged thrush, common blackbird, and Sri Lanka white-eye. All five species of bird which are strictly endemic to this ecoregion are present in the reserve. Common birds are scarlet minivet, small minivet, black bulbul, Sri Lanka scimitar babbler, grey-headed canary-flycatcher, pied bushchat, and Sri Lanka <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush.</b> Indian pitta, Asian brown flycatcher, Kashmir flycatcher, Indian blue robin, pied thrush, black-throated munia, and large-billed leaf warbler are amongst the large number of migratory species.|$|E
50|$|The taxonomic changes {{proposed}} {{increase the}} number of South Asian endemic bird species, and the numbers of restricted-range endemic bird species in several of South Asias Endemic Bird Areas. Using the taxonomic arrangements in Birds of South Asia, the following species are additional South Asian endemics: Ceylon bay-owl, hill swallow, white-bellied and orange minivets, square-tailed black bulbul, Jerdons leafbird, Indian blackbird, large blue flycatcher, common babbler and Indian and white-cheeked nuthatches; the following are additional Indian endemics: crested hawk-eagle, grey-fronted green-pigeon, Malabar barbet, Malabar woodshrike, flame-throated bulbul, Nilgiri thrush, white-bellied blue robin, Naga wren-babbler, Indian yellow tit, Nilgiri flowerpecker and Malabar white-headed starling; the following are new Sri Lankan endemics: Ceylon green-pigeon, Ceylon small barbet, crimson-backed flameback, Ceylon swallow, Ceylon woodshrike, black-capped bulbul, Ceylon <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush</b> and Ceylon crested drongo; and the following are additional endemics in the Andaman/Nicobar islands: Nicobar imperial-pigeon, Andaman barn-owl, Humes hawk-owl, Andaman cuckooshrike, Andaman bulbul, Nicobar jungle-flycatcher, Andaman shama and Andaman flowerpecker.|$|E
40|$|In 2008, tick {{surveillance}} of migratory birds {{was conducted on}} Hong-do (Hong Island), Jeollanam Province, Republic of Korea. Seventy-seven ticks representing two genera and four species—Haemaphysalis flava Neumann (21 ticks), Haemaphysalis ornithophila Hoogstraal & Kohls (2), Ixodes nipponensis Kitaoka & Saito (3), and Ixodes turdus Nakatsuji (51) —were collected from 12 species of birds belonging to nine genera. Two male H. ornithophila, an uncommonly collected tick, were removed from a <b>scaly</b> <b>thrush,</b> Zoothera dauma (Latham), on Hong-do. Haemaphysalis ornithophila is a Southeast Asian species that was transported to Korea during the spring migration of Z. dauma to its breeding grounds in Russia. This first report of H. ornithophila from Korea has implications for the introduction of exotic tick species and their pathogens on migratory birds...|$|E
