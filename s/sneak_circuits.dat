40|$|The {{malfunction}} {{or failure}} of an aircraft electrical system because signal or power flow paths were unintentionally designed into the electrical circuit, {{is known to be}} the cause of several major failures of engineering systems. These unintentional signal or power paths are called <b>sneak</b> <b>circuits.</b> The nature of <b>Sneak</b> <b>Circuits</b> was first considered after they had been identified as the cause of some spectacular and expensive rocket failures in the United States space programme. This paper reviews the status of Sneak Circuit Analysis (SCA) and presents a general systematic approach the author has devised to identify <b>sneak</b> <b>circuits</b> during the circuits design phase. The application of the method of SCA is illustrated with a case study. The paper makes a case to take the investigation of an electrical failure or malfunction beyond the identification of a failed component to include a search for possible <b>sneak</b> <b>circuits.</b> The obvious fact that could result from the discovery of a sneak circuit is the shift in legal responsibility from the component manufacturer to the circuit designer...|$|E
40|$|Sneak circuit {{analysis}} {{is used in}} safety critical systems to identify latent paths which cause the occurrence of unwanted functions or inhibit desired functions, assuming all components are functioning properly.

Because of the high cost of a sneak circuit analysis, it should be conducted only in areas where there is a high potential for a hazard. Benefit: Identification of <b>sneak</b> <b>circuits</b> in the design phase of a project prior to manufacture can improve reliability; eliminate costly redesign and schedule delays; and eliminate problems in test, launch, on-orbit, and protracted space operations.

It uses qualitative reasoning and knowledge about which functions are expected to be active in the circuit, in order to identify potential sneak paths in a circuit. The method has been implemented in software and deployed at several automotive engineering design centres. An example run of the software is shown. It is able to import circuits from a standard electrical computer aided design tool, and so demands very little work of the engineer. The time savings through use of the system are estimated to be several orders of magnitude as well as ensuring a thorough exploration of all possible interactions.

Recent work in Model Based Reasoning has {{resulted}} in the development of automated tools to perform Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) and <b>Sneak</b> <b>Circuit</b> Analysis (SCA). These tools work at the component level for individual systems or subsystems. Analysis of multiple subsystems is becoming necessary because of the increase in system and subsystem interactions resulting from Electronic Control Unit networked system architectures. This paper considers the automated construction of black box system or subsystem models from envisionments produced by a mixture of qualitative electrical and finite state machine simulations. These models can then be used {{as part of a larger}} simulation to promote reuse of simulation results during the repetitive automated FMEA task and hence improve simulation efficiency when multiple systems are involved. The approach also has the potential to allow <b>Sneak</b> <b>Circuit</b> Analysis (Price, Snooke and Landry 1996; Price & Snooke 1999) to be extended to include systems with internal memory.

Ellis, Identifying Design Glitches through Automated Design Analysis, 44 th Intl Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, Washington DC, January 1999 Engineers have {{developed}} a number of design techniques in order to detect problems in their designs, such as yellow-boarding, FMECA, FTA and <b>sneak</b> <b>circuit</b> analysis. Concurrent engineering demands that all such design analysis activities are carried out in a timely manner-instantaneously would be ideal. For electrical systems incorporating some electronics, many such techniques can be automated using qualitative simulation to generate appropriate results. There are two main advantages of using qualitative simulation over using numerical simulation in tools such as SPICE or SABER. The first advantage is that the analysis can be performed early in the design lifecycle, identifying problems when it is less costly to fix them. The second advantage is that component models are easy to specify and are highly reusable when compared with models built in SPICE or SABERNon peer reviewe...|$|R

Its use enables the automatic generation of a textual design analysis report that interprets the results of qualitative (or numerical) simulation in terms of the system's purpose. We present a novel functional description language that increases the expressiveness of this approach, increasing the range both of systems and design analysis tasks for which the approach can be used. The language also allows closer integration of functional modelling into the design process. The language allows a device function to be decomposed either in terms of subsidiary functions or required effects. We discuss the use of such alternative decompositions and propose a logic of functional description that is used to underpin the proposed language. The language has been used in the interpretation of electro-mechanical, hydraulic and fluid transfer systems in the automotive and aerospace industries to support tasks Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, <b>Sneak</b> <b>Circuit</b> Analysis, and Diagnosis. The language is not inherently restricted to these applications and the paper makes use of indicative examples from other domains. Peer reviewe...|$|R
