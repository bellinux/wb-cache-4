50|$|The FE's auto-exposure lock {{mechanism}} is activated by pushing {{and holding the}} timer shutter release lever toward the lens mount; even though the exposure is fixed {{to the state of}} the instant the lever is pushed, the black <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> <b>needle</b> in the viewfinder does not reflect this and moves freely.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Nikon F2 Photomic, packaged {{with the}} Nikon DP-1 head, was manufactured from 1971 to 1977. The DP-1 had a center-the-needle exposure control system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving between horizontally arranged +/- over/underexposure markers {{at the bottom}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the photographer's actual camera selections. Flanking the needle array on the left and right were a readout of the camera set f-stop and <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> respectively. The <b>needle</b> array was duplicated on the top of the DP-1 head to allow exposure control without looking through the viewfinder. A Nikon F2 Photomic with Nikkor-S 50 mm f/1.4 lens had a US list price of $660 in 1972. Note that SLRs usually sold for 30 to 40 percent below list price.|$|R
50|$|These two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> In above situation, slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> makes image more clear and bright because the low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> takes more light than high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> However, the high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> often {{is necessary for}} moving object.|$|R
5000|$|P Program AE (auto-exposure) mode. Exposure is set by {{calculating the}} correct <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> for the given lighting, film {{sensitivity}} and currently-selected aperture. If the calculated <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is higher than}} the maximum available (1/250th of a second) the aperture is closed to expose with an achievable <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> value. If the calculated <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is lower than the [...] "camera shake" [...] <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (default 1/30 of a second, but variable from 1/4 to 1/60) the aperture is opened to expose with that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Motion blur due {{to subject}} {{movement}} {{can usually be}} prevented by using a faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> The exact <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{will depend on the}} speed at which the subject is moving. For example, a very fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> will be needed to [...] "freeze" [...] the rotors of a helicopter, whereas a slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> will be sufficient to freeze a runner.|$|R
50|$|Above two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera shutter speed.In case of moving object, the low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is not proper {{to capture the}} object. It needs faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> to capture it. <b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> has pros and cons.For capturing a moving object, photographers must use a high <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> However, the image can be very dark. Low <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> must be used when capturing a clear image or object under the harsh condition, {{but it is hard}} to capture the moving objects.|$|R

5000|$|A Aperture {{priority}} AE mode. Exposure is set by {{calculating the}} correct <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> or the given lighting, film sensitivity and currently-selected aperture. If that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{is not available}} the photo is taken with the closest available <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> but the aperture value is not varied.|$|R
5000|$|Tv (<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> priority): The camera {{lets the}} user set the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and {{automatically}} sets the aperture for correct exposure.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF meters for {{exposure}} either by aperture priority auto-exposure (with AE lock and +/-2EV exposure compensation) or in metered-manual mode. Aperture priority is selected by setting the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial {{to either the}} AE or AE lock position. Manual exposure is set by selecting a specific <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> on the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial (there is a central interlock button to prevent accidentally moving the dial from the AE modes to a manually selected <b>shutter</b> <b>speed).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{duration}} of an exposure {{is referred to}} as <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> often even in cameras that do not have a physical shutter, and is typically measured in fractions of a second. It is quite possible to have exposures from one up to several seconds, usually for still-life subjects, and for night scenes exposure times can be several hours. However, longer <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> blur motion, and shorter <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> freeze motion. Therefore, moving subjects require fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{ability of}} the {{photographer}} to take images without noticeable blurring by camera movement is an important parameter {{in the choice of}} the slowest possible <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> for a handheld camera. The rough guide used by most 35 mm photographers is that the slowest <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> that can be used easily without much blur due to camera shake is the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> numerically closest to the lens focal length. For example, for handheld use of a 35 mm camera with a 50 mm normal lens, the closest <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is 1/60 s (closest to [...] "50"), while for a 200 mm lens it is recommended not to choose <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> below 1/200th of a second. This rule can be augmented with knowledge of the intended application for the photograph, an image intended for significant enlargement and closeup viewing would require faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> to avoid obvious blur. Through practice and special techniques such as bracing the camera, arms, or body to minimize camera movement, using a monopod or a tripod, slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> can be used without blur. If a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is too slow for hand holding, a camera support, usually a tripod, must be used. Image stabilization on digital cameras or lenses can often permit the use of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> 3-4 stops slower (exposures 8-16 times longer).|$|R
50|$|When using most Zorki cameras, the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{should only}} be set after the shutter has been cocked. Setting the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> before the <b>shutter</b> is cocked can {{permanently}} damage the camera. This especially affects all Zorki cameras with slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> under 1/30 of a second, in particular the Zorki-3 and Zorki-4.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> do not factor into {{guide number}} {{calculations}} and, {{for the most}} part, {{have no effect on}} electronic flash exposures. See Effect of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds,</b> below.|$|R
50|$|In manual mode, a green M LED came on. The OVER or UNDER LED would blink to {{indicate}} the exposure adjustment recommended by the meter, while a steadily lit LED showed the actual camera set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> The photographer would adjust the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and/or the lens aperture f-stop until the OVER or UNDER LED went out. Unlike most other SLRs of the era, the ME F used two push buttons to increase or decrease <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> instead of the traditional dial and this LED scale is the only display of the set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> What {{appeared to be a}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial on autoexposure M-series SLRs was actually the exposure mode dial: AUTO meant aperture priority and M was for manual.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its effect on exposure, the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> changes the way movement appears in photographs. Very short <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{can be used to}} freeze fast-moving subjects, for example at sporting events. Very long <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are used to intentionally blur a moving subject for effect. Short exposure times are sometimes called [...] "fast", and long exposure times [...] "slow".|$|R
5000|$|... 1983: Pentax Super A (Japan; called Super Program in USA): first SLR with {{external}} LCD data display. With push buttons for <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> selection {{instead of a}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial, the Super Program used an LCD to show set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> As computerized SLR features multiplied, large external LCD panels became normal on virtually all 35 mm SLRs by the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|In 'M' (Manual Exposure Control) mode, {{the user}} selects both {{aperture}} and <b>shutter</b> <b>speed,</b> and the metering system provides a suggested <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (indicated in the viewfinder) for the selected aperture.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is {{critical}} to catching motion, thus sports photography is often done in shutter priority mode or manual. A frequent goal is to capture an instant with minimal blur, in which case a minimal <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is desired, but in other cases a slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is used so that blur shows to capture the motion, not simply the instant. A particular technique is panning, where the camera uses an intermediate <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and pans with the subject, yielding a relatively sharp subject and a background blurred {{in the direction of}} motion, yielding a sense of speed - compare speed lines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are not {{a factor}} in the {{calculation}} of guide numbers. For most modern cameras (those with focal-plane <b>shutters),</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> has no effect on flash exposures. See Shutter (photography) for more.|$|R

50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> is {{the length}} of time when the film or digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light. Object and image can be shown {{differently}} by <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> Below are the examples.|$|R
5000|$|A {{vertical}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> {{scale with}} LEDs to indicate both the user selected and camera suggested <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> (in 'M' mode) {{and the value}} selected ('P' and 'A' modes) by the camera's metering system.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{range from}} 30 seconds to 1/8000 {{of a second}} in all {{exposure}} modes. A non-timed bulb speed is available. Flash X-sync is available up to a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/250 of a second.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{one might}} wish to {{photograph}} a waterfall at a slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> to create a deliberate motion-blur effect. The photographer might determine that to obtain the desired effect, a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of ten seconds was needed. On a very bright day, there might be so much light that even at minimal film speed and a minimal aperture, the ten-second <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> would let in too much light, and the photo would be overexposed. In this situation, applying an appropriate neutral-density filter {{is the equivalent of}} stopping down one or more additional stops, allowing the slower <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and the desired motion-blur effect.|$|R
50|$|The rings {{controlling}} the effective lens diameter (from f/2.8 to f/22) and the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> are mechanically linked so that once one combination has been matched to the ambient lighting conditions, a faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> can be selected {{and a larger}} effective lens diameter will automatically be set when possible. For instance, one might start with a setting of f/11 and 1/250 second, but decide that the moving target demanded the higher <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> of 1/500. Simply setting that <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> without changing the effective lens aperture would result in an underexposure, but the Ricoh 500 will automatically change the aperture setting to f/8.|$|R
50|$|Faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are {{achieved}} by the second curtain closing before the first one has fully opened; {{this results in a}} vertical slit that travels horizontally across the film. Faster <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> simply require a narrower slit, as the speed of travel of the shutter curtains is not normally varied. Using this technique, modern SLR cameras are capable of <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 1/2000, 1/4000 or even 1/8000 of a second.|$|R
50|$|The EVF {{live view}} mode also allows {{a preview of}} the actual {{exposure}} in manual mode. The user can adjust <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and aperture in manual mode and see the actual effect on the recorded exposure in the EVF. In addition to the usual depth of field preview, the GH1 allows a unique <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> effect preview, giving the user a fairly accurate preview of the finished image blurring when using a slow <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because leaf {{shutters}} synchronized electronic flash at all <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> {{especially at}} fast <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> of [...] {{of a second}} or faster, cameras using leaf shutters were more desirable to studio photographers who used sophisticated studio electronic flash systems.|$|R
50|$|The FT used a metal-bladed, {{vertical}} travel, {{focal plane}} <b>shutter</b> with a <b>speed</b> range of 1 to 1/1000 second plus Bulb and flash X-sync of 1/125th second. The Nikkormat F-series had a <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> ring concentric with the lens mount, unlike Nippon Kogaku's other manual focus SLRs {{with a top}} mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> dial.|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{video cameras}} {{do not have}} {{mechanical}} shutters and allow setting <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> directly in time units. Professional video cameras often allow selecting <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> in terms of shutter angle instead of time units, especially those {{that are capable of}} overcranking or undercranking.|$|R
50|$|The only auto-exposure mode {{supported}} was {{aperture priority}} AE. The camera would choose an appropriate <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> Also supported, of course, was full manual exposure, {{aided by the}} camera's built-in meter. <b>Shutter</b> <b>speed</b> range was 1/1000 second to 1 second, plus bulb.|$|R
5000|$|Water modes, {{depending}} on what the mode is designed to do, will either widen the aperture and increase the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> for an action shot or shrink the aperture and slow down the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> to show {{the motion of the}} water.|$|R
5000|$|In {{early days}} of photography, {{available}} <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> were not standardized, though a typical sequence might have been 1/10 s, 1/25 s, 1/50 s, 1/100 s, 1/200 s and 1/500 s; neither were apertures or film sensitivity (at least 3 different national standards existed). Soon this problem resulted in a solution consisting in {{the adoption of a}} standardized way of choosing aperture so that each major step exactly doubled or halved the amount of light entering the camera (2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, etc.), a standardized 2:1 scale was adopted for <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> so that opening one aperture stop and reducing the amount of time of the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> by one step resulted in the identical exposure. The agreed standards for <b>shutter</b> <b>speeds</b> are: ...|$|R
5000|$|The FE is a manual-focus SLR with manual {{exposure}} control or aperture-priority autoexposure, and electromechanical components. As such, the FE requires batteries (two S76 or A76, or LR44 or SR44, or one 1/3N) to power its electronically controlled shutter. The batteries also power the FE's [...] "match-needle" [...] exposure control system. This {{consists of two}} needles pointing along a vertical <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> scale {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder. In manual mode, a black needle points out the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> recommended by the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL), silicon photodiode (SPD) light meter, with 60/40 percent centerweighting, while a translucent green needle shows the actual camera-set <b>shutter</b> <b>speed.</b> The photographer adjusts the <b>shutter</b> <b>speed</b> and/or the lens aperture f-stop until the needles align.|$|R
