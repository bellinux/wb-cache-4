40|$|The rapid {{worldwide}} {{growth of}} {{offshore renewable energy}} production will provide marine organisms with new hard substrate for colonization, thus acting as artificial reefs. The artificial reef effect is important when constructing, for example, <b>scour</b> <b>protections</b> since it can generate an enhanced habitat. Specifically, artificial structures can create increased heterogeneity in the area important for species diversity and density. Offshore energy installations also have the positive side effect as they are a sanctuary area for trawled organisms. Higher survival of fish and bigger fish is an expected outcome that can contribute to a spillover to outer areas. One negative side effect is that invasive species can find new habitats in artificial reefs and thus influence the native habitats and their associated environment negatively. Different <b>scour</b> <b>protections</b> in offshore wind farms can create new habitats compensating for habitat loss by offshore energy installations. These created habitats differ from the lost habitat in species composition substantially.

40|$|When {{building}} {{offshore wind}} turbines, a static <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> is typically designed, allowing no movement of top layer stones under design conditions, {{leading to an}} often conservative design. Furthermore, little design guidelines exist for a <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> around a monopile foundation under combined wave and current loading. In part 1 (De Vos et al., 2011), preceding this paper, a static design guideline for a <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> around a monopile is suggested, based on a combined wave and current flow field. By allowing some movement of the top layer stones of the <b>scour</b> <b>protection,</b> a more economical design is obtained. This paper describes the derivation of a dynamic design formula to calculate the required stone size for a <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> around a monopile foundation in a combined wave and current climate. The formula {{is based on the}} results of an experimental model study, described in this paper. The formula gives an expected damage level to the <b>scour</b> <b>protection,</b> based on the wave orbital velocity, wave period, steady current velocity, water depth, relative stone density and stone size.

It will be located in a water depth of 29 m, where tidal currents and harsh wave conditions may cause soil erosion (scour) and possibly undermining of the foundation if not protected properly. Laboratory experiments were conducted in order to investigate the scouring around the foundation and provide an optimized layout for <b>scour</b> <b>protection.</b> This paper summarizes the initial scour assessment, the design approach for <b>scour</b> <b>protection,</b> the experimental set-up, test program, monitoring techniques and results of the experiments. The test results revealed which zones of the <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> around the foundation were most sensitive to shear failure and edge scour. In steps, the <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> was strengthened in these zones and reduced in the more sheltered areas. The tests showed that the magnitude of rock displacement, apart from wave height and direction, was significantly influenced by the superimposed current velocity.

Scouring around the jacket-type foundation exposed to wave and current was conducted in the NSWB with a mobile bed experiment. Two locations (a water depth of 12 m and 16 m) of the foundations are separately simulated in this study.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{offshore}} wind farms is increasing rapidly, leading {{to questions about}} {{the environmental impact of}} such farms. In the Netherlands, an extensive monitoring programme is being executed at the first offshore wind farm (Offshore Windfarm Egmond aan Zee, OWEZ). This letter compiles the short-term (two years) results on a large number of faunal groups obtained so far. Impacts were expected from the new hard substratum, the moving rotor blades, possible underwater noise and the exclusion of fisheries. The results indicate no short-term effects on the benthos in the sandy area between the generators, while the new hard substratum of the monopiles and the <b>scouring</b> <b>protection</b> led to the establishment of new species and new fauna communities. Bivalve recruitment was not impacted by the OWEZ wind farm. Species composition of recruits in OWEZ and the surrounding reference areas is correlated with mud content of the sediment and water depth irrespective the presence of OWEZ. Recruit abundances in OWEZ were correlated with mud content, most likely to be attributed not to the presence of the farm but to the absence of fisheries. The fish community was highly dynamic both in time and space. So far, only minor effects upon fish assemblages especially near the monopiles have been observed. Some fish species, such as cod, seem to find shelter inside the farm. More porpoise clicks were recorded inside the farm than in the reference areas outside the farm. Several bird species seem to avoid the park while others are indifferent or are even attracted. The effects of the wind farm on a highly variable ecosystem are described. Overall, the OWEZ wind farm acts as a new type of habitat with a higher biodiversity of benthic organisms, a possibly increased use of the area by the benthos, fish, marine mammals and some bird species and a decreased use by several other bird specie...|$|R
40|$|The planning, {{the special}} {{development}} work, and {{the installation of}} the foundations for the offshore wind parks North Hoyle in the Irish Sea and Scroby Sands in the North Sea are described. The wind parks comprise each 30 2 MW Vestas V 80 turbines. In both wind parks monopile foundations were used. They were placed in open sea in tidal dominated areas. Water depths were varying from 6 – 20 m. It was decided from the beginning that the foundations should be as standardised as possible even though geotechnical and hydrographic variations were highly variable and that the installation should be quick and simple with few offshore operations. This was done {{in spite of the fact}} that the offshore foundations in a wind park are the only items, which cannot be standardised. Turbines, towers, and cables can be standardised, but the foundation shall connect the highly variable underground and water depth with the standardised turbine component. The North Hoyle foundations were governed by large geological variations – a sand/clay overburden on top of a mudstone/sandstone formation. The Scroby Sands foundations, on the other hand, were governed by large fluctuations in seabed elevations, which annually were up to 3 m. In 25 yrs. they were up to 7 m. In spite of these variations the foundations and components could be standardised to a very high degree. Developments of special transitions, pile/foundation, telescopic j-tubes, and special <b>scour</b> <b>protections</b> were made. Efforts were put into speedy installation.

40|$|As part of {{the energy}} transition, the French {{government}} is planning the construction of three offshore wind farms in Normandy (Bay of Seine and eastern {{part of the}} English Channel, north-western France) in the next years. These offshore wind farms will be integrated into an ecosystem already facing multiple anthropogenic disturbances such as maritime transport, fisheries, oyster and mussel farming, and sediment dredging. Currently no integrated, ecosystem-based study on the effects of the construction and exploitation of offshore wind farms exists, where biological approaches generally focused on the conservation of some valuable species or groups of species. Complementary trophic web modelling tools were applied to the Bay of Seine ecosystem (to the 50 km 2 area covered by the wind farm) to analyse the potential impacts of benthos and fish aggregation caused by the introduction of additional hard substrates from the piles and the turbine <b>scour</b> <b>protections.</b> An Ecopath ecosystem model composed of 37 compartments, from phytoplankton to seabirds, was built to describe the situation “before” the construction of the wind farm.

Our main results showed (1) that the total ecosystem activity, the overall system omnivory (proportion of generalist feeders), and the recycling increased after the construction of the wind farm; (2) that higher trophic levels such as piscivorous fish species, marine mammals, and seabirds responded positively to the aggregation of biomass on piles and turbine scour protections; and (3) a change in keystone groups after the construction towards more structuring and dominant compartments.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{possibilities}} to implement ‘Building with North Sea Nature’ in offshore infrastructures in the North Sea by providing guidelines for the eco-friendly design of <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> structures around monopiles in planned wind farms to enhance ecological functioning. The guidelines include specifications on: The type of hard substrate material or products available and how these can potentially enhance ecological functioning (and have added value compared to regular types used); How different types of hard substrates and configurations can be (experimentally) designed to vary spatially, in such a systematic manner that the effect on ecological enhancement can be determined empirically; How the effects of these <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> structures can be monitored and evaluated; Whether site-specific conditions apply to wind planned farm locations in the Dutch North Sea. Eco-friendly design in this study entails optimising the <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> of offshore wind farms to enhance its ecological functioning. Enhancement of ecological functioning has been defined as: increasing habitat suitability for species (or communities) occurring naturally in the Dutch North Sea, in particular, for policyrelevant (from a conservation perspective) and endangered species, such as those listed in the EU Habitats Directive, OSPAR or national red lists (see Annex 2 in Bos et al. in prep.). Where previous work has explored the more general possibility for enhancement of ecological functioning in offshore wind farms (van Duren et al. 2016; Smaal et al. in prep.), this study provides explicit steps towards realising an eco-friendly design of <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> and a practical field experiment to allow for scientific evaluation. From an analysis of physical conditions in the North Sea that influence both biodiversity and scouring mechanisms at wind farm locations, it is concluded that <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> will be required in most, or all, future offshore wind farms on the Dutch Continental Shelf. It is also concluded that <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> design could be altered to benefit the ecology, but that new designs will require additional testing for anti-scouring effects. Based on a selection of policy-relevant species for the North Sea, two umbrella species were selected: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis). Focussing design variables and principles on these two umbrella species is expected to result in optimising the habitat for a wide range of native hard substrate biodiversity. Based on existing data from current wind farm <b>scour</b> <b>protection,</b> other artificial hard substrates and natural hard substrates from the North Sea, it is hypothesized that an optimised design of <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> will yield increased populations of umbrella species or increased native biodiversity in general, including policy-relevant species. Based on available knowledge on ecological principles and expert judgement of North Sea hard substrate ecologists, four design variables for optimised <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> are defined: 1. Adding larger structures than conventional <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> to create large holes and crevices, to provide adequate shelter / holes for large mobile species. 2. Adding more small-scale structures than conventional <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> to create more small-scale holes and crevices but also attachment substrate and settlement substrate. 3. Providing or mimicking natural (biogenic) chemical substrate properties to facilitate species. An example is to provide chalk-rich substrate such as concrete with added chalk, or even natural substrate such as shell material. 4. Active introduction of specimens of target species to enhance establishment of new populations. This is to facilitate recruitment at locations where reproduction by naturally occurring adults is These design variables are made practically applicable by providing example materials and specifications for implementation in the field and, a cost overview is provided for example materials. Combining the above information, this study provides design guidelines for wind farms with optimised <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> to enhance ecological functioning. In addition it defines a minimum and a standardized approach for deployment and monitoring of a subset of locations to allow for scientific evaluation. The monitoring techniques that are required to do so, are described and a cost estimate for the monitoring is provided. In conclusion, this study provides eco-friendly design principles for <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> and a first experimental design to implement ‘Building with North Sea Nature’: ecological enhancement by optimising <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> in offshore wind farms. This is considered as a first step in a process that should result in ‘learning by doing’...|$|E
40|$|Monopile {{foundations}} is {{the most}} popular foundation type for offshore wind turbines, with over 80 % of the substructures being monopile foundations. When placed in a marine environment monopiles is prone to scour around the pile. This can influence the eigenfrequency of the wind turbine, which is a major design driver. To prevent scouring it is possible to place <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> around the pile, normally consisting of a filter and armor layer. The effect of <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> has been investigated with a 3 D-FEM analysis in Plaxis with a real size model with characteristic properties for a monopile pile placed in sand. Hardeing Soil Small (HSS) soil model has been used for the sand. The results from the simulations have been used to calculate p-y curves representing the soil response along the pile. Three different cases have been investigated, 1) a benchmark case without <b>scour</b> <b>protection,</b> 2) <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> as surface load and 3) a full <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> layer. The lateral load on the monopile were divided into 5 load steps, 10 kN, 100 kN, 1000 kN, 2000 kN and 5000 kN. Also, a simple 1 -DOF approximation has been used to compare the eigenfrequencies of the three cases. The results from the simulations show a 1 % increase in eigenfrequency for the case with surface load at load step 100 kN and the case with a full <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> layer show 10 % increase in eigenfrequency. Also, a comparison with DNV/API design codes for p-y curves have been done for the benchmark case, giving a good match for shallow depths, but for larger depths the DNV/API formulations give higher stiffness.

The development of a <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> system at Poole Harbour in Dorset has been documented and reviewed and a series of laboratory investigations were then undertaken. This has enabled a greater understanding of the scour mechanisms from the water jet propulsion systems of High Speed Ships. This work has shown that current design guidance on <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> is not appropriate for use on berths used by High Speed Ships, that failure of these systems can occur rapidly and catastrophically, and secondary effects from water jets may promote the failure of quay walls. The <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> system should comprise two individual elements, a filter layer and an armour layer. It has been found that systems involving individual isolated armour units are inappropriate and prone to failure and that shaped linked armour blocks need to be used. The loads on the armour layer were also found to be oscillatory and the materials used for both the armour and filter layers need to be designed for cyclic fatigue loading and fretting.

A method for predicting the damage risk of bridge structures during multiple floods is presented. The {{risk of flood damage}} is studied from the viewpoint of scouring. The method is based on two approaches to scour calculation: (1) determination of the scour development in time during multiple floods and (2) determination of the designed equilibrium depth of scour. Using these two methods, we suggest estimating the factor of flood damage risk as a ratio between the scour depth calculated during/after multiple floods and the designed equilibrium scour depth. Under critical conditions, when the scour depth calculated in floods is close to the designed equilibrium stage of scour for bridge foundations, emergency protection measures should be taken to avoid the failure of bridge structures...|$|R
40|$|The Adriatic LNG {{terminal}} is a liquefied {{natural gas}} offshore terminal located about 17 km {{off the coast of}} Rovigo, Italy in the northern Adriatic, where the water depth is approximately 29 m. <b>Scour</b> <b>protection</b> was needed around the GBS and the mooring dolphins to prevent the bed material under them from washing out. This paper presents a description of the <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> design for the GBS and the mooring dolphins. The paper will first present the design criteria and the design approach. The dynamic stability approach, which has been developed in the recent years, was applied. This approach allows the profile of the armor rock to deform, but damage (loss of rocks from the <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> system) must be very limited under the specified design environmental conditions. Particular aspects influencing the design of the <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> in this case are the use of skirts and the composition of the upper layers of the seabed. The paper will further highlight the way in which existing data and physical modeling were used to arrive at the final design. In particular it will be demonstrated that this is an effective way to carry out the design and that the adaptations of the final design developed and tested during the physical model tests are important. Finally, the paper will present the final design obtained. Copyright 9 2011 by ASME. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|A 1 : 36 {{scale model}} tests {{were carried out}} in the Medium Wave Flume (MWF) and Near-shore Wave Basin (NSWB) at the Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory (THL) with the jacket type {{offshore}} wind turbine foundation located in the test area. The loading of typhoon wave with current on the jacket type offshore wind turbine foundation was investigated in the MWF with fixed bed experiment. Meanwhile, the scour around the jacket type offshore wind turbine foundation exposed to wave and current was conducted in the NSWB with the moveable bed experiment. Two locations (water depth 12 m and 16 m) of the foundations are separately simulated in this study. Based on the analysis from the former NSWB experimental results, the suitable <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> of a four-layer work around the foundation is also proposed to the impact of scour. Finally, a four-layer <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> is tested and found to be effective in preventing scour around jacket type foundation of offshore wind turbines at water depth 12 m and 16 m...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Study of {{the flow}} field around the large scale {{offshore}} structures un-der the action of waves and viscous currents is of primary importance for the <b>scouring</b> estimation and <b>protection</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the structures. But very little has been known in its mechanism when the viscous effects is taken into consideration. As a part of the efforts to tackle the problem, a numerical model is presented for the sim-ulation {{of the flow}} field around a fixed vertical truncated circular cylinder subjected to waves and viscous currents based on the depth-averaged Reynolds equations and depth-averaged k-e turbulence model. Finite difference method with a suitable iter-ation defect correct method and an artificial open boundary condition are adopted in the numerical process. Numerical results presented relate to the interactions of a pure incident viscous current with Reynolds number Re = 105, a pure incident reg-ular sinusoidal wave, and the coexisting of viscous current and wave with a circular cylinder, respectively. Flow fields associated with the hydrodynamic coefficients of the fixed cylinder, as well as corresponding free surface profiles and wave amplitudes, are discussed. The present method is found to be relatively straightforward, com-putationally effective and numerically stable for treating the problem of interactions among waves, viscous currents and bodies.

40|$|The growing {{tendency}} of sustainable building and development is transforming {{the way in}} which construction projects are faced. These changes are saving the natural environment, as well as, minimising the quantity of industrial waste. In line with this initiative, the following project studies the potential recovery of Electric Arc Furnace Slag and its use as material fill in gabion cages. From a sustainability point of view, the recovery of steel slag is positive from all perspectives. (a) Economically: steel slag is cheaper in comparison to natural rock considering that it {{does not need to be}} mined and if used steel companies do not have to pay a disposal tax. (b) Environmentally: natural resources are spared and space is being reserved in landfills. (c) Socially: steel slag is thought to have a low potential impact on human health and the environment. The focus on gabion cages was chosen as the stability of the structure relies on the density of the material used to fill the metal cages. Additionally, gabion cages should be promoted as a sustainable solution to <b>scour</b> and erosion <b>protection,</b> as well as, retaining walls. These structures blend in with the environment and can even create a habitat for wildlife. In order to verify this application, technical and environmental aspects have to be considered. A series of leaching tests, based on the developing European harmonised framework, have been carried out to determine the environmental impact of EAF Slag. Basic characterisation tests were used to determine the main leaching mechanisms of EAF Slag, whereas, conformity test verify the release of constituents in comparison with the limits defined by legislation...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the next}} decades the {{construction}} of thousands {{of different types of}} large wind turbine foundations in the North Sea will substantially increase the amount of habitat available to reef fauna. To gain first insights which effect these substantial changes in habitat structure and diversity might have on faunal stocks settling on hard substrata, we compared the mobile demersal megafauna associated with the common types of wind turbine foundations ('jacket', 'tripod' and 'monopile with scour protections of natural rock') in the southern German Bight, North Sea. Monopiles with <b>scour</b> <b>protection</b> were mostly colonized by typical reef fauna. They were inhabited by an average of about 5000 edible crabs Cancer pagurus (per foundation), which is {{more than twice as much}} as found at the foundation types without <b>scour</b> <b>protection.</b> Strong evidence was found that all three foundation types not only function as aggregation sites, but also as nursery grounds for C. pagurus. Assuming equal shares of the three foundation types in future wind farms, we project that about 27...|$|E
