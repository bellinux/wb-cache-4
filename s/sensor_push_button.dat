40|$|This final {{project was}} aimed {{to build a}} model of Air Conditioning Equipment Pond Fish Spawning ATmega 8 microcontroller-based. This device was {{expected}} to function to assist community fish farmers in fish spawning process that requires setting the water temperature automatically. This tool was developed in several stages namely, (1) Identification of Needs, (2) Needs Analysis, (3) System Design, (4) Hardware Design, (5) Software Design, (6) Technical Operations, and (7) Testing Equipment. The design of this tool is realized by combining several systems of power supply circuit, LM 35 temperature <b>sensor,</b> <b>push</b> <b>button,</b> the LCD 16 x 2 lines, the control circuit and microcontroller ATmega 8 as processing units. Software design as a control program in this ATmega 8 microcontroller used C language and compiler software CVAVR as his. The testing of this tool is by entering the LM 35 temperature sensor into the water. LM 35 sensor output {{was connected to the}} ATmega 8 microcontroller ADC input for processing into digital numbers for controlling the cooling elements and heating elements. If the water temperature is less than the minimum limit has been determined, then the cooling element will be on. If the water temperature is more than the maximum limit specified, then the heating element will be on. If the water temperature between the minimum and maximum temperature within the limits specified temperature, the cooling elements and heating elements will be off. The tool also displayed the temperature value into the LCD in accordance detected by the temperature sensor. After testing the data, it can be concluded that this tool can work in accordance with the plan. This tool can adjust the water temperature range 0 ° C to 40 ° C with a volume of 2 liters of water...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the tragedy}} at the Fukushima nuclear {{facility}} after the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, {{the nuclear industry}} has issued a request for proposal to design and build a small remotely controlled device. This device {{would be used to}} inspect buildings that may otherwise be determined as dangerous and unsafe. The device contains a camera that is able to view the vehicles path. This way the vehicle can be controlled without actually having {{to be in the same}} building. The device also has an arm that is able to grab items. The purpose of the arm is to be able to place radiation sensors and also to pick them up and return them to the operator. This device has been constructed and will be tested at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Design Competition. There will be a course that the vehicle will run that includes picking up a wooden dowel that will represent a radiation <b>sensor,</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>buttons,</b> and reading text on the ground using the camera alone. The text represents a sensor reading that an actual radiation inspecting device would be able to read that would allow the operator to know if the building is safe or unsafe.

The PCA 9535 A is a pin-to-pin replacement to the PCA 9535 and other industry-standard devices. A more fully featured device, the PCAL 9535 A, is available with Agile I/O features. See the respective data sheet for more details. The PCA 9535 A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the system master that an input state has changed. INT can {{be connected to the}} interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its ports without having to communicate via the I 2 C-bus.
