500|$|Hull {{expressed}} {{a strong desire}} to retain Campbell's services for the 2008–09 season, with Hull chairman, Paul Duffen, describing Campbell as [...] "too good for the Championship". Following his successes leading to their promotion, Hull were hoping to secure either a permanent move or another season-long loan, depending on Manchester United's willingness to let him go. However, Campbell repeatedly expressed the desire to return to Old Trafford and try to break into the first team, saying [...] "Now I'm back at United, the plan is to try to force my way into the first team." [...] He added, [...] "I'm going to continue to work hard and try to do enough to <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> go on from there." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} about the [...] "rebirthing" [...] scene, Kit Harington {{said that it}} intended to mirror the Daenerys Targaryen scene {{at the end of}} the third-season episode [...] "Mhysa" [...] when Daenerys is held up by freed Yunkai slaves; in [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Jon Snow emerges from the crushing crowd of the battle: [...] "When the crush starts happening, he slows down, and there's that thing of peace where he thinks: 'I could just <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> let it all end.' And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again, which I found weirdly reflective of the scene where Dany is held aloft at the end of season three." ...|$|E
500|$|Tin Toy gained Disney's attention, and the {{new team}} at The Walt Disney Company—CEO Michael Eisner and {{chairman}} Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division —began a quest to get Lasseter to come back. Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder Ed Catmull, [...] "I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> make history." [...] Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film. Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when Tim Burton, {{who used to work}} at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare Before Christmas, Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.|$|E

500|$|Interviewed by the Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Haaretz {{about the fact}} that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: [...] "The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticize the policy of the State of Israel – just as we are allowed to criticize any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist". She has opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: [...] "The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of radical Islam in the problematic regions".|$|E

2500|$|During November–December 1884, Gordon's diary {{showed the}} {{stressful}} {{effects of the}} siege, {{as he was in}} a state of mental exhaustion, a man on the brink of madness. In his final months Gordon oscillated between a longing for martyrdom and death versus an intense horror at the prospect of his own demise as the hour of his destruction rapidly approached. Even if the relief force had reached him, it is not clear if he would have left Khartoum, as Gordon wrote in his diary: [...] "If any emissary or letter comes up here ordering me to come down I WILL NOT OBEY IT, BUT WILL <b>STAY</b> <b>HERE,</b> <b>AND</b> FALL WITH THE TOWN!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, Robeson {{was called}} before HUAC after {{he refused to}} sign an {{affidavit}} affirming {{that he was not}} a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, [...] "because my father was a slave and my people died to build , I am going to <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> have a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!" [...] At that hearing, Robeson stated [...] "Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights." [...] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town Hall sold out within an hour, and Wales via the transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1: [...] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing".|$|E
