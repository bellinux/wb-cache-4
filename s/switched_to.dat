30|$|Figure  6 c {{shows the}} average occurrences of channel {{switching}} by CR users, {{again for the}} small topology.

The results indicate that our proposed approach can keep the occurrences of channel switching lower and converge to an optimal solution.|$|R

30|$|As {{the source}} nodes are {{distributed}} centrally, the mobile sink needs {{to move toward}} the event area as close as possible such that the total length of the sensory data transmission is reduced and the energy consumption is decreased. Before the moving belts <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> another column or row, the mobile sink first compares Chorizontal(1), Chorizontal(2), and Chorizontal(3). If Chorizontal(1) has the largest value, the transverse moving belt <b>switches</b> <b>to</b> a neighbor row above. If Chorizontal(3) has the largest value, the transverse moving belt <b>switches</b> <b>to</b> a neighbor row below. If Chorizontal(2) is the largest, or two of three counters are equal, or all three counters are equal, the transverse moving belt does not <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> another row. Similarly, the mobile sink compares Cvertical(1), Cvertical(2) and Cvertical(3). If Cvertical(1) has the largest value, the longitudinal moving belt <b>switches</b> <b>to</b> a neighbor column on the right. If Cvertical(3) is the largest, the longitudinal moving belt <b>switches</b> <b>to</b> a neighbor column on the left. In other cases, the longitudinal moving belt does not <b>switch.</b> According <b>to</b> this strategy, the mobile sink can get closer to the event area.|$|R
