5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E

50|$|For {{the optical}} watch, {{at the lower}} level (veille basse), for close sea targets, there were three lookout {{positions}} port and starboard, on the first deck abeam the bridge. For aerial targets, the middle lookout station (veille moyenne) was on platform 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward tower, having five lookouts on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Against mines and torpedoes, the upper lookout station (veille haute) was on platform 8 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward tower, with five lookouts on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mounted on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> <b>the</b> 8-pounders {{reinforced}} <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broadside.

5|$|Minas Geraes and São Paulo were {{originally}} armed with twelve 12-inch/45 caliber, twenty-two 4.7-inch/50 caliber, eighteen 3-pounders and eight 1-pounder naval guns. The main battery was arranged with four superfiring turrets, two each fore and aft, and two placed en echelon. The 4.7-inch secondary guns {{were placed in}} casemates along the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> five feet above the main battery deck, and caused {{a number of small}} fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move from one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E

5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from Bismarck. This would have blown out the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} December attack, Timothy Bloodworth was at anchor in Antwerp {{later in the}} month {{awaiting}} a New York-bound convoy. At about 14:10 on 24 December, a German V-2 rocket exploded overhead, showering the ship with shrapnel. A short time later, a second rocket hit nearby and more fragments pelted the ship, this time damaging the starboard <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> at the number one cargo hold. Although Timothy Bloodworth had a total of 68 people aboard—8 officers, 33 crewmen, 26 Armed Guard, and 1 passenger—no one was injured in either attack. Authors Benjamin King and Timothy J. Kutta, in their book Impact: The History of Germany's V-Weapons in World War II, report that Timothy Bloodworth was the first ship {{to be hit by}} V-2 fragments during the war.|$|E

50|$|The Katori-class {{battleship}} Kashima had {{a secondary}} armament of four single-gun turrets positioned on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> superstructure. In Japanese service these guns were know as 10-inch/45 Type 41 naval guns.|$|R
50|$|A {{favorite}} rendezvous of many Nieuw Amsterdam passengers was {{the handsome}} First Class Smoking Room with its rich Circassian walnut paneling and deep, luxurious armchairs and settees.

5|$|Leeboard: To avoid leeward drift {{caused by}} the force of wind while sailing, the {{leeboard}} was invented; it was a board lowered onto the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> opposite to the direction of the wind, helping the ship to stay upright and on course. Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that an odd-looking second paddle on a bronze drum of the Dong Son culture (centered in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam) may depict a leeboard in use as early as 300 BC. Leeboards may have been invented in China as early as the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty and are featured shortly after in 9th century engraved artwork found at the Borobudur monument built during the Sailendra dynasty of Central Java (Indonesia). Leeboards were first used in the West by the Dutch, during the 15th to 16th centuries (possibly used on early Dutch cogs, or perhaps influenced by a Chinese origin).|$|E
5|$|The first udema {{was built}} in 1760 and had two masts (mainmast and foremast) that were {{originally}} rigged with lateen sails. It was later provided with a square sail rig {{similar to that of}} a polacca bark without topgallant sails. It had a low hull with a small quarterdeck structure and an arrangement of guns that was unique for its time. Its main armament consisted of a single line of eight 12-pound guns along the centerline of the ship and two 12-pounders in the bow facing forwards. The centerline guns used pivoting carriages that could be rotated 360 degrees and aimed to either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> similar to the main guns of the dreadnought battleships of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> being covered with human heads bobbing {{up and down like}} corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
50|$|All {{cargo tank}} vapour spaces are linked via a vapour header which runs {{parallel}} to the cargo header. This also has connections to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> next to <b>the</b> loading and discharging manifolds.|$|R
60|$|The stage sailor {{seems to}} have an easy time of it when at sea. The hardest work we have ever seen him do then has been folding up a rope or dusting <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
50|$|In warships, a breastwork is {{the armored}} {{superstructure}} in <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{that did not}} extend {{all the way out}} to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> It was generally only used in ironclad turret ships designed between 1865 and 1880.|$|R
5|$|On board Arctic, disquiet turned {{increasingly}} into panic as {{it became}} clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate. Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve women and five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew. In the general melee the boat was upended, sending all but three of its occupants into the water, where they drowned. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the stern, where women and children passengers would be passed down. No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed by men, who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up women and children, and drifted away. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter boat had been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.|$|E
5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. It {{was most}} likely based on the weapon used in the United States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ° range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ° on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be ° on their sides. The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E
5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> needed to be armored, even though this would limit {{the thickness of the}} main belt. They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals. This system likely would have worked against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt.|$|E

50|$|In modern warfare, {{boarding}} {{by military}} forces may involve <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> small submarines or submersibles, inflatable boats or helicopters to carry troops to <b>the</b> deck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> or {{may simply be}} carried out by scuba divers scaling <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> entire <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prince Consort-class <b>ships,</b> from <b>the</b> upper-deck level downwards, was {{protected}} by wrought iron armour that tapered from [...] at the ends to [...] amidships.

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered {{on the street or}} stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered {{before the end of the}} diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E
50|$|Vista class ships had an {{external}} observation lift mid-ship on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> a wider forward and aft deck-width and a tiered forward {{section on the}} passenger cabin decks. Vista class also tend to have an additional upper deck just forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funnel.|$|R
