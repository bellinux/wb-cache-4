5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to {{separate}} the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution. UEFA also requested that fences be put up {{around the perimeter of}} the pitch. The riots did not spread to the stadium, although there was an attempt to pull down the fences by fans heading towards the Arsenal area of the stadium before police <b>stopped</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bellas began feuding with Eve Torres {{after they}} {{appeared}} as lumberjills during a Divas Championship match between Torres and Natalya on the February 14 episode of Raw. Following the match, they attacked Torres backstage before Gail Kim and Natalya <b>stopped</b> <b>them.</b> The next week, the twins defeated Torres and Kim in a tag team match. The following week, Nikki won a battle royal {{to become the}} number one contender for the Divas Championship, and unsuccessfully challenged Torres for the championship on March 7.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept {{him away from the}} corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster <b>stopped</b> <b>them,</b> but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E

5|$|Before dawn on August 17, {{troops from}} both the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, {{supported}} by A Company of the 70th Tank Battalion, attacked Hill 303, but heavy North Korean mortar fire <b>stopped</b> <b>them</b> {{at the edge of}} Waegwan. During the morning, American artillery heavily bombarded the North Korean positions on the hill. Throughout the morning of August 17 the North Korean guards exchanged fire with U.S. troops attempting to rescue the prisoners. Around 12:00 the North Korean unit holding the Americans placed them in a gully on the hill with a light company of 50 guards. Several more American prisoners were added to the group during the day, bringing the number of prisoners on Hill 303 to 45. One survivor estimated that the total number of prisoners was 67, and that the balance of the prisoners were executed on August 15 or 16.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 April, South Vietnamese forces {{reported}} hearing the sound of tanks moving toward {{the southern end of}} the district airfield. At about 5:30 am, the Viet Cong launched another attack from southern Lộc Ninh, with the support of about 25 T-54 and PT-76 tanks. Viet Cong infantry initially managed to breach the South Vietnamese lines, but the attack soon stalled, and neither side gained a clear advantage. In the afternoon, elements of the Viet Cong E6 Regiment forced their way through the compound gates, but air strikes from U.S. AC-130s <b>stopped</b> <b>them</b> from advancing any further. By that stage, however, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment had absorbed a significant number of casualties; it only had 50 soldiers left, while another 150 wounded were in the hospital bunker. The defenders in Lộc Ninh were cut off from outside help since heavy-calibre North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns effectively prevented resupply and medivac flights into the area.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an opportunity was lost on 5 August to encircle and capture the invading Austrian, German and Ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to Katia. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, <b>stopped</b> <b>them</b> from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force {{in the early hours of}} the second day's battle. General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani. That the strong enemy attack on the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades during the first night's battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade became almost a frontal attack. Lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at Kantara, which was considered to be too far from the battlefield, and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day, when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with Romani. Lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on 5 August, when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui {{remained}} understrength. Half of {{the force}} had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies {{to hold the line}} with a handful of replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south road of Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet and delay the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement through the morning fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into the fog until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, <b>stopped</b> <b>them.</b> At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 the fog began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.|$|E
5|$|The Tang {{capital was}} the largest {{city in the world}} at its time, the {{population}} of the city wards and its suburban countryside reaching 2 million inhabitants. The Tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of Persia, Central Asia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, India, and many other places living within. Naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in Chang'an, there were also many different practiced religions, such as Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Islam being practiced within. With widely open access to China that the Silk Road to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to China, while the city of Chang'an itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within. Exotic green-eyed, blonde-haired Tocharian ladies serving wine in agate and amber cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers. If a foreigner in China pursued a Chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in China and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys. Several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs in the capital, Chang'an, to wear their ethnic dress, <b>stopped</b> <b>them</b> from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from passing off as Chinese.|$|E

25|$|The {{fighting}} styles were Powerhouse, Showman, Hardcore, Dirty, Brawler, High-Flyer, Submission and Technical.

For example, Carlito and Chavo Guerrero {{did not have}} the ability to perform any of their springboard attacks, and Mr. McMahon was as strong as some of the larger characters in the game.
