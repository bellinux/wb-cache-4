50|$|Masataka Murata (extra=October 5, 1884 - December 20, 1974) was a Japanese physician. He {{invented a}} Murata's method for the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of syphilis, and studied leprosy.

After the Sotojima Incident, in which communists were against religious societies, he resigned {{as the director of}} the sanatorium. Later, he personally studied leprosy at his house, and died in 1974.|$|E
50|$|In 1884, he {{was born}} in Kōchi Prefecture. When he was {{studying}} laws, he was interested in leprosy since a woman he knew developed leprosy. He asked Kensuke Mitsuda for advice, and studied medicine at Tokyo University following his advice. He worked in the Institute of Infectious Diseases and invented the Murata's method for <b>serodiagnosis</b> of syphilis. In 1926 he assumed the post of the director of Osaka Prefectural Sotojima Sanatorium. In 1928, {{he was one of the}} founders of the Japanese Leprosy Association, together with Kensuke Mitsuda.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} serologic tests have been {{employed}} for {{the diagnosis of}} paracoccidioidomycosis. Double diffusion in agar gel and complement fixation test, are amongst {{the most commonly used}} tests in <b>serodiagnosis.</b> Culture extracts of the yeast or mycelia are exploited to produce effective, quick, and reproducible antigens. A study reported detection of 43 kD antigen in pooled sera of affected individuals, which might provide a basis {{for the development of a}} diagnostic test. Tests targeting the presence of serum antibodies to P. brasiliensis simultaneously detect both active and historical infections and cannot descriminate active infection. The evaluation of populations in endemic zones has shown roughly equal rates of seroconversion between men and women, suggesting equal rates of exposure, despite the strong male predominance shown by the clinical disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{major change}} {{was brought in}} the Virology department. The newly {{constructed}} structure of the building was fully changed and converted into a purpose built laboratory. The office space was created. The serum bank area, Viral <b>serodiagnosis</b> lab, Molecular Biology laboratory and laboratory sterilization areas were added. The department has a new shape. The expansion of the space led to mobility and freedom of work and increased the efficiency. The new gadgets, computers, telephonic connections and working areas were added in the department. During his tenure, the freedom of thoughts, acceptance of new ideas and an improvisation remained the priorities. The quick decision were made and the sudden expansion in the quality work was absorbed. The working of the LIMS was reviewed and innovations were introduced into it. The plan for the Forensic Lab was followed and the work started on it. After a long time the officers were encouraged to receive training from abroad and attend the conferences and make presentations. During his tenure, the earthquake struck the north of Pakistan and the Azad Kashmir. All laboratories and pathology service had disappeared there.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{reference}} method for detecting specific Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies is indirect immunofluorescence (IF) with EBV-infected cells. The availability of protein purified from infected cells {{and more recently}} of recombinant polypeptides designed to contain immunodominant epitopes, has enabled the development of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the specific <b>serodiagnosis</b> of EBV infection. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of ELISA-based EBV <b>serodiagnosis</b> in comparison with indirect immunofluorescence. STUDY DESIGN: We have first compared three commercial ELISA test systems with our in house indirect immunofluorescence assay for classifying correctly a set of serum samples into clinical categories (acute infection, past infection, interfering non-EBV infection, persistent infection). Additionally a prospective analysis with the best performing ELISA test (Enzygnost) was then carried out by running the ELISA test in parallel with the indirect immunofluorescence assay on 324 consecutive clinical samples sent to our laboratory for EBV <b>serodiagnosis.</b> RESULTS: For the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of past EBV infection and acute EBV infection all three commercial ELISAs performed well in comparison with indirect immunofluorescence. When testing samples positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Toxoplasma or herpes simplex IgM, interference in the IgM tests was observed with the three ELISAs. In some instances we could demonstrate that the positive IgM results were due to EBV reactivation. The observed discrepancies between ELISA and IF for the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of chronic EBV infection or EBV reactivation, point to the difficulty for the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of persistent EBV infection on single serum samples. According to our prospective study the EBV IgG determination was accurate. A positive IgM result was not always indicative of an acute infection. Positive IgM results due to EBV reactivation were observed. A positive EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG result in those samples precluded acute infection. CONCLUSIONS: 90 - 95 % of samples could be classified correctly into clinical categories by a two parameter ELISA system detecting IgG and IgM against a standardized mixture of EBV antigens, allowing standardization and automation of EBV-specific serology. The absence of EBNA IgG was useful as a second line confirmatory assay for acute EBV infection. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ELISA and RIFI are {{currently}} used for <b>serodiagnosis</b> of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). The accuracy {{of these tests}} is controversial in endemic areas where canine infections by Trypanosoma cruzi may occur. We evaluated the usefulness of synthetic peptides that were selected through phage display technique in the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of CVL. Peptides were chosen based {{on their ability to}} bind to IgGs purified from infected dogs pooled sera. We selected three phage clones that reacted only with those IgGs. Peptides were synthesized, polymerized with glutaraldehyde, and used as antigens in ELISA assays. Each individual peptide or a mix of them was reactive with infected dogs serum. The assay was highly sensitive and specific when compared to soluble Leishmania antigen that showed cross-reactivity with anti-T. cruzi IgGs.

40|$|Diagnosis {{of human}} toxocariasis, caused by Toxocara canis or Toxocara cati, {{normally}} {{relies on a}} combination of the presence of clinical signs and symptoms backed by positive serology. The use of Toxocara excretory-secretory antigen (TES) in ELISA assays increases the test specificity. However, in tropical countries where soil-transmitted helminths are endemic, cross-reactivity from antibodies to these intestinal parasites poses a significant limitation for Toxocara <b>serodiagnosis.</b> To increase the specificity of <b>serodiagnosis,</b> we compared the use of IgG-ELISA to the use of IgG 4 -ELISA using commercially manufactured TES-coated plates. The sensitivity of the IgG-ELISA was 97. 1, while that of the lgG 4 -ELISA was 45. 7; the specificities were 36. 0 and 78. 6, respectively. The study shows that employing both assays can improve the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of toxocariasis. An IgG 4 immunoassay would also be useful in the secondary screening of antigen clones in the effort to develop improved serological tests for toxocariasis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The serologic assay is an {{important}} tool in the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. One {{of the most commonly}} used tests is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Since total Leishmania promastigotes are used as antigen in the routine assay, false-positive reactions are frequent due to cross-reaction with sera from other diseases, mainly Chagas' disease. Therefore, an antigen that determines less cross-reactivity has been pursued for the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of leishmaniasis. In the present study we analyzed the use of recombinant Leishmania infantum heat shock protein (Hsp) 83 in ELISA for the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of cutaneous (N = 12) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (N = 14) and we observed the presence of anti-L. infantum Hsp 83 antibodies in all samples as well as anti-Leishmania total antigen antibodies. When cross-reactivity was tested, chronic Chagas' disease patients (N = 10) did not show any reactivity. Therefore, we consider this L. infantum Hsp 83 to be a good antigen for routine use for <b>serodiagnosis</b> of tegumentary leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with crude {{extracts}} {{of adult}} Clonorchis sinensis {{has been reported}} to have a high degree of sensitivity with a moderate degree of specificity for the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of clonorchiasis. The cystatin capture ELISA was investigated for its usefulness for the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of human clonorchiasis. Cystatin bound specifically to cysteine proteinases in crude extracts of adult C. sinensis worms, and its binding capacity was not hindered competitively by the other proteinase inhibitors tested. The cystatin capture ELISA for clonorchiasis showed a higher degree of specificity than the conventional ELISA, which produced some cross-reactivities to sera from patients with cysticercosis, sparganosis, and opisthorchiasis. Immunoglobulin G antibodies to C. sinensis cysteine proteinases were produced in experimental rabbits at week 3, and their levels increased rapidly and remained at a plateau after 8 weeks of infection. Of the proteins from the C. sinensis crude extract captured with cystatin, seven proteins were reactive with the serum from patients with clonorchiasis. The cystatin capture ELISA is indicated to be a sensitive and highly specific immunodiagnostic assay for <b>serodiagnosis</b> of human clonorchiasis...|$|E
40|$|In several studies, {{different}} antigenic preparations {{and diverse}} immunological tests were applied for <b>serodiagnosis</b> of Fasciola hepatica infections.

Here, we used fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) -fractionated extracts of F. hepatica excretory/secretory antigens (E/S Ags) for <b>serodiagnosis</b> {{of human and}} sheep fasciolosis. To develop an improved diagnostic method, we fractionated F. hepatica E/S Ags by anion exchange chromatography on a Sepharose CL- 6 B column and then tested the serodiagnostic values of the fractions. We used sera from F. hepatica-infected human and sheep as positive controls. Sera from patients with hydatidosis and strongyloidiasis were used for cross-reactivity studies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of the second FPLC peak, containing 20, 25, and 70 kDa proteins, discriminated between F. hepatica-infected and uninfected human and sheep samples.

40|$|Genes for {{flagellin}} A (FlaA) proteins from European borrelial {{strains of}} Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii were cloned and sequenced. An identity of 92 to 93 % {{was observed in}} the flaA sequences of the different species. Polyhistidine-tagged recombinant FlaA (rFlaA) proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and used as antigens in Western blotting (WB) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In immunoglobulin G (IgG) WB, 71 % (10 of 14) of the sera from neuroborreliosis and 86 % (12 of 14) of those from Lyme arthritis patients reacted with one to three rFlaAs. In IgG ELISA, 74 % (14 of 19) and 79 % (15 of 19) of patients with neuroborreliosis and arthritis, respectively, were positive. The immunoreactivity in local European patient sera was stronger against rFlaA from B. garinii and B. afzelii than against rFlaA from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Neither IgG nor IgM ELISA was sensitive in the <b>serodiagnosis</b> of erythema migrans. Serum samples from patients with syphilis and systemic lupus erythematosus showed mild cross-reactivity in IgG tests.

40|$|Indirect {{hemagglutination}} (IHA) {{is commonly}} used for <b>serodiagnosis</b> of melioidosis. However, in endemic areas, high background titers in normal populations and occasional low titers in patients with septicemic melioidosis prompted {{a search for a}} more sensitive and more specific method of <b>serodiagnosis.</b> An indirect fluorescent-antibody test for immunoglobulin M (IgM) specific antibody to Pseudomonas pseudomallei was more sensitive and more specific, but fluorescence microscopes are rarely available in the endemic areas. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM antibody is an attractive alternative. An indirect ELISA for IgM antibody (IgM ELISA) and an IgM antibody capture ELISA for melioidosis were developed. Both tests, together with IHA, were evaluated for 153 serum specimens from blood donors and 16 serum specimens from 16 melioidosis patients. It was found that IHA, the IgM ELISA, and the IgM antibody capture ELISA had sensitivities of 88, 88, and 75 %, respectively, with specificities of 97. 4, 92. 2, and 91. 5 %, respectively.

In this study, the usefulness of an anti-TBGL antibody assay kit for rapid <b>serodiagnosis</b> was evaluated in a controlled multicenter study. Antibody titers in sera from 318 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (216 positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in smear and/or culture tests and 102 smear and culture negative and clinically diagnosed), 58 patients with old tuberculosis, 177 patients with other respiratory diseases, 156 patients with nonrespiratory diseases, and 454 healthy subjects were examined. Sera from 256 younger healthy subjects from among the 454 healthy subjects were examined as a control. When the cutoff point of anti-TBGL antibody titer was determined as 2. 0 U/ml, the sensitivity for active tuberculosis patients was 81. 1 % and the specificity was 95. 7 %.

SDS-PAGE and "Western-blotting" revealed at least 10 different antigenic components common to the two antigen preparations. However, distinct qualitative and quantitative differences among the two E/S-antigens were observed, since one antigen had a more complex composition than the other. Despite these differences, an accordance of <b>serodiagnosis</b> was obtained in 80 % of 25 sera from patients with suspected Toxocara infection tested independently in two different ELISA systems (Basel and Zürich) with the corresponding E/S-antigens. The specificity was 93 % as determined (BS-antigen, BS-ELISA) by testing 46 out of 3396 sera from patients with parasitologically proven extra-intestinal helminthic infections. Cross-reactions occurred mainly with sera from patients infected with filariae (5 from 13 cases) exhibiting very high extinction values in their homologous ELISA-system. The reproducibility (intra- and inter-test variations) of two ELISA systems using the corresponding E/S-antigens varied from 5 - 15 %.
