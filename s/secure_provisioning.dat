40|$|Cloud {{computing}} has {{revolutionized the}} IT industry by enabling a virtualized resource provisioning model for organizations. The Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) provisioning model enables {{new ways of}} providing virtually isolated and on-demand networking capabilities in existing cloud provisioning models, resulting in best-effort performance, scalable data throughput, reduced latency, and reduced configuration complexity. In this paper we propose V 2 C, an elastic Vehicle-to-Cloud infrastructure that integrates NaaS into the automotive ecosystem and enables provisioning of vehicle-based services for automobile users. However, V 2 C introduces various security challenges and the main objective {{of this paper is}} to propose a <b>secure</b> <b>provisioning</b> model to address them...|$|E
40|$|Securely storing {{and using}} {{credentials}} {{is critical for}} ensuring the security of many modern distributed applications. Existing approaches {{to address this problem}} fall short. User memorizable passwords are flexible and cheap, but they suffer from bad usability. On the other hand, dedicated hardware tokens provide high levels of security, but the logistics of manufacturing and provisioning smartcards are expensive, which makes it unattractive for most service providers. Several types of generalpurpose secure hardware, like TPM and M-shield, are becoming widely deployed. These platforms enable, to different degrees, a strongly isolated secure environment. In this report, we describe how we use general-purpose secure hardware to develop a platform for credentials which we call OnBoard Credentials (ObCs). ObCs combine the flexibility of virtual credentials with the higher levels of protection due to the use of secure hardware. Besides secure storage and execution the ObC architecture supports <b>secure</b> <b>provisioning</b> of both credential algorithms and secrets. The architecture is widely applicable and in this report we describe prototype implementations for three different platforms: an M-shield enabled mobile phone, a TPM-based Linux PC, and a mobile Linux tablet with para-virtualization...|$|E

40|$|A mapping {{exercise}} {{as part of}} a pathway study of women in secure psychiatric services in the England and Wales was conducted. It aimed to (i) establish the extent and range of <b>secure</b> service <b>provision</b> for women nationally and (ii) establish the present and future care needs and pathways of care of women mentally disordered offenders (MDO) currently in low, medium and enhanced medium secure care. The study identified 589 medium secure beds, 46 enhanced medium secure beds (WEMSS) and 990 low secure beds for women nationally. Of the 589 medium secure beds, the majority (309, 52 %) are in the NHS and under half (280, 48 %) are in the independent sector (IS). The distribution of low secure beds is in the opposite direction, the majority (745, 75 %) being in the IS and 254 (25 %) in the NHS. Medium <b>secure</b> <b>provision</b> for women has grown over the past decade, but comparative data for low <b>secure</b> <b>provision</b> are not available. Most women are now in single sex facilities although a small number of mixed sex units remain. The findings have implications for the future commissioning of secure services for women...|$|R
