5|$|<b>Sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Anoplura) are {{a diverse}} group infecting placental mammals. Species found on marsh rice rats include three of the common genus Hoplopleura and Polyplax spinulosa, which more usually infects black and brown rats.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{parasitic}} arthropods {{have been recorded}} on northern voalavo: mites from the families Laelapidae and Trombiculidae (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), the demodicid mite Demodex (Marojejy only), the atopomelid mite Listrophoroides (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), and unidentified <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Anjanaharibe-Sud only). In 2007, a laelapid mite found on V.gymnocaudus in Anjanaharibe-Sud {{was described as a}} new species, Andreacarus voalavo. The apicomplexan parasite Eimeria has also been recorded in Anjanaharibe-Sud.|$|E
50|$|Lemurpediculus verruculosus is an {{ectoparasite}} that {{is found}} on Microcebus rufus, a mouse lemur of southeastern Madagascar. It {{is a type}} of <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> that is found on the external ears of the mouse lemur due to the rich peripheral blood supply and sparse fur. The mouse lemur M. rufus is the only known host to this particular <b>sucking</b> <b>louse,</b> and infestations range from light to fairly heavy on the ears. The exact effect these lice have on the host is largely unknown.|$|R
50|$|Hoplopleura hirsuta is a <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> that {{is known}} from North, Central, and South America. Its main hosts are cotton rats such as Sigmodon hispidus, Sigmodon ochrognathus, Sigmodon peruanus, and Sigmodon arizonae.|$|R
40|$|Hoplopleura traubi, a {{new species}} ofhoplopleu-rid <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> {{collected}} from the murine ro-dent, Maxomys wattsi, is described. The louse and its host are known only from montane forest on Gunung (Mount) Tambusisi (1 ° 38 'S, 121 ° 23 'E) in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The morphology of H. traubi is {{compared to that of}} related species of Hoplopleura known from Sulawesi and Sunda-land. The polyplacid <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> Polyplax re-clinata is recorded for the first time from Sulawesi; specimens were recovered from a house shrew, Suncus murinus. The anopluran fauna as currently known from native Sulawesian mammals is briefly analyzed and compared with the known faunas of other parts of the Indo-Australian region...|$|R
5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin and debris, while <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{species of}} mites (Gigantolaelaps aitkeni, Gigantolaelaps gilmorei, Gigantolaelaps oudemansi, Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni, Haemolaelaps glasgowi, Laelaps dearmasi, Laelaps pilifer, Laelaps thori, Mysolaelaps parvispinosus, and Paraspeleognathopsis cricetidarum), {{thirteen}} chiggers (Aitkenius cunctatus, Ascoschoengastia dyscrita, Eutrombicula alfreddugesi, Eutrombicula goeldii, Intercutestrix tryssa, Leptotrombidium panamensis, Myxacarus oscillatus, Pseudoschoengastia abditiva, Pseudoschoengastia bulbifera, Trombicula dunni, and Trombicula keenani), and four fleas (Jellisonia sp., Polygenis roberti, Polygenis klagesi, and Polygenis dunni) {{have been found}} on T.talamancae in Panama. G.aitkeni has also been found on this species in Colombia. In addition, the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> Hoplopleura nesoryzomydis and Hoplopleura oryzomydis occur on T.talamancae.|$|E
50|$|Hoplopleura oryzomydis is a <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> that {{is known}} from the {{southern}} United States, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. It is known from several oryzomyine rodents: the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), O. couesi, Handleyomys alfaroi, Transandinomys talamancae, Melanomys caliginosus, and Sigmodontomys alfari.|$|R
50|$|These insects, which live parasitically {{on other}} animals, {{are as a}} rule quite small. The largest known species is the hog louse, Haematopinus suis, a <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> that lives on large {{livestock}} like pigs and cattle. It can range up to 6 mm in length.|$|R
50|$|A {{species of}} <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> Docophthirus acinetus is found only on this species, the genus itself being {{restricted}} to hosts {{in the family}} Tupaiidae. Endoparasitic microfiliriae have also been described from the species. The Crested Hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus) {{has been known to}} prey on this tree shrew.|$|R
5|$|Wolves {{are often}} infested {{with a variety}} of {{arthropod}} exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite), though they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The tick Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include biting lice, <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.|$|E
5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other <b>sucking</b> <b>lice,</b> but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, Pediculus and Pthirus: head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis), body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis), and pubic lice (Pthirus pubis). Human head and body lice (genus Pediculus) share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus Pthirus) share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that Pediculus and Pthirus are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of divergence between Pediculus and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.|$|E
50|$|Dogs, cats, foxes, and coyotes {{are some}} of the predators of the species. The eastern mole harbors many parasites. One hundred four moles taken in Indiana {{exhibited}} four species of fleas, one species of <b>sucking</b> <b>louse,</b> one species of beetle, and at least 20 species of mites, several of them entirely new species, with one of them, Scalopacarus, constituting a new genus.|$|R
50|$|There are two subspecies, M. m. mayori and M. m. pococki. A {{recent study}} catalogued the parasites {{associated}} with subspecies pococki: a mite of genus Echinolaelaps, a tick of genus Ixodes, and the <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> Polyplax spinulosa. A {{new species of}} pseudoscorpion {{was found on the}} mouse, described, and named Megachernes kanneliyensis. The mouse also carries the native Sri Lankan flea Stivalius phoberus.|$|R
50|$|Polyplax spinulosa is a <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> (Anoplura) {{from the}} genus Polyplax. It occurs {{worldwide}} and commonly infects its type host, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), and related species like the black rat (Rattus rattus), Rattus pyctoris, Rattus nitidus, Rattus argentiventer, Rattus tanezumi, Rattus exulans, and Bandicota indica. It is also occasionally {{found in other}} rodents, such as the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in North America.|$|R
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: <b>sucking</b> <b>lice,</b> which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
500|$|Chewing lice {{are also}} {{flattened}} {{and can be}} slightly larger than <b>sucking</b> <b>lice,</b> ranging in length from [...] They are similar to <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> in form but the head is wider than the thorax and all species have compound eyes. There are no ocelli and the mouthparts are adapted for chewing. The antennae have three to five segments and are slender in the suborder Ischnocera, but club-shaped in the suborder Amblycera. The legs are short and robust, and terminated by one or two claws. Many lice are specific to a single species of host and have co-evolved with it. They are usually cryptically coloured to match the fur or feathers of the host.|$|E
500|$|The order Phthiraptera {{is clearly}} a {{monophyletic}} grouping, united as the members are {{by a number of}} derived features including their parasitism on warm-blooded vertebrates and the combination of their metathoracic ganglia with their abdominal ganglia to form a single ventral nerve junction. The order has traditionally been divided into two suborders, the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Anoplura) and the chewing (Mallophaga); however, recent classifications suggest that the Mallophaga are paraphyletic and four suborders are now recognized: ...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to assess the efficacy of eprinomectin (EPR) against the <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> Haematopinus asini on naturally infested donkeys. Parasitological investigations were performed on fifteen animals. On day 0, donkeys received EPR pour-on at the manufacturer’s recommended cattle dose. Louse counts were performed on days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56 at seven predilection sites on the skin of each donkey. EPR was completely effective (100...|$|R
50|$|Pthirus gorillae or gorilla louse is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> that afflicts gorillas. It {{is found in the}} African continent, specifically in Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pthirus gorillae and Pthirus pubis (the crab louse) are the only known species that belong to the genus Pthirus, often incorrectly spelled as Phthirus (the Latin for louse is phthir). It is suggested that it is transmitted among its hosts by social grooming, shared bedding and sexual contact.|$|R
40|$|The {{same species}} of <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> (Phthiraptera-Anoplura) from the Chilean abrocomid rodent Abrocoma bennetti Waterhouse, 1837 was {{recently}} described as Eulinognathus chilensis Gomez, 1998 and as Abrocomaphthirus hoplai Durden & Webb, 1999. We discuss the nomenclature of this louse and confirm that its correct name is now Abrocomaphthirus chilensis (Gomez, 1998). After comparing type specimens designated from each description, we also document some morphological variation within this species {{with respect to}} the paratergal plate on abdominal segment 3 in the female which usually has two relatively long apical setae, but occasionally has only one...|$|R
500|$|Between 1735 and 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first {{classified}} insects, {{doing so}} {{on the basis of}} their wing structure. One of the seven orders into which he divided them was [...] "Aptera", meaning wingless, a group in which as well as fleas, he included spiders, woodlice and myriapods. It wasn't until 1810 that the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille reclassified the insects {{on the basis of their}} mouthparts as well as their wings, splitting Aptera into Thysanura (silverfish), Anoplura (<b>sucking</b> <b>lice)</b> and Siphonaptera (fleas), at the same time separating off the arachnids and crustaceans into their own subphyla. The group's name, Siphonaptera, is zoological Latin from the Greek siphon (a tube) and aptera (wingless).|$|E
500|$|<b>Sucking</b> <b>lice</b> {{are small}} {{wingless}} insects ranging from [...] in length. They have narrow heads and oval, flattened bodies. They have no ocelli, and their compound eyes are reduced in size or absent. Their antennae are short with {{three to five}} segments, and their mouth parts, which are retractable into their head, are adapted for piercing and sucking. There is a cibarial pump {{at the start of}} the gut; it is powered by muscles attached to the inside of the cuticle of the head. The mouthparts consist of a proboscis which is toothed, and a set of stylets arranged in a cylinder inside the proboscis, contaiing a salivary canal (ventrally) and a food canal (dorsally). The thoracic segments are fused, the abdominal segments are separate, and there is a single large claw at the tip of each of the six legs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sucking</b> <b>lice</b> (Anoplura, {{formerly}} known as Siphunculata) have around 500 species and represent the smaller of the two traditional suborders of lice. As opposed to the paraphyletic chewing lice, which are now divided among three suborders, the <b>sucking</b> <b>lice</b> are monophyletic.|$|E
40|$|Beef calves from 2 sources {{entering}} southern Alberta feedlots in {{the winters}} of 1997 - 98 and 1998 - 99, were surveyed {{for the presence}} of lice. A random sample of multiple source (MS), that is, auction market-derived, calves entering commercial feedlots and single source (SS) calves entering a backgrounding feedlot were examined {{for the presence of}} lice at entry to the feedlot. A standardized examination, which involved hair-part examination of 8 louse predilection sites, was conducted on each selected calf to determine prevalence and intensity of infestation. The long-nosed <b>sucking</b> <b>louse,</b> Linognathus vituli, was the most commonly encountered species. This species infested from 57. 8 % to 95. 6 % of the calves selected from both MS and SS calves during both winters. Louse index values, indicating intensity of infestation, for L. vituli ranged from 1 to 243 lice per animal. The chewing louse, Bovicola bovis, was present on MS and SS calves only in the winter of 1998 - 99. The louse index values for B. bovis ranged from 1 to 230 lice per animal. Mixed infestations of the L. vituli and B. bovis were common. The little blue cattle louse, Solenopotes capillatus, was present only on the SS calves in the winter of 1997 - 98. The short-nosed <b>sucking</b> <b>louse,</b> Haematopinus eurysternus, was present at very low intensities, 1 - 2 lice per animal, on 2. 6 % to 4. 4 % of the MS calves during both winters. Comparison of results from the current study with published literature suggests that efforts to determine the economic impact of louse infestations are confounded by the lack of a uniform method to assess louse population levels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Four {{cases of}} pediculosis, two in adults {{and two in}} children, caused by the crab-louse, Pthirus pubis Linnaeus, 1758 (Diptera: Anoplura) is {{reported}} from peninsular Malaysia. This is the second report of the problem to be documented from the country. Although P. pubis is closely associated with genital hairs, it is, however, also found to occur on the eyelashes, eyebrows, hairs of the body, head and axilla. The few reported cases of pthiriasis probably {{do not reflect the}} true situation. The <b>sucking</b> <b>louse</b> (Insecta: Anoplura) are generally small, wingless, dorso-ventrally flattened obligate insects. The order Anoplura contains 536 species, several with a cosmopolitan distribution (Dunce & Musser, 1994). Three species, the body louse, Pediculus humanus Linnaeus, 1758 and the head louse, Pediculus capitis De Geer, 1778 (Pediculidae) and the crab louse, Pthirus pubis Linnaeus, 1758 (Pthiridae) parasitize humans. However, the body louse has not been reported to occur in peninsular Malaysia.
