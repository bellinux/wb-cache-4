40|$|The {{adaptive}} <b>serrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> (ASN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising concepts to help reduce the noise level generated by aero-engines. Shear between a hot air stream and ambient air at the nozzle exit creates noise. The <b>serrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> is designed to protrude into the air stream causing mixing between the two air streams reducing the noise level. Adaptive control system using shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators deploy the protrusion only when required in order to maximise fuel efficiency. The successful joining of NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) to the titanium parent structure is critical to the development of the adaptive <b>serrated</b> <b>nozzle.</b> However, joining of SMAs to dissimilar metals is widely known as extremely difficult if not impossible. This research provides a preliminary study into the potential of using SMAs in large engineering applications such as the ASN and the development of viable joining methods for joining SMA to titanium based alloy. Five most favourable conventional joining methods were selected for experimental investigation. Results proved that the successful joining of SMA to dissimilar alloys was extremely difficult, joint failures were mainly due to the formation of brittle intermetallics at joint interfaces. The formation of these intermetallics occurs irrespective of the type of joining method and level of heat input employed. However, it has been shown that the formation of these intermetallics can be suppressed by the manipulation of the joint composition. A marked improvement in joint performance has been achieved for joints that contained no more than 25 at% nickel. Joint improvement has also been achieved through the addition of titanium at the joint, although further research is necessary to investigate the effect of titanium addition to joint performance...|$|E

Both longitudinal and cross stream PIV were implemented and allowed to explore the jet development up to 13 fan diameters in the symmetry plane as well as to catch its azimuthal structure at different axial positions. The influence of the pylon is exhibited. It strongly modified the azimuthal jet structure and increased the turbulence level in the upper shear layer. The comparison of both nozzles demonstrated unexpected results: the <b>serrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> induced a strong decrease of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) up to about 10 fan diameters and slight higher TKE farther downstream.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in a low speed wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic performance of several flared fan nozzles. Each of the flared nozzles was a downstream-facing inlet to a model fan {{that was used to}} simulate a variable pitch fan during reverse thrust operation. The total pressure recovery of each of the flared nozzles {{as well as that of}} an unflared <b>nozzle</b> and a <b>serrated</b> flare <b>nozzle</b> was obtained for comparison. The aerodynamic performance of a selected flared nozzle was considered in further detail. The nozzle surface pressures for a flared nozzle were also determined. Results indicated that the differences in aerodynamic performance among the nozzles were most apparent at the wind-tunnel-off condition. A nonzero free stream velocity significantly reduced the perforamnce of all the nozzles, and crosswind flow (free stream flow perpendicular to the model axis) further reduced the performance of the nozzles. The unflared <b>nozzle</b> and the <b>serrated</b> flare <b>nozzle</b> had reduced aerodynamic performance compared to a solid surface flared nozzle...|$|R

40|$|Civil {{air traffic}} has been {{constantly}} growing {{over the past}} decades. Therefore, the noise emitted by aircraft became increasingly important to public perception, as noise pollution has numerously evidenced adverse effects on human health. Jet noise - one of different noise sources of an aircraft - has been successfully alleviated by new technological advances, such as <b>serrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometries. This thesis aims to enhance the knowledge of jet noise generation by assessing the experimental data of an aeroacoustic investigation of jet noise generated by a common turbofan engine. The effects of aerofoil and pylon presence as well as different nozzle and cowling configurations are elaborated at flow conditions resembling the ICAO noise reference measurement points by examining the Sound field of the jet via source directivity analysis. The findings agree well with theory: Wing installation increases the sound pressure level slightly for all test cases due to reflection events, while the flight stream lowers the sound emission noticeably by encasing the hot core jet flows...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the last part of}} a series of four papers characterizing the {{installation}} effects of a typical high bypass ratio engine jet using numerical simulations and particle image velocimetry. The global objectives are an improved understanding of the link between the jet flows and the generated noise, the validation of methods for computing the aerodynamic field and the noise sources for industrial configurations, and the assessment of the benefits of a <b>serrated</b> <b>nozzle</b> when installed under a wing profile. This paper proposes an evaluation of the jet acoustics of under-wing nozzles with experimental and numerical tools. Far-field and near-field noise is measured in the CEPRA 19 anechoic facility. Acoustic maps of jet noise sources are obtained using a beamforming technique. Characteristic effects of jet velocity and flight simulation are observed on measured jet noise in the near-field and far-field, and are related to the flow-field analysis. CFD-CAA tools are able to capture the effect of flight on jet mixing noise. The low-frequency source peak is located by beamforming on experimental data in the region of intense mixing downstream of the nozzle pylon. The cross-analysis with CFD, PIV data and numerical tools confirms that the pylon {{plays a major role in}} mixing noise signature. The serrations are found to have a peculiar behavior...|$|E
40|$|Our {{recent efforts}} of using large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) type methods to study complex and realistic geometry single stream and co-flow nozzle jets and acoustics {{are summarized in}} this paper. For the LES, since the solver being used tends towards having dissipative qualities, the subgrid scale (SGS) model is omitted, giving a numerical type LES (NLES). To overcome near wall streak resolution problems a near wall RANS (Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes) model is smoothly blended in the LES making a hybrid RANS–NLES approach. Several complex nozzle geometries including the <b>serrated</b> (chevron) <b>nozzle,</b> realistic co-axial nozzles with eccentricity, pylon and wing–flap are discussed. The hybrid RANS–NLES simulations show encouraging predictions for the chevron jets. The chevrons are known to increase the high frequency noise at high polar angles, but decrease the low frequency noise at lower angles. The deflection effect of the potential core has an important mechanism of noise reduction. As for co-axial nozzles, the eccentricity, the pylon and the deployed wing–flap are shown to influence the flow development, especially the former {{to the length of}} potential core and the latter two having a significant impact on peak turbulence levels and spreading rates. The studies suggest that complex and real geometry effects are influential and should be taken into count when moving towards real engine simulations...|$|R

Implicit large-eddy simulation (ILES) is employed, namely omitting explicit subgrid scale models. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solution is blended into the near wall region. This makes an overall hybrid LES-RANS approach. A Hamilton–Jacobi equation is applied to remove the disparate turbulence length scales implied by hybridization. Computations are contrasted for a baseline axisymmetric (round) <b>nozzle</b> and a <b>serrated</b> (or chevron) <b>nozzle</b> with high bending and penetration. Jet characteristics for both nozzles are studied in detail with well documented experimental data compared. The chevron effects are demonstrated by comparing both solutions using the same mesh resolution and flow conditions. Higher order velocity moments with potential for aeroacoustic modeling and noise prediction, such as the two-point velocity spatial correlations, are also explored.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{ensuring}} the complete transfer of liquid droplets from nozzles in microfluidic devices to nearby surfaces involves relatively simple geometric {{modification of the}} nozzle surfaces. The method is especially applicable to nozzles in print heads and similar devices required to dispense liquid droplets having precise volumes. Examples of such devices include heads for soft printing of ink on paper and heads for depositing droplets of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or protein solutions on glass plates to form microarrays of spots for analysis. The main purpose served by the present method {{is to ensure that}} droplets transferred from a nozzle have consistent volume, as needed to ensure accuracy in microarray analysis or consistent appearance of printed text and images. In soft printing, droplets having consistent volume are generated inside a print head, but {{in the absence of the}} present method, the consistency is lost in printing because after each printing action (in which a drop is ejected from a nozzle), a small residual volume of liquid remains attached to the nozzle. By providing for complete transfer of droplets (and thus eliminating residual liquid attached to the nozzle) the method ensures consistency of volume of transferred droplets. An additional benefit of elimination of residue is prevention of cross-contamination among different liquids printed through the same nozzle a major consideration in DNA microarray analysis. The method also accelerates the printing process by minimizing the need to clean a printing head to prevent cross-contamination. Soft printing involves a hydrophobic nozzle surface and a hydrophilic print surface. When the two surfaces are brought into proximity such that a droplet in the nozzle makes contact with the print surface, a substantial portion of the droplet becomes transferred to the print surface. Then as the nozzle and the print surface are pulled apart, the droplet is pulled apart and most of the droplet remains on the print surface. The basic principle of the present method is to reduce the liquid-solid surface energy of the nozzle to a level sufficiently below the intrinsic solid-liquid surface energy of the nozzle material so that the droplet is not pulled apart and, instead, the entire droplet volume becomes transferred to the print surface. In this method, the liquid-solid surface energy is reduced by introducing artificial surface roughness in the form of micromachined serrations on the inner nozzle surface (see figure). The method was tested in experiments on soft printing of DNA solutions and of deionized water through 0. 5 -mm-diameter nozzles, of which some were not serrated, some were partially serrated, and some were fully <b>serrated.</b> In the <b>nozzles</b> without serrations, transfer was incomplete; that is, residual liquids remained in the nozzles after printing. However, in every nozzle in which at least half the inner surface was serrated, complete transfer of droplets to the print surface was achieved...|$|R
