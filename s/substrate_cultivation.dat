This process involves the fermentation of solid substrate medium with microorganism in the absence of free flowing water. Recent developments and concerted focus on SSF enabled it to evolve as a potential bio- technology as an alternative to thetraditional chemical synthesis. SSF is being successfully exploited for food production, fuels, enzymes, antibiotics, animal feeds and also for dye degradation.

40|$|Background: Calibration {{of dynamic}} models in {{biotechnology}} is challenging. Kinetic models are usually complex and differential equations are highly coupled involving {{a large number}} of parameters. In addition, available measurements are scarce and infrequent, and some key variables are often non-measurable. Therefore, effective optimization and statistical analysis methods are crucial to achieve meaningful results. In this research, we apply a metaheuristic scatter search algorithm to calibrate a solid <b>substrate</b> <b>cultivation</b> model. Results: Even though scatter search has shown to be effective for calibrating difficult nonlinear models, we show here that a posteriori analysis can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of the estimation. Conclusions: Sensibility and correlation analysis helped us detect reliability problems and provided suggestions to improve the design of future experiments...|$|E

The biosynthesis level, the biochemical characteristics, and the technological properties of the resulting proteinases are affected by the producer strain and the mode of cultivation. While the milk-clotting enzymes produced by the Rhizomucor spp. have been extensively studied in the past, much less is known on the properties and potential applications of the aspartic proteinases obtained for Mucor spp. Indeed, several Mucor spp. strains have been reported as a potential source of milk-clotting enzymes having unique technological properties. Both submerged fermentation and solid <b>substrate</b> <b>cultivation</b> are proven alternatives for the production of Mucor spp. aspartic proteinases.

The cultures reached oxygen limitation after approximately 12  hours for the glycerol processes (Figures  2 and 3), independent of glycerol concentration, indicating supply of oxygen determined the rate at which glycerol could be utilised for growth. By increasing the oxygen availability (in cultures where dissolved oxygen was maintained at 25, 50 and 100 % respectively), it was shown that the exponential growth phase could be prolonged (to 16  hours), see Additional file 1. The yield coefficients Yxo (moles of O 2 consumed per cmol of biomass produced) were estimated during growth on the different carbon sources, Table  1. Interestingly, Yxo was the same for all the single substrate cultures, whereas a 25 % reduction in Yxo was estimated for the combined <b>substrate</b> <b>cultivation.</b> The specific uptake rates of oxygen ro were estimated from Yxo by multiplication with μmax. As indicated in Table  1, ro ranged between 0.11 - 0.14 moles O 2 cmol- 1  h- 1 for all the experiments where the specific oxygen uptake rate was lower in the glucose cultivations.|$|E

A fractional factorial design (FFD) was used to study the effect of the following variables: microorganism (Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger), substratum (wheat bran and defatted rice bran), aeration (40 and 60 ml h- 1 g- 1), pectin (5 and 10 g g- 1) and nitrogen (urea and ammonium sulfate). Microorganism, aeration and initial pectin were identified in FFD as significant variables (p< 0. 05) on PG production. A central composed design to optimize PG and PMG productions indicated that Aspergillus niger presents higher PG production; substratum and nitrogen do not affect PG production; the aeration rate affects positively the production of PG and negatively the production of PMG and the initial pectin concentration affects positively both PG and PMG production. The optimal point of aeration and initial pectin concentration for PG production are 66. 13 ml h- 1 g- 1 and 12. 8 g g- 1, respectively and for PMG production are 40 ml h- 1 g- 1 and 15. 0 g g- 1, respectively...|$|E

Most of the carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios reported for A. brasiliensis {{are similar to those}} used for A. bisporus on the composting method and there are few studies about the variation of C:N ratios for A. brasilienses on the axenic method. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify the mycelial growth of A. brasiliensis on different C:N ratios using regional by-products as substrate formulation on the axenic method. Studied C:N ratios of substrate (mixture of soybean and cassava fibers) ranged from 11 : 1 to 248 : 1, with nitrogen content ranging from 4. 25 to 0. 20 %, respectively. It was concluded that substrate with only soybean fiber generates higher mycelial growth than any formulation with cassava fiber; the highest mycelial growth on substrate is with C:N ratio of 11 : 1 (N = 4. 25 %); the intermediate growth is with C:N ratio range from 15 : 1 to 50 : 1 (N from 3. 31 to 0. 98 %); and the lowest growth is with C:N ratio of 100 : 1 or higher (N ≤ 0. 50 %).

The statistical design was split plot-factorial based on completely randomized design with three replications. The factors were three strawberry cultivars under three potassium concentrations (200, 300 and 400 ppm) of nutrient solution of KH 2 PO 4, KNO 3 and K 2 SO 4 and three different substrates (peat + sand + perlite, cocopeat + perlite and sand + perlite). Results showed that increasing the concentration of potassium to 300 ppm in nutrient solution increased vitamin C content, TSS, fruit number, fruit weight, yield of plant, root weight, root dry weight and length of root. Substrate cocopeat + perlite had significant effects on some growth factors. The substrate consisting cocopeat + perlite increased plant yield and fruit number. Also the highest vitamine C content, TSS and Ta was obtained in peat + sand + perlite substrate. In addition the highest total yield was obtained from Parus with 300 ppm potassium in cocopeat + perlite substrate (921. 84 g/plant). Therefore if the goal is to increasing fruit production and yield per unit area, recommended the cocopeat + perlite <b>substrate</b> <b>cultivation,</b> but if consider to quality and taste of strawberry fruit, the ideal cultivation substrate was peat + sand + perlite.

40|$|Chemostat {{cultivation}} enables {{investigations into}} the effects of individual environmental parameters on sugar transport in yeasts. Various means are available to manipulate the specific rate of sugar uptake (q(s)) in sugar-limited chemostat cultures. A straightforward way to manipulate q, is variation of the dilution rate, which, in substrate-limited chemostat cultures, {{is equal to the}} specific growth rate. Alternatively, q(s) can be varied independently of the growth rate by mixed <b>substrate</b> <b>cultivation</b> or by variation of the biomass yield on sugar. The latter can be achieved, for example, by addition of nonmetabolizable weak acids to the growth medium or by variation of the oxygen supply. Such controlled manipulation of metabolic fluxes cannot be achieved in batch cultures, in which various parameters that are essential for the kinetics of sugar transport cannot be controlled. In sugar-limited chemostat cultures, yeasts adapt their sugar transport systems to cope with the low residual sugar concentrations, which are often in the micromolar range. Under these conditions, yeasts with high-affinity proton symport carriers have a competitive advantage over yeasts that transport sugars via facilitated-diffusion carriers. Chemostat cultivation offers unique possibilities to study the energetic consequences of sugar transport in growing cells. For example, anaerobic, sugar-limited chemostat cultivation has been used to quantify the energy requirement for maltose-proton symport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Controlled variation of growth conditions in chemostat cultures can be used to study the differential expression of genes involved in sugar transport and as such can make an important contribution to the ongoing studies on the molecular biology of sugar transport in yeasts...|$|E

Cultivation system has effect on rhizosphere bacterial community. Four treatments were set to investigate the effects of two different cultivation systems, soil and substrate systems, for two varieties of lettuce, Shengxuan NO. 5 and cv. Lollo Rossca. (two cultivation systems &# 215; two varieties). Each treatment had three pots as samples with 10 lettuce plants for each pot. After 30 days of transplanting, five plants of each pot were randomly selected, and rhizosphere soil or substrate was sampled. Real-time PCR and PCR-DGGE were implied to analyze the characteristics of rhizosphere bacterial community in each treatment. Real-Time PCR detection showed {{that the number of}} the population of rhizosphere bacteria in substrate system was significantly higher than that of soil system(P< 0. 05). PCR-DGGE profiles revealed that the diversity of substrate system was significantly higher than that of soil system. As for Shenxuan NO. 5, the Shannon-Wiener index(H), Simpson index(D) and Pielou evenness index(E) of substrate system were significantly higher than that of soil system(P< 0. 05), and for cv. Lollo Rossca, index H of substrate system were significantly higher than that of soil system(P< 0. 05).

In traditional biopharmaceutical production quality of the product is currently tested {{at the end of}} the production process only. Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released guidelines on process analytical technology (PAT) aiming at reducing variability in the end-products by introducing timely measurement and control of quality variables during the manufacturing process. This thesis intends to be a step forward towards the introduction of real-time feedback control within the frame of PAT by combining several techniques from a multidisciplinary field of systems and control theory, biology, and chemometrics. The dual <b>substrate</b> <b>cultivation</b> of Bordetella pertussis for the production of bulk whole cell whooping cough vaccine was chosen as test case. A software sensor was developed to reconstruct biomass and specific growth rate from easy to obtain measurements during cultivation. The software sensor accurately monitors biomass growth over the whole range from low to high biomass concentrations during different types of cultivation (batch, fed-batch, and continuous cultivations). It has also been investigated how near infra red spectra can be used to yield an alternative measurement of biomass. In the current state of development the software sensor is the preferred choice when it comes to feed-back control. A model-reference based controller was derived that adapts its settings in response to the time-varying conditions in order to control the specific growth rate during fed-batch cultivation, thus obtaining higher bulk vaccine concentrations compared to the standard production process. Two methods to automate controller tuning were proposed and have successfully been implemented. To obtain an indication which controller set-points are needed to obtain the best vaccine quality, the effect of specific growth rate on the formation of virulence factors has been investigated. The data and a proposed preliminary model are in favour of choosing the highest feasible growth rate.

40|$|Testing {{for plant}} {{experiments}} in space {{has begun to}} explore active nutrient delivery concepts in which water and nutrients are replenished on a continuous basis for long-term growth. The goal {{of this study is}} to develop a novel microsensor array to provide information on the dissolved oxygen environment in the plant root zone for the optimum control of hydroponics and solid substrate plant cultivation systems in the space environment. Miniaturized polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors have been designed and fabricated on a flexible Kapton (trademark) (polyimide) substrate. Two capabilities of the new microsensor array were explored. First, measurements of dissolved oxygen in the plant root zone in hydroponics and solid substrate culture systems were made. The microsensor array was fabricated on a flexible substrate, and then cut out into a mesh type to make a suspended array that could be placed either in a hydroponics system or in a solid <b>substrate</b> <b>cultivation</b> system to measure the oxygen environments. Second, the in situ self-diagnostic and self-calibration capability (two-point for oxygen) was adopted by dynamically controlling the microenvironment in close proximity to the microsensors. With a built-in generating electrode that surrounds the microsensor, two kinds of microenvironments (oxygen-saturated and oxygen-depleted phases) could be established by water electrolysis depending on the polarity of the generating electrode. The unique features of the new microsensor array (small size, multiple sensors, flexibility and self-diagnosis) can have exceptional benefits for the study and optimization of plant cultivation systems in both terrestrial and microgravity environments. The in situ self-diagnostic and self-calibration features of the microsensor array will also enable continuous verification of the operability during entire plant growth cycles. This concept of automated control of a novel chemical monitoring system will minimize crew time required for maintenance, as well as reduce volume, mass, and power consumption by eliminating bulky diagnosis systems including calibrant (fluid and gas) reservoir and flow system hardware...|$|E
