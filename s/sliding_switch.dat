50|$|The T70 {{included}} two different through-the-lens metering methods; both used a silicon photocell housed above the viewfinder eyepiece. Center-weighted average metering was the standard metering method, averaging {{over the whole}} frame with a slight preference towards {{the center of the}} frame, where the main subject is most likely to be. With strongly backlit scenes, or ones where the subject is spotlit against a dark background, center-weighted averaging produces underexposure or overexposure, respectively. For such situations, the T70 also supported selective area metering, which metered only the center 11% of the frame. The metering mode was selected by a <b>sliding</b> <b>switch</b> on the top left-hand side of the camera (from the photographer's perspective).

50|$|Riders advance out of {{the station}} slowly onto the chain lift hill that is covered in fog machines, which give the {{illusion}} of climbing up water. At the top of the lift hill, riders make a full U-turn on a roller coaster track, which wraps around the larger of the ride's two tower-like buildings while traversing a small hump. This turn offers the riders a view of the main roller coaster portion and parts of the park, in which boats emerge above the U-turn. The boat heads toward the second tower, which bares an arched portico with fountain pouring down directly onto the tracks. The fountain turns off just as the boats slip under, plunging down a 60 ft flume channel into a pool of water. During the plunge, photos are taken of riders. The boat then makes a left-handed U-turn in the water pool and meanders through the pond gently.The boat then enters the plunge tower building at the base. The building is dark inside. The boats enter a room which lights up dimly, and begins to flood. (Water comes through crevices in the wall to achieve the effect). The boats roll {{out of the}} room into the darkness, and onto a special track that works like an elevator, carrying two boats simultaneously. The elevator rocks from side to side while traveling up, as though being pushed by an ocean current. The elevator stops to reach the maximum height position on the ride's course.The boats drop down a 70-foot, 270° curved drop and rise element, followed by a small block brake section. The boat then drops again into another banked hill, followed by a banked bunny hop which lands into another pool of water. The boats then meander through the pool and up a small lift hill to the loading area. A <b>sliding</b> <b>switch</b> track enables high-capacity, faster loading and unloading process.|$|E
5000|$|The Langevin Model EQ-251A was {{the first}} {{equalizer}} to use slide controls. It featured two passive equalization sections, a bass shelving filter, and a pass band filter.

The first true graphic equalizer was the type 7080 developed by Art Davis's Cinema Engineering. It featured 6 bands with a boost or cut range of 8 dB. It used a <b>slide</b> <b>switch</b> to adjust each band in 1 dB steps. Davis's second graphic equalizer was the Altec Lansing Model 9062A EQ. In 1967 Davis developed the first 1/3 octave variable notch filter set, the Altec-Lansing [...] "Acousta-Voice" [...] system.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 1890s flashlights used a metal {{ring around}} the fiber body of the flashlight as one contact of a switch, and the second contact was a movable metal loop that could be flipped down to touch the ring, completing the circuit. A wide variety of mechanical <b>switch</b> designs using <b>slide</b> <b>switches,</b> rocker switches, or side-mounted or end-mounted pushbuttons {{have been used in}} flashlights. A common combination is a <b>slide</b> <b>switch</b> that allows the light to be left on for an extended time, combined with a momentary button for intermittent use or signalling. Since voltages and currents are low, switch design is limited only by the available space and desired cost of production. Switches may be covered with a flexible rubber boot to exclude dirt and moisture. Another common type of switch relies on twisting the head of the light. Weapon-mounted lights may have remote switches for convenience in operation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—When the {{permanent}} magnet {{linear synchronous motor}} (PMLSM) direct drive system, the system has the characteristics of nonlinear, motor parameter time-variance and vulnerable disturbance, an adaptive sliding mode controller based on neural network is designed. The controller consists of two neural networks, one is used for sliding equivalent control {{and the other for}} <b>sliding</b> <b>switch</b> control, so as to effectively guarantees the system fast tracking performance for a given signal. The controller can restrain the system parameters perturbation and external resistance changes, and weakening the sliding mode control system chattering. The simulation results show that the adaptive sliding mode controller based on neural network can improve the system robustness for parametric perturbation and external disturbance, and possess better dynamic stability and tracking performance Keywords- Linear motor, Neural network, Sliding control, Chatterin...|$|E

5000|$|One of the Jazzmaster's notable {{features}} is {{the pickup}} circuit featuring the unusual [...] "roller" [...] thumbwheel controls and <b>slide</b> <b>switch</b> {{at the upper}} neck end of the pickguard.

When it is in the rhythm position, it selects the neck pickup only with the brightness rolled off slightly due to different values of the potentiometers (50k vs 1000k in the lead circuit), and the volume and tone are controlled by the two thumbwheels; the other controls are bypassed.
