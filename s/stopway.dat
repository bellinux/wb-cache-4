500|$|Førde Airport, Øyrane {{was located}} in the {{industrial}} area Øyrane, immediately west of the town center of Førde. The terminal facilities were located {{on the shore of}} the river of Jølstra and consisted of a control tower, a passenger terminal, a hangar for Førdefly and a wharf used by the seaplanes. The airport was owned by Førde Municipality. It consisted of a single [...] asphalt runway aligned 14–32 and with a [...] <b>stopway</b> on each end. The runway length was limited by the fjord to the north and by National Road 5 to the south. From the northern end of the runway, a taxiway ran due south about [...] to the terminal.|$|E
2500|$|Geçitkale's only runway, 9/27, {{measures}} [...] {{in length}} and [...] wide. In addition, there is a [...] long <b>stopway</b> on either end. The airport {{is equipped with a}} VOR/DME and an NDB station.|$|E
5000|$|Accelerate-Stop Distance Available - The {{length of}} the takeoff run {{available}} plus the {{length of the}} <b>stopway,</b> if <b>stopway</b> is provided.|$|E
5000|$|Length of runway - A short runway {{means the}} {{aircraft}} has less distance to accelerate to takeoff speed. The length for computation of maximum permitted takeoff weight may be adjusted if the runway has clearways and/or <b>stopways.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Metrolínea is the Integrated Mass Transit System of Bucaramanga. Its {{construction}} {{began in}} 2006 during {{the administration of}} Mayor Honorio Galvis; its operation is currently in its first phase. Its first phase was inaugurated in December 22, 2009; in this phase, the first 6 lines inaugurated are: Avenida del Libertador (Diagonal 15), autocentral, Prospero Finch Avenue (27th Avenue), La Cumbre, Highway Floridablanca Villabel Bucarica and which have 91 <b>stopways.</b> The administration is currently {{in the process of}} coupling the second phase, which will cover the areas of Piedecuesta, Ciudadela Real de Minas, the Avenue of the Americas (Race 33) and will have trunks at Autosur, Real de Minas and the Americas.|$|R
5000|$|Blast pads, {{also known}} as overrun areas or <b>stopways,</b> are often {{constructed}} just {{before the start of}} a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway. Overrun areas are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to slowly stop planes that overrun the runway on a landing gone wrong, or to slowly stop a plane on a rejected takeoff or a takeoff gone wrong. Blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are marked with yellow chevrons. Planes are not allowed to taxi, take off or land on blast pads, except in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|Geçitkale's only runway, 9/27, {{measures}} 2850 m {{in length}} and 45 m wide. In addition, there is a 285 m long <b>stopway</b> on either end. The airport {{is equipped with a}} VOR/DME and an NDB station.|$|E
50|$|FAA Advisory Circular 150/5220-22B {{explains}} that an EMAS {{may not be}} effective for incidents involving aircraft of less than 25,000 pounds weight. It also clarifies that an EMAS {{is not the same}} as a <b>stopway,</b> which is defined in FAA Advisory Circular 150/5300-13A, Section 312.|$|E
50|$|Some airfields {{now have}} a special surface known as soft {{concrete}} {{at the end of}} the runway (<b>stopway</b> or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.|$|E
50|$|Førde Airport, Øyrane {{was located}} in the {{industrial}} area Øyrane, immediately west of the town center of Førde. The terminal facilities were located {{on the shore of}} the river of Jølstra and consisted of a control tower, a passenger terminal, a hangar for Førdefly and a wharf used by the seaplanes. The airport was owned by Førde Municipality. It consisted of a single 790 by 30 m asphalt runway aligned 14-32 and with a 85 m <b>stopway</b> on each end. The runway length was limited by the fjord to the north and by National Road 5 to the south. From the northern end of the runway, a taxiway ran due south about 400 m to the terminal.|$|E
50|$|The aerodrome {{is owned}} by the local {{government}} and used for pioneer flight operations. The coordinates are 00 47 North, 114 34 East. The elevation is not officially published, only measured from the aircraft altimeter, which is about 650 ft above sea level. The runway designation is 02 and 20. The length of the runway is 750 meter with width of 23 meter. A <b>stopway</b> of 30 meter is provided for runway 02. The runway surface is asphalt and its strength can accommodate up to CASA 212 aircraft. It has an apron, taxiway, but a tower building is not available since the aerodrome is a non controlled aerodrome. The runway is not equipped with landing direction indicators and, due to local prevailing surface winds at most of the time, the preferred takeoff and landing direction is runway 02. A significant obstacle is the hilly forest in the northerly direction of the extension of runway 02. The first obstacle is about 200 feet high above runway elevation located about 533.3 meters from the end of runway 02, and the second obstacle is about 500 feet above runway elevation 1.262,9 meters from the end of runway 02. Runway slope inclination is 3% from direction of runway 02.|$|E
