500|$|Galerina marginata {{was shown}} in various studies to contain the amatoxins α-amanitin and γ-amanitin, first as G.venenata, then as G.marginata and G.autumnalis. The ability of the fungus to produce these toxins was {{confirmed}} by growing the mycelium as a liquid culture (only trace amounts of β-amanitin were found). G.marginata {{is thought to be}} the only species of the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture. Both amanitins were quantified in G.autumnalis (1.5mg/g dry weight) and G.marginata (1.1mg/g dry weight). Later experiments confirmed the occurrence of γ-amanitin and β-amanitin in German specimens of G.autumnalis and G.marginata and revealed the presence of the three amanitins in the fruit bodies of G.unicolor. Although some mushroom field guides claim that the species (as G.autumnalis) also contains phallotoxins (however phallotoxins cannot be absorbed by humans), scientific evidence does not support this contention. A 2004 study determined that the amatoxin content of G.marginata varied from 78.17 to 243.61µg/g of fresh weight. In this study, the amanitin amounts from certain Galerina specimens were higher than those from some Amanita phalloides, a European fungus generally considered as the richest in amanitins. The authors suggest that [...] "other parameters such as extrinsic factors (environmental conditions) and intrinsic factors (genetic properties) could contribute to the significant variance in amatoxin contents from different specimens." [...] The lethal dose of amatoxins has been estimated to be about 0.1mg/kg human body weight, or even lower. Based on this value, the ingestion of 10 G.marginata fruit bodies containing about 250µg of amanitins per gram of fresh tissue could poison a child weighing approximately [...] However, a 20-year retrospective <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2100 cases of amatoxin poisonings from North American and Europe showed that few cases were due to ingestion of Galerina species. This low frequency may be attributed to the mushroom's nondescript appearance as a [...] "little brown mushroom" [...] leading to it being overlooked by collectors, and by the fact that 21% of amatoxin poisonings were caused by unidentified species.|$|E
