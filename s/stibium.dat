Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl.

5000|$|... "Blue" [...] Kohl is a dark-bluish black pigment {{composed}} of both lead-based compounds {{as well as}} a compound of antimony. The lead-based compounds in kohl are galena (PbS) - dark grey and gloss laurionite ( [...] PbCl(OH)) - white phosgenite ((PbCl)2CO3); cerussite (PbCO3) - blue. The antimony-based compound in kohl is stibnite (Sb2S3) - blue. Stibnite has antimony (<b>stibium)</b> in it. There is evidence that submicromolar concentrations of lead (Pb2+) can elicit overproduction of nitrous oxide (N2O), which in turn can trigger an enhancement of the immune response.|$|E
50|$|Stibarsen or allemontite is {{a natural}} form of arsenic {{antimonide}} (AsSb) or antimony arsenide (SbAs). The name stibarsen is derived from Latin <b>stibium</b> (antimony) and arsenic, whereas allemonite refers to the locality Allemont in France where the mineral was discovered. It is found in veins at Allemont, Isère, France; Valtellina, Italy; and the Comstock Lode, Nevada; and in a lithium pegmatites at Varuträsk, Sweden. Stibarsen is often mixed with pure arsenic or antimony, and the original description in 1941 proposed to use stibarsen for AsSb and allemontite for the mixtures. Since 1982, the International Mineralogical Association considers stibarsen as the correct mineral name.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to a story}} {{collected}} by the erudite Francesco Cancellieri in 1802, a pilgrim named [...] "Stibeum" [...] (from Latin: <b>stibium,</b> which means [...] "antimony") was hosted in the villa for a night. That night, the pilgrim, identified later by some as the alchemist Giuseppe Francesco Borri—known as Giustiniano Bono—, searched the gardens of the villa overnight {{in search of a}} mysterious herb capable of concocting gold. Legend held that the next morning he was seen to disappear forever through a door, but left behind a few flakes of gold, the fruits of a successful alchemical transmutation, and a mysterious paper full of puzzling symbols and equations, putatively describing the ingredients and process required. Perhaps the paper referred to the Voynich manuscript, a mysterious document belonging earlier to the king Rudolf II. The marquis had these symbols engraved on the five gates of the villa Palombara and {{on the walls of the}} mansion, hoping that one day they would be translated.|$|E
5000|$|The ancient {{words for}} {{antimony}} mostly have, as their chief meaning, kohl, the sulfide of antimony.The Egyptians called antimony mśdmt; in hieroglyphs, the vowels are uncertain, but an Arabic tradition {{holds that the}} word is ميسديميت mesdemet. The Greek word, στίμμι stimmi, is probably a loan word from Arabic or from Egyptian stm O34:D46-G17-F21:D4 and is used by Attic tragic poets of the 5th century BC. Later Greeks also used στἰβι stibi, as did Celsus and Pliny, writing in Latin, {{in the first century}} AD. Pliny also gives the names stimi , larbaris, alabaster, and the [...] "very common" [...] platyophthalmos, [...] "wide-eye" [...] (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as <b>stibium.</b> The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as إثمد ithmid, athmoud, othmod, or uthmod. Littré suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from stimmida, an accusative for stimmi.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first of}} these symbols were {{intended}} to be fully universal. Since Latin was the common language of science at that time, they were abbreviations based on the Latin names of metals. Cu comes from Cuprum, Fe comes from Ferrum, Ag from Argentum. The symbols were not followed by a period (full stop) as with abbreviations. Later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols, based on {{the name of the}} element, but not necessarily in English. For example, sodium has the chemical symbol 'Na' after the Latin natrium. The same applies to [...] "W" [...] (wolfram) for tungsten, [...] "Fe" [...] (ferrum) for iron, [...] "Hg" [...] (hydrargyrum) for mercury, [...] "Sn" [...] (stannum) for tin, [...] "K" [...] (kalium) for potassium, [...] "Au" [...] (aurum) for gold, [...] "Ag" [...] (argentum) for silver, [...] "Pb" [...] (plumbum) for lead, [...] "Cu" [...] (cuprum) for copper, and [...] "Sb" [...] (<b>stibium)</b> for antimony.|$|E

5000|$|Metal is {{a mineral}} body, by nature either liquid or {{somewhat}} hard. The latter may be melted {{by the heat}} of the fire, but when it has cooled down again and lost all heat, it becomes hard again and resumes its proper form. In this respect it differs from the stone which melts in the fire, for although the latter regain its hardness, yet it loses its pristine form and properties. Traditionally there are six different kinds of metals, namely gold, silver, copper, iron, tin and lead. There are really others, for quicksilver is a metal, although the Alchemists disagree with us on this subject, and bismuth is also. The ancient Greek writers seem to have been ignorant of bismuth, wherefore Ammonius rightly states that there are many species of metals, animals, and plants which are unknown to us. <b>Stibium</b> when smelted in the crucible and refined has as much right to be regarded as a proper metal as is accorded to lead by writers. If when smelted, a certain portion be added to tin, a bookseller's alloy is produced from which the type is made that is used by those who print books on paper. Each metal has its own form which it preserves when separated from those metals which were mixed with it. Therefore neither electrum nor Stannum meaning our tin is of itself a real metal, but rather an alloy of two metals. Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver, Stannum of lead and silver. And yet if silver be parted from the electrum, then gold remains and not electrum; if silver be taken away from Stannum, then lead remains and not Stannum. Whether brass, however, is found as a native metal or not, cannot be ascertained with any surety. We only know of the artificial brass, which consists of copper tinted with the colour of the mineral calamine. And yet if any should be dug up, it would be a proper metal. Black and white copper seem to be different from the red kind. Metal, therefore, is by nature either solid, as I have stated, or fluid, as in the unique case of quicksilver. But enough now concerning the simple kinds.|$|E

40|$|Aims Organ {{stoichiometric}} {{characteristics are}} the bridge that connects environment and plant organ traits. The relationships among environment, organ stoichiometric characteristics and organ traits reveal mechanisms of environmental effects on plant organ traits {{and make it}} possible to regulate plant traits. Our objective was try to find the relationships among soil and leaf nitrogen (N), phosphonium (P) stoichiometric characteristics and leaf chlorophyll content for Oligostachyum lubricum. Methods Total N, P concentrations of the original soil in pots were 421. 76 and 37. 35 mg·kg– 1, respectively, and the original soil was treated as the control (1 N 1 P). Total experimental N, P concentration were two, three and four times as high as the control. Different N, P levels were combined into 10 combinations (2 N 2 P, 2 N 3 P, 2 N 4 P, 3 N 2 P, 3 N 3 P, 3 N 4 P, 4 N 2 P, 4 N 3 P, 4 N 4 P and 1 N 1 P) and every combination except the control was achieved by adding different amounts of NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 H 2 PO 4. Leaf samples were collected from ramets of O. lubricum after grown in the pot soil with different N, P level combinations for 45 days. Leaf total N concentration was determined by employing the Kjeldahl method and leaf total P concentration by the acid melt-molybdenum <b>stibium</b> anti-color method. Leaf chlorophyll concentrations were measured based on acetone-ethanol mixture (1 : 1) extraction method. Soil and leaf total N, P concentrations were expressed as mg·kg– 1 DW. Important findings Soil total N concentration was significantly positively correlated with leaf total N concentration and leaf N : P ratio, whereas soil total P concentration had no significant correlation with leaf total P concentration and leaf N : P ratio. Leaf N : P ratio increased with the increasing of soil N : P ratio, and the rate of increase of soil N : P ratio was faster than that of leaf N : P ratio. At the same soil condition, leaf N : P ratio of ramets growing in soil with 2 N 2 P and 3 N 3 P had no significant difference, but the both were higher than the control (1 N 1 P) and lower than that growing in soil with 4 N 4 P. Leaf N : P was the main factor that affected leaf chlorophyll content. Results suggested that soil total N concentration had more effect on leaf N, P stoichiometric characteristics than soil total P. Sufficient supply of soil total N lead to the luxury uptake of N by leaves of O. lubricum. The growth of O. lubricum was limited by low soil total N concentration before N and P addition...|$|E
