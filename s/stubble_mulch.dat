50|$|Agronomic {{practices}} {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the severity of Fusarium crown rot on wheat, but they cannot eliminate the disease. Practices which can help reduce the risk of disease are: not rotating wheat with oats, tilling fields after harvest to improve water infiltration, establishing a dust and <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> in the spring, applying the correct amount of nitrogen to fields, and planting wheat at an intermediate planting date which balances the larger plants and greater stress of early planting with the lower yields of later planting. These practices work to reduce disease by creating an unfavorable environment for the pathogen or by making the host less susceptible. Since these practices do not necessarily line up with preferred agronomic and economic considerations, the use of resistant or tolerant varieties is becoming the accepted management practice.|$|E

40|$|Traffic and tillage {{effects on}} runoff and crop {{performance}} on a heavy clay soil were investigated {{over a period of}} 4 years. Tillage treatments and the cropping program were representative of broadacre grain production practice in northern Australia, and a split-plot design used to isolate traffic effects. Treatments subject to zero, minimum, and <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage each comprised pairs of 90 -m 2 plots, from which runoff was recorded. A 3 -m-wide controlled traffic system allowed one of each pair to be maintained as a non-wheeled plot, while the total surface area of the other received a single annual wheeling treatment from a working 100 -kW tractor. Rainfall/runoff hydrographs demonstrate that wheeling produced a large and consistent increase in runoff, whereas tillage produced a smaller increase. Treatment effects were greater on dry soil, but were still maintained in large and intense rainfall events on wet soil. Mean annual runoff from wheeled plots was 63 mm (44 %) greater than that from controlled traffic plots, whereas runoff from <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage plots was 38 mm (24 %) greater than that from zero tillage plots. Traffic and tillage effects appeared to be cumulative, so the mean annual runoff from wheeled <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> tilled plots, representing conventional cropping practice, was more than 100 mm greater than that from controlled traffic zero tilled plots, representing best practice. This increased infiltration was reflected in an increased yield of 16 % compared with wheeled <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch.</b> Minimum tilled plots demonstrated a characteristic midway between that of zero and <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage. The results confirm that unnecessary energy dissipation in the soil during the traction process that normally accompanies tillage has a major negative effect on infiltration and crop productivity.

The distribution of maize roots was cone shaped and gradually extended from 20 cm to 40 cm below the surface during the elongation stage. Under the different mulch tillage models, the effects on maize root growth were positive. The mulching measures significantly affected the control and support of the early and later stages of maize growth. The maize significantly differed in the root weight density (P= 0. 026 < 0. 05) and the root surface area (P = 0. 005 < 0. 01) with different mulching measures. No-tillage with straw mulching on the ridge and furrow was the only mulching model in which the growth of the roots and leaves of maize was limited. However, the other maize growth measures were better than conventional tillage. In addition, no-tillage with straw mulching on the ridge and furrow had an advantage in terms of the growth of the surface roots, while <b>stubble</b> <b>mulching</b> and strip mulching had advantages in terms of the growth of deep roots and radial roots, respectively.

40|$|International audienceIntercropping {{is used to}} {{increase}} grain production {{in many areas of}} the world. However, this increasing crop yield costs large amounts of water used by intercropped plants. In addition, intercropping usually requires higher inputs that induce greenhouse gas emissions. Actually, it is unknown whether intercropping can be effective in water-limited arid areas. Here, we measured crop yield, water consumption, soil respiration, and carbon emissions of wheat–maize intercropping under different tillage and crop residue management options. A field experiment was conducted at Wuwei in northwest China in 2011 and 2012. Our results show that wheat–maize intercropping increased grain yield by 61  % in 2011 and 63  % in 2012 compared with the average yield of monoculture crops. The intercropping under reduced tillage with <b>stubble</b> <b>mulching</b> yielded 15. 9  t ha− 1 in 2011 and 15. 5  t ha− 1 in 2012, an increase of 7. 8  % in 2011 and 8. 1  % in 2012, compared to conventional tillage. Wheat–maize intercropping had carbon emission of 2, 400  kg C ha− 1 during the growing season, about 7  % less than monoculture maize, of 2, 580  kg C ha− 1. Reduced tillage decreased C emission over conventional tillage by 6. 7  % for the intercropping, 5. 9  % for monoculture maize, and 7. 1  % for monoculture wheat. Compared to monoculture maize, wheat–maize intercropping used more water but emitted 3. 4  kg C per hectare per millimeter of water used, which was 23  % lower than monoculture maize. Overall, our findings show that maize–wheat intercropping with reduced tillage coupled with <b>stubble</b> <b>mulching</b> can be used {{to increase}} grain production while effectively lower carbon emissions in arid areas...|$|R

A split plot design was used to isolate traffic effects, while the cropping program and treatments were broadly representative of extensive grain production practice in the northern grain region of Australia. Treatments subject to zero tillage and <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage each comprised pairs of 90 m 2 plots, from which runoff was recorded. A 3 m wide controlled traffic system allowed one of each pair to be maintained as a non-wheeled plot, while the complete surface area of the other received a single annual wheeling treatment from a working 100 kW tractor. Mean annual runoff from controlled traffic plots was 81 mm (36. 3 %) smaller than that from wheeled plots, while runoff from zero tillage was reduced by 31 mm (15. 7 %). Traffic and tillage effects appeared to be cumulative, so the mean annual runoff from controlled traffic and zero tillage plots, representing best practice, was 112 mm (47. 2 %) less than that from wheeled <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> plots, representing conventional cropping practice. Rainfall infiltration into controlled traffic zero tillage soil was thus 12. 0 % greater than into wheeled stubble mulched soil. Rainfall/runoff hydrographs show that wheeling produced a large and consistent increase in runoff, whereas tillage produced a smaller increase. Treatment effects were greater on dry soil, but were still present in large and intense rainfall events on wet soil. Plant available water capacity (PAWC) in the 0 – 500 mm zone increased by 10 mm (11. 5 %) and mean grain yields increased by 337 kg/ha (9. 4 %) in controlled traffic plots, compared with wheeled plots. Mean grain yield of zero tillage was 2 – 8 % greater than that of <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> plots for all crops except for winter wheat in 1994 and 1998. Increased infiltration and plant available water were probably responsible for increased mean grain yields of 497 kg/ha (14. 5 %) in controlled traffic zero tillage, compared with wheeled <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> treatments. Dissipation of tractive and tillage energy in the soil is the apparent mechanism of deleterious effects on the soils ability to support productive cropping in this environment.

To explore the effect of variation in <b>stubble</b> height and <b>mulching</b> biomass on soil erosion caused by wind, we conducted a field experiment using a quadratic rotation combination design.

The soil water content in <b>stubble</b> and straw <b>mulching</b> treatments was higher than in a control treatment at 0 - 20 cm soil, and the tendency {{in the amount of}} soil water content was opposite to the amount of wind erosion (r = - 0. 882, n = 10, p < 0. 01).

Moldboard ploughing produced the roughest soil surface and the highest initial CO 2 flux and maintained the highest flux throughout the experiment. The moldboard ploughing caused higher CO 2 loss than less intensive tillage such as chisel ploughing, mulch cultivating, or disc harrowing.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Abundant conidial {{production}} occurs from colonized straws {{and plants}} infected with Cercosporella herpotrichoides Fron during the cool moist {{months of the}} growing season. Experiments were designed to study the survival, inoculum potential and competitive saprophytic ability of conidia in soil. Laboratory results indicated that cool moist soil favors the saprophytic survival of the fungus in soil. Viable hyphae were observed 16 months after conidia were buried in soil held at 5 ° and 10 ° C. Ammonium nitrate inhibited germination and survival of conidia in soil. It also inhibited germination on glass slides not in contact with soil. Ammonium ions were more inhibitory than nitrate ions. Glucose did not influence germination but stimulated saprophytic development and survival of the pathogen in soil. A marked reduction in survival of C. herpotrichoides after one year occurred in naturally and artificially colonized straws buried in the soil. Survival was favored in straws placed at the soil surface. Straws buried in conidial infested soil and incubated in the laboratory or the field were colonized by the pathogen. Colonization was {{directly related to the}} inoculum density of the soil and inversely related to time. Foot rot lesions developed below the soil surface on plants grown in conidial infested soil. Lesion incidence was directly related to the inoculum density of the soil. Based on mathematical models it was concluded that conidia were influenced by host exudates only at the host surface and a rhizosphere was not operative. The fungus was able to grow up to 10 mm from a food base in the soil and cause below ground lesions. Lesions below the soil surface were observed on plants growing under natural field conditions. It is suggested these below ground infections play an important part in maintaining inoculum levels in fields during years not favorable for foot rot development. In growth chamber studies, plants developed lesions from single conidium inoculations. Disease development on plants in the growth chamber was influenced by the general susceptibility of the inoculated tissue, the stage of growth when inoculated, the rate of plant growth and the openness of the crown. Green tissues were more resistant to infection than senescent tissues. Infection occurring before the onset of tillering can result in lesion development on each new tiller produced. Plants growing rapidly in a high nitrogen media were able to slough off infections and escape the disease. Tight crowned plants tended to have a majority of their tillers infected while healthy culms were associated with diseased ones in plants having wide spreading crowns. Successful penetration and infection of a coleoptile or leaf sheath did not insure disease development. The infected tissues may become separated from the main stem before the fungus has penetrated into adjacent leaf sheaths, thus isolating the pathogen, so that. the majority of the plant tissue escapes infection. The infection process failed at one of three stages on green "resistant" tissues of coleoptiles and leaf sheaths: (1) germination failed to occur, (2) germination occurred but the pathogen failed to attempt penetration, and (3) penetration was attempted but failed. Thickening of host cell walls was associated with the failure of attempted penetrations. Thickened host walls were also associated with containment of the pathogen at the perifery of lesions. These thickened cell walls usually stained heavily with cotton blue and were never associated with senescent tissue. Results indicate that <b>stubble</b> <b>mulching</b> and deep seeding would favor foot rot development. Chemicals or varieties delaying senescence of leaf sheaths would be expected to reduce foot rot injury...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 No-tillage {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a wheat-fallow {{cropping}} system has consistently produced lower grain yields than conventionally tilled soils in the semiarid Pacific Northwest. A 2 -year {{study was conducted}} in a long-term tillage trial at Moro, OR to determine factors responsible for differences in wheat growth and yield as affected by moldboard plow, <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch,</b> and no-tillage fallow method. Soil water, soil mineral N, plant N uptake, soil temperature, above-ground dry matter accumulation, and yield components were measured. The highest fallow efficiency during both years was achieved by <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage, followed by the plow and no-tillage systems. Accelerated water loss from no-tillage fallow occurred during the hot, dry summer due to uninterrupted capillary flow. The main yield limitations to no-tillage technology in this study were: (1) diminished seedzone water at planting time in the fall which resulted in reduced germination and stand establishment; (2) cooler spring soil temperatures which slowed crop development and dry matter accumulation, and; (3) production of fewer spikes per unit area. The second objective {{of this study was to}} determine if late season seedzone water loss from fallow could be reduced by altering the physical characteristics of the dust mulch. Loss of seedzone water appears to accelerate in late August and September because of increased diurnal heat flux. Compacting the soil surface with a roller in mid-August increased surface bulk density and volumetric water content to depths as great as 10 cm. Evaporative water loss from compacted plots, however, occurred at a faster rate than from control plots and, by mid-September, there were no differences in seedzone water content among treatments. Increased soil thermal conductivity appeared to be the reason for accelerated water loss in compacted treatments. Although water loss occurred at a faster rate in compacted treatments, compacting fallow soils with a roller immediately prior to fall seeding may increase winter wheat germination, emergence, and stand establishment during years of marginal seedzone water...|$|E

The traditional experimental approach has {{played an important}} role in studying crop {{production systems}}, but isolation of these factors in experimental studies is difficult and time consuming. Computer simulation models are useful in exploring these interactions and provide a valuable tool to test and further our understanding of the behavior of soil-crop systems without repeating experimentation. Productivity erosion and runoff functions to evaluate conservation techniques (PERFECT) is one of the soil-crop models that integrate the dynamics of soil, tillage and crop processes at a daily resolution. This study had two major objectives. The first was to calibrate the use of the PERFECT soil-crop simulation model to simulate soil and crop responses to changes of traffic and tillage management. The second was to explore the interactions between traffic, tillage, soil and crop, and provide insight to the long-term effects of improved soil management and crop rotation options. This contribution covers only the first objective, and the second will be covered in a subsequent contribution. Data were obtained from field experiments on a vertisol in Southeast Queensland, Australia which had controlled traffic and tillage treatments for the previous 5 years. Input data for the simulation model included daily weather, runoff, plant available water capacity, and soil hydraulic properties, cropping systems, and traffic and tillage management. After model calibration, predicted and measured total runoffs for the 5 -year period were similar. Values of root mean square error (RMSE) for daily runoff ranged from 5. 7 to 9. 2 mm, which were similar to those reported in literature. The model explained 75 - 95 % of variations of daily, monthly and annual runoff, 70 - 84 % of the variation in total available soil water, and 85 % of the variation in yield.

Both practices can result in late, less vigorous stands which have lower yield potential and provide less protection from erosion. The objectives of this study were to: 1) quantify changes in seed zone water content prior to seeding; 2) determine the cause of the accelerated loss; 3) substantiate the effect of planting date on the yield of one variety of winter wheat and one variety of winter barley; 4) investigate the effect of soil temperature on the rate of first and 70...|$|E

To better understand these controls, decreases in soil organic C (SOC), soil microbial biomass (SMB) C, and the role of SMB as a source of mineralizable C were measured during a long-term incubation (853 days) without added substrate. The 2 soils used were a Weld loam (fine montmorillonitic, mesic, Aridic Paleustoll) from near Akron, Colorado, and a Duroc loam (fine silty, mixed mesic Pachic Haplustoll) from near Sidney, Nebraska. The Akron soil was uniformly cropped to small grain crop-fallow rotations until 1989 when wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in conventional (<b>stubble</b> <b>mulch)</b> till-fallow, reduced till-fallow, and no-till fallow treatments were adopted. On additional rotation plots, continuous corn (Zea mays L.) or no-till corn, fallow, wheat, and no-till corn in a 4 -year rotation were grown. The Sidney soil was broken from native sod in 1970 and planted to wheat-fallow with no-till, plow-tillage, and sod-plot treatments. Moist soil samples were collected and refrigerated until plant material removal by sieving and picking. The SOC and SMB-C decreased during incubation and rates of loss measured. The results from this study allow insights into contributions of SMB and changes in soil isotope C ratios not previously available. Soil microbial biomass C contributed an average of 31...|$|E
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw mulch level on weed control and corn growth in a winter wheat-ecofallow corn (Zea mays L.) -fallow rotation at Wilber, North Platte, and Sidney, Nebraska from 1981 to 1983. Wheat straw mulch was established at levels of 0, 1. 68, 3. 36, 5. 04, and 6. 72 t/ha in stubble fields after harvest (fall-adjusted) or the following spring (spring-adjusted). Atrazine { 2 -chloro- 4 -(ethylamino) - 6 -(isopropylamino) -s-triazine} concentration remained higher in unmulched soil than in soil with high levels of mulch for more than 9 months following application after wheat harvest due to interception of atrazine by the mulch. Metolachlor { 2 -chloro-N-(2 -ethyl- 6 -methylphenyl) -N-(2 -methoxy- 1 -methylethyl) acetamide} concentration remained higher in unmulched soil than in soil with high levels of mulch for more than 4 months after application at corn planting due to interception by the mulch. Even though the amount of atrazine and metolachlor in the soil was reduced by mulch in fall-adjusted experiments and the amount of metolachlor was reduced in spring-adjusted experiments, weed control was not reduced and usually increased with increasing mulch level. Thus increasing atrazine and metolachlor rate was not necessary to maintain adequate weed control in no-till wheat <b>stubble</b> since the <b>mulch</b> itself had an adverse effect on weed growth. ^ The response of corn to mulch level varied with environment. Overall, early corn growth was retarded by increasing amounts of mulch, but, after tasseling, corn grew taller as the mulch level increased. Soil water content, silking date, kernel moisture at harvest, stover dry matter, total dry matter, ears per plant, and kernel weight increased with increasing mulch level. Kernel number reached a maximum at a mulch level of 4. 4 t/ha while grain yield reached a maximum at a mulch level of 5. 1 t/ha. Grain yield was better correlated with kernel number than with kernel weight. Unmulched corn usually had the lowest kernel number and lowest grain yield. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Freeze/thaw cycles are {{numerous}} in agricultural soils of the Pacific Northwest. Potential loss of soil by erosion is high whenever a soil thaws {{from the surface}} creating a saturated soil overlying an impermeable frozen layer. Field studies were conducted to investigate the effect of surface residue on soil freezing. Residue treatments were: 1) bare surface, B; 2) standing stubble with no straw mulch between the rows, SSNM; and 3) standing <b>stubble</b> with straw <b>mulch</b> between the rows, SSM. Water migration to the freezing surface and freezing depth were partially controlled through the mulch cover which thermally insulated the soil. The SSM and SSNM treatments reduced the {{depth of frost penetration}} by an average of 35 % compared to the B treatment, {{even in the absence of}} snow cover. During one diurnal freeze/thaw cycle the soil froze to 1. 5 cm on the B treatment; the soil on the SSM treatment did not freeze. Water content of the 0 - to 0. 5 -cm layer increased from 0. 31 at 1800 hours to 0. 57 cm³ /cm³ at 0600 hours on the B treatment. On the unfrozen SSM treatment, water content increased from 0. 34 to 0. 40 cm³ /cm³ during this same time. Soil heat and water flux during a 19 -hour freezing and thawing cycle was numerically simulated using finite differences. The model couples the heat and water flux equations at sub-zero temperatures by the change in soil ice content. An experimental relationship between unfrozen water and sub-zero temperature was used to couple the heat and water flow equations and estimate the change in soil ice content. Field measurements of soil temperature, water content and frost depth were used to validate the model. Measured versus simulated soil temperature at the 1 -cm depth resulted in an r² =. 995. Standard error of the estimate was. 63 °C. Simulated ice and water content of the 0 - to 1 -cm soil layer, at the time of maximum frost penetration, was. 48 g/g, which compares to a measured value of. 44 g/g. Simulated maximum frost depth was 2 cm, which compares to a measured depth of 1. 5 cm. These results validate the usefulness of this model in simulation studies and also support the methods used to obtain the heat and water transport coefficients for this field soil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Long term tillage {{effects may}} be {{characterized}} {{on the basis}} of changes in soil surface hydraulic properties. These properties directly influence infiltration as well as the movement of soil water to the surface during drying. We measured surface soil hydraulic properties on no-till (NT) and conventional (<b>stubble</b> <b>mulch)</b> tillage (CT) plots, each of which was farmed with either a wheat-sorghum-fallow (WSF) or a wheat-fallow (WF) rotation. The plots had been in the same treatments for 12 years. Tension infiltrometers were used to measure steady state infiltration rates at four heads, h (nominally- 2. 0,- 1. 5,- 1. 0, and- 0. 5 kPa, applied in that order), resulting in estimates of hydraulic conductivity, K(h). Both single and multiple-reservoir infiltrometers were constructed. The multiple-reservoir infiltrometer allowed completion of infiltration to steady state at four tensions without disturbance of the flow regime or of soil contact due to re-filling of reservoirs. Hanging water column and pressure plate techniques were used to measure soil water retention values, (h), on undisturbed core samples. The parameter was not well estimated by a nonlinear optimization used to find the parameters Ks and in Wooding’s equation for steady-state flow; so was estimated as the mean of values satisfying Wooding’s equation for any two tensions and flow rates. The K(h) and (h) data were fitted to Mualem’...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{effects of}} {{different}} fallow moisture levels and tillage systems {{on the amount}} of nitrate-nitrogen accumulation in the 0 - 30 cm soil profile were studied. Fallow moisture treatments simulating typical dry, normal and wet precipitation cycles were established on trial plots. Data were obtained for nitrate-nitrogen, soil moisture and nitrogen mineralization potential. Dry, normal and wet fallow moisture treatments had no effect on nitrate-nitrogen accumulation in the 0 - 30 cm soil depth. The nitratenitrogen accumulation rate after August was 2 - 3 times higher than the other periods. This is an important consideration for nitrogen fertilizer application. Fallow tillage treatments consisting of bare fallow, <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> and no-till were established on trial plots. Data were obtained for nitrate-nitrogen, soil temperature, soil moisture and nitrogen mineralization potential. The location of the crop residue as a result of tillage treatment affected the rate of the nitrate-nitrogen accumulation during the various sampling intervals. Spring rains and rewetting the soil surface by rain during September created more favorable conditions for no-till systems. Adequate moisture under the mulch during the summer stimulated the nitrate-nitrogen accumulation under the bare fallow systems. The amount of mineral nitrogen obtained by a calculation procedure and measurement in fallow plots were compared during two fallow periods. The calculation procedure consistently produced higher values than the field measurements but the two values were always proportionate...|$|E

ABSTRACT: On-farm experiments were conducted to evaluate two jab planters for planting maize in the forest zone of Ghana in 2014 major season. One of the jab planters was imported from China; and we fabricated the other. The experiments were conducted at 3 farmers ’ fields (sites) and the design was a factorial with sites as replications. Factor A was method of land preparation (ridges and no-till with <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch)</b> and factor B was planting device (Chinese jab planter, Local jab planter and cutlass). On the average, it took about 9 hours, 11 hours and 23 hours 37 minutes to plant one hectare of maize with the Chinese Jab planter, local jab planter and cutlass in that order. Consistently, there were more hills with maize seedlings on the ridges than on the no till plots. At one site, pests removed maize from the entire no-till plots, but removal was very low on the ridges. There was no significant (P> 0. 05) difference in yield among the treatments studied. Some farmers in Ghana now broadcast maize and cowpea seed due to scarcity and/or high cost of labour for planting. Economic analysis showed that it is about 100 % cheaper to plant with the jab planters than with cutlass. The jab planters could be promoted to reduce drudgery, time and cost of planting maize...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{is usually}} the {{nutrient}} most limiting production in semiarid ecosystems and at very low concentrations can seriously impact ecosystem processes. Soil from five mines, incorporating a number of commonly used land reclamation practices (grazing vs. un-grazed; stockpiled vs. direct hauled soil; shrub mosaic vs. grass seed mix; and <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> vs. hay mulch), were sampled and analyzed for soil total N (TN) and microbial biomass N (MBN). All mines were located in semiarid Wyoming in either mixed-grass or sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The various management practices investigated appeared to have little influence on TN. Reclaimed soils averaged 30 % less TN than undisturbed native soils, suggesting that N could potentially limit vegetation production. Only two reclaimed sites (grass and shrub) at Mine 1 contained a greater mass of TN than an undisturbed site, and while the reason is unclear, greater precipitation (20 % higher relative to the other sites sampled) may be responsible. The microbial communities present in undisturbed soils appear to uptake N more efficiently than microbial communities present in reclaimed soil, relative to total soil N. As N fertilizer is only rarely used in Wyoming surface mines, N can only accumulate in a reclaimed soil via wet or dry deposition or by N-fixation by free-living micro-organisms or through symbiotic relationships. However, as legumes are typically only a small component of the vegetation, presumably deposition and/or microbial fixation of N {{are responsible for the}} majority of N accumulation in these ecosystems. Despite the low TN in reclaimed soils, high plant production on these reclaimed soils suggests that TN is not limiting production...|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceRidge {{culture is}} a special {{conservation}} tillage method, but the long-term influence of this tillage system on soil aggregate-size stability in paddy fields is largely unknown in southwest of china. The objectives of this paper are to evaluate soil aggregates stability and to determine the relationship between SOC and soil aggregate stability. Soil samples at 0 - 20 cm layer were adopted from a long-term (16 yr) field experiment including conventional tillage: plain culture, summer rice crop and winter upland crop under drained conditions (PUR-r), and conservation tillage: ridge culture without tillage, summer rice and winter fallow with floodwater layer annually (NTR-f), and winter upland crop under drained conditions (NTR-r), and wide ridge culture without tillage, summer rice crop and winter upland crop under conditions (NTRw-r), respectively. The determination of aggregate-size stability distribution involves the assumptions that soil aggregates can be categorized {{in terms of their}} size and water stability (slaking resistance). Experimentally this procedure involves the slaked and capillary-wetted pretreatments; and a subsequent slaking treatment of aggregates > 0. 250 mm in size. WSMA and NMWD were applied to simulate the breakdown mechanisms of aggregates for studying soil stability based on aggregate resistance to slaking in paddy soil. The results showed that the amount of aggregates-size was greatly observed in the fraction of 2 ~ 6. 72 mm under ridge culture in paddy soil (more than 50 %) under slaking and capillary-wetting pretreatment. The proportion of soil macro-aggregates (> 0. 25 mm) in conservation tillage was greatly higher than that in conventional tillage under subsequent slaking treatment. Minimal differences of aggregate stability between slaking and wetting were observed, while {{significant differences were found between}} ridge culture and plain culture. The aggregates stability under slaking treatment ranked in the order of NTR-r>NTRw-r>NTR-f>PUR-r, while under wetting was NTRw-r>NTR-r>NTR-f>PUR-r, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the aggregates stability and SOC concentrations under wetting, and low correlation was observed under slaking pretreatment. Soil exposure with tillage and lack of rice/rape-seed stubble inputs caused declines in aggregation and organic carbon, both of which make soil susceptible to water erosion. Adoption of ridge culture with no-tillage integrated with crop rotation and <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> significantly alter soil organic concentration, suggesting it was a valuable conservation practice for soil aggregation and soil organic carbon sequestration on paddy soil...|$|E
40|$|Volatilization {{of ammonia}} (NH 3) from animal manure {{is a major}} pathway for {{nitrogen}} (N) losses that cause eutrophication, acidification, and other environmental hazards. In this study, the effect of alternative techniques of manure treatment (aeration, separation, addition of peat) and application (broadcast spreading, band spreading, injection, incorporation by harrowing) on NH 3 emissions {{in the field and}} N uptake by ley or cereals was studied. The effect of a mixture of slurry and peat on soil properties was also investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} find ways to improve the utilization of manure N and reduce its release to the environment. Injection into the soil or incorporation by harrowing clearly reduced NH 3 volatilization from slurry more than did the surface application onto a smaller area by band spreading or reduction of the dry matter of slurry by aeration or separation. Surface application showed low NH 3 volatilization, when pig slurry was applied to tilled bare clay soil or to spring wheat stands in early growth stages. Apparently, the properties of both slurry and soil enabled the rapid infiltration and absorption of slurry and its ammoniacal N by the soil. On ley, however, surface-applied cattle slurry lost about half of its ammoniacal N. The volatilization of NH 3 from surface-applied peat manure was slow, but proceeded over a long period of time. After rain or irrigation, the peat manure layer on the soil surface retarded evaporation. Incorporation was less important for the fertilizer effect of peat manure than for pig slurry, but both manures were more effective when incorporated. Peat manure applications increase soil organic matter content and aggregate stability. <b>Stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage hastens the effect in surface soil compared with ploughing. The apparent recovery of ammoniacal manure N in crop yield was higher with injection and incorporation than with surface applications. This was the case for leys as well as for spring cereals, even though NH 3 losses from manures applied to cereals were relatively low with surface applications as well. The ammoniacal N of surface-applied slurry was obviously adsorbed by the very surface soil and remained mostly unavailable to plants roots in the dry soil. Supplementing manures with inorganic fertilizer N, which adds plant-available N to the soil at the start of growth, increased the overall recovery of applied N in crop yields...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Cephalosporium stripe, {{caused by}} the soil-borne ascomycete Cephalosporium gramineum, is {{becoming}} an increasingly important disease of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) in several areas of the world, especially where <b>stubble</b> <b>mulch</b> is practiced to maintain soil moisture and prevent erosion. As cultural control of the disease is infeasible and no fungicides are registered, the development of resistant cultivars offers {{the best hope for}} disease control. Selection of resistant genotypes remains problematic due to the requirements of evaluating adult plants in variable field environments. The symptoms of cephalosporium stripe suggest the involvement of pathogen-produced toxins, and the toxin called graminin A has previously been isolated from C. gramineum. The goals of this thesis were to determine if insensitivity of wheat genotypes to a toxic fraction produced by C. gramineum is associated with resistance to cephalosporium stripe, and to evaluate the potential use of this toxic fraction to screen wheat genotypes for disease resistance. A method was developed to mass-produce a toxic fraction of C. gramineum by modifying the method of K. Kobayashi (Kobayashi and Ui 1977). Large volumes (9 L) of broth medium were inoculated with C. gramineum and incubated for 35 days. The culture filtrate was then extracted four times with ethyl acetate, which eliminated need for the most time-consuming step of rotary evaporation. Reversed phase fractionation of the crude extract was used to isolate the toxic fraction. Leaves from fourteen-day-old wheat plants were excised and placed in scintillation vials containing the toxic fraction. Exposure to a concentration of(60 μl/ml) of the toxic fraction for 72 hours produced distinct wilting symptoms that allowed us to distinguish wheat genotypes in a repeatable manner. Degree of wilting was measured on a continuous 1 - 5 scale, where 1 = no wilting and 5 = a fully wilted leaf. Twenty wheat genotypes, belonging to four distinct germplasm groups (common, club, durum, and synthetic) were included in three runs of the toxin assay. Wilting reactions for the 20 genotypes were very consistent among runs. Sensitivity of the individual genotypes to the toxic fraction did not differ significantly within germplasm groups, but all differences among the means of the four germplasm groups were highly significant (P< 0. 001) based on linear contrasts. Seventeen winter wheat genotypes representing the common, club, and durum germplasm groups were planted in infested fields at two locations. The percentage of tillers showing whitehead symptoms (early maturity and reduced grainfill) was significantly correlated with wilting symptoms measured by the toxin assay. The common and durum genotypes varied more for disease susceptibility than for toxin insensitivity. However, all pairwise linear contrasts between means of the whitehead percentages for the three germplasm groups were highly significant (P< 0. 001). Failure of the toxin assay to identify some of the moderately resistant common wheat genotypes suggests that additional mechanisms of resistance are operative. As no toxin-insensitive genotype showed susceptibility to cephalosporium stripe in the field experiments, however, the toxin assay can be used as an initial screening procedure {{to reduce the number of}} genotypes to be tested in the field...|$|E
