5|$|Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell {{created the}} concept model that {{established}} the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for Star Wars (1977). Star Wars creator George Lucas liked the basic design {{consisting of two}} panels connected by a <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ball-shaped cockpit, but Cantwell's concept had few details. Joe Johnston created additional details, such as the cockpit window and the attachment points between the solar panels and the hull.|$|E
5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{existence}} of snake charmers, {{there have also been}} professional snake catchers or wranglers. Modern-day snake trapping involves a herpetologist using a long <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> V- shaped end. Some television show hosts, like Bill Haast, Austin Stevens, Steve Irwin, and Jeff Corwin, prefer to catch them using bare hands.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} kit-drumming sticks are wooden sticks modeled on, {{or in some}} cases {{identical}} to, those originally designed for use with the snare drum. These {{come in a variety of}} weights, conventionally expressed as a number, and tip designs, expressed as a letter following the number, with the higher numbers indicating lighter sticks. Thus, a 7A is a common jazz <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wooden tip, while a 7N is the same weight, with a nylon tip, and a 7B is a wooden tip but with a different tip profile (shorter and rounder than a 7A). A 5A is a common wood tipped rock stick, heavier than a 7A but with a similar profile. The numbers are most commonly odd but even numbers are used occasionally, in the range 2 (heaviest) to 9 (lightest).|$|E

500|$|A defender is {{a player}} {{position}} whose primary {{responsibility is to}} prevent the opposing team from scoring. Unlike in field lacrosse where some defensive players carry [...] "long poles" [...] (a lacrosse <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] shaft or handle), all box lacrosse defenders play with a maximum [...] long stick. Defensive tactics include cross checking (where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance), body checking (where a player makes contact with the opposition player in order to slow him down), and stick checking (where a player makes contact with the opposition player's stick in order to knock the ball loose).|$|E
500|$|Rick Kogan, {{television}} critic {{with the}} Chicago Tribune, called the show [...] "wholly original" [...] and {{an example of}} how good television entertainment can be. He praised the ensemble cast and interesting characters, and said the show would be renewed [...] "if there's any justice in TV". Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with. In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become as rare as quality itself. [...] " [...] Steven Cole Smith with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said of the evaluation period during Homicides second season: [...] "If you don't watch it, you may lose your right to complain that there's never anything good on TV." [...] He called it [...] "a gritty, atmospheric police series" [...] and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but the consequences of it.|$|E
500|$|The atlatl (spear-thrower) was {{introduced}} to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic. This was a [...] <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> notched end to hold a dart or javelin. The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone. Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior. Commoners used blowguns in war, which also served as their hunting weapon. The bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting. Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic. The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E

2500|$|Players usually seek a {{lie that}} will put the blade flat on the ice while {{they are in their}} typical skating stance. [...] Hall of Fame center Wayne Gretzky, for example, used a <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low lie to {{correspond}} with his deep skating crouch and shorter height, whereas Hall of Fame defenceman Rod Langway used a <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very high lie number as he was very tall and tended to skate in a very upright position.|$|E

2500|$|It {{may well}} be that, in this context, [...] "runne" [...] meant running in general. For a long time, {{until well into the}} 18th century, the scorers sat on the field and {{increments}} to the score were known as [...] "notches" [...] because they would notch the scores on a <b>stick,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deeper knick at 20, which of course represented a score.

2500|$|Field {{lacrosse}} is the men's outdoor {{version of}} the sport. There are ten players on each team: three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and one goalie. Each player carries a lacrosse stick. A short stick measures between 40 and 42 inches (about 1 meter) long and is used by attackmen and midfielders. A maximum of four players on the field per team may carry a long stick which is between 52 and 72 inches (1.3 to 1.8 meters) long and {{is used by the}} three defensemen and and sometimes one defensive midfielder. The goalie uses a <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> head as wide as 12 inches (30 centimeters) that can be between 40 and 72 inches long.|$|E
2500|$|A violin {{is usually}} played using a bow {{consisting}} of a <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ribbon of horsehair strung between the tip and frog (or nut, or heel) at opposite ends. A typical violin bow may be [...] overall, and weigh about [...] Viola bows may be about [...] shorter and [...] heavier. At the frog end, a screw adjuster tightens or loosens the hair. Just forward of the frog, a leather thumb cushion, called the grip, and winding protect the stick and provide a strong grip for the player's hand. The winding may be wire (often silver or plated silver), silk, or whalebone (now imitated by alternating strips of tan and black plastic.) Some student bows (particularly the ones made of solid fiberglass) substitute a plastic sleeve for grip and winding.|$|E

2500|$|Atlatls, {{consisting}} of a weighted <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flexible spear or dart, are one example of primitive weapons that are commonly used today. In the U.S., the Pennsylvania Game Commission has given preliminary approval [...] for the legalization of the atlatl for hunting certain animals. The animals that {{would be allowed to}} atlatl hunters have yet to be determined, but attention is focused on deer. There are some who object, stating that the atlatl is rarely capable of a clean kill, resulting in undue suffering for the sport animal. As of 2007, only Alabama allowed the use of the atlatl for deer hunting, with a few other states allowing its use for rough fish (rather than food or sport species), as well as some game birds and non-game mammals.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "outside of the box" [...] {{thinking}} {{incorporated by}} AMC in the Pacer {{as the first}} [...] "wide, small car" [...] attempted to capture a revolutionary change in marketplace, but {{a radical departure from}} what was accepted by consumers as [...] "good styling" [...] was a risky strategy. Only the largest firms can <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> radical element until it [...] "grows," [...] and the automaker’s dominance in the marketplace may eventually establish it as a standard feature. However, by the late 1970s the styling research axiom no longer applied that if a car with some controversial styling was liked by {{at least half of the}} potential market segment; then chances were good that this feature was a differential advantage for the manufacturer. The AMC Pacer incorporated many controversial styling and design innovations that led to its market failure after five model years.|$|E
2500|$|John Ricciardi, {{writing for}} Electronic Gaming Monthly, called Nintendo's {{decision}} to <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cartridge format for the Nintendo 64 stubborn. The author {{called it a}} major contributor to the company's competitive disadvantages, even more so than the failed partnership with Sony to create a CD format and console. [...] EDN Magazine said that the Nintendo 64 Game Paks are [...] "bulky and expensive, eating into Nintendo’s profit margins compared with competitors’ inexpensive CD and DVD plastic discs". The Los Angeles Times praised Nintendo's choice of the cartridge medium with its [...] "nonexistent" [...] load times and [...] "continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver", concluding that [...] "the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish". Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the Times cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to [...] "place a premium on substance over flash", and noted that the launch titles lack the [...] "poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures" [...] which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games.|$|E
