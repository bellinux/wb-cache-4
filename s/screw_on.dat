25|$|Spinning reels {{have two}} types of drag: front or rear. Front drags, which have the {{adjustment}} located on the spool itself, are mechanically simpler, usually more consistent in performance and capable of higher drag forces. Rear drags, with the adjustment <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> {{the back of the}} reel, are more complicated mechanically and usually not as precise or smooth as front drags since the drag itself is often part of the drive shaft and not the spool. They are however, easier to adjust in mid-fight.|$|E
500|$|The {{sight head}} was mounted {{on top of}} a square platform, with screw {{adjustments}} {{that could be used to}} level the platform. A spirit level on the sight allowed it to be checked. The normally periodic and minor changes required to level the sighting head could be performed by removing the cover over the [...] spirit level and then turning a small adjusting <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the mount. Pressing the release lever unlocked the sighting head from the mounting shaft on the left of the platform, allowing the sight to be removed and then re-attached simply by sliding it back onto the shaft, maintaining the level setting between missions.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1894, Tesla began {{investigating}} what {{he referred}} to as radiant energy of [...] "invisible" [...] kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as [...] "Roentgen rays" [...] or [...] "X-Rays"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement {{of the discovery of}} x-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube.

500|$|In 1967 the BBC {{commissioned}} Britten {{to write}} an opera specially for television. Owen Wingrave was based, like The Turn of the <b>Screw,</b> <b>on</b> a ghost story by Henry James. By the 1960s Britten found composition much slower than in his prolific youth; he told the 28-year-old composer Nicholas Maw, [...] "Get as much done now as you can, because it gets much, much more difficult as you grow older." [...] He did not complete the score of the new opera until August 1970. Owen Wingrave was first broadcast in Britain in May 1971, when it was also televised in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and Yugoslavia.|$|E

500|$|The {{engine system}} {{was divided into}} four engine rooms, all on the centerline. Each room {{contained}} a turbine and two boilers, without any division between the boilers and turbines. This was done to limit the risk of capsizing should the ship sustain heavy flooding in the engine rooms. The engine rooms alternated in their layout: {{the first and third}} engine rooms were arranged with the turbine on the starboard side and its corresponding boilers on the port, this was reversed in the second and fourth rooms. The forward-most engine room powered the starboard outer shaft, the second turbine drove the outer <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the port side, the third engine supplied power to the inner starboard propeller, and the fourth turbine drove the port-side inner screw. All four screws had four blades; the two outer propellers were [...] in diameter and the inner pair were [...] wide. Steering was controlled by a pair of rudders.|$|E

500|$|The {{sea mink}} was pursued by fur traders {{due to its}} large size; this made it more {{desirable}} than other mink species further inland. The unregulated trade eventually led to its extinction, which {{is thought to have}} occurred between 1860 and 1920. The sea mink was seldom sighted after 1860. The last two recorded kills of a sea mink were made in Maine in 1880 near Jonesport, Maine, and Campobello Island in New Brunswick in 1894, although the 1894 kill is speculated to be of large American minks. Fur traders made traps to catch sea minks and also pursued them with dogs, although they were rarely trapped. If a sea mink escaped into a small hole on the rocky ledges, it was dug out by hunters using shovels and crowbars. If it was out of reach of the hunters, it was shot and then retrieved using an iron rod with a <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the far end. If it was hiding, it was smoked out and suffocated. The minks' nocturnal behavior may have been caused from pressure by fur traders who hunted them in daylight.|$|E

2500|$|The first Stevens 520 {{appeared}} in Stevens' 1909 Catalog #52 {{and was also}} offered {{for sale in the}} Fall 1909 Sears & Roebuck catalog. It is easily recognizable by its [...] "Humpback" [...] double hump receiver. [...] It had a round slide release knob {{on the left side of}} the receiver, a visible breech locking bolt on the top of the receiver, and base models had a rounded pistol grip on the butt stock. The fore grip was ringed and uniform in size. The trigger housing was retained with three screws and the safety was a lever located inside the trigger guard in front of the trigger. The cartridge stop was a rocker design with a set <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> front right side of the receiver. There were other models including a Model 522 trap gun and the 525, 530, and 535 with increasing levels of engraving and stock quality (some straight grip) and fore grips. Internally there was an inertial slide release block that was affixed to the inside of the receiver. [...] This inertial release used the recoil of a discharged round to unlock the breech. [...] The action was designed to only unlock after firing or with use of the slide release and not by dry firing like many modern shotguns. [...] All model 520s were only offered in 12 gauge until 1928.|$|E
2500|$|To {{illustrate}} that a wheelset trajectory follows a curved path, one may place a nail or <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> a flat table top {{and give it}} a push. [...] It will roll in a curved circle because the nail or screw is like a wheelset with extremely different diameter wheels. [...] The head is analogous to a large diameter wheel and the pointed end is like a small diameter wheel. [...] While the nail or screw will turn around in a full circle (and more) the railroad wheelset behaves differently because as soon at it starts to turn in a curve, the effective diameters change {{in such a way as}} to decrease the curvature of the path. [...] Note that [...] "radius" [...] and [...] "curvature" [...] refer to the curvature of the trajectory of the wheelset and not the curvature of the railway since this is perfectly straight track. [...] As the wheelset rolls on, the curvature decreases until the wheels reach the point where their effective diameters are equal and the path is no longer curving. [...] But the trajectory has a slope at this point (it is a straight line which crosses diagonally over the centerline of the track) so that it overshoots the centerline of the track and the effective diameters reverse (the formerly smaller diameter wheel becomes the larger diameter and conversely). [...] This results in the wheelset moving in a curve in the opposite direction. [...] Again it overshoots the centerline and this phenomenon continues indefinitely with the wheelset oscillating from side to side. [...] Note that the wheel flange never makes contact with the rail. [...] In this model, the rails are assumed to always contact the wheel tread along the same line on the rail head which assumes that the rails are knife-edge and only make contact with the wheel tread along a line (of zero width).|$|E

40|$|In {{posterior}} {{pedicle screw}} instrumentation of thoracic idiopathic scoliosis, screw malposition might cause significant morbidity in tems of possible pleural, spinal cord, and aorta injury. Preoperative axial magnetic resonace images (MRI) in 12 consecutive patients with right thoracic adolescent scoliosis, all with King type 3 curves, were analyzed {{in order to}} evaluate {{the relationship between the}} inserted pedicle screw position to pleura, spinal cord, aorta. Axial vertebral images for each thoracic level were scanned and the simulation of pedicle screw insertion was performed using a digital measurement programme. The angular contact value for each parameter regarding the pleura and spinal cord was measured {{on both sides of the}} curve. The aorta-vertebral distance was also measured. Aorta-vertebral distance was found to be decreasing gradually from the cephalad to the caudad with the shortest distance being measured at T 12 with a mean of 1. 2  mm. Concave-sided <b>screws</b> <b>on</b> T 5 –T 9 and convex-sided <b>screws</b> <b>on</b> T 2 –T 3 had the greatest risk to spinal cord injury. Pleural injury is most likely on T 4 –T 9 segments by the convex side screws. T 4 –T 8 <b>screws</b> <b>on</b> the concave side and T 11 –T 12 <b>screws</b> <b>on</b> the convex side may pose risk to the aorta. This MRI-based study demonstrated that in pedicle instrumentation of thoracic levels, every segment deserves special consideration, where computer scanning might be mandatory in immature spine and in patients with severe deformity...|$|R
