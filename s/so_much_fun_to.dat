[...] "She is just <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> work with," [...] Cuarón told Cinematical. [...] "She is just pulling the rug out from under your feet all the time.

They also declared victory after one election, claiming all candidates were Rhinoceroses, whether they knew or acknowledged it: thick-skinned, short-sighted, mean-tempered, etc.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} of Monty Python's 25th anniversary, in 1994, the point was already being made that [...] "the five {{surviving}} members had with the passing years begun to occupy an institutional position in the edifice of British social culture that they had once had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> trying <b>to</b> demolish". A similar point is made in a 2006 book {{on the relationship between}} Monty and philosophy: [...] "It is remarkable, after all, not only that the utterly bizarre Monty Python's Flying Circus was sponsored by the BBC in the first place, but that Monty Python itself grew into an institution of enormous cultural influence." ...|$|R

[...] When a friend, Brandon Monk, had a basketball court installed in his back yard, Stevens [...] "appeared instantaneously." [...] He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches over to Monk's house, so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook.|$|E

I love the Stamford characters. Everyone is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> work with." [...] This version {{contained}} two new story lines and other minor additions and changes, including Meredith remembering an agreement {{to have sex with}} a coworker {{on the final day of}} employment, Creed selling electronics and furniture from the office, Andy having a plan in case he gets laid off, and Ryan admitting that Kelly has a strange power over him.|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{ended in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her then-untitled fourth studio album. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, worked on a track titled [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{and sent it to}} the singer. Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote [...] "Two Black Cadillacs", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him. Underwood said that [...] "it was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write and just be in that room" [...] with Lindsey and Kear, as they [...] "didn't really know what to expect or where we were headed or what we would end up with."

5000|$|Forty-six {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three raced because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Truex, Jr. clinched his seventh pole position during his career, {{with a time}} of 28.366 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kenseth. Biffle qualified third, Martin took fourth, and Kasey Kahne started fifth. Newman, Ambrose, Keselowski, Jamie McMurray, and Johnson rounded out the first ten positions. The drivers who failed to qualify for the race were David Stremme, Joe Nemechek and Stacy Compton. Once the qualifying session concluded, Truex, Jr. said, [...] "That's our main goal. This team's good enough. We can get to Victory Lane. We're going to do it soon. I feel good about this team. I'm just having <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> coming <b>to</b> the race track and driving these cars. We're going to make them proud here pretty quick." ...|$|R
5000|$|Loewenthal later recalled, [...] "we {{just started}} making music in our bedroom, which {{was like a}} big granny flat sort of thing. The first Tora track we made in four days - 'Unobtainable' - it just came {{together}} and we were like 'wow'. Electronic music is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play and make... So we made that track then stewed on it, then made heaps of tracks - then after a while we just decided to put them up and see what people thought. We got a much better reaction than we'd ever had for Alice Blu - so we were a bit excited about that." [...] According to Byron Bay Festival's correspondent, they played a [...] "blend of ambient harmonies, layered rhythms and pulsing soundscapes." [...] Aside from electronica they perform in the new-age genre, chillwave.|$|R
500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write." ...|$|E
500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E
500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> program {{in and it}} takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables {{so that you could}} position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

The site is great for teachers to explain to their class how the rock cycle works. The pictures help students to see the circle the rock cycle creates. I would use this site in a powerpoint presentation. This information and the picture of the rock cycle is easy to follow and great for the students to see the difference of each rock. The information that is given in the site is easy to follow and provides a detailed illustration of how a rock cycle works. I also liked the engaging questions at the end that ask the student how to tell one rock from another. ...|$|R

[...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you need to play loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold.

500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun.

500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E
500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play {{because it was a}} lighter side. A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch up and have fun in the process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was just great to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters. The Volkswagen campus van — still in operating condition — along with Hurley's Camaro, were later auctioned off with other Lost props and costumes at the Santa Monica Airport in 2010.|$|E

Her outstanding rendition of [...] "At Last" [...] by Etta James during the try-outs threw off many fans and viewers alike, whom had not learned of her recent name change from marriage or her relocation. Some web postings suggested Williams was made to be a [...] "plant" [...] in the competition, given she already had a career and singing credits to her name. She recounted the time: [...] "It was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> getting <b>to</b> be myself, not as the actor or celebrity, but as just another face in a sea of hopefuls, just wanting to sing." [...] Her voluntary obscurity wouldn't last long. She then returned to film making, starring in the Paramount Pictures psychological thriller, Circle of Eight and then a recurring role on the CW television show Vampire Diaries, playing [...] "Lucy", cousin to the long line of Bennett Witches on the show. In 2011, Natashia gave birth to her second child, Braden, and continues to work as a model and actor.

American film reviewer Leonard Maltin said the film is a [...] "hilariously solemn, high camp British imitation of U. S. cheapies". The reviewer for the British Monthly Film Bulletin (1954) wrote that the [...] "settings, dialogue, characterisation and special effects are of a low order, but even their modest unreality has its charm. There is really no fault in this film that one would like to see eliminated. Everything, in its way, is quite perfect". In the book Going to Mars the authors described the film as [...] "an undeniably awful but oddly interesting" [...] film. They noted that the plot was [...] "more a reflection of the 1950s view of politics and the era's inequality of the sexes than a thoughtful projection of present or future possibilities".|$|R

In the episode, she played various characters, including Heidi Klum, as well as singing [...] "What is this Feeling" [...] from Wicked in a mock battle with SNL cast member Kristen Wiig during the opening monologue. Adams appeared in Charlie Wilson's War as Bonnie Bach, the title character's administrative assistant. On the experience of making the film, Adams said, [...] "It was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> Just <b>to</b> be on that set and learn from these people and get to watch Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Hanks do these amazing scenes together, directed by Mike Nichols, it was for me like going to school." [...] Adams' next project was Sunshine Cleaning playing a single mother who starts her own crime scene clean-up business in order to make enough money to send her son to a private school. The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and received mixed reviews. When it received a limited theatrical release in March 2009, it was generally well received.
