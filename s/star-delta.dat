The Y, spelled out as wye, can also be called T or star; the Δ, spelled out as delta, can also be called triangle, Π (spelled out as pi), or mesh.

50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} electrical receptacle or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor. When energized, a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. Reduced-voltage, <b>star-delta</b> or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors. Very large motors running on medium voltage power supplies (thousands of volts) may use power circuit breakers as switching elements.|$|E
50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{starting}} a polyphase motor are used. Where a large inrush current and high starting torque can be permitted, the motor can be started across the line, by applying full line voltage to the terminals (direct-on-line, DOL). Where {{it is necessary to}} limit the starting inrush current (where the motor is large compared with the short-circuit capacity of the supply), the motor is started at reduced voltage using either series inductors, an autotransformer, thyristors, or other devices. A technique sometimes used is <b>star-delta</b> (YΔ) starting, where the motor coils are initially connected in star configuration for acceleration of the load, then switched to delta configuration when the load is up to speed. This technique is more common in Europe than in North America. Transistorized drives can directly vary the applied voltage as required by the starting characteristics of the motor and load.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} the Synchronous Reluctance Motor (SynRM) performance for a conventional star winding {{and for a}} combined <b>star-delta</b> connected winding under healthy and faulty conditions. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to simulate the SynRM characteristics in case of normal star and in case of combined <b>star-delta</b> connected windings. For the healthy case, {{it was found that}} for the same current, the SynRM output power increased by about 5 % for the <b>star-delta</b> connected windings compared with the conventional star connection. Moreover, the efficiency increased slightly by 0. 20 %. Probably the strongest advantage of the combined <b>star-delta</b> winding is observed when a phase fault occurs. When one phase is missing, for the same current, the <b>star-delta</b> connected motor keeps 80 % of the rated torque in the healthy case, while the star connected motor only keeps 40 %.

40|$|This paper compares four {{prototype}} Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SynRMs) {{having an}} identical geometry of iron lamination stacks in the stator and rotor. Two different stator winding layouts are employed: a conventional three-phase star connection and a combined <b>star–delta</b> winding. In addition, two rotors are considered: a conventional rotor without magnets and a rotor with ferrite magnets. The {{performance of the}} four SynRMs is evaluated using a two-dimensional (2 D) Finite Element Model (FEM). For the same copper volume and current, the combined star–delta-connected stator with Permanent Magnets (PMs) in the rotor corresponds to an approximately 22 % increase in the output torque at rated current and speed compared to the conventional machine. This improvement is mainly thanks to adding ferrite PMs in the rotor {{as well as to}} the improved winding factor of the combined <b>star–delta</b> winding. The torque gain increases up to 150 % for low current. Moreover, the rated efficiency is 93. 60 % compared to 92. 10 % for the conventional machine. On the other hand, the impact on the power factor and losses of SynRM when using the <b>star–delta</b> windings instead of the star windings is merely negligible. The theoretical results are experimentally validated using four identical prototype machines with identical lamination stacks but different rotors and winding layouts...|$|E

It has been estimated that induction motors consumes approximately 50 of all the electric energy generated. Further in the area of renewable energy sources such as wind or bio-mass energy induction machines have been found suitable for functioning as generators. In this context it may be mentioned that a <b>star-delta</b> switching is common for the starting of three-phase induction motor. Now it is proposed to use this <b>star-delta</b> switching for energy conservation of induction machines i. e. at times of reduced loads the machine switched back to star connection. Using a three-phase 400 V 50 Hz 4 -pole induction machine it has been demonstrated that the <b>star-delta</b> switching of stator winding of three-phase induction machine motor generator operations reconnected in star at suitable reduced loads with a switching arrangement can result in improved efficiency and power factor as compared to a fixed delta or star connection.

In the present study the occurrence and effects of these conversions during plasminogen activation by HMW-STAR were studied in purified systems and in human plasma. In stoichiometric mixtures of HMW-STAR and native human plasminogen (Glu-plasminogen), rapid and quantitative conversion of HMW-STAR to LMW-STAR occurred, concomitant with exposure of the active site in the plasmin-STAR complex. NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed the sequence Lys-Gly-Asp- {{in addition to the}} known sequences of the Lys-plasmin chains, identifying <b>STAR-delta</b> 10 as the derivative generated from HMW-STAR. In mixtures of catalytic amount of HMW-STAR and human plasminogen, plasmin generation occurred progressively, following an initial lag phase, during which HMW-STAR was converted to LMW-STAR. Plasmin-mediated conversion of HMW-STAR to LMW-STAR obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km = 3. 6 microM and k 2 = 0. 38 s- 1.

Different topologies reported in literature for 3 P- 4 W UPQC use active compensation for the mitigation of source neutral current along with other power quality (PQ) problems, while the uses of passive elements for the mitigation of source neutral current are advantageous over the active compensation due to ruggedness and less complexity of control. Hence, in this paper a <b>star-delta</b> transformer is connected in shunt near the load for mitigation of source neutral current, while three-leg voltage source inverters (VSIs) based shunt and series active power filters (APFs) of 3 P- 4 W UPQC mitigate the current and voltage based distortions, respectively. A simple control algorithm based on Unit Vector Template Generation (UVTG) is used as a control strategy of UPQC for mitigation of different PQ problems. In this control scheme, the current/voltage control is applied over the fundamental supply currents/load voltages instead of fast changing APFs currents/voltages, thereby reducing the effects of computational delay and the required sensors.

This project aims to study the effect of voltage sag during starting of large induction motors by using three different starting methods i. e. direct online, <b>star-delta</b> and autotransformer. An 11 kV induction motor of kiln main drive utilised in a cement factory has been modelled and tested using various motor ratings.
