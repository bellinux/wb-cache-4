40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that credit {{has a positive}} effect on children's schooling among poor households. This article shows that need not be the case when households obtain credit for investment purposes. In fact, <b>investment</b> <b>loans</b> may not have any effect on the likelihood of schooling for children who work in their family business. Our estimates confirm that this is the case; credit used to finance investments has no effect on the odds of schooling for employed children. This may be because <b>investment</b> <b>loans</b> increase children's labour productivity, which in turn increases the opportunity cost of schooling. The {{results of this study suggest}} that improving access to credit may not, by itself, constitute a solution to the problem of child labour in developing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Realizing {{innovations}} {{usually requires}} substantial and <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> from {{firms in the}} development of relevant resources and competencies. Although these investments are essential to develop a firm’s readiness for action necessary to realize an innovation in the future, they bear the risk of an uncomplete amortization due to unforeseen and unfavorable developments of firm internal and external settings. Hence, the success and commitment effect of <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> lead to a strategic trade-off for firms which constitutes a major challenge in the strategic management of <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> in innovations. In this context the thesis takes up the important role of inter-organizational cooperation for firms’ competitiveness and elaborates on the research question of how actors can use inter-organizational cooperation to manage <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> in innovations and to deal with the resulting strategic trade-off. The thesis addresses a fundamental research gap in the existing specificity research by drawing on the consistent, multi-level theoretical framework of the Competence-based Theory of the Firm (CbTF) and its interpretation of specificity as an endogenous decision variable and strategic management construct. In transaction cost economics as well as in resource- and competence-based approaches, little {{attention has been paid to}} the strategic management of specificity and the role of inter-organizational cooperation in this context. The nucleus of this behavioral dissertation is the analysis of an empirical, longitudinal single case study in the German health care sector. Applying an iterative research design, a multi-level process model is developed that illustrates the co-evolutionary management process of a <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> and its implications on actors using inter-organizational cooperation. The research findings show that actors use inter-organizational cooperation to exert influence on firms’ external settings via standardization processes, to develop relevant competencies for the use of the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> ex ante and to customize the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> ex post. The aim of these cooperative management strategies is to assure the future utilization of the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> in first best or second best alternatives. By providing an understanding of inter-organizational cooperation as a strategic instrument to manage <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> over time, the thesis formulates theoretical and practical contributions, notably with regard to the management of investments in innovations in uncertain environments...|$|R

These types of investments increase switching costs and thereby create barriers towards exiting. Additionally, high levels of relationship <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> enhance partners’ ability and willingness to resort to voice when defections and conflicts arise, and hence postpone exit. Moreover, partner <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> may emerge as a consequence of individual- or organizational level ties. Furthermore, we argue that organizational dimensions, such as centralization, formalization, size and levels of inclusiveness and inter-organizational dimensions, such as history moderate the effect of interpersonal and inter-organizational ties upon relationship dissolution...|$|R
40|$|The authors analyze {{incomplete}} {{contracts to}} induce efficient investment. With exogenous switching costs, fixed-price contracts are efficient, generate some rigidity in prices, are renegotiated intermittently by possibly small amounts, and when inflation is positive, generate asymmetric responses to shocks, all consistent with evidence on prices and wages. With two-sided <b>specific</b> <b>investments,</b> efficiency requires prices to have sufficient escalator clauses to avoid renegotiation, as observed in many long-term contracts. A third case, with one-sided <b>specific</b> <b>investments,</b> can generate 'take or pay' contracts {{and explain why}} firms sometimes pay for <b>specific</b> <b>investments</b> that appear to benefit employees directly.
