25|$|A <b>skid</b> <b>loader</b> or {{skid steer}} loader is a small rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E

50|$|A skid-steer loader can {{sometimes}} be used {{in place of a}} large excavator by digging a hole from the inside. The <b>skid</b> <b>loader</b> first digs a ramp leading {{to the edge of the}} desired excavation. It then uses the ramp to carry material out of the hole. The <b>skid</b> <b>loader</b> reshapes the ramp making it steeper and longer as the excavation deepens. This method is particularly useful for digging under a structure where overhead clearance does not allow for the boom of a large excavator, such as digging a basement under an existing house. Several companies make backhoe attachments for skid-steers. These are more effective for digging in a small area than the method above and can work in the same environments. Other applications may consist of transporting raw material around a job site, or assisting in the rough grading process.|$|E

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 53 - 54) Machines {{have become}} indispensable {{as part of}} our day today lives. They have made a stand in various fields like agriculture, construction, mining, materials handling, excavating and general use in industries. <b>Skid</b> Steer <b>loader</b> is one such machine which has the ability to fit into all of these categories. <b>Skid</b> steer <b>loaders</b> are known the world over for versatility and maneuverability. These are agile machines which have become a part of most industries. Their ability of having various attachments makes them proficient in handling tasks, which otherwise would be difficult for a human being. For these <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders</b> to work to their full potential a skilled operator is required. Among other safety features, these <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders</b> need to be accountable {{for the safety of the}} operator. So the cab mounted on these <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders</b> need to conform to Roll Over Protective Structure also called as ROPS and Falling Object Protective Structure otherwise known as FOPS standards. There are various standards laid down by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for these ROPS/FOPS cabs on <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders</b> and other construction and mining equipments world over. This study deals with the composite modeling of ROPS/FOPS cab as per ISO 3471 : 1994 and ISO 3449 : 1992 Level I standards for <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders.</b> In this research, a <b>skid</b> steer <b>loader</b> model with the operator cab is constructed and tested for the ISO standards. A section of the cab is then chosen and its properties are changed to composite properties. An attempt is made to use Glass fiber/epoxy composite materials for the section designed in this study. In addition, a parametric study is carried out on the section to satisfy the current standards in the industry. It is demonstrated that the section with the use Glass fiber/epoxy with a pertinent orientation and thickness may present more energy absorption than the present steel structure. It is demonstrated that the new designed composite section with Glass fiber/epoxy may be more effective than the present steel structure. With the advance in computer simulations, finite element (FE) model of the <b>skid</b> steer <b>loader</b> is used to predict the vehicle behavior in case of roll over. In addition, MSC Patran/Hypermesh has been used as the modeler and LS-Dyna as the solver to run the required simulations...|$|R

50|$|Creature {{designer}} John Carl Buechler {{was assigned}} to create the dinosaur models, {{under the supervision of}} amateur paleontologist Donald F. Glut. Buechlers special effects crew had only 10 weeks to complete both the miniature and full sized models, due to the films limited budget. Also, many of Gluts suggestions were not incorporated into the dinosaurs final designs, as many of the models were already in various stages of completion when he was consulted. For the Tyrannosaurus rex, Buechler created numerous different sized props, including a pneumatically-operated creature measuring 16 feet in height, 25 feet in length and 450 lbs in weight, a 7 ft suit version and a 3 ft mechanical walking puppet. An 8 ft suit was made for the Deinonychus, as well as a 1 ft mechanized, walking mockup. Due to the low budget, Buechler could not create the full scale Tyrannosaurus model with standard sculpting and molding techniques; therefore, the Tyrannosaurus understructure was built using L200, a light polyurethane foam, while the skin was crafted with urethane foam sheets. Miniature models for the Tyrannosaurus and the <b>skid</b> <b>loader</b> were used for most of the penultimate scene, as the full scale model was too inarticulate to fight the vehicle convincingly.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a smartphone based system to continually analyze construction equipment activity (e. g. a <b>skid</b> <b>loader</b> moving forward, side-ways, or raising its bucket) using a variety of different sensors and give feedback to the equipment operator or the supervisor. Such a system could detect inefficiencies in construction operations and provide valuable information to project managers. The results have demonstrated that DTW is effective at identifying typical rotation patterns. It has been less effective for slow rotations over long duration or very fast rotations with short durations. The accuracy of DTW is improved when the data is accurately segmented. Use of standard deviation to segment the data is very promising. Current work involves determining the most effective window to calculate standard deviation on, and an appropriate threshold value to use for segmentation...|$|E

40|$|Fluid {{power systems}} have been {{extensively}} used in off highway applications like <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders,</b> wheel loaders, excavators since many years. Work {{has been done by}} both industry and academia to improve efficiency, reduce noise and leakages in these systems. With increasing competition in the market, importance is now also given to operator comfort and machine productivity in off highway applications. ^ Mobile, off – highway vehicles like Skid-steer loaders are widely used in labour saving applications like loading earth into a truck, dig and move material on construction sites to, clean roads, clear snow from roads etc. To carry out these jobs in limited spaces, <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders</b> need tight turning radius. For this reason, these machines have a short wheelbase which prevents the use of suspensions in these vehicles. The absence of a suspension system exposes the vehicle to ground vibrations of high magnitude and low frequency. Vibrations reduce operator comfort, productivity and life of components. This thesis will discuss control strategies for vibration damping of <b>skid</b> steer <b>loader</b> using the hydraulic boom cylinder as the active suspension element, which is equivalent to a spring–damper. Along with vibrations, the machine productivity is also hampered by material spillage which is caused by the tilting of the bucket due to the extension of the boom. This dissertation will discuss the development of a robust path-planning control algorithm which adapts to the position of the boom to maintain a level load to achieve bucket self-leveling. Another reason for reduced productivity in <b>skid</b> steer <b>loaders</b> is slow in site travel speeds. This dissertation also concentrates on reducing the in-job cycle time by developing a control strategy to smooth speed shift the drive motors keeping the pump flow constant. ^ To synthesize these proposed control algorithms, high fidelity hydraulic and mechanical models of the <b>skid</b> steer <b>loader</b> are created. Ultimately, the control algorithms derived in this dissertation help in improving operator comfort and machine productivity. ...|$|R
