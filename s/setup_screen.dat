On the Intel side, this support once was limited to server chipsets; however, newer desktop chipsets like the Intel 955X and 965 and later support it as well.

50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to that of EyeToy: Play, in which players use their body to play a variety of minigames. However, while that game only picked up player's movement, Sega Superstars uses a more {{advanced}} system. Before the start of each game, a <b>setup</b> <b>screen</b> with an orange area is shown. In order to start the game, players have to stand in a position where the orange area won't pick up any movement and select the continue button. This method determines what area is the background, allowing EyeToy to pick up the player's position, as opposed to just what areas are moving. This is particularly prominent in games like Puyo Puyo, which uses the player's entire body.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of feline foamy virus (FFV, spumaretrovirinae) in naturally infected domestic cats ranges between 30 and 80 % FFV positive animals depending on age, sex and geographical region analyzed. Two serotypes {{have been reported}} for FFV designated FUV 7 -like and F 17 / 951 -like. Serotype-specific neutralization {{has been shown to}} correlate with sequence divergence in the surface (SU) domain of the envelope protein (Env). We analyzed a serum collection of 262 domestic cat sera from Germany using a GST-capture ELISA <b>setup</b> <b>screening</b> for Gag and Bet specific antibodies and identified 39 % FFV positive animals. Due to the heterogeneity of the serological samples, cut-offs for Gag and Bet reactivity had to be experimentally determined since application of calculated cut-off values yielded some false-positive results; the new cut-off values turned out to be also fully applicable to a previous study. Using the already established FUV 7 ElpSU antigen and the newly cloned and produced F 17 / 951 ElpSU antigen, both consisting of the corresponding ectodomains of the envelope leader protein (Elp) and SU protein, we aimed at the detection of Env-specific antibodies and discrimination between the two known FFV serotypes within the diagnostic FFV ELISA. We validated the ElpSU antigens using cat reference sera of known serotype and screened with this assay domestic cat sera from Germany. Use of the FUV 7 - and F 17 / 951 ElpSU antigens in ELISA resulted in the detection of Env-specific antibodies in both cat reference sera and sera from domestic cats in Germany, but failed to allow serotyping at the same time...|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{development}} {{in the field of}} nanotechnology is increasingly yielding novel applications of nanoparticles. The unique properties of nanoparticles in particular their high aspect ratio (length : width ratio), however could pose potential risks to the user. A high throughput genetic screening platform, RISCI (robotic single cDNA investigation), was previously established for the systematic evaluation of single gene activities. Here, RISCI was utilised to identify pro-apoptotic genes as well as genes involved in the positive and negative regulation of silica nanoparticle-induced cell death. This project describes the further development of the screening platform by harnessing its capability to screen a cDNA library comprising approximately 30, 000 full length, completely annotated, and sequenced human genes for novel regulators of apoptosis. It integrates an extensive skill sets and is broadly organised into three major phases: <b>Setup,</b> <b>Screen</b> and Analysis. The integration of a pro-apoptosis treatment to screen for inhibitors and sensitizers is a novel aspect of the current experimental setup, along with the low redundancy library. The extensive setup phase focused on technical aspects. The cDNA library, acquired as plasmid DNA, was transformed into a bacterial host for replication and subsequent DNA isolation. A new high-throughput process was developed encompassing the production of competent bacteria and a heat shock transformation protocol, which was subsequently transferred onto the robotic platform. In parallel, the software controlling the robots was redeveloped to allow for execution of user-defined protocols while novel transfection protocols were adapted for automation. The screen identified 699 apoptosis inducers, 1, 141 inhibitors and 626 sensitizers. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the inducers were highly enriched for cell death associated terms, while the inhibitors were strongly associated with cancer profiles. Both inducers and sensitizers were predominantly achieving the functional effect on the protein level, but inhibitors were mainly transcription based. Enriched metal response genes also suggest that the silica nanoparticles were causing their toxicity through reactive oxygen species generation. Intriguingly, the screen identified many noncoding sequences as being functionally capable of regulating apoptosis. These noncoding candidates are capable of regulating the protein coding counterparts identified from the screen. The truly interesting part of the project outcome remains those unknown candidates that were implicated in apoptosis regulation for the first time. Dissemination of the consolidated candidate list would help accelerate the experimental validation of these candidates and aid other researchers in deriving novel hypotheses when the candidates are placed in their research context.
