40|$|Mechanically {{separated}} meat (MSM) is {{the product}} obtained by removing meat from bones by pressure application. Whole fillets and fish burgers from minced muscle and from mechanical separation of Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) were evaluated immediately after processing (T 0) and after 90 days of storage at − 20 °C for parameters related to quality loss. Firstly, mechanical separation inhibited water losses (2. 67 % against 4. 57 and 5. 57 % in whole fillets and burgers from minced muscle, respectively), but the colour of MSM was duller and redder than the samples from other groups. Horse mackerel contained low fat (8 mg MDA-eq/ 100 g muscle). Nevertheless, Atlantic horse mackerel showed a high antioxidant capacity (ABTS, 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid, DPPH, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl, and FRAP, ferric-reducing ability) at T 0 which may protect muscle against oxidative damages both during processing treatment and storage. Industrial relevance The mechanical separation process described in the article has been largely utilized for terrestrial animal products. However, it is seldom adopted by fish industry, especially for recovering discard fish <b>species.</b> <b>Horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> is an underutilized species, normally transformed into animal feed despite its high levels of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

The {{spatial distribution}} was clearly different between the years studied and corresponds quite precisely to different water circulation regimes. <b>Mackerel</b> and <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> larvae are more affected by the prevailing currents than sardine, as their spawning grounds are located offshore, far from the shelf break where the current velocities are higher. Survival rates for <b>mackerel</b> and <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> were higher in 2001, when the offshore larval transport was stronger. However, for sardine, the mortality rate hardly varied between years.

40|$|Two <b>species</b> of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus trecae and Trachurus capensis) {{reside in}} the {{northern}} Benguela ecosystem. Both are important economic commodities for the Angolan and Namibian fisheries and therefore need to be managed appropriately. Although the two <b>species</b> of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> share similar morphological characteristics and co-occur in Namibian waters in the northern Benguela, few studies have compared their parasite assemblages. To date there are no studies regarding the parasite profile of T. trecae. This study {{is the first to}} identify and document the parasite assemblage of T. trecae from the northern Benguela and forms the only parasite profile for this <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> <b>species.</b> This study also assesses the effects of fish size and fish sex on the parasite assemblage of T. trecae, and compares the parasite assemblage of this species with that of T. capensis from the northern Benguela. Results indicate that the largest significant difference in parasite assemblage is between the two <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> <b>species</b> (by convention p< 0. 01), but that significant differences are also found between small and large T. trecae and between immature, male and female T. trecae. The coccidian Goussia cruciata was found to have the strongest discriminatory power in all comparisons, and therefore serves as a potential indicator parasite or biotag for discriminating between different stocks of T. trecae and between T. trecae and T. capensis in the northern Benguela. Due to the lack of literature regarding the life history of T. trecae it is difficult to assess why there are sex effects on parasites infecting this species, as well as whether the interspecific difference in parasite assemblage is due to environmental conditions or species-specific relationships. Further investigations regarding the life history of T. trecae would assist interpretation of the results obtained here. This study provides a comprehensive knowledge of the parasite assemblages infecting T. trecae and thus lends to possible future studies regarding T. trecae stock structure. It also provides a starting point for conducting studies of the parasite assemblages of other fish in the northern Benguela...|$|R

We explore the reproductive strategy of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and estimation of fecundity. Fecundity and fecundity regulation in relation to condition was investigated over a number of years. Fulton's K, lipid content, and hepatosomatic index increased after the start of spawning, though decreased again at the end of spawning.

LPs were assigned to trawlers, defining fleet components with specific technical characteristics and fishing strategies. This showed that large vessels target pelagics along the entire coastline, average-powered units fished a diverse catch off the Central zone of the western coast, including <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and cephalopods and a group of trawlers targeted cephalopods and benthic species off the south coast. Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data, processed by GeoCrust 2. 0, was used to quantify effective fishing effort and define geographic patterns of fishing activity. VMS-based species-specific effort from 2003 was integrated with landings to estimate landings per unit effort (landings per day at sea and landings per hour trawled. Integration of cephalopod size-classes data with VMS information enabled the estimation of size-dependent effort and analysis of geographical patterns of population structure. A group of vessels with landing activity and VMS coverage of trips belonging to distinct LP were selected to constitute a potential sample fleet for estimating speciesdirected LPUE. Their representativeness in terms of effort and LPUE was examined by comparing these results with those obtained for the entire fleet.

40|$|The {{body size}} of fish is an {{important}} factor in determining their biology and ecology, as predators eat prey smaller than themselves. Predator mouth size restricts the availability of possible prey. In this paper we provide the allometric relationships of eight common, small pelagic fish species in the Bay of Biscay. In addition, we describe the predator-prey size ratios for different species, and we determine changes in their ratio-based trophic-niche breadth with increasing body size. Results suggest that gape size does not totally determine the predator-prey size ratio distribution, but predators use the entire available prey size range, including the smallest. As they grow they simply incorporate larger prey as their increased gape size permits. Accordingly, a large degree of overlap was found in the diet composition in terms of size and predator-prey ratios, even between fish of different sizes.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the discard sampling programme of the Dutch pelagic freezer trawler fleet in European waters in 2010. The pelagic freezer trawler fishery targets pelagic species, namely herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), greater argentine (Argentina silus), and pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). The annual landings of this fishery illustrates its seasonality; different species are targeted during different parts of the year. The total landings of the Dutch fleet were about 201, 000 tonnes in 2010. <b>Horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and herring were the most abundant landed species. Overall, the discard percentage for the Dutch pelagic fleet in 2010, based on 8 sampled trips, is estimated at 6 % in weight. This is consistent with the discard percentages that have been found in previous years. However, in 2010 we did not succeed in sampling the fishery each quarter of the year; no trip was sampled in quarter 3. On board of the pelagic freezer trawlers two different discarding methods are observed, namely discarding after the catch is sorted and discarding prior to sorting. The latter includes catch that is discarded directly or via the conveyer belt from the cooling tanks, and catch that is slipped from the net. Due to practical limitations and safety issues {{it is not possible to}} sample these discards. The results show that the estimated amount of unsampled discards represent 30 % of the total estimated discards. Motivations for discarding unsampled catch can vary. Anecdotal information implies most incidents of discarding take place when more fish is caught than can be stored in the cooling tanks. In addition, fish-quality issues, unprofitable mixtures of species, or a lack in quota, could also be reasons for this discarding behaviour. The discard composition and length frequency data shown in this report are only based on routinely sorted discards. Discard percentages of target <b>species</b> herring, <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and blue whiting are relatively low (1 %, 1 %, and 4 % respectively). For mackerel the discard percentage is significantly higher (18 %).

In 1868, British zoologist Albert Günther unaware of the prior naming independently renamed the species Caranx caballus based on specimens collected from Panama, one of which was designated to be the holotype. The species was further renamed in 1870 by Franz Steindachner, who attempted to remove the Caranx boops homonym by simply renaming the species Caranx girardi. Later reviews of the Carangidae revealed this synonymy, and due to Gunther's' earlier naming, his species name was kept and attributed to him, while Cuvier's' Caranx boops was later moved to Selar boops. The specific name caballus is Latin for 'horse', reflecting the common name of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> given to this and many similar species at the time. William Smith-Vaniz has suggested the possibility C. caballus is conspecific with a very similar Atlantic species; Caranx crysos, but no studies into this relationship have been undertaken. Its position in the genus Caranx has also been questioned recently by John Randall due to its unusual dentition. The common name 'green jack' is in reference to the species' common coloration, while 'horse jack' is derived from the Latin name. In Spanish-speaking nations, it is often known under broadly applied names including cocinero and caballa.|$|R

The aim of this change was serving the new demands of the fisheries management in order to include the ecosystem approach in the assessments. Since 2009, the MS national fisheries sampling programs had to adopt the concurrent sampling strategy, which implies that length structure of all species landed must be obtained during the sampling operation.

40|$|Fish {{provides}} {{a major source}} of proteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids which are known to prevent coronary heart diseases. However, inherent characteristics such as colour and texture prevent the effective utilisation of some fish, especially fatty pelagics for human consumption. Instead, they are used for fish oil and fish meal production. For this reason and for enhancing the utilisation of valuable resources, the physico-chemical properties, which may be species specific, were investigated in relation to two Namibian <b>species,</b> namely, <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus capensis) and snoek (Thyrsites atun). The results showed that <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus capensis) and snoek (Thyrsites atun) contain high contents of palmitic acids (29 %), oleic acids (25 %), and the omega- 3 -polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) (15 %) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) (9 %). The studies also showed that optimum protein extractability was obtained with 5 % NaCl at pH 7. 2 and the highest gel strength at pH 6. 5 - 7. 0. CaCO 3 had detrimental effect on the water-holding capacity when used above 50 mg. l- 1 in washing water. Agar and sodium alginate extracted from Namibian Gracilaria verrucosa (red seaweed) and Laminaria schinzii (brown seaweed) respectively, were also characterised for their physico-chemical properties. Both the nontreated and treated agars were observed by colorimetric method to contain low levels of sulphate, an observation also confirmed by NMR and Raman FTIR spectroscopy. Sodium alginate was found to contain high content of guluronic acid (75 %) by NMR, a good index of strong gelling ability. The good functionalities obtained as a result of optimising the physicochemical properties of fish proteins and seaweed polysaccharides enabled an investigation of the interactions of the two components. Studies on the interactions of the both <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and snoek with either sodium alginate or agar were undertaken by rheology, differential scanning calorimetry and phase contrast microscopy. Large deformation and small deformation rheological studies showed a decrease in the gel strength of fish proteins with the addition of either polysaccharide at all combinations. The DSC results indicated a lowering of the denaturation temperature with the addition ratios of increasing amounts of sodium alginate to fish proteins. Although the mixture of fish proteins and agar resulted in the lowering of the denaturation temperature, the shift; was not as pronounced as that obtained with sodium alginate. The reason for the lowering of gel strength and G' values was attributed to phase separation of fish proteins and polysaccharides which was reflected by phase contrast microscopy studies. This investigation has resulted in the characterisation of valuable fish and seaweed polysaccharide resources from Namibia which could be used in combination for the development of new food products...|$|R

Therefore, this GLM uses only data recorded by the Desert Diamond, a midwater trawl vessel, which covers the years 2003 - 2010...|$|R

The {{basis for the}} associated computations for each fishery are set out in separate sections below. Appendix A gives the details for the GLM procedure used to produce a <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> CPUE series for the midwater fishery, and Appendix B describes Exceptional Circumstances (ECs) {{that could lead to}} deviations from OMP recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of international commercial catch data were mapped by ICES rectangle and quarter from 1983 - 1994. These indicate a northward expansion of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{distribution in the}} Northeast Atlantic since 1987. The spatial variability of the yearclass abundance of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> over the European shelf and shelf edge is investigated using international bottom trawl survey data. The aim is {{to determine if the}} northward expansion of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution is due to the extremely strong 1982 yearclass. How the changes in oceonographic conditions since 1989 may relate to the fish northward expansion is also discussed...|$|R
