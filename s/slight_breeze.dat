5|$|King's cricketing career did not {{end with}} his last {{first-class}} match. He continued to play club matches in Philadelphia and participated in non-first-class fixtures around the continent. King is noted for holding the bowling record against Canada. On a rainy afternoon at Philadelphia in 1906, King bowled into a <b>slight</b> <b>breeze</b> to capture 8 wickets for 17 runs. This record came in a four-year period during which King focused on club cricket in Philadelphia, {{when he won the}} city's batting award three times and the bowling award four times.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a <b>slight</b> <b>breeze</b> could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 January 1807 Galatea was {{off the coast of}} Venezuela when she sighted a sail {{steering}} for La Guaira. Galatea approached and identified the vessel as a man-of-war; she then change her course, heading for Barcelona, Anzoátegui, which lay some 160 miles to the east. By noon Galatea was becalmed; {{at the same time a}} <b>slight</b> <b>breeze</b> enabled Galateas quarry to continue on her way. Two hours later lookouts could barely see her highest sails above the horizon.|$|E

500|$|The {{flag was}} the games emblem of a javelin thrower in a {{wheelchair}} with a background outline of the Flag of Australia on a flagpole in a <b>slight</b> <b>breeze.</b> [...] Medals had one side with the games emblem and the reverse side name of sport with room for engraving. Badges were given to each competitor and official with the aims of identification {{and access to the}} dining hall. The badge also became a memento of the games.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1968, Cash had {{a spiritual}} [...] in the Nickajack Cave. He had {{attempted}} to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs.

Utterly discouraged, he felt God's presence in his heart and struggled out of the cave (despite exhaustion) by following a faint light and <b>slight</b> <b>breeze.</b> To him, the incident represented his rebirth. June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the London Gardens in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in Franklin, Kentucky. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had [...] "cleaned up." ...|$|E

5000|$|Some masses {{shaped by}} humans also exhibit similar {{behaviour}} (sometimes unintentionally). For example, {{in the ruins}} of the Roman temples at Jerash in Jordan (the [...] "city of 1000 pillars"), some massive pillars move {{back and forth in the}} <b>slightest</b> <b>breeze.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{was after}} dark that the five men {{returned}} to the camp on the east shore. The night was hot and sultry. No <b>slightest</b> <b>breeze</b> ruffled the foliage of the trees or rippled the mirror-like surface of the ocean. Only a gentle swell rolled softly in upon the beach.|$|R

60|$|That is what Trysdale was doing, {{standing}} by {{a table in}} his bachelor apartments. On the table stood a singular-looking green plant in a red earthen jar.

50|$|Accurately {{measuring}} the statistical properties of leaf angle distributions {{is not a}} trivial matter, especially for small leaves. Clinometers can be used but may be rather bulky or inconvenient. Most leaves are quite light and tend to move with the <b>slightest</b> <b>breeze</b> or air turbulence. Nevertheless, when these environmental conditions are suitable or can be controlled, {{it is possible to}} acquire data on leaf orientation.|$|R
50|$|A spider (usually {{limited to}} {{individuals}} {{of a small}} species), or spiderling after hatching, climbs {{as high as it}} can, stands on raised legs with its abdomen pointed upwards ("tiptoeing"), and then releases several silk threads from its spinnerets into the air. These form a triangle-shaped parachute that carries the spider on updrafts of winds, where even the <b>slightest</b> <b>breeze</b> transports it. The Earth's static electric field may also provide lift in windless conditions.|$|R
60|$|Enormous granite {{boulders}} {{blocked the}} way on every hand; deep rifts in the ice threatened to engulf us at the least misstep; and from the north a <b>slight</b> <b>breeze</b> wafted to our nostrils an unspeakable stench that almost choked us.|$|E

60|$|July 1st.--On Friday I {{took the}} rail with J----- for Coventry. It {{was a bright}} and very warm day, oppressively so, indeed; though I {{think that there is}} never in this English climate the pervading warmth of an American summer day. The {{sunshine}} may be excessively hot, but an overshadowing cloud or the shade of a tree or of a building at once affords relief; and if the <b>slightest</b> <b>breeze</b> stirs, you feel the latent freshness of the air.|$|R
40|$|Quaking aspens, Populus tremuloides, are {{a widely}} used tree by many homeowners and {{professional}} landscapers. Aspens are fast growing and their ornamental beauty is sought after {{because of their}} white bark and leaves that shimmer and flutter in the <b>slightest</b> <b>breeze.</b> Unfortunately, aspens are prone to disease problems and as landscape maintenance professionals, {{it is important to}} recognize and be able to diagnose common problems associated with aspens.

60|$|The hunter {{agreed and}} went with him, and they came to seven {{windmills}} whose sails were going round quite fast, and yet {{there was not a}} breath of wind, nor was a leaf moving.

So he walked on with his servants, and when they had gone two miles they saw a man sitting on a tree, holding one of his nostrils and blowing out of the other.|$|R

60|$|The <b>slight</b> <b>breeze</b> favored them, the camp-fire was dead, and {{the night}} was clear and starlit. They had not been quiet many moments when the shrill neigh of a mustang rang out. The Naabs raised {{themselves}} and {{looked at one another}} in the starlight.|$|E
60|$|The rough rocks left behind, {{the boys}} {{came out on}} a trail which {{seemed to come from}} the north and lead {{directly}} up a steep hillside well covered with tall trees.

60|$|There was a {{long silence}} between them. Then at long length Fenzileh rose and crossed to the meshra-biyah--the {{latticed}} window-box.

That she could perform this menial service for herself when a mere clapping of hands would have brought slaves to minister to her need betrayed something of her disordered state of mind.|$|R
