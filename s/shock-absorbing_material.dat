2500|$|The North American 2.5-litres were {{fundamentally}} different from their European counterparts. Due to federal regulations, some modifications were required. Most noticeable from the outside were the 'America' bumpers, with the typical rubber accordions in them. Furthermore, these bumpers had thick (and heavy) <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> inside them and in addition, they were mounted to the vehicle on shock absorbers. To accommodate these shock absorbers, the 'America'-bodies were slightly different from the European ones. Other changes relative to the European model were: ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} the {{specimen}} size on the vibrational wave superimposed on the load-deflection curve of polYmers is first investigated. Next, in the instrumented Charpy test, a <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>material</b> is used in order to prevent the generation of the vibrational wave superimposed on the load-deflection curve, and its validity is discussed. Further, differences of the impact response curves obtained by an instrumented Charpy test and the one-point bend test are compared and discussed. The results of this study are summarized as follows. (1) The vibrational wave can be prevented by using a small specimen which shortens the period of the vibrational wave. (2) The load value is lowered by using <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>material.</b> (3) The differences in the impact response curves and the fracture times obtained from tbe instrumented Charpy impact test and the one-point bend test are rather large in the lower impact velocity of 3. 10 m/s; however, the obtained K_(Id) values are nearly coincidental...|$|E

50|$|Most {{designs are}} a {{compromise}} between practicality and energy efficiency. With too long a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it delivers force to the wrong place, off-target. With too short a handle, the hammer is inefficient because it doesn't deliver enough force, requiring more blows to complete a given task. Modifications have also been made {{with respect to the}} effect of the hammer on the user. Handles made of <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> or varying angles attempt {{to make it easier for}} the user to continue to wield this age-old device, even as nail guns and other powered drivers encroach on its traditional field of use.|$|R

40|$|Arrays of aligned carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have been}} proposed for different applications, including electrochemical energy storage and <b>shock-absorbing</b> <b>materials.</b> Understanding their mechanical response, {{in relation to their}} structural characteristics, is important for tailoring the synthesis method to the different operational conditions of the material. In this paper, we grow vertically aligned CNT arrays using a thermal chemical vapor deposition system, and we study the effects of precursor flow on the structural and mechanical properties of the CNT arrays. We show that the CNT growth process is inhomogeneous along the direction of the precursor flow, resulting in varying bulk density at different points on the growth substrate. We also study the effects of non-covalent functionalization of the CNTs after growth, using surfactant and nanoparticles, to vary the effective bulk density and structural arrangement of the arrays. We find that the stiffness and peak stress of the materials increase approximately linearly with increasing bulk density...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{direct-drive}} turntables may suffer from vibration {{due to the}} motor, which is less of an issue for belt-drive turntables. However, in recent years, <b>shock-absorbing</b> (less dense) <b>material,</b> placed between the motor and platter, {{has been used to}} cut back on vibrations. The torque on direct-drive turntables is usually much higher than on belt drive models. This means the platter speed is less susceptible to outside forces (stylus, hand). Higher torque also means the platter will accelerate to its proper speed faster so less distortion is heard when the record begins to play.|$|R

Mineral mass and microstructure/nanostructure of bone are susceptible to stimulation by mechanical loads, ensuring that its mechanical behavior and strength are adapted to environmental changes. Woodpeckers repeatedly drum tree trunks at a speed of 6 - 7 [*]m[*]s− 1 and acceleration of ~ 1000 [*]g with no head injuries. The uneven distribution of spongy bone has been founded on woodpecker's skull in our previous study. More knowledge {{of the distribution of}} the shock-absorbing spongy bone could be incorporated into the design of new safety helmets, sports products, and other devices that {{need to be able to}} resist the impact. In this study, the effect of microstructure of spongy bone in different parts on woodpecker’s skull compared with other birds was observed and analyzed. It was found that the unique coordinate ability of micro-parameters in different parts of woodpecker’s skull could be one of the most important roles of its resistance to impact injury. Better understanding of the materials would provide new inspirations of <b>shock-absorbing</b> composite <b>materials</b> in engineering...|$|R
40|$|Many {{natural and}} {{man-made}} cellular bodies are light-weight, <b>shock-absorbing,</b> multifunctional <b>materials,</b> capable of undertaking large elastic deformations. These properties {{are due to}} a complex system of local deformations {{which can lead to}} changes in the material properties as the deformation progresses, but their study is nontrivial since the corresponding stresses are non-trivial functions of volume fraction, micro-geometry, and material properties of the components. For cellular bodies of hyperelastic material, several main factors determine the magnitude of the stress level, including the cell geometry, the cell wall thickness, and the presence of cell inclusions. In this thesis, two nonlinear elastic parameters are identified, namely a nonlinear elastic modulus and a nonlinear Poisson’s ratio, which are defined in terms of the large stresses and strains in the elastic cell walls, and their utility in estimating how different competing factors may contribute to the complex mechanical behaviour of cellular structures is investigated. For the numerical analysis, finite element simulations of periodic, honeycomb-like structures with a small number of square, diamond, or hexagonal cells made from a nonlinear hyperelastic material are presented. This study offers important insight into the fundamental behaviour of cellular structures of nonlinear elastic material under large strains, and contributes to illuminate key mechanical effects that are not visible under small strains...|$|R
40|$|A flexible, {{waterproof}} {{material that}} will solidify in water {{has long been}} desired in civil engineering. We have developed {{a new class of}} material, called Aquaphalt, which has these and other desirable properties. Aquaphalt is composed of an asphalt emulsion, cement and a water-absorbing polymer. The components are liquid at ambient temperature and can therefore be pumped, but they form a gel almost instantly when mixed. The hardened mixture is similar to hard bitumen, and has very low water permeability, high ductility and good adhesion to other materials. Here we describe the characteristics of Aquaphalt, with particular emphasis on those properties that give it potential as a <b>shock-absorbing,</b> waterproof backfill <b>material</b> for tunnels and dams, and as an antiliquefaction agent for protection of buildings exposed to earthquake hazards...|$|R
