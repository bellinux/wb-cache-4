It was a broader aim to work out equipment specific differences between the <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>machine</b> EDM 2000 of the manufacturer SAE and its successor EDM 2005. The roughness of the superstructures was examined and the results evaluated directly before processing after the tooth technical cast and after spark erosion. The structure changes of the superstructures became examines with the energy dispersve x-ray spectrometry before processing and after spark erosion. The layer strength measuring of the metal changed by the erosion was examined with the same method after spark erosion. Both results were evaluated statistically. With {{the help of}} the roughness measuring it could be shown that it does not come to any uniform change in the examined roughness parameters during the spark erosiv process at all examined material samples.

The erosion can smooth the surface of the finished workpiece in its surface structure so that a more slippery surface than after the tooth technical cast arises. However, the surface can get rougher also altogether.

Objective is to maximize the material removal rate (MRR) and to minimize the roundness, surface roughness (SR), tool wear rate (TWR), weight wear ratio (WWR) and taper angle during Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) of hot pressed ZrB 2. Most of the ceramic components are manufactured through powder metallurgy route at net shaped production, but some feature like holes of smaller diameter or complex features cannot be produced by this technique and hence needs additional machining. In this work, a ZrB 2 disc of 100 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness is manufactured by means of hot pressing technique and this disc is machined using diamond load grinding to have parallel surfaces. Then, 2 mm diameter holes are machined on the disc using EDM <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>machine</b> with different tool materials. Mathematical models are proposed for the modelling {{and analysis of the}} effects of Pulse on time and tool materials on the performance characteristics in the EDM using regression analysis (RA).

It has been shown that for reproducible etching the crystal surface must be parallel to a low index crystallographic plane to within +/- 1 ° and the necessary techniques for preparing square cross-section crystals with such surfaces have been developed. The ionic compositions of the etch and the chemical polish employed, both solutions of nitric acid in ethanol, have been elucidated by chemical and spectroscopic methods and an attempt has been made to identify the fundamental mechanism of dislocation etching in the cadmium-etch system. The etch has been used to study the dislocations injected into cadmium single crystals sectioned by <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>machining.</b> The experimental method used has novel features and {{it has been shown that}} the nature and depth of the damage introduced by this cutting technique depend on the spark energy employed and the diameter of the cutting wire used.

Advantages of liquids include higher breakdown strength compared to compressed gases. When compared with solid dielectrics, their ability to circulate leads to better thermal management and easier removal of debris after breakdown. Liquid dielectrics are also better suited to applications involving complex geometries. Thus the electrical behaviour of dielectric liquids subjected to high electric fields has been intensively studied [1]. The interest arises from various applications that include pulsed power systems, energy storage, highvoltage insulation, development of acoustic devices and <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>machines.</b> Electrical breakdown of dielectric liquids {{is a very complex}} process that involves a succession of inter-correlated phenomena (electronic, mechanical, thermal, etc.). Moreover, experiments have shown that characteristic features of prebreakdown and breakdown phenomena greatly depend on experimental conditions (electrode geometry, shape and duration of applied voltage, liquid nature and purity, etc.). Rather than attempt to treat all phenomena associated with breakdown, it has been decided for the sake of clarity and brevity to restrict discussion in this paper to streamer processes occurring in mineral transformer oil. Current research at the University of Southampton is mainly devoted to modelling the physical mechanism occurring within a needle-plane electrode geometry separated by mineral transformer oil, where breakdown {{is the result of the}} initiation and propagation streamer process. In previous research concerning gas discharge mechanisms, the implementation of the electro-hydrodynamic model has been validated in describing the streamer process [2]. Based on the treatment of liquid dielectrics as a dense fluid, the drift-diffusion equations of positive ions, negative ions and electrons are solved coupled with Poisson’s equation in this work. The finite element method based commercial software Comsol Multiphisics is used for numerical calculations. The streamer process simulation is modelled as a response to a negative pulsed voltage applied to the negative needle electrode. Estimations of the main features of the simulated streamers (such as field strength distribution, charge density, etc.) have been obtained and compared to experimental data published by other researchers [3].

The drawback of this method {{is that there is a}} significant level of contaminants or additional phases that appear in the powder, which is prepared from elemental materials. The advantages of the wire explosion method [7, 8], which yields particularly dispersed powders, are often frustrated by the high cost of equipment, energy consumption, and the small number of the powder obtained. Chemical synthesis approach successfully used for Au-Cd nanoparticles production [9] is heuristic by definition. In this work, we will focus on <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> method. The method allows obtaining alloy powder with a given chemical composition in a wide range of sizes, with a relatively low level of contaminants [10 – 32]. One of the features of this method is the foam-like structures, which coat the surface of micron-sized particles that appear during <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> [27 – 32].|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} fabrication of novel all-magnetic atom chips for use in ultracold atom trapping. The considerations leading to the choice of nanocrystalline exchange coupled FePt as best material are discussed. Using stray field calculations, we designed patterns that function as magnetic atom traps. These patterns were realized by <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> of FePt foil and e-beam lithography of FePt film. A mirror magneto-optical trap (MMOT) was obtained using the stray field of the foil chip.

50|$|All {{production}} {{takes place}} at the FAMARS factory, in Gardone Val Trompia, a small city nestled between foothills of the Italian Alps. A single FAMARS gun requires hundreds, sometimes thousands, of man-hours to complete. The firm produces no more than 110 guns in any year. Today, FAMARS combines modern technology with its traditional gunmaking techniques. The company utilizes computer numerical control and <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> technology to create precision parts critical for gun reliability. Processes such as shaping of receivers, wood carving, stock finishing, barrel shaping, soldering, and engraving are still performed by hand.|$|R
