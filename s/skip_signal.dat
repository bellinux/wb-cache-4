40|$|NDE {{modeling}} and simulation are important tools to support the development and validation of enhanced localization and characterization techniques. Previously, important achievements {{were made by the}} USAF to address crack detection in aircraft structures using angled-beam shear wave inspection techniques. However, new work on model benchmarking is needed to move beyond detection and achieve reliable crack characterization. To achieve this goal, simulated studies are needed to verify that models can accurately represent all of the key variables with the inspection of multilayer structures with fastener sites and varying crack conditions. Often with model benchmark studies, the accuracy of the model is evaluated based on the change in response relative to a selected reference signal. During recent simulated and experimental studies, some challenges were discovered concerning the creation and/or selection of a reference signal in a plate with a vertical hole and crack. The focus of this paper is on key findings concerning model benchmarking using CIVA-UT for angled-beam shear wave inspections. The use of a side drilled hole (SDH) in a plate was found to be somewhat problematic as a reference signal for angled beam shear wave inspection. Previously, {{only a limited number of}} studies have looked at model benchmarking for angled beam shear wave inspections. Systematic studies were performed with varying SDH depth and size, and varying the ultrasonic probe frequency, focal depth, and probe height. Care must be taken in understanding the precise beam properties with these experiments. One issue is that there is some increased error with the simulation of angled shear wave beams, especially in the near-field. Even more significant, asymmetry in real probes and the inherent sensitivity of signals in the near-field to subtle test conditions were found to provide a greater challenge with achieving model agreement. Through these studies, conditions of good and poor agreement were observed. For some inspection conditions, the <b>skip</b> <b>signal</b> off of the far wall from the side drilled hole can provide a better reference than the direct reflected signal. All in all, these seemingly mundane studies were found to be important with providing guidance on reference signal selection for model benchmarking work on the inspection of fastener sites with cracks...|$|E

Bitrates below 1 bit per pixel are achieved through <b>skipping</b> <b>signaling</b> when the prediction of a pixels sufficiently good. The pixels to be skipped are implicitly detected  by the decoder, minimizing the overhead. Different methods of quantization are tested, {{and the possibility of}} using vector quantization is investigated, by matching pixel sequences against a dynamically generated vector tree. Several different prediction schemes are evaluated, both linear and non-linear, with both static and adaptive weights.   Maintaining the low computational complexity of LOCO-I has been a priority. The results are compared to different HEVC implementations with regards to compression speed and ratio...|$|R

40|$|Skeletal {{muscle and}} kidney enriched {{inositol}} phosphatase (SKIP) is an inositol polyphosphate 5 -phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate [PI(3, 4, 5) P 3] to downregulate intracellular levels. In this study, {{we show that}} SKIP inhibits phosphoinositide 3 -kinase signaling in insulin-stimulated CHO cells. Ectopic expression of SKIP did not inhibit insulin-induced PI(3, 4, 5) P 3 generation but did rapidly decrease insulin-induced intracellular PI(3, 4, 5) P 3 levels compared with those in control cells. Further, insulin-induced phosphorylation of some downstream targets such as Akt and p 70 S 6 kinase was markedly inhibited by the ectopic expression of SKIP, whereas phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was not. In contrast, downregulation of intracellular SKIP levels by antisense oligonucleotides dramatically enhanced Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation in response to insulin, suggesting that endogenous <b>SKIP</b> downregulates insulin <b>signaling.</b> <b>SKIP</b> also markedly inhibited GLUT 4 translocation and membrane ruffle formation. We conclude that SKIP preferentially regulates glucose transport and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement among a variety of PI(3, 4, 5) P 3 downstream events...|$|R

50|$|Standalone/self-ruling GPS devices depend {{solely on}} {{information}} from satellites. A-GPS augments that by using cell tower data to enhance quality and precision when in poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, {{for example in}} urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit multipath propagation where <b>signals</b> <b>skip</b> off structures, or are weakened by meteorological conditions or tree canopy. Some standalone GPS navigators used in poor conditions can't fix a position because of satellite signal fracture and must wait for better satellite reception.

40|$|One {{major problem}} {{associated}} with the interpretation of seismic signals on active volcanoes {{is the lack of}} knowledge about the internal structure of the volcano. Assuming a 1 D or a homogeneous instead of a 3 D velocity structure leads to an erroneous localization of seismic events. In order to derive a high resolution 3 D velocity model of Mt. Merapi (Java) a seismic tomography experiment using active sources is planned {{as a part of the}} MERAPI (Mechanism Evaluation, Risk Assessment and Prediction Improvement) project. During a pre-site survey in August 1996 we tested a seismic source consisting of a 2. 5 l airgun shot in water basins that were constructed in different flanks of the volcano. This special source, which in our case can be fired every two minutes, produces a repeatable, identical source signal. Using this source the number of receiver locations is not limited by the number of seismometers. The seismometers can be moved to various receiver locations while the source reproduces the same source signal. Additionally, at each receiver location we are able to record the identical source signal several times so that the disadvantage of the lower energy compared to an explosion source can be reduced by <b>skipping</b> disturbed <b>signals</b> and stacking several recordings...|$|R
40|$|It is {{of great}} {{importance}} to monitor large solar active regions in the far-side of the Sun for space weather forecast, in particular, to predict their appearance before they rotate into our view from the solar east limb. Local helioseismology techniques, including helioseismic holography and time-distance, have successfully imaged solar far-side active regions. In this Letter, we further explore the possibility of imaging and improving the image quality of solar far-side active regions by use of time-distance helioseismology. In addition to the previously used scheme with four acoustic <b>signal</b> <b>skips,</b> a five-skip scheme is also included in this newly developed technique. The combination of both four- and five-skip far-side images significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in the far-side images, and reduces spurious signals. The accuracy of the far-side active region imaging is also assessed using one whole year solar observation. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, accepted by ApJ Letter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In modern chip designs, test {{strategies}} are {{becoming one of}} the most important issues due to the increase of the test cost, among them we focus on the large test power dissipation and large test data volume. In this paper, we develop a methodology to suppress the test power to avoid chip failures caused by large test power, and our methodology is also effective in reducing the test data volume and shift-in power. The proposed schemes and techniques are based on the selective test pattern compression, they can reduce considerable shift-in power by <b>skipping</b> the switching <b>signal</b> passing through long scan chains. The experimental results with ISCAS 89 circuits demonstrate that our methodology can achieve significant improvement in the reduction of shift-in power and test data volume.

DCT and IDCT are the most widely used transform technique in Digital Image Processing and Digital Signal Processing. This project presents an efficient approach for multiplier less implementation for N-point DCT approximation, which based on coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm which makes use of shift and add operation for computation. The proposed algorithm is the most popular because of its computational efficiency and structural simplicity.

40|$|Insulin {{controls}} {{glucose homeostasis}} and lipid metabolism, and insulin impairment plays {{a critical role}} in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Human skeletal muscle and kidney enriched inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (SKIP) {{is a member of the}} phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate phosphatase family (T. Ijuin et al. J. Biol. Chem. 275 : 10870 - 10875, 2000; T. Ijuin and T. Takenawa, Mol. Cell. Biol. 23 : 1209 - 1220, 2003). Previous studies showed that SKIP negatively regulates insulin-induced phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling (Ijuin and Takenawa, Mol. Cell. Biol. 23 : 1209 - 1220, 2003). We now have generated mice with a targeted mutation of the mouse ortholog of the human SKIP gene, Pps. Adult heterozygous Pps mutant mice show increased insulin sensitivity and reduced diet-induced obesity with increased Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle but not in adipose tissue. The insulin-induced uptake of 2 -deoxyglucose into the isolated soleus muscle was significantly enhanced in Pps mutant mice. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study also revealed a significant increase in the rate of systemic glucose disposal in Pps mutant mice without any abnormalities in hepatic glucose production. Furthermore, in vitro knockdown studies in L 6 myoblast cells revealed that reduction of SKIP expression level increased insulin-stimulated Akt/PKB phosphorylation and 2 -deoxyglucose uptake. These results imply that <b>SKIP</b> regulates insulin <b>signaling</b> in skeletal muscle. Thus, SKIP may be a promising pharmacologic target for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Multigenic {{families}} of Plant Defensin type 1 (PDF 1) {{have been described}} in several species, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as well as zinc tolerant and hyperaccumulator A. halleri. In A. thaliana, PDF 1 transcripts (AtPDF 1) accumulate in response to pathogen attack following synergic activation of ethylene/jasmonate pathways. However, in A. halleri, PDF 1 transcripts (AhPDF 1) are constitutively highly accumulated. Through an evolutionary approach, we investigated the possibility of A. halleri or A. thaliana species specialisation in different PDF 1 s in conveying zinc tolerance and/or the response to pathogen attack via activation of the jasmonate (JA) signalling pathway. The accumulation of each PDF 1 from both A. halleri and A. thaliana was thus compared in response to zinc excess and MeJA application. In both species, PDF 1 paralogues were barely {{or not at all}} responsive to zinc. However, regarding the PDF 1 response to JA signalling activation, A. thaliana had a higher number of PDF 1 s responding to JA signalling activation. Remarkably, in A. thaliana, a slight but significant increase in zinc tolerance was correlated with activation of the JA signalling pathway. In addition, A. halleri was found to be more tolerant to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea than A. thaliana. Since PDF 1 s are known to be promiscuous antifungal proteins able to convey zinc tolerance, we propose, {{on the basis of the}} findings of this study, that high constitutive PDF 1 transcript accumulation in A. halleri is a potential way to <b>skip</b> the JA <b>signalling</b> activation step required to increase the PDF 1 transcript level in the A. thaliana model species. This could ultimately represent an adaptive evolutionary process that would promote a PDF 1 joint effect on both zinc tolerance and the response to pathogens in the A. halleri extremophile species...|$|R
40|$|A custom {{laboratory}} {{electronic timer}} circuit measures the durations of successive cycles of nominally highly stable input clock signals {{in as many}} as eight channels, for the purpose of statistically quantifying the small instabilities of these signals. The measurement data generated by this timer are sent to a personal computer running software that integrates the measurements to form a phase residual for each channel and uses the phase residuals to compute Allan variances for each channel. (The Allan variance is a standard statistical measure of instability of a clock signal.) Like other laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer utilizes an externally generated reference clock signal having a known frequency (100 MHz) much higher than the frequencies of the input clock signals (between 100 and 120 Hz). It counts the number of reference-clock cycles that occur between successive rising edges of each input clock signal of interest, thereby affording a measurement of the input clock-signal period to within the duration (10 ns) of one reference clock cycle. Unlike typical prior laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer does not skip some cycles of the input clock signals. The non-cycle-skipping feature is an important advantage because in applications that involve integration of measurements over long times for characterizing nominally highly stable clock <b>signals,</b> <b>skipping</b> cycles can degrade accuracy. The timer includes a field-programmable gate array that functions as a 20 -bit counter running at the reference clock rate of 100 MHz. The timer also includes eight 20 -bit latching circuits - one for each channel - at the output terminals of the counter. Each transition of an input signal from low to high causes the corresponding latching circuit to latch the count at that instant. Each such transition also sets a status flip-flop circuit to indicate the presence of the latched count. A microcontroller reads the values of all eight status flipflops and then reads the latched count for each channel for which the flip-flop indicates the presence of a count. Reading the count for each channel automatically causes the flipflop of that channel to be reset. The microcontroller places the counts in time order, identifies the channel number for each count, and transmits these data to the personal computer...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a methodology for modeling stochastic signals that have either Gaussian or approximately bell-shaped non-Gaussian distribution. The synthesized {{model can be}} used to generate stochastic signals that approximate both the power spectral density (PSD) and the probability density function (pdf) of the original stochastic signal. The new methodology is based on non-linear transformations, filter banks and autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models. Because the stochastic signals modeled can have Gaussian distribution or approximately bell shaped non-Gaussian distribution, normality tests such as sample skewness, sample kurtosis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Shapiro-Wilk test are also used. ^ Many methods have been proposed in the literature for model order estimation and parameter estimation in ARMA modeling. For Gaussian signals, the methods are usually based on second order statistics and, for non-Gaussian, the methods are usually based on higher order statistics. However, in the literature review conducted, a simple method was not found for modeling either Gaussian or non-Gaussian signals that can: (1) consistently estimate true model orders; (2) approximate peaky power spectral densities; (3) approximate the pdf of the original input signal; and (4) have fast computation using parallel architectures. ^ The problem of modeling stochastic non-Gaussian signals is solved here by first using an appropriate non-linear function to transform the input signal to Gaussian. If the input stochastic signal is already Gaussian, then this first step is <b>skipped.</b> The Gaussian <b>signal</b> is then decomposed using an adaptive filter bank which simplifies the model order estimation, and which enables modeling of each subband component using a fixed order ARMA model with only two poles and two zeros. The use of decimated filter bank decomposition also simplifies the modeling of signals that have peaky PSD because it generates subband components that have a smoother PSD than the Gaussian input signal and that can be approximated with low order ARMA. The adaptive filter bank gives perfect reconstruction and implements a dyadic tree decomposition similar to that used in adaptive wavelet packets. ^ After the modeling process is completed, the system {{can be used to}} generate stochastic signals that approximate both the PSD and the pdf of the original input signal. Independent random sequences with Gaussian distribution are applied to the input of the ARMA models and then filtered with the corresponding filters of the synthesis filter bank. The new components are then added to synthesize a stochastic signal that approximates the PSD of the Gaussian input signal. If the original input signal was non-Gaussian, then the corresponding inverse non-linear transformation is finally applied. This new stochastic signal approximates both the PSD and the pdf of the original stochastic signal. ^ The new methodology was extensively tested using test Gaussian sequences generated by known ARMA models and stochastic non-Gaussian sequences provided by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). The non-Gaussian test sequences used had skewness in the range of - 0. 3 to + 0. 3 and kurtosis in the range 1. 5 to 5. 5. All the sequences tested in this thesis indicate that the new methodology can be used to model both the PSD and the pdf of stochastic Gaussian or bell-shaped non-Gaussian sequences. ...|$|R
