50|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the 11 September attacks, Navy SEALs quickly dispatched to Camp Doha, and those already aboard US Naval vessels in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters began conducting VBSS operations against ships suspected of having ties to or even carrying al Qaeda operatives. SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of Masirah for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs' immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct special reconnaissance (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the Army Rangers also staging on Masirah, the <b>SEALs</b> <b>inserted</b> into Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become Camp Rhino, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan (OEF-A).

At dawn, they approach the compound, hear Morales being tortured, and decide to enter the compound early. Rorke and Weimy, the team sniper, provide cover for the other five, led by Dave, who conduct room-clearing, engaging several enemy guards. Mikey is shot in the head, blinding him in one eye, and knocking him unconscious, though he survives. The SEALs extract Morales, escaping with her and recovering a cellphone full of the information she had gathered. However, the gunfight alerts the enemy quick reaction force down the road, who drive toward the camp. The SEALs commandeer an enemy truck and exfiltrate. The hot pursuit forces them to revert to a tertiary extraction point where the SOC-R boats extract the team and neutralize the enemy pursuit with miniguns.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research program {{to develop and}} evaluate a new high temperature, self-lubricating powder metallurgy composite, PM 212. PM 212 has the same composition as the plasma-sprayed coating, PS 212, which contains 70 wt percent metal-bonded chromium carbide, 15 wt percent silver and 15 wt percent barium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic. The carbide acts as a wear resistant matrix and the silver and fluorides act as low and high temperature lubricants, respectively. The material is prepared by sequential cold press, cold isostatic pressing and sintering techniques. In this study, hemispherically tipped wear pins of PM 212 were prepared and slid against superalloy disks at temperatures from 25 to 850 C in air in a pin-on-disk tribometer. Friction coefficients range from 0. 29 to 0. 38 and the wear of both the composite pins and superalloy disks was moderate to low in the 10 (exp - 5) to 10 (exp - 6) cubic mm/N-m range. Preliminary tests indicate that the material has a compressive strength of at least 130 MPa over the entire temperature range of 25 to 900 C.

50|$|Electrical {{connector}} contacts {{are typically}} Beryllium copper (BeCu) or Phosphor bronze {{which is then}} plated with gold or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a dielectric insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer, and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often die-cast aluminum and plated or anodized for corrosion protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a soldered or crimped connection. The seal between the shell and insert may be moisture resistant or a hermetic <b>seal.</b> The <b>inserts</b> in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a keying feature to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem.

40|$|The {{enhanced}} gaseous nitrogen (EGN) dewar is a cryogenic dry shipper with a <b>sealed</b> cylinder <b>inserted</b> inside {{along with}} a temperature monitoring device, and is intended for macromolecular crystallization experiments on the International Space Station. Within the dewar, each crystallization experiment is contained as a solution within a plastic capillary tube. The standard procedure for loading samples in these tubes has involved rapid freezing of the precipitant and biomolecular solution, e. g., protein, directly in liquid nitrogen; this method, however, often resulted in uncontrolled formation of air voids, These air pockets, or bubbles, can lead to irreproducible crystallization results. A novel protocol has been developed to prevent formation of bubbles, {{and this has been}} tested in the laboratory as well as aboard the International Space Station during a 42 -day long mission of July/August 2001.

40|$|Lecturepg. 23 Metal bellows seals, {{originally}} {{developed for the}} aerospace/defense industry, are now widely accepted in the petrochemical, chemical, and general industrial markets. Metal bellows seals offer enhanced dynamic tracking of the seal rings because they eliminate dynamic secondary seals. They are ideally suited for difficult high temperature applications, {{like those in the}} petrochemical industry that demand enhanced seal reliability. An effective means of ensuring seal reliability is by controlling face distortion, which directly affects the operating conditions at the sealing surface. When designing a seal, it is necessary to consider distortion resulting from pressure, the presence of temperature gradients {{in the area of the}} interface, and stress relaxation of interference fit components. All three of these factors can result in distortion of the face and changes to the lubricating fluid film thickness between the faces. Historically, to reduce stress relaxation of interference fit components in high temperature applications, material selection was limited to materials with a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to that of the <b>seal</b> ring <b>insert.</b> Recently, innovative design and manufacturing technology has made it possible to offer metal bellows seals made of corrosion resistant alloys for high temperature applications (up to 800 degrees F). This design controls face distortion at elevated temperatures. It does this through design rather than material selection, which limits the applicability of the seal. A comparison of the new design to more traditional designs is made and the performance advantages, including experimental and field test results, are described. The combination of an optimized metal bellows and balanced interference fit technologies provide enhanced seal performance for high temperature, corrosive applications...|$|R
30|$|In parallel, to {{investigate}} the effect of waste glass powder on the ASR expansion of cementitious composite bars, pH values in pore solution of cementitious composite were also measured by solid–liquid extraction method (Cyr et al. 2010). The extraction of the pore solution of small pieces of hardened cement mortar under hydraulic pressure {{is the most common}} technique for acquiring pore solution for further analysis including pH measurements (Cyr et al. 2010; Jr and Diamond 1981; Plusquellec et al. 2017). The pore fluid expression device consists of a hollow steel cylinder in which cement mortar specimens are located, a steel piston which is located {{on the top of the}} specimen inside the hollow steel cylinder and a steel base plate which has few drainage channels for collecting the extracted cementitious composites pore solution. In terms of pH measurement after extracting the concrete pore solution, pH values using a commercial pH electrode or determining hydroxide ion concentrations can be used for calculating the pH value (Pavlı́K 2000). Before each extraction test, all surfaces of the device were cleaned by ethanol at least twice until no residue remained. An approximately 6  mm-thick Teflon <b>seal</b> was <b>inserted</b> between the top of the specimen and the bottom surface of the piston to reduce the damage to the piston and reduce the friction between cement mortar specimens and piston by facilitating transfer of the applied pressure to the specimens. The loading rate for extraction was about 1 – 2.8  MPa/s until the maximum 550  MPa stress was achieved. To eliminate residual particles, the collected solution was filtered as soon as possible using filter paper with pore size of 0.45  μm. Then the pH of the pore solution was determined using a precision pH meter. All the liquid specimens were sealed to minimize any carbonation or oxidation.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} 10 years, 41 {{patients}} with dural tear caused by anterior cranial fossa bone fracture were treated surgically.

Traffic accidents, as well as wounds caused by missiles (shell fragments or bullets), blows, and falls were the mechanisms of injury. An autogenous graft, followed by homologous (lyodura) and most recently by heterologous (lyoplant; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) implants, was used to repair the dural lacerations. Fibrin adhesive was used to <b>seal</b> the sutures <b>inserted</b> between graft and dural defect margins in a majority of cases. The following criteria are required for the best dural substitute: uncontaminated tissue, histologic similarity to the local dura mater, adaptability, quick rehidratation, waterproof closure and the dural margins fast healing, and tensile strength easily resisting cerebrospinal fluid pressurization in physiological and pathological conditions. To define the effects of different tissue that could meet the above-mentioned criteria, we have undertaken a mechanical testing of the dural substitutes' tensile strength followed by histologic examination, and comparison with the dura mater of the anterior fossa region.

The prosthesis was passed through the round window membrane in one ear. In the other the prosthesis bypassed the round window via an opening anteroinferior to the round window niche. Before death, horseradish peroxidase was administered as a tracer for possible pathways of infection.

The unimplanted round window membrane and the seals around the electrode entry points prevented infection from entering the cochlea. The <b>seals</b> around electrodes <b>inserted</b> either through the round window membrane or an opening drilled anteroinferior to the niche were equally effective. The horseradish peroxidase tracer studies showed, however, that a gap existed between the electrode and membranous seal, and this could be a potentially vulnerable site under certain conditions.

Breathing out against the positive pressure resistance (the expiratory positive airway pressure component, or EPAP) may also feel unpleasant to some patients. These factors lead to inability to continue treatment due to patient intolerance in about 20% of cases where it is initiated. Some machines have pressure relief technologies that makes sleep therapy more comfortable by reducing pressure at the beginning of exhalation and returning to therapeutic pressure just before inhalation. The level of pressure relief is varied based on the patient’s expiratory flow, making breathing out against the pressure less difficult. Those who suffer an anxiety disorder or claustrophobia are less likely to tolerate PAP treatment. Sometimes medication will be given to assist with the anxiety caused by PAP ventilation.|$|R
30|$|In the Bitcoin network, {{transactions}} {{are made and}} immediately announced by broadcasting them to the neighbouring network nodes that propagate the announce further. Nodes also validate transactions which are gathered into blocks which are cryptographically <b>sealed</b> and <b>inserted</b> (every 10 minutes approximately) into the Blockchain after a validation from the community. Bitcoin network participants reach consensus {{on the order of}} the transactions by voting by computation power majority (the proof of work). In theory every network node could participate to this consensus mechanism, but, in the years, this activity has become typical of a specialised part of the community called “miners”. Miners get newly emitted Bitcoin in reward for this activity. A block contains the hash of the last valid block and the record of the most recent transactions observed by the miner and not included yet in the Blockchain. The miner will try to seal it cryptographically with a hash produced from the block itself and a random part. If the hash number is by chances smaller than a threshold imposed by the proof-of-work then it is considered “valid” and it can start to be broadcasted to the network. When a node receives a new block, it should verify if the block is valid. In order to do that, it checks whether the hash of the block fulfils the proof-of-work requirements. After that, the node also verifies the digital signatures and the formatting of each transaction inside the block. If the whole block and all the {{transactions are}} verified, it accepts the new block as valid and starts propagating it through the network (and if the node is a miner, also it will start to discover the next block on top of it). Conversely, if the block is not valid, or at least one transaction inside the block is invalid, the block will be discarded. The Blockchain is the chain of blocks built {{one on top of the}} other in chronological sequence uniquely associated with a sequence of hash numbers. Miners get their gain mainly from the cryptographic sealing of new blocks with a valid hash number; therefore, they have little incentives to make the system efficient by carefully checking if all transactions are included in the blocks.|$|R

40|$|The {{conceptual}} design and preliminary engineering calculations {{have been completed}} for a two cassette cryostat. This report summarizes the design. A cryocooler is permanently mounted {{in the center of}} a stainless steel, 0. 75 inch thick top lid. The cryocooler sits upon a spacer which raises the cooling stage elevations to favorably match the cassette heat intercept elevations. The top lid (32. 0 -inch outside diameter) mates to a 24 -inch pipe size flange with o-ring. The 24 -inch pipe size vacuum vessel with end plate has a minimum internal depth of 16 -inch to give adequate clearance for the depth of the cryocooler and multilayer insulation blankets. Support stand legs elevate the container to a convenient height and allow for placement of the AFE power supply underneath. Two cassette slots are located on either side of the cryocooler. The slots are positioned parallel to each other, 10. 5 -inch center to center (6 standard cassette slot widths) so that the standard 8 slot AFE backplane can be used. The slot opening through the lid is approximately 1. 422 -inch x 16. 782 -inch. A 0. 016 -inch thick titanium (Ti- 6 AI- 4 V) envelope with <b>sealing</b> lip is <b>inserted</b> through lid and defines the gas helium boundary that the VLPC cassette resides. The internal dimensions of the titanium envelope are 1. 390 -inch x 16. 75 -inch x 10. 531 -inch deep. When the cassette is inserted the clearances will be 0. 015 -inch on the long side, 0. 063 -inch on the short side, and 0. 032 -inch at the bottom. The cassette gasket seals against the top lip of the titanium envelope. A soft gasket or thin vacuum sealant tape seals the underside of the titanium envelope to the top surface of the lid. A clamping hold down bar may be necessary to make this vacuum seal. Gas helium for the cassette space is supplied through a fitting and port that is added to the cassette bulkhead assembly. This is the only modification necessary the standard D-Zero cassette. Evacuation and backfilling and then stagnant positive pressure are achieved through this one port. After the titanium envelope/pocket and cassette are mounted to the top lid, the lid is raised so that assembly work can be accomplished below. Three pneumatic cylinders mounted to the lid are pressurized (with air or the gas helium source) to raise the lid. Safety linkages are installed to prevent accidental lowering of the lid while work is being performed. Honeycomb sandwich panels are attached to the titanium envelope to support the thin envelope against the pressure differential. A thin thermoplastic mesh placed between the honeycomb panel and titanium envelope helps to insulate the panel so it is not a significant parallel heat path down the wall. There are two panel sets for each cassette. One for the area above the upper intercept and one set for the area below. It is reasonable that a 0. 40 -inch thick panel will suffice. A high conductance thermal link is made between the first stage of the cryocooler and the uppermost intercept location. This is solid OFHC copper part with a short section of flexible copper braid that connects to bars that clamp solidly to the long sides of the cassette envelope. Apiezon 'N' grease is used at assembly to enhance heat transfer at the clamp bar to titanium envelope interface. A second high conductance thermal connection is made between the second stage of the cryocooler and the bottom of the cassette envelope. The link is mostly solid OFHC copper along with a short flexible braid section in between. The two piece clamping bar encases the bottom 1. 75 -inch of the cassette. Thermal grease is used at the interface...|$|R
