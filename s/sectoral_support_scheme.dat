Our analysis aims at finding the right equilibrium between market signals received by wind generators and their intrinsic risks. More market signals are needed to give the right incentives for reducing wind integration costs but should not undermine the effectiveness of <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> Although several alternatives combining <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> and market signals could improve the current situation in terms of market signals and risks, feed-in premium <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> seems actually to be the more balanced option. Furthermore, an adequate sharing of wind generation technical responsibility between the system operator and wind power producers can help to control wind integration costs {{even in the absence of}} accurate market signals.

40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil the European Union’s {{renewable}} energy policy and its multiple objectives, the Member States of the Union have introduced national <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewable electricity. These <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> are not harmonized, {{but they need}} to be carefully designed and comply with various aspects of EU law. This includes state aid concerns. Instead of following the Commission’s Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014 - 2020, which today guide the Member States’ <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design to quite a large extent, this thesis proposes an alternative way for Member States to comply with state aid law when <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewable electricity are designed. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify whether schemes for the promotion of renewable electricity could potentially, as EU law stands today, be classified as services in the general economic interest (SGEI), and to clarify potential difficulties that a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable electricity would face in relation to material compatibility with EU law if it was classified as an SGEI. The idea of qualifying a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable electricity as an SGEI rests on the thought that the production of renewable energy might be viewed as a service of general or public interest. The objectives of a renewable energy <b>support</b> <b>scheme,</b> and especially the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, could be seen as general or public interest objectives. While producing renewable energy, the energy producers might then be conceived as providing a service in the general interest, and the support that the producer receives under the <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> would be seen as compensation for the service provided. An analysis of the position of SGEI under EU law, and an attempt to give a general definition of SGEI including some limits to this definition is made. Simultaneously, the possibility to fit <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewable electricity into the definition is analysed. The possibility to include renewable electricity in the concept of SGEI is thereafter gradually analysed by reviewing environmental SGEIs, the position of public service obligations in the Electricity Directive, and existing Union soft and case law dealing with the possibility to define a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable energy as an SGEI. The study shows that the possibility to introduce a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable electricity as an SGEI finds support in EU law, but the factual possibility to introduce a <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable energy as an SGEI is circumscribed by quite a few restrictions and established SGEI characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The new Directive 2009 / 28 /EC {{stipulates}} an ambitious, {{legally binding}} {{target of a}} 20 per cent renewable energy share in overall energy consumption in the European Union by 2020. In addition to national <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> Member States may implement measures of cooperation, such as statistical transfers, joint or coordinated support mechanisms, and joint projects. National <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> constitute crucial determinants for the investment decision of renewable electricity producers and can hence no longer be seen in isolation. With the newly adopted Directive {{and the possibility of}} measures for cooperation, the interesting question emerges how this will impact the choice and design of national <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> i. e., if there will be a convergence or divergence in <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design in the race towards the 2020 target. This paper seeks to investigate to what extent we can already observe convergence or divergence in national <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design for meeting the renewable energy targets. The analysis consists of two steps: firstly, based on a case study on the support for wind energy in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom, the historical evolution of support legislation will be examined to find out if any trends in <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design have already materialized. Secondly, a quantitative analysis will discuss the difference in the allocation of risk among investors and the state for the predominant <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> in place. From this, conclusions will be drawn for future policy implications...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{overview}} of the European Union (EU) Member States <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for the promotion of renewable energy sources (RES) is provided. In particular, the status of the electricity generation capacity as well as the RES mixture in the Member States is described. Moreover, the different <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> such as, investment support, feed-in tariffs (FiTs), tradable green certificates, and fiscal and financial measures which the Member States have adopted for the promotion of RES technologies are discussed in detail. Some Member States are implementing a single <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for the promotion of RES for power generation (RES-E), e. g., seven Member States use FiTs, or implement a hybrid <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> by combining all or some of the four categories of the RES-E <b>supporting</b> <b>schemes.</b> Although, these <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> have increased the penetration of the RES-E technologies in the Member States, still there is a long way in order to achieve the 2020 target. The reason for this may be that the way these schemes have been used so far, i. e., either as single <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> or in combination of FiTs or tradable green certificates with investment support and fiscal and financial measures, has been ineffective. A more effective combination could be a hybrid scheme consisting of FiTs with tradable green certificates measures, {{as in the case of}} Italy and United Kingdom, that will increase the RES-E penetration and eliminate the possible technical problems which will arise from this increased penetration and have an effect in the stability of the power system...|$|R

However, today's technical and economic challenges are preventing mass-market adoption. In order to create an early market and support economies of scale in production, some European countries have already established <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> This research study aims to {{provide an overview of}} the existing <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> in Europe and to assess them using four criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, practicability, and political acceptance. The study concludes with an impact analysis of today's economic <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> which considers the total costs of ownership. While one-time <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> help to reduce the large initial investments for EVs, recurring instruments are often more effective and efficient but also smaller in volume. The comparison of the different regional incentive schemes reveals that EVs today are only economically attractive in Denmark and Norway, but at relatively high prices. Thus, regulators need to increase the volume and efficiency of the <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> establish high scoring instruments, and align these on a European scale. In addition, non-monetary support, e. g. free-parking, can help to overcome technical or smaller economic hurdles. [...] ...|$|R

The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to examine investment behaviours under different market systems and <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> This paper further investigates the interaction of technological progress and <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> Four scenarios are designed, and the corresponding real options models are established. In the case study, we find that electricity market reform enhances the defer option value in the short term but makes the owners of solar PV projects postpone their investment. Nevertheless, the government can stimulate investment by implementing appropriate <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> Additionally, the impacts of different <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> vary according to the market system. The impacts of feed-in tariffs and price premiums are similar in a regulated market but are different in a free market. The price premium scheme greatly promotes the defer option values in the short term, but the feed-in tariff scheme excels in the long term. A feed-in tariff has a greater impact on reducing the expected execution time and its variance than the price premium. In addition, more attractive <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> are required when the technological level is improved...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{cost-effective}} RES-E deployment it is often argued that technology-neutral <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewables are indispensable. Against this background, RES-E support policies making widely use of technology differentiation in remuneration settings, e. g. across the EU, are frequently criticized from a theoretical point of view. However, {{in this paper we}} provide a systematic critique of the technology neutrality concept as a foundation for designing policy <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> in the RES-E technology field. Specifically, the main objective of the paper is to scrutinize the arguments for technology-neutrality, and discuss three conceptual arguments for why technology-specific <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> could in fact help minimize the societal costs of reaching future RES-E targets. We also briefly address different political economy concerns, which could constrain the choice of cost-effective policy <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> and that have {{to be taken into account}} for economic policy advice. For empirical illustration of the key arguments we refer to the case of German RES-E support...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources (RES) has several complex technical and economic aspects, such as: grid reinforcement, tertiary power reserves required for intermittent operation of RES, promoting or <b>support</b> <b>scheme,</b> etc. In this paper, the focus {{will be given to}} wind and photovoltaic energy integration from the promoting scheme point of view, with a special emphasis on the case of Romania. In this respect, we propose a model that shows the relation between wind and photovoltaic energy integration and <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> in Romania. Due to the green certificates (GC) <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> design that is related to several elements such as total consumption forecast, installed power of the plants based on each type of RES and their full load hours that are expected to vary, we also perform several sensitivity analyses. The GC <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> implemented in Romania provides interesting insights regarding the installed power based on the primary energy source that could benefit from the GC for RES investors, policy and decision makers...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for {{renewable}} energy sources in the electricity sector (RES-E) are currently being implemented in EU member states. The main tools {{used for this purpose}} are either price-based policy instruments such as feed-in tariffs or premiums, or quantity-based instruments such as quota systems using tradable green certificates. Much work has been devoted to the motivation for and evaluation of these instruments, mostly in the form of country/local case studies, model simulations, or econometric modeling. The main drivers behind these policies are addressing the externalities of the environmentally harmful emissions of electricity generation and stimulating technological innovation. Two frequently used evaluation criteria for <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> and instruments are their effectiveness and economic efficiency. We find that those <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are most effective in stimulating the growth of RES-E generation, are typically economically efficient as we ll. Generally, it can be concluded that <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are technology specific, and those that avoid unnecessary risks in project revenues, are more effective and efficient than technology-neutral <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> or schemes with higher revenue risk. The most recent quantitative assessment shows that some convergence can now be observed between schemes applying price- and quantity-based instruments. With respect to policy effectiveness, quota schemes show improvements. Regarding efficiency, the situation is still very heterogeneous, and remuneration levels in many EU member states are still substantially higher than generation costs...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of the Directive 2009 / 28 /EC on {{the promotion of the}} use of energy from renewable sources was an important step for the successive contribution to the global Climate Change Regime as well as the diversification of energy supply, thus ensuring energy security and reducing dependence on external suppliers. However, although the Directive sets out legally binding targets for each Member State by 2020 as well as interim targets, it does not provide any legally binding instruments, i. e., renewableenergy <b>support</b> <b>scheme(s),</b> to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. Since the overall EU target as well as national targets are fairly ambitious, it poses a question, why the Directive does not include specific legally binding instrument(s) for achieving these targets, whereas the so-called flexibility mechanisms, provided in the Directive, are limited only to non-obligatory cooperation between Member States. It is important to mention that, during the negotiation process on the Directive,the harmonization of Member States' renewable energy policies through the EU-level mechanism of Guarantees of Origin was widely debated. Therefore, the intergovernmental negotiation on the Directive's provisions on renewable energy <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> which should allow Member States to achieve their national targets as well as the overall EU target shall be submitted as the object of this article, while the purpose is to analyze the case of negotiating the EU-level renewable energy <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> and to investigate the intergovernmental factors such as asymmetrical bargaining power of Member States aswell as specific domestic factors' influence for the negotiation's results, applying liberal intergovernmentalistapproach as the theoretical framework for analysis. The main tasks of the article are:__ to introduce the basic provisions of liberal intergovernmentalism and to formulate principal theoretical assumptions for further empirical analysis;__ to present a compact overview of the <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> for renewables, applied in the EU;__ to define the role of the European Commission in the negotiation process, to determine the positions of the Member States on a common <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewable energy, to analyze the process of interest bargaining through coalition-forming and to detect the essential results of the negotiation. The main methods applied in this article include an analysis of the documents and the Member States' position papers, conducting a case study of the negotiation process on the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin as the common EU-wide <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewables in the Directive 2009 / 28 /EC on thepromotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The article consists of three parts. The basic provisions of liberal intergovernmentalism as well as the principal theoretical assumptions are examined {{in the first part of}} the article as the theoretical framework for further empirical analysis. Renewable energy <b>support</b> <b>schemes,</b> applied in the EU, are presented in the second part and the case study of the intergovernmental negotiation on the pan-European <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewables based on the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin is carried out in the third part. The findings show that the majority of the Member States demonstrated strong opposition to the European Commission's proposal for harmonizing their renewable energy policies through specific pan-European <b>support</b> <b>scheme,</b> i. e., the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin. The Commission's initiative was rejected by posing an argument that the instruments for reaching the renewable energy targets must be selected according to the principal of subsidiarity with respect to each Member State's national specificsas only under these circumstances renewable energy <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> could function in the most sufficient and effective manner. Therefore, the Commission's initial proposal had to be significantly modified thus abandoning the idea of the EU-level <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> for renewables. The findings also verify theoretical assumptions based on liberal intergovernmentalism which postulate that the negotiation's results mainly depend on asymmetric bargaining power and the most powerful Member States' preferences determined by their national specifics, <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> and other domestic factors...|$|R
