5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he checked the {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying {{next to one of}} the wings—he had not worn his <b>safety</b> <b>belt.</b> Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his <b>safety</b> <b>belt,</b> and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E

25|$|Another {{intervention}} study, conducted among U.S. and Canadian drivers, evaluated {{a device}} that prevents drivers from shifting vehicles into gear for up to 8 seconds unless safety belts are buckled. Participants were 101 commercial drivers who operated vans, pickups, and other light trucks. The driver could escape or avoid the delay by fastening his or her <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> before shifting out of park. Unbelted participants experienced either a constant delay of 8 seconds, or a variable delay of 8 seconds on average. A 16-second delay was introduced for those U.S. drivers who did not show significant improvement. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use increased from 48% to 67% for U.S. drivers and from 54% to 74% for Canadian drivers. After the driver fastened his or her <b>safety</b> <b>belt,</b> it tended to remain fastened {{for the duration of}} the trip.|$|E

The use of <b>safety</b> <b>belts</b> in rural and urban areas is mentioned, as is the problem of cars in which <b>safety</b> <b>belts</b> have to be used. A distinction is made between adults, children of different ages, disabled persons and pregnant women. Finally some objections to the use of <b>safety</b> <b>belts</b> are discussed...|$|R

Additionally, Volvo developed the first rear-facing child seat in 1964 and introduced its own booster seat in 1978.|$|E

Once close, the crew secured the rope launched by the keepers. The rope was used to ferry a passenger back and forth. Once the passenger had secured his <b>safety</b> <b>belt,</b> he sat down with his luggage astride a kind of large ball that slid up or down the rope. In stormy weather the manoeuvre was particularly delicate and difficult; in fierce gales it was often impossible.|$|E
25|$|Employers are in {{a unique}} {{position}} because they can use the employer-employee relationship as leverage to complement and enforce government policies that require <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use, prohibit impaired driving, and prohibit mobile-phone use and other forms of distracted driving. Safe-driving policies implemented in the workplace can promote safer driving away from work. In addition, employers, as purchasers of large fleets of vehicles, can spur improvements in vehicle safety, and encourage development of road safety capacity and legislation in the local areas and countries in which they operate, thereby improving road safety for all.|$|E

2500|$|Novas and all 1974 {{cars were}} {{fitted with a}} weight {{sensitive}} relay within the front seat that prevented the vehicle from being started until the driver's seatbelt had been fastened, following a safety mandate from the NHTSA. Later, a law passed by Congress repealed the mandate requiring this type of device, declaring that it infringed on a driver's freedom of choice, and allowed owners of 1974-model cars to have the seat belt interlock bypassed. The devices {{were not included in}} future Nova models. [...] Along with this controversial seat belt interlock, a new, more convenient [...] "inertial reel" [...] one-piece lap/shoulder <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> assembly was standard for both front outboard passengers, along with a plastic clip attached to the headrest to guide the belt across the wearer's shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|Trolley poles {{are usually}} raised and lowered {{manually}} by a rope {{from the back}} of the vehicle.

The trolley catcher contains a detent, like that in an automotive shoulder <b>safety</b> <b>belt,</b> which [...] "catches" [...] the rope to prevent the trolley pole from flying upward if the pole is dewired. The similar looking retriever (see photo) adds a spring mechanism that yanks the pole downward if it should leave the wire, pulling it away from all overhead wire fittings. Catchers are commonly used on trams operating at lower speeds, as in a city, whilst retrievers are used on suburban and interurban lines to limit damage to the overhead at speed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} is also stressing strict enforcement of <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> laws, in particular, the [...] "Primary <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> laws", which allow {{law enforcement officers}} issue a <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> citation without observing another offense.

Massachusetts, the state with the second lowest usage, has only a secondary <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> law, which requires officers to observe another driving offense before issuing a <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> citation.
