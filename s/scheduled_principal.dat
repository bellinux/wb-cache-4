40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the price {{sensitivity}} of fixed-income securities to the interest rate changes, expressing a dominant source of financial risk the financial institutions or other market participants manage. The most common modelling technique used by practitioners for measuring and managing the bond price sensitivity is the Macaulay's duration normally expressed in the modified duration form, also known as weighted average maturity of the bond, or the bond price sensitivity to the interest rate changes. Taking into account {{the fact that the}} standard concept of the duration has its limitations as the accuracy for small yield changes, a nonparallel shift in the yield curve or option-free bond assumption, we derive and describe the effective duration and convexity models for determining the expected theoretical price of the bonds with embedded options enabling the bond redemption prior to the maturity. To demonstrate computation and effect of the embedded option in a bond contract we use fun- damental characteristic of an option-free bond and two most common types of embedded options - call option and put options giving the issuer the right to call or prepay the debt obligation prior to the <b>scheduled</b> <b>principal</b> payment date (call option) or giving the investor the right to require the issuer to purchase the bond at a specified price (put option). To determine the theoretical price of the embedded option rights we use these two methods coupled with the modified Black model to cope with limitation of the traditional Macaulay's dura- tion approach. The results show a significant impact of the embedded options on the effective duration and convexity of fixed income securities...|$|E

In 2008, SODEC, Telefilm Canada, The Harold Greenberg Fund and Alliance Vivafilm decided to finance the production. Due to the films significant amount of visual effects, an extensive year of pre-production was necessary. Also, in order to work around Robert Lepages extremely tight <b>schedule,</b> <b>principal</b> photography took place in Montreal in two segments; the first was in September 2008, and the second was in April 2009. Since Lepage only had a few days available for filming, Villeneuve turned his character into a hologram and had another actor wearing a green hood stand in for his scenes during principal photography. The film was almost entirely shot on green screen, in 25 days, using the RED digital camera.|$|R
