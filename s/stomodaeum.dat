The true mouth is formed late by a tucking-in of epiblast, the <b>stomodaeum</b> (s.d.), which meets and fuses with the hypoblast, and is then perforated. The position of this mouth is at the velum. The formation of the atrium has been described. The metapleural folds run forward in front of the velum, as the epipleurs (ep. in Sections 1 and 2), and form an oral hood (b.c.), around which the tentacles appear, and which is evidently not equivalent to the vertebrate mouth cavity, but in front of and outside it.

40|$|Cambrian lobopodians are {{important}} for understanding the evolution of arthropods, but despite their soft-bodied preservation, {{the organization of the}} cephalic region remains obscure. Here we describe new material of the early Cambrian lobopodian Onychodictyon ferox from southern China, which reveals hitherto unknown head structures. These include a proboscis with a terminal mouth, an anterior arcuate sclerite, a pair of ocellus-like eyes and branched, antenniform appendages associated with this ocular segment. These findings, combined with a comparison with other lobopodians, suggest that the head of the last common ancestor of fossil lobopodians and extant panarthropods comprized a single ocular segment with a proboscis and terminal mouth. The lack of specialized mouthparts in O. ferox and the involvement of non-homologous mouthparts in onychophorans, tardigrades and arthropods argue against a common origin of definitive mouth openings among panar-thropods, whereas the embryonic <b>stomodaeum</b> might well be homologous at least in Ony-chophora and Arthropoda...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{points in}} the descriptive embryology of the sawfly appear to be important especially for comparison with the higher Hymenoptera, e. g. the honey bee. 1. The earlier stages of development (formation of the blastoderm, germinal layers, &c.) take relatively {{more time in the}} honey bee than in the sawfly, while the later stages of development (organogenesis) take more time in the sawfly. 2. Only two well-defined germ layers are formed—the outer (ectoderm) and the inner (mesoderm).

40|$|Pituitary {{homeobox}} (pitx) genes {{have been}} identified in vertebrates as critical molecular determinants of various craniofacial ontogenetic processes including pituitary organogenesis. Accordingly, a prominent conserved feature of pitx genes in chordates is their early expression in the anterior neural boundary (ANB) and oral ectoderm, also known as the <b>stomodaeum.</b> Here we used the ascidian model species Ciona intestinalis to investigate pitx gene organization and cis-regulatory logic during early stages of oral development. Two distinct Ci-pitx mRNA variants were found to be expressed in mutually exclusive embryonic domains. Ci-pitx and vertebrate pitx 2 genes display remarkably similar exon usage and organization, suggesting ancestry of the pitx transcriptional unit and regulation in chordates. We next combined phylogenetic footprinting, transient transgenesis, and confocal imaging methods to study the Ci-pitx cis-regulatory system, with special emphasis on the regulation of isoform-specific ANB/stomodaeal expression. Among 10 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) interspersed in C. intestinalis and Ciona savignyi pitx loci, we identified two separate cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that drive ANB/stomodaeal expression in complementary spatiotemporal patterns.

40|$|The foxa gene is an {{integral}} component of the endoderm specification subcircuit of the endomesoderm gene regulatory network in the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryo. Its transcripts become confined to veg 2, then veg 1 endodermal territories, and, following gastrulation, throughout the gut. It is also expressed in the stomodeal ectoderm. gatae and otx genes provide input into the pregastrular regulatory system of foxa, and Foxa represses its own transcription, resulting in an oscillatory temporal expression profile. Here, we report three separate essential functions of the foxa gene: it represses mesodermal fate in the veg 2 endomesoderm; it is required in postgastrular development {{for the expression of}} gut-specific genes; and it is necessary for <b>stomodaeum</b> formation. If its expression is reduced by a morpholino, more endomesoderm cells become pigment and other mesenchymal cell types, less gut is specified, and the larva has no mouth. Experiments in which blastomere transplantation is combined with foxa MASO treatment demonstrate that, in the normal endoderm, a crucial role of Foxa is to repress gcm expression in response to a Notch signal, and hence to repress mesodermal fate. Chimeric recombination experiments in which veg 2, veg 1 or ectoderm cells contained foxa MASO show which region of foxa expression controls each of the three functions. These experiments show that the foxa gene is a component of three distinct embryonic gene regulatory networks...|$|E
40|$|Zygotes of S. purpuratus were {{injected}} with synthetic mRNAs encoding rodent brain neurotransmitter receptors, and specific developmental phenotypes were produced on {{addition to the}} sea water of the respective ligands. Most of these experiments were carried out with a mouse serotonin receptor (5 HT-R) mRNA, though exactly comparable results were obtained with a rat muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (MAChR) mRNA; these receptors are expected to couple to the same endogenous signal transduction system. We show by whole mount in situ hybridization that the injected mRNAs diffuse {{to all of the}} early blastomeres, and that they are translated in vivo. Three specific phenotypes were reproducibly observed. The most severe, occurring at highest levels of injected mRNA, was a cleavage arrest phenotype in which no overtly differentiated cells ever appear, though the embryos remain alive for at least 72 h. A gastrular arrest (GA) phenotype is generated in appreciable fractions of embryos developing from eggs {{injected with}} lower levels of mRNA. In GA embryos the blastocoel is filled with disorganized mesenchyme cells, including pigment cells and skeletogenic cells; there is no archenteron; and the entire ectoderm expresses an oral ectoderm cell surface marker. The least severe phenotype that we recognized displays an altered arrangement of spiculogenic foci (RSE phenotype), generating a ring of extra spicules that are properly positioned with respect to the animal/vegetal axis, but that lack any reference to the oral/aboral axis. However, use of cytological and molecular markers demonstrates that RSE embryos retain normal spatial patterns of aboral and oral ectoderm. They develop a fully formed archenteron, but fail to form either a <b>stomodaeum</b> or a ciliated band. RSE embryos can be produced in embryos expressing the 5 HT-R by exposure to serotonin, beginning as late as 12 h postfertilization (pf). All of the morphogenetic processes affected in RSE embryos depend in normal embryos on intercellular interactions occurring at the blastula-gastrula stages of development...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was the {{molecular}} and morphogenetic characterisation of the larval body regions of the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii for evolutionary comparison with the body regions of other protostome and deuterostome model species. I have described the expression of several conserved homeobox transcription factors that broadly mark the neuroectoderm of the different larval body regions and can therefore be used as regionalisation markers in the trochophore larva of Platynereis dumerilii. A six 3 orthologue is a marker gene for the prostomium, the most anterior region of the trochophore larva. The peristomium that harbours the mouth region and the prototroch ciliary band expresses an otx orthologue as regionalisation marker in Platynereis. The subdivision of the metastomium into larval segments has been analysed by Pdu-engrailed expression. It is found to give rise to four larval segments, of which {{the first one is}} reduced and bears the first tentacular cirri. It is furthermore characterised as the most anterior gbx-expressing segment and is innervated by axons that connect to the circumoesophageal connectives left and right of the mouth opening. The second larval segment develops into the first chaetiferous segment and is characterised by the anterior-most hox 1 expression. The molecular and morphological comparison of the Platynereis anterior CNS with arthropods brains has allowed homologisation of the polychaete prostomial ganglia to the “archicerebrum” (putative most anterior part of the protocerebrum of arthropods), the peristomial ganglia with the “prosocerebrum” (putative posterior part of the protocerebrum), the ganglia of the first larval segment with the deutocerebrum and the second larval segment (first chaetiferous) ganglia with the tritocerebrum. Comparison with enteropneust (basal deuterostomes) larvae suggests homology and evolutionary conservation in Bilateria of the following larval body regions: prostomium/prosoma (six 3), peristomium/mesosoma (otx) and metastomium/metasoma (gbx and hox 1). This is supported by the origin and localisation of the different mesodermal populations in Platynereis that I have characterised by the expression of six 3, fgfr, myoD, twist, mef 2 and troponin I. I have found that the Platynereis “brain mesoderm” expresses six 3 as does the enteropneust prosoma. The mesodermal sheath around the <b>stomodaeum</b> in Platynereis has morphological similarities to the enteropneust mesosomal coelomic pouches and expresses fgfr and twist in Platynereis. The trunk mesoderm in Platynereis dynamically expresses myoD, twist, and mef 2, forms differentiated muscles cells as described by troponin I expression and originates from a similar position as the enteropneust metasomal mesoderm. The molecular comparison of Platynereis neuroectodermal regions with lower vertebrates’ brain regions suggests homology of prostomium/forebrain (six 3), peristomium/midbrain (otx) and trunk CNS/hindbrain (gbx and hox 1). In vertebrates, the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (positioned at the otx/gbx boundary) is a morphogenetic boundary between the posterior hindbrain/spinal chord region that undergoes convergent extension and the anterior forebrain-/midbrain regions that do not extend. I have found that reminiscent to vertebrate convergent extension in the hindbrain, the gbx-/hox 1 -expressing neural plate in Platynereis undergoes convergent extension by mediolateral cell intercalation that is possibly controlled by the non-canonical Wnt pathway. Similar to the vertebrate midbrain, the otx-expressing peristomium does not extend. Yet, these movements take place along a slit-like blastopore that develops into both mouth and anus in Platynereis, but occur in front of the blastopore that develops exclusively into the anus in vertebrates. This suggests that convergent extension movements are ancestral in Bilateria and have evolved in early bilaterians to relocate the blastopore-derived mouth and anus to opposite ends of the elongating body axis...|$|E
40|$|Resume 1) The egg of Squilla oratoria DE HAAN is centrolecithal and {{undergoes}} partial cleavages {{resulting in}} rudimentary primary yolk pyramids. 2) The germinal disk is first {{represented by a}} pair of optic lobes and a ventral plate, which are afterward connected by paired, lateral ectoderm thickenings to form a V-shape. The V is then transformed into an O by the appearance of a transverse band between the optic lobes of both sides. 3) A small blastopore is formed. Of the mesendoderm cells derived from the blastopore by cell immigrations, those attached to the lower surface of the lateral ectoderm thickenings are differentiated into a U-shaped, naupliar mesoderm band. This inesoderm band joins the preante:mulary mesoderm derived from the optic lobe, and grows into a complete ring conforming to the shape of the germinal disk. 4) The extra-blastoporic immigrants consist of a preantennulary mesoderm, mesodermal yolk cells and a part of the naupliar mesoderm. The greater part of the preantennulary mesoderm cells disintegrate sooner or later, without forming any distinct structure. The mesodermal yolk cells also degenerate after taking part in the dissolution of the deutoplasm. A discussion as regards the mutual relationship between these elements, with the conclusion that the formation of the preantennulary mesoderm represents the initial step of the extra-blastoporic cell sinking from the whole egg surface, is included. 5) The endodermal elements consist of a compact cell mass differentiated from the posterior part of the mesendoderm layer and the endodermal yolk cells immigrated from the blastopore. The yolk cells, after migrating through the most peripheral part of the yolk, scatter all over its surface. The endoderm plate is nothing but a mass of yolk cells. which remain without scattering. 6) Eight mesoteloblasts derived from the blastoporic lip are attached to the inner surface of the thoracico-abdominal process, making four groups. The ectoteloblasts are differentiated from the ordinary blastoderm cells in a later stage than the mesoteloblasts. In the final condition they consist of 21 cells forming a complete ring around the thoracico-abdominal process. 7) Both the ectoderm and the mesoderm are derived from the teloblasts in all of the post-naupliar segments. · The dorsal ectoderm, however, is non-teloblastic in only a few anterior segments. Differentiation of segments proceeds from the front toward the back. 8) The telson mesoderm is formed by the cells sunk from the telson ectoderm which is derived from the peri-blastoporic ectoderm. 9) The anus is the remnant of the blastopore. In accordance with the change of the caudal furca, the anus is displaced from the dorsal side of the telson to the ventral border between this and the last abdominal segment. 10) There is a distinct nauplius stage. Of the meta-naupliar segments, those from the m:txillula to the second maxilliped are laid on the germinal disk, the following segments together forming a thoracico-abdominal process. Two maxiliiped segments, however, are later separated from the cephalon with the development of the carapace fold, and join the trunk segments. Externally, six abdominal segments are formed. 11) The ganglionic cells are proliferated from the neuroblasts occupying the most superficial part of the centra 1 nervous system. The giant ganglionic cells arise from the ordinary ganglionic cells and not directly from neuroblasts. The development of the cerebrum is described. The tritocerebra of both sides are conne~ted by a transverse nerve-fibre bundle behind the <b>stomodaeum.</b> The ganglia of the segments from the mandible to the second maxilliped first exhibit a typical ladder-like shape. Of these ganglia, the anterior three constitute a sub-resophageal ganglion by more or less complete fusion, while the posterior two are transferred from the cephalon to the thoracico-abdomimil process with the constriction of the segments. The inter-ganglionic cell groups take part in the constriction of the consecutive segments. The seventh abdominal ganglion is clearly indicated by the presence of such a cell group as well as of a pair of nerve fibre masses. 12) The development of the compound eye is traced. The ganglion opticum is derived from the ectoderm of the optic lobe lateral to the protocerebrum; it is not an outgrowth of the cerebrum. 13) The ganglion visceralum is differentiated from the anterior wall of the <b>stomodaeum.</b> 14) A median dorsal organ is formed. In close connection with the activity of this organ, the embryo undergoes one ecdysis. 15) The mid-gut epithelium is formed by the gradual expansion of the anterior and posterior endoderm plates over the yolk sac. These plates, however, extend only on the ventral side of the yolk sac before hatching. The posterior plate is produced by the concentration of the scattered yolk cells toward the periphery of the. plate differentiated from the mesendoderm, while the anterior plate is formed by yolk cells alone. 16) The greater part of the intestine develops from the outgrowth of the posterior endoderm epithelium, the proctodaeum occupying only the rectum. 17) The posterior liver lobes are produced from the posterior endoderm plate as a pair of blind tubes and extend as far backward as the telson. The anterior liver lobes and the lateral mid-gut cceca are rather incompletely developed, being ~eparated by shallow superficial grooves of the yolk sac. These two pairs of diverticula are only partially covered by the endoderm epithelium, and develop into more or less distinct coeca during larval life. They later seem to be completely absorbed again by the mid-gut. 18) The product of each division of the mesoteloblast is equivalent to one mesodermal-segment. The mesoderm of the seventh abdominal segment is derived from the posteriorly situated daughter cell produced by the last division of the teloblast. In' accordance with the grouping of teloblasts, the trunk mesoderm is separated into two ventral and two dorsal bands. Each band is further separated into segmentally arranged blocks, the somites. The ccelom develops in no stage and in no segment. 19) The dorsal mesoderm gives rise to the extensor and the oblique muscles of the trunk, the anterior and posterior limb muscles, {{as well as to the}} mesodermal inclusion of the limb. The -ventral mesoderm grows into the flexor. The connective tissue investing the intestine -and the liver lobes are principally constructed from the dorsal mesoderm. The germ cell does not appear until hatching. A brief account is also given of the fate of the naupliar mesoderm. 20) The heart wall and the pericardial floor are morphologically one unit. They arise from the dorsal mesoderm as a pair of membranes stretching between it and the intestine. The dilated and elongated parts of the heart are formed by the subsequent union of these paired rudiments. 21) The anterior dorsal vessel has a two-fold origin; it is formed by the fusion of an anterior rudiment extending backward from the rostrum and a posterior one developing as a tubular outgrowth of the heart. The former is derived from the rearrangement of mesenchymatous cells which migrated from the anterior end of the naupliar mesoderm. 22) By the time of hatching, two pairs of lateral vessels are formed as hollow linear thickenings of the pericardial floor in front and behind the dilated part of the heart. 23) The antennal gland remains rudimentary without acquiring any intercellular lumen. The maxillar gland is not laid until hatching. The labral and anal glands are derived from the peristomodaeal and the telson mesoderm respectively. 23) Comparisons are made bewteen Squilla and other orders of Malacostraca as regards the salient points of the embryonic development. These have led to the conclusion that the Stomatopoda are most closely related in their embryonic development to Nebaliacea, and further that Stomatopoda represent a rather primitive group separated from the main stem of Malacostraca very early, only next in order to Nebaliacea...|$|E
