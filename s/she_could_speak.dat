5|$|Laurent {{had also}} planned another feature film, Putain de pluie!, {{produced}} by Alain Attal's Productions du Trésor, whose script she co-wrote with Morgan Perez and which {{she intended to}} direct. Originally set for filming {{in the spring of}} 2009, it was postponed because of her work on Inglourious Basterds. Knowing that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> French, and had already acted in French in one of the short films in Paris, je t'aime, she offered the first role to Natalie Portman, who declined because of the script's language.|$|E
5|$|When Makeba was {{eighteen}} days old, {{her mother was}} arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent {{the first six months}} of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> the language.|$|E
25|$|During {{his stay}} in Soviet Russia a second time, {{accepting}} {{an invitation for}} teaching Buddhism at Leningrad University, he {{came in contact with}} a Mongolian scholar Lola (Ellena Narvertovna Kozerovskaya). <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> French, English, and Russian and write Sanskrit. She helped him in working on Tibetan- Sanskrit dictionary. Their attachment ended in marriage and birth of son Igor. Mother and son were not allowed to accompany Rahul to India after completion of his assignment. It was Stalin's Russia.|$|E

25|$|Barbara was the {{youngest}} child of Jerzy Radziwiłł, Voivode of Trakai and Vilnius and Great Lithuanian Hetman, and his wife Barbara Kolanka, daughter of Voivode of Podolia. Her exact birth date is unknown. It is known that she was born on 6 December, but the year is not known. Historians usually provide either 1520, as recorded in Radziwiłł genealogy found in Nesvizh, or 1523, as recorded on a plaque found in her tomb. Details of her education are unknown, but {{it is unlikely that}} it was extensive. From her correspondence, it is known that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> and write in Polish. From a February 1549 letter it could be inferred that she understood at least some Latin, but her letters to Sigismund Augustus had not a single Latin phrase. According to her contemporaries, Barbara was very beautiful. Moreover, Barbara had an interest in fashion and cosmetics; she used perfumes and face powder.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak.</b> At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the episode}} with an A−. He {{described}} the main Jin-Sun storyline as [...] "delicate and gripping," [...] and believed Sun's eventual {{decision to stay}} with her husband was as [...] "intriguing" [...] as the revelation that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> English. Snierson also praised the episode's humor and tension between the castaways' [...] "we're-gonna-be-rescued-any-minute- versus-we're-gonna-be-here-for-awhile" [...] mentalities.|$|E

500|$|A {{week after}} the {{settlement}} of the Chandler's lawsuit was announced on January 25, 1994, L.A. District Attorney Gil Garcetti announced he supported amending a law that prohibits forcing {{people who say they}} have been sexually assaulted to testify in criminal proceedings. The amendment introduced into the state assembly the week of February 7 would have immediately allowed Garcetti to compel Jordan to testify. Around that time, Santa Barbara police interviewed the 13-year-old son of one of Jackson's former maids (who had told them her son had spent time with Jackson) and then arranged for him to see a therapist after he repeatedly denied being abused. [...] In a deposition, his mother stated when she asked the police about who <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> to about her concerns about their meetings and phone conversations with her son without her present, they arranged for her and her son to see separate therapists. On April 11, 1994, the grand jury session in Santa Barbara was extended for an additional 90-day term to allow Sneddon to gather more evidence and prosecution sources admitted to being frustrated in their grand jury probe, failing to find direct evidence of the molestation charges. The final grand jury ultimately disbanded without ever returning an indictment against Jackson.|$|E
2500|$|During her seclusion, Kartini {{continued}} to educate {{herself on her}} own. [...] Because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> Dutch, she acquired several Dutch pen friends. [...] One of them, a girl {{by the name of}} Rosa Abendanon, became a close friend. Books, newspapers and European magazines fed Kartini's interest in European feminist thinking, and fostered the desire to improve the conditions of indigenous Indonesian women, who at that time had a very low social status.|$|E
2500|$|In 1784, the Cosways {{moved into}} Schomberg House, Pall Mall, and {{developed}} a fashionable salon for London society. [...] Richard was Principal Painter of the Prince of Wales, and Maria served as hostess to artists, members of royalty including the Prince, and politicians including Horace Walpole, Gouverneur Morris and James Boswell. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> several languages and due to her travels in Italy and France, she gained an international circle of friends. These included Angelica Schuyler Church and the artist John Trumbull. Maria Cosway organised concerts and recitals for her guests. She became known as [...] "The Goddess of Pall-Mall".|$|E

2500|$|Born in Kraków, Isabella was {{the oldest}} child of King Sigismund I the Old and his Italian wife Bona Sforza. She {{spent most of her}} {{childhood}} at Wawel Castle in Kraków and hunting castle in Niepołomice. She also lived in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1527–29 and 1533–36. During the latter visit her three younger sisters were left in Kraków. This episode foreshadowed future family relationships: Bona Sforza favored her oldest daughter, arranging her marriage early, while the other three daughters were neglected and married late. Isabella received a good education, including from humanist Johannes Honter, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> and write four languages: Polish, Latin, German, and Italian (her mother's native language).|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Woman Disputed (1928) was released, the talking film {{revolution}} had begun, and Talmadge began taking voice lessons in preparation. She worked diligently with voice coaches {{for over a}} year so she could make her sound debut. Her first talkie, New York Nights (1929), showed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> and act acceptably in talkies. [...] While her performance was considered to be good, the film was not. Talmadge next took on the role of Madame du Barry in the 1930 film Du Barry, Woman of Passion. With incompetent direction and Talmadge's inexperience at a role requiring very demanding vocal acting, the film was a failure, in spite of the elaborate sets by William Cameron Menzies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975 the {{scientists}} said that Genie's voice had clearly strengthened and she modified both pitch and volume for emphasis and stress, but {{she continued to}} avoid speaking if possible because controlling her voice remained very difficult for her. Her vocalizations were still soft and breathy, and they wrote that, [...] "it is still very difficult to understand her {{if you have not}} been with her for a period of time." [...] In mid-1975 <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> with a relatively normal declarative sentence stress pattern, and began to do so with increasing frequency. Even then her pronunciation also remained abnormal, as she still frequently deleted and substituted sounds in her speech, and she remained unable to use intonation to indicate a question.|$|E

2500|$|Cassatt had befriended Degas and Pissarro {{years earlier}} when she joined Pissarro's newly formed French Impressionist group {{and gave up}} {{opportunities}} to exhibit in the United States. She and Pissarro were often treated as [...] "two outsiders" [...] by the Salon since neither were French or had become French citizens. However, she was [...] "fired up with the cause" [...] of promoting Impressionism and looked forward to exhibiting [...] "out of solidarity with her new friends". Towards {{the end of the}} 1890s she began to distance herself from the Impressionists, avoiding Degas at times she did not have the strength to defend herself against his [...] "wicked tongue". Instead, she came to prefer the company of [...] "the gentle Camille Pissarro", with whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> frankly about the changing attitudes toward art. She once described him as a teacher [...] "that could have taught the stones to draw correctly." ...|$|E
2500|$|He ensnared Aredhel Ar-Feiniel, the wilful {{sister of}} Turgon, when, losing her way, she ventured into his forest. He wedded her, not wholly {{against her will}} {{according}} to The Silmarillion, but by force according to Quendi and Eldar and without informing her family or going through the customs of the Noldor. They had a son Maeglin. [...] Eöl resented the pride and presumptive authority of the Noldor and, given to secrecy much like Turgon, refused permission for Aredhel and Maeglin to leave Nan Elmoth to seek out their Noldorin kin, the sons of Fëanor. Aredhel and Maeglin later left secretly for Gondolin, stealing Eöl's sword, Anguirel. Eöl pursued them and entered the Hidden Way of Gondolin, and was captured by the guards and brought before Turgon, the king. He wished to go away with his son back to Nan Elmoth leaving Aredhel behind. He claimed Maeglin saying that as Turgon was Aredhel's brother, she could stay behind. Turgon would not allow Eöl to leave Gondolin, offering only the choice of staying or dying. Eöl would not acknowledge any authority of Turgon over him and refused to remain, choosing instead death {{for himself and his}} son, Maeglin. He tried to kill his son, but his javelin hit Aredhel who stepped in front of Maeglin. She called for her brother to spare Eöl, but the javelin was poisonous and she died before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> her last words. Turgon decreed Eöl was to be put to death by being thrown from a cliff. Before he died, Eöl called out a curse on his son for betraying him, that Maeglin should suffer the same fate of his father. The fulfilment of the curse is told in the Fall of Gondolin.|$|E
