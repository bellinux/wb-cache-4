50|$|Besides {{these early}} examples, {{the role of}} de novo {{mutations}} in ASD first became evident when DNA microarray technologies reached sufficient resolution to allow the detection of copy number variation (CNV) in the human genome. CNVs {{are the most common}} type of structural variation in the genome, consisting of deletions and duplications of DNA that range in size from a kilobase to a few megabases. Microarray analysis has shown that de novo CNVs occur at a significantly higher rate in sporadic cases of autism as compared to the rate in their typically developing siblings and unrelated controls. A series of studies have shown that gene disrupting de novo CNVs occur approximately four times more frequently in ASD than in controls and contribute to approximately 5-10% of cases. Based on these studies, there are predicted to be 130-234 ASD-related CNV loci. The first whole genome sequencing study to comprehensively catalog de novo structural variation at a much higher resolution than DNA microarray studies has shown that the mutation rate is approximately 20% and not elevated in autism compared to <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> However, structural variants in individuals with autism are much larger and four times more likely to disrupt genes, mirroring findings from CNV studies.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{congenital}} hypothyroidism (CH) {{it has been}} questioned whether high dose thyroxine replacement therapy has detrimental effects on memory, attention, and behaviour. AIMS: To describe memory, attention, and behaviour problems in young adults with CH, and to study possible negative effects of high dose thyroxine replacement therapy. METHODS: A cohort based follow up study of 49 young adults (mean age 20 years) with early treated CH, and <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> (n = 41). RESULTS: Controlled for age and sex, the CH group attained significantly lower scores than <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> on some tests of memory (Wechsler Logical Memory part II: 12. 9 versus 17. 8; difference 5. 2, 95 % CI 3. 6 to 6. 8) and attention (Wechsler Freedom From Distractibility factor: 95. 6 versus 104. 8; difference 9. 9, 95 % CI 6. 4 to 13. 4). They rated themselves with more behaviour problems than did <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> (52. 7 versus 44. 7; difference - 7. 6, 95 % CI - 11. 2 to - 4. 0) on the Achenbach Self Report. A high thyroxine starting dose, high serum thyroxine treatment levels {{during the first six}} childhood years, and high levels at assessment had no adverse effects on outcome measures at age 20. On the contrary, the results suggest better outcome with higher childhood treatment levels. CONCLUSIONS: Long term outcome revealed deficits in some aspects of memory, attention, and behaviour in young adults with CH relative to <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> No adverse effects of high dose thyroxine therapy were found on measures of memory, attention, and behaviour problems...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} neuropsychological {{functioning}} and behaviour {{of children with}} non-syndromic end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Methods: The study was carried out at two tertiary care paediatric teaching hospitals, in Halifax and Vancouver, Canada. Children with ESRD were on a renal transplant waiting list and either pending dialysis or on dialysis therapy. Twenty two patient-sibling pairs were evaluated. Neuropsychological assessments consisting of measures of intelligence, academic achievement, memory, and motor abilities were carried out. Maternal ratings of behaviour and self-report rating of self-esteem were collected. Results: The Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQs of patients with ESRD were {{significantly lower than the}} IQs of the <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> The mean differences were 8. 6, 11. 7, and 10. 9 points, respectively. ESRD patients also had significantly more difficulty on measures of fine motor coordination and ability to copy geometric designs than <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> There were no differences between groups on measures of academic achievement, memory, behaviour, or self-esteem.

40|$|Objective To {{assess whether}} use of {{specific}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or venlafaxine in early pregnancy {{is associated with}} an increased risk of birth defects, with emphasis on cardiovascular birth defects even when accounting for lifestyle or other familial confounding. Design Multicountry population based cohort study, including <b>sibling</b> <b>controlled</b> design. Setting Nordic population (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) identified from nationwide health registers at different periods in 1996 - 2010. Population The full study cohort included women giving birth to 2. 3 million live singletons. The sibling cohort included 2288 singleton live births. The <b>sibling</b> <b>controlled</b> analyses included <b>sibling</b> pairs who were discordant for exposure to SSRIs or venlafaxine and birth defects. Main outcome measure Prevalence of birth defects, including subtypes of cardiac defects. Odds ratio of birth defects from logistic and conditional logistic regression. Results Among 36 [*] 772 infants exposed to any SSRI in early pregnancy, 3. 7 % (n= 1357) had a birth defect compared with 3. 1 % of 2 [*] 266 [*] 875 unexposed infants, yielding a covariate adjusted odds ratio of 1. 13 (95 % confidence interval 1. 06 to 1. 20). In the <b>sibling</b> <b>controlled</b> analysis the adjusted odds ratio decreased to 1. 06 (0. 91 to 1. 24). The odds ratios for any cardiac birth defect with use of any SSRI or venlafaxine were 1. 15 (95 % confidence interval 1. 05 to 1. 26) in the covariate adjusted analysis and 0. 92 (0. 72 to 1. 17) in the <b>sibling</b> <b>controlled</b> analysis. For atrial and ventricular septal defects the covariate adjusted odds ratio was 1. 17 (1. 05 to 1. 31). Exposure to any SSRI or venlafaxine increased the prevalence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects, with a covariate adjusted odds ratio of 1. 48 (1. 15 to 1. 89). In the <b>sibling</b> <b>controlled</b> analysis the adjusted odds ratio decreased to 0. 56 (0. 21 to 1. 49) for any exposure to SSRIs or venlafaxine and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects. Conclusions In this large Nordic study no substantial increase was found in prevalence of overall cardiac birth defects among infants exposed to SSRIs or venlafaxine in utero. Although the prevalence of septal defects and right ventricular outflow tract defects was higher in exposed infants, the lack of an association in the <b>sibling</b> <b>controlled</b> analyses points against a teratogenic effect of these drugs...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess {{sluggish}} cognitive tempo (SCT) behavioral symptoms among pediatric survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to determine the relationship of these behaviors with cognitive late effects. Methods ALL survivors (n 80) and a <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> group (n 19) were administered intelligence (IQ) testing, achievement testing and SCT behavioral items. Group differences (patients vs. siblings) were examined on the SCT behaviors and partial correlations were conducted to explore the relationship of the SCT behaviors with IQ and achievement, while controlling for age at treatment and time since treatment. Results ALL survivors exhibited significantly more SCT symptoms than the <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> group and increased SCT symptoms were associated with lower IQ and achievement scores.

We examined differences in child versus parent report of the child's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a large prospective, community-based study of newly diagnosed childhood epilepsy that included children with epilepsy (case) and <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> MethodsHRQOL was assessed 8 to 9 years after initial diagnosis of epilepsy in a subset of 143 case-control matched pairs using the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), a generic HRQOL measure with child (CHQ-CF 87), and parent (CHQ-PF 50) versions. ResultsThere {{were no significant differences}} between self-reported case and sibling control HRQOL scores on 9 of 11 scales or 2 global items. Nevertheless, parent ratings were significantly better (higher HRQOL) for <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> compared with epilepsy cases on 10 of 12 scales, global behavior and general health items, and the physical and psychosocial summary scores (P ≤ 0. 05). Parent–child agreement was low for cases and controls (kappa 0. 27 – 0. 33) for three single-item questions with the same wording on parent and child versions. Parent ratings of the case's HRQOL were often significantly associated with 5 -year remission status and current antiepileptic drug use, but the case's self-reported HRQOL scores were not. In contrast, current pharmacoresistance was often associated with the child and parent ratings of the child's HRQOL. ConclusionChildren with epilepsy report HRQOL that is comparable to that of <b>sibling</b> <b>controls,</b> while parents rate children with epilepsy as having lower HRQOL than <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Measuring outcomes in studies of this population should incorporate both perspectives...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Velo-cardio-facial {{syndrome}} or 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome (22 q 11 DS) is {{the most}} common known microdeletion syndrome. One of the genes in the deleted region is the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, which is thought to have significant effects on cognition through its influence on dopamine metabolism. The aim {{of the present study was}} to better characterize the cognitive phenotype in a large cohort children with 22 q 11 DS compared with <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> and to investigate if the cognitive deficits in 22 q 11 DS were modulated by COMT expression. Method: The memory, executive function and attentional abilities of children with 22 q 11 DS (n = 50) compared to <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> (n = 31), were measured. Also, within children with 22 q 11 DS, a preliminary exploration was carried out of the relationship between cognitive ability and COMT genotype. Results: Overall, the 22 q 11 DS group had significantly reduced scores on tests of memory (especially in visual memory) and executive function (particularly in planning, working memory, and motor organization) compared with <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> No association, however, was identified between COMT genotype and cognitive function. Conclusions: Although 22 q 11 DS children have specific cognitive deficits, differences in COMT do not account for these findings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Social subjugation {{is a very}} {{significant}} and natural stressor in the animal kingdom. Adult animals defeated and subjugated during establishment of dominance hierarchies or territorial encounters can be highly submissive in future agonistic interactions. While much is know about the biological and behavioral consequences of winning and losing fights in adulthood, {{little is known about}} adolescence; a developmental period noted for impulsivity and heightened agonistic behavior. The present studies were undertaken to determine if the behavioral and neuroendocrine consequences of social subjugation are comparable in adolescent versus adult Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Male siblings were studied from adolescence into adulthood following exposure to counterbalanced episodes of either a benign stressor, i. e., isolation in a novel cage, or the more severe stressor of social subjugation. Results As adults, hamsters with a history of social subjugation in adolescence show high levels of aggression toward intruders as compared to siblings subjugated in adulthood. <b>Sibling</b> <b>controls</b> subjugated in adulthood are highly submissive with little or no aggressive behavior. However, when subjugated in adulthood, hamsters with the earlier history of subjugation are no different than their <b>sibling</b> <b>controls,</b> i. e., adult subjugation promotes submissive behavior. Sexual motivation is high in adult hamsters with adolescent subjugation and testosterone levels remained stable over adulthood. In contrast, <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> subjugated in adulthood show lower levels of sexual motivation and reduced levels of testosterone. Release of cortisol during agonistic encounters is blunted in animals subjugated in adolescence but not adulthood. Measures of anxiety are reduced in hamsters with adolescent subjugation as compared to their <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Conclusion These data demonstrate a pronounced difference in behavior and neuroendocrinology between adolescent and adult hamsters in their response to social subjugation and suggest adolescence is a resilient period in development. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a {{well-documented}} {{association between}} maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The {{degree to which}} this reflects causal intrauterine effects or is due to unmeasured confounding is not clear. We sought to compare the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring ADHD with the associations with paternal smoking, grandmother’s smoking when pregnant with mother, and maternal smoking in previous pregnancies. Each of these exposures {{is expected to be}} influenced by much of the same confounding factors as maternal smoking during pregnancy, but cannot have direct intrauterine effects. A <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> design was also used. METHODS: The current study used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (n > 100 [*] 000 children). Mothers and fathers reported on smoking during pregnancy, and mothers reported on smoking in previous pregnancies and their mother’s smoking when pregnant with them. Mothers reported on child ADHD symptoms at 5 years of age. Information about child ADHD diagnosis was obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry. RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was not more strongly associated with offspring ADHD diagnosis than was paternal smoking, grandmother’s smoking when pregnant with mother, or maternal smoking in previous pregnancies. <b>Sibling</b> <b>control</b> analyses showed no association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and child ADHD symptoms among siblings discordant for maternal smoking.

Children with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome (22 q 11 DS, or velo-cardio-facial syndrome) have poor social competence and are also at a particularly high risk of developing mood (40 %) and psychotic (up to 30 %) disorders in adolescence and young adulthood. However, it is unknown if these problems are associated with theory of mind skills, including underlying social-cognitive and social-perceptual mechanisms. The present cross-sectional study included classic social-cognitive false-belief and mentalising tasks and social-perceptual face processing tasks. The performance of 50 children with 22 q 11 DS was compared with 31 age-matched typically developing <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Key findings indicated that, while younger children with 22 q 11 DS showed impaired acquisition of social-cognitive skills, older children with 22 q 11 DS were not significantly impaired compared with <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> However, children with 22 q 11 DS {{were found to have}} social-perceptual deficits, as demonstrated by difficulties in matching faces on the basis of identity, emotion, facial speech and gaze compared with <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Furthermore, performance on the tasks was associated with age, language ability and parentally rated social competence and emotional problems.

40|$|Background: Tackling severe acute {{malnutrition}} (SAM) is {{a global}} health priority. Heightened risk of non-communicable diseases (NCD) in children exposed to SAM at around 2 years of age is plausible in view of previously described consequences of other early nutritional insults. By applying developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) theory to this group, we aimed to explore {{the long-term effects of}} SAM. Methods: We followed up 352 Malawian children (median age 9 · 3 years) who were still alive following SAM inpatient treatment between July 12, 2006, and March 7, 2007, (median age 24 months) and compared them with 217 <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> and 184 age-and-sex matched community controls. Our outcomes of interest were anthropometry, body composition, lung function, physical capacity (hand grip, step test, and physical activity), and blood markers of NCD risk. For comparisons of all outcomes, we used multivariable linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, HIV status, and socioeconomic status. We also adjusted for puberty in the body composition regression model. Findings: Compared with controls, children who had survived SAM had lower height-for-age Z scores (adjusted difference vs community controls 0 · 4, 95 % CI 0 · 6 to 0 · 2, p= 0 · 001; adjusted difference vs <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> 0 · 2, 0 · 0 to 0 · 4, p= 0 · 04), although they showed evidence of catch-up growth. These children also had shorter leg length (adjusted difference vs community controls 2 · 0 cm, 1 · 0 to 3 · 0, p< 0 · 0001; adjusted difference vs <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> 1 · 4 cm, 0 · 5 to 2 · 3, p= 0 · 002), smaller mid-upper arm circumference (adjusted difference vs community controls 5 · 6 mm, 1 · 9 to 9 · 4, p= 0 · 001; adjusted difference vs <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> 5 · 7 mm, 2 · 3 to 9 · 1, p= 0 · 02), calf circumference (adjusted difference vs community controls 0 · 49 cm, 0 · 1 to 0 · 9, p= 0 · 01; adjusted difference vs <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> 0 · 62 cm, 0 · 2 to 1 · 0, p= 0 · 001), and hip circumference (adjusted difference vs community controls 1 · 56 cm, 0 · 5 to 2 · 7, p= 0 · 01; adjusted difference vs <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> 1 · 83 cm, 0 · 8 to 2 · 8, p< 0 · 0001), and less lean mass (adjusted difference vs community controls − 24 · 5, − 43 to − 5 · 5, p= 0 · 01; adjusted difference vs <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> − 11 · 5, − 29 to − 6, p= 0 · 19) than did either sibling or community controls. Survivors of SAM had functional deficits consisting of weaker hand grip (adjusted difference vs community controls − 1 · 7 kg, 95 % CI − 2 · 4 to − 0 · 9, p< 0 · 0001; adjusted difference vs <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> 1 · 01 kg, 0 · 3 to 1 · 7, p= 0 · 005,)) and fewer minutes completed of an exercise test (sibling odds ratio [OR] 1 · 59, 95 % CI 1 · 0 to 2 · 5, p= 0 · 04; community OR 1 · 59, 95 % CI 1 · 0 to 2 · 5, p= 0 · 05). We did not detect significant differences between cases and controls in terms of lung function, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, glycated haemoglobin A 1 c, salivary cortisol, sitting height, and head circumference. Interpretation: Our results suggest that SAM has long-term adverse effects. Survivors show patterns of so-called thrifty growth, which is associated with future cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The evidence of catch-up growth and largely preserved cardiometabolic and pulmonary functions suggest the potential for near-full rehabilitation.

40|$|Background Caesarean section (CS) {{has been}} {{reported}} to increase the risk of asthma in offspring. This may be due to that infants delivered by CS are unexposed to vaginal ﬂora, according to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’. Objective Our aim was to investigate if CS increases risk of childhood asthma, and if the risk increase remains after adjustment for familial confounding using sibling design. Methods A register-based cohort study with 87 500 Swedish sibling pairs was undertaken. Asthma outcome variables were collected from national health registers as diagnosis or asthma medication (ICD- 10 J 45 -J 46; ATC code R 03) during the 10 th or 13 th year of life (year of follow-up). Mode of delivery and confounders were retrieved from the Medical Birth Register. The data were analysed both as a cohort and with <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> analysis which adjusts for unmeasured familial confounding. Results In the cohort analyses, there was an increased risk of asthma medication and asthma diagnosis during year of follow-up in children born with CS (adjusted ORs, 95 % CI 1. 13, 1. 04 – 1. 24 and 1. 10, 1. 03 – 1. 18 respectively). When separating between emergency and elective CS the effect on asthma medication remained for emergency CS, but not for elective CS, while both groups had signiﬁcant effects on asthma diagnosis compared with vaginal delivery. In <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> analyses, the effect of elective CS on asthma disappeared, while similar but non-signiﬁcant ORs of medication were obtained for emergency CS. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance An increased risk of asthma medication in the group born by emergency CS, but not elective, suggests that there is no causal effect due to vaginal microﬂora. A more probable explanation should be sought in the indications for emergency CS.

The auditory P 50 component of event-related potentials reflecting preattentive processing was investigated in 38 children with developmental disorders of scholastic skills and 19 <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> children, as elicited during a working memory test. The P 50 was evoked by two tones of low and high frequency (500 Hz and 3000 Hz).

For the whole study population, energy intake was 9225 ± 2650 kJ/d and physical activity was 7380 ± 4331 metabolic equivalents (MET) ·min/wk. Compared with time controls, gestational famine exposure was associated with 113 kJ/d (95 % CI, − 272, 502) higher energy intake, 0. 01 percentage point (95 % CI, − 0. 88, 0. 89) higher fat density, 688 MET·min/wk (95 % CI, − 1398, 23) lower physical activity, and 63 kJ/d (95 % CI, − 130, 259) higher predicted energy expenditure (pEE). Compared with <b>sibling</b> <b>controls,</b> gestational famine exposure was associated with 4 kJ/d (95 % CI, − 702, 711) higher energy intake, 2. 01 percentage points (95 % CI, 0. 38, 3. 63) higher fat density, 97 MET·min/wk) (95 % CI, − 1243, 1050) lower physical activity score, and 188 kJ/d (95 % CI, − 163, 539) higher pEE. Gender-specific associations (P < 0. 05 for heterogeneity) emerged for protein density and pEE using time controls and for energy intake using <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Associations were weak, differed by choice of control, and may reflect sampling variability or methodological differences. Persistent small energy imbalances could explain the increased weight of famine-exposed individuals...|$|E

CPa- 1 and CPa- 2. In contrast, when lithium dodecyl sulfate {{is used to}} solubilize the membranes of the mutant prior to electrophoretic separation, a CP complex is observed which has a mobility {{similar to that of}} CPa- 2. Comparison of spectral characteristics and polypeptide composition of the green bands in this region taken from samples of the mutant, normal <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> plants and from PSII preparations indicate that the CP complex observed in the mutant represents a portion of a light-harvesting complex of PSI (Mullet et al. 1980 Plant Physiol 65 : 814 - 822).

None of 19 seropositive older children 41 to 124 months old became infected when 10 (6) 50 % tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50) of vaccine virus was administered intranasally. Two of nine and seven of twenty-four young seropositive children given 10 (5) or 10 (6) TCID 50 of CP 18 PIV- 3, respectively, became infected.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of melanocortin- 1 receptor (MC 1 R) gene variants {{to the development}} of early-onset melanoma is unknown. Using an Australian population-based, case-control-family study, we sequenced MC 1 R for 565 cases with invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between ages 18 and 39 years, 409 unrelated controls and 518 <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Variants were classified a priori into "R" variants (D 84 E, R 142 H, R 151 C, I 155 T, R 160 W, D 294 H) and "r" variants (all other nonsynonymous variants). We estimated odds ratios (OR) for melanoma using unconditional (unrelated controls) and conditional (<b>sibling</b> <b>controls)</b> logistic regression. The prevalence of having at least one R or r variant was 86 % for cases, 73 % for unrelated controls and 81 % for <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> R 151 C conferred the highest risk (per allele OR 2. 57, 95 % confidence interval 1. 86 - 3. 56 for the case-unrelated-control analysis and 1. 70 (1. 12 - 2. 60) for the case-sibling-control analysis). When mutually adjusted, the ORs per R allele were 2. 23 (1. 77 - 2. 80) and 2. 06 (1. 47 - 2. 88), respectively, from the two types of analysis, and the ORs per r allele were 1. 69 (1. 33 - 2. 13) and 1. 25 (0. 88 - 1. 79), respectively. The associations were stronger for men and those with none or few nevi or with high childhood sun exposure. Adjustment for phenotype, nevi and sun exposure attenuated the overall log OR for R variants by approximately 18 % but had lesser influence on r variant risk estimates. MC 1 R variants explained about 21 % of the familial aggregation of melanoma. Some MC 1 R variants are important determinants of early-onset melanoma. The strength of association with melanoma differs according to the type and number of variants. 13 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 1 (T 1 DM) {{has been}} associated with cognitive dysfunction and structural abnormalities across the cortex. It has been argued that there are critical periods in the lifespan where the brain is particularly vulnerable to the neural insults of Diabetes (Biessels, Deary & Ryan, 2008). In this MRI study, we used voxel-based morphometry to compare a group of T 1 DM patients to <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> during young adulthood. We had previously shown that when 7 years younger there was no effect of T 1 DM on IQ (Strudwick et al., 2005) and while there was still no effect on IQ, there was a suggestion of difficulties in executive functioning (EF; Ly et al., 2011). In this follow-up study we explored whether differences in brain structure related to T 1 DM might explain the difference in EF. There were 61 participants (Mage = 19. 3) who participated in the MRI scanning (T 1 DM N = 31) with an approximately equal gender balance (54 % female). Participants' T 1 -weighted volumes at 1 mm 3 voxel size were obtained from a 3 T Siemens scanner. MRI scans were analysed using the SPM 8 toolbox (Wellcome Trust) in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc). When performing voxel-wise comparisons across the cortex, {{there were no significant differences}} in grey matter density between T 1 DM and <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> (corrected p =. 05). Lowering the statistical criteria to an uncorrected p =. 001 revealed <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> had higher grey matter density in four left-lateralised clusters (middle temporal gyrus, cuneus, superior frontal gyrus and postcentral gyrus). The largest effects were for T 1 DM patients to have reduced grey matter density in the middle temporal gyrus"”a cortical region associated with semantic processing and risk factor for developing Dementia, and in the superior frontal gyrus"”a cortical region implicated in EF. These results reveal consistent, yet subtle, structural brain differences between T 1 DM patients and controls in young adulthood...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{paternal}} age at offspring conception increases de novo {{genetic mutations}} (Kong et al., 2012). Based on evolutionary genetic theory we {{predicted that the}} offspring of older fathers {{would be less likely}} to survive and reproduce, i. e. have lower fitness. In a <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> study, we find clear support for negative paternal age effects on offspring survival, mating and reproductive success across four large populations with an aggregate N > 1. 3 million in main analyses. Compared to a sibling born when the father was 10 years younger, individuals had 4 - 13 % fewer surviving children in the four populations. Three populations were pre-industrial (1670 - 1850) Western populations and showed a pattern of paternal age effects across the offspring's lifespan. In 20 th-century Sweden, we found no negative paternal age effects on child survival or marriage odds. Effects survived tests for competing explanations, including maternal age and parental loss. To the extent that we succeeded in isolating a mutation-driven effect of paternal age, our results can be understood to show that de novo mutations reduce offspring fitness across populations and time. We can use this understanding to predict the effect of increasingly delayed reproduction on offspring genetic load, mortality and fertility...|$|R

Based on evolutionary genetic theory {{we predicted}} older fathers’ children, all else equal, {{would be less}} likely to survive and reproduce, i. e. have lower fitness. In <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> studies, we find support for negative paternal age effects on offspring survival and reproductive success across four large populations with an aggregate N > 1. 4 million. Three populations were pre-industrial (1670 - 1850) Western populations and showed negative paternal age effects on infant survival and offspring reproductive success. In 20 th-century Sweden, we found minuscule paternal age effects on survival, but found negative effects on reproductive success. Effects survived tests for key competing explanations, including maternal age and parental loss, but effects varied widely over different plausible model specifications and some competing explanations such as diminishing paternal investment and epigenetic mutations could not be tested. We can use our findings to aid in predicting the effect increasingly older parents in today’s society will have on their children’s survival and reproductive success. To the extent that we succeeded in isolating a mutation-driven effect of paternal age, our results can be understood to show that de novo mutations reduce offspring fitness across populations and time periods...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To study neuropsychological {{functioning}} of newly diagnosed children with {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} (ALL) within two weeks after diagnosis {{in order to determine}} the feasibility of a <b>sibling</b> <b>controlled</b> prospective study design. Methods: Fifty consecutive patients (median age at testing 6. 6 years, range 4 - 12) were included in a prospective, longitudinal, nationwide study. Treatment would include intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy according to the DCLSG ALL- 9 protocol. Children were evaluated with an extensive neuropsychological battery including measures of intelligence, memory, attention, language, visual-constructive function, and fine-motor abilities within two weeks after start of the chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 29 healthy siblings (median age at testing 8. 2 years, range 4 - 12), who were tested Results: Mean scores on Wechsler intelligence Scales did not differ significantly between patients and of siblings; mean IQ scores for both the patients and the controls were high average. To examine specific neuropsychological functions, norm scores based on the exact age were acquired by fitting procedures, but no significant differences were found. Conclusions: Neuropsychological assessment of patients during early hospitalisation is feasible. The results indicate no adverse effect of illness and psychological factors on IQ and neuropsychological {{functioning of}} patients with recently diagnosed ALL.

40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase sigma (PTPσ) {{belongs to}} the LAR family of receptor tyrosine phosphatases and was previously shown to negatively regulate axon growth. The substrate for PTPσ and the effector(s) mediating this inhibitory effect were unknown. Here we report the identification of N-cadherin as an in vivo substrate for PTPσ. Using brain lysates from PTPσ knockout mice, in combination with substrate trapping, we identified a hyper-tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼ 120 kDa in the knockout animals (relative to <b>sibling</b> <b>controls),</b> which was identified by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting as N-cadherin. β-Catenin also precipitated in the complex and was also a substrate for PTPσ. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which highly express endogenous N-cadherin and PTPσ, exhibited a faster growth rate in the knockout mice than in the <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> when grown on laminin or N-cadherin substrata. However, when N-cadherin function was disrupted by an inhibitory peptide or lowering calcium concentrations, the differential growth rate between the knockout and sibling control mice was greatly diminished. These {{results suggest that the}} elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of N-cadherin in the PTPσ−/− mice likely disrupted N-cadherin function, resulting in accelerated DRG nerve growth. We conclude that N-cadherin is a physiological substrate for PTPσ and that N-cadherin (and likely β-catenin) participates in PTPσ-mediated inhibition of axon growth...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Previous literatures on young adult {{survivors}} of childhood cancer show inconsistent findings {{with regards to}} their psychological distress and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Much of the available data focus on negative patient outcomes following cancer treatments prescribed from 1970 to 1990. In the present study, HRQOL and psychological distress of young adult survivors in Hong Kong was examined. It focused on subjects who had received cancer treatments prescribed {{in the last two}} decades. Methods A structured telephone survey was conducted with 614 eligible survivors and 208 <b>sibling</b> <b>controls</b> in Hong Kong. Results The survivors reported significantly lower mean scores in physical role and functioning, whereas their mental, social, and psychological well-being was similar to that of their <b>sibling</b> <b>controls.</b> Being female, older age, longer survival time, and specific cancer diagnoses were the factors associated with poorer physical and mental adaptation. HRQOL was negatively correlated with psychological distress. Conclusions Findings of the study suggest that most survivors adjusted fairly well in mental, psychological, and social aspects. Survivors with a higher risk of poor HRQOL could benefit from appropriate screening and counseling at an early stage to mitigate their survivorship difficulties. Prospective follow-up studies on childhood cancer survivors are recommended to detect changes over longer survival periods. School of Nursin...|$|E
40|$|Changes in body composition, in {{particular}} the onset of obesity, may result from reductions in total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) {{as a consequence of}} relative physical inactivity. Children previously treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) become obese, yet the mechanism remains undefined. TDEE and physical activity levels [PAL = TDEE/basal metabolic rate (BMR) ] were measured in 34 long-term survivors of ALL and compared with results from 21 survivors of other malignancies and 32 healthy <b>sibling</b> <b>control</b> subjects using the flex-heart rate technique. Body composition was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The median TDEE was reduced in the ALL group (150 kJ x kg d(- 1)) compared with other malignancies and controls (207 and 185 kJ x kg d(- 1), respectively, p < 0. 01). This reduction was accounted for mainly by a relative decrease in the PAL of the ALL group (1. 24) compared with both other malignancies and controls (1. 58 and 1. 47, respectively, p < 0. 01). TDEE and PAL were correlated with percentage body fat (r = - 0. 39, p < 0. 001 and r = - 0. 24, p < 0. 05, respectively). Obesity in survivors of ALL may, in part, be explained by a reduction in TDEE as a consequence of reduced PAL. The cause of such reduction is uncertain...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{relationship}} between cannabis use and cognitive functioning {{in patients with}} psychosis has yielded contradictory findings. In individuals at genetic high risk for psychosis, information is sparse. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the association between recency and frequency of cannabis use and cognitive functioning in patients with psychosis and their unaffected siblings. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study in 956 patients with non-affective psychosis, 953 unaffected siblings, and 554 control subjects. Participants completed a cognitive test battery including assessments of verbal learning, set shifting, sustained attention, processing speed, working memory, acquired knowledge, reasoning and problem solving and social cognition. Cannabis use was assessed by urinalysis and by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Using random-effect regression models the main effects of cannabis (recency and frequency) and the interaction with status (patient, <b>sibling,</b> <b>control)</b> on cognitive functioning were assessed. Results Current cannabis use was associated with poorer performance on immediate verbal learning, processing speed and working memory (Cohen's d+ 0. 20 to+ 0. 33, p< 0. 005). Lifetime cannabis use was associated with better performance on acquired knowledge, facial affect recognition and face identity recognition (Cohen's d+ 0. 17 to + 0. 33, p< 0. 005). There was no significant interaction between cannabis and status on cognitive functioning. Conclusions Lifetime cannabis-using individuals might constitute a subgroup with a higher cognitive potential. The residual effects of cannabis may impair short-term memory and processing speed. © 2011 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
