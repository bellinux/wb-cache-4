5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> head {{out of the water and}} saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
