5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS {{was taken into}} {{functional}} testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit <b>sensor.</b> Ground controllers at Goddard would restart the testing once the thermal limit <b>sensor</b> was back in normal <b>sensor</b> range, but it is believed the component is in good shape.|$|E
5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the <b>sensor</b> coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of <b>sensor</b> coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if <b>sensor</b> coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because <b>sensor</b> coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a <b>sensor</b> coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Speed sensors: A speed <b>sensor</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a Hall effect <b>sensor,</b> or a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the <b>sensor.</b> The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in the <b>sensor.</b> Since the voltage induced in the <b>sensor</b> {{is a result of the}} rotating wheel, this <b>sensor</b> can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.|$|E
