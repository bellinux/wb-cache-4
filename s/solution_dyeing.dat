2500|$|The {{polyester}} {{known as}} [...] "PET" [...] (polyethylene terephthalate) {{is used in}} carpet manufacturing in both spun and filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s, polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant because it is hydrophobic, and, unlike nylon, does not have dye sites. Colour is infused in a molten state (<b>solution</b> <b>dyeing).</b> Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily. It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solution</b> <b>dyeing,</b> {{also known}} as dope or spun dyeing, {{is the process of}} adding {{pigments}} or insoluble dyes to the spinning solution before the solution is extruded through the spinneret. Only manufactured fibers can be solution-dyed. It is used for difficult-to-dye fibers, such as olefin fibers, and for dyeing fibers for end uses that require excellent colorfastness properties. Because the color pigments {{become a part of the}} fiber, solution-dyed materials have excellent colorfastness to light, washing, crocking (rubbing), perspiration, and bleach. Dyeing at the solution stage is more expensive, since the equipment has to be cleaned thoroughly each time a different color is produced. Thus, the variety of colors and shades produced is limited. In addition, it is difficult to stock the inventory for each color. Decisions regarding color have to be made very early in the manufacturing process. Thus, this stage of dyeing is usually not used for apparel fabrics.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{standardization of}} dyeing variables for dyeing of five synthesized reactive dyes (Red A, Red B, Red C, Orange D and Black BE) on 100 % cotton fabric. These dyes contained sulfo vinylsulfone functionality and were prepared by either reacting cyanuric chloride with H-acid and coupling with the diazotized product of sulfo vinylsulfone/sulfo tobiaz acid or reacting diazotized sulfo vinylsulfone with H-acid/sodium napthonate under optimized conditions. Different variables which affect {{the process of}} dyeing like dye concentration, dyeing temperature, pH of dyeing <b>solution,</b> <b>dyeing</b> time and concentration of auxiliaries used during dyeing were systematically evaluated. All measurements were made at wavelength maxima (λmax) of respective dyes Red A (540 nm), Red B (535 nm), Red C (530 nm), Orange D (520 nm) and Black BE (630 nm). The results showed that 3 % dye concentration was adequate for maximum dye absorption on the cotton fabric and 1 % was ideal for fastness to sunlight and wash. The optimized values for other variables were, dyeing temperature: 80 ºC, pH of dyeing: 11. 0, drying time: 90 min; and 80 / 85 g/L of sodium chloride and 20 / 25 g/L of sodium carbonate as auxiliaries for 1 % and 3 % dye concentration respectively...|$|E

40|$|Decolorization of 10 {{types of}} <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> by {{potassium}} permanganate was studied.

When pH value 4. 0, the <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> were almost not decolorized. Concentration of potassium permanganate and temperature also showed significant effects on the decolorization efficiency.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of degradation of an aqueous solution of reactive red 120 dye using Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) was evaluated. A low pressure UV lamp and {{a combination of}} UV/TiO 2 were tested using ten different dye concentrations (50 - 500 mg/L) at several retention times (5. 2 - 60 min) a pH of 10. 5. The effect of acidic pH (pH = 3) on dye removal efficiency and the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the treated effluents were also investigated. When the alkaline (pH = 10. 5) reactive red 120 <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> were treated using a low pressure (380 nm intensity) UV lamp, a maximum degradation {{efficiency of}} 27. 01 % was obtained for the least concentrated <b>dye</b> (50 mg/L) <b>solution</b> and only a degradation efficiency of 0. 33 % was obtained for the most concentrated (500 mg/L) <b>dye</b> <b>solution.</b> When the alkaline (pH = 10. 5) reactive red 120 solutions were exposed {{to a combination of}} UV/TiO 2, a maximum degradation efficiency of 46. 70 % was obtained for the lease concentrated (50 mg/L) <b>dye</b> <b>solution</b> after 60 min and only a degradation efficiency of 2. 84 % was obtained for the most concentrated (500 mg/L) <b>dye</b> <b>solution</b> after 60 min.

30|$|Berberine, palmatine, alizarin, purpurin, indigotin, and indirubin {{which were}} the major {{coloring}} compounds of Phellodendron bark, madder, and indigo plant were thermally degraded in 100 °C oven in liquid dye form and also in silk dyed with five of these pigments. A mixed <b>dye</b> <b>solution</b> of six coloring compounds was prepared in DMSO solution and was thermally degraded for up to 7  days. Silk were dyed using either a mixed <b>dye</b> <b>solution</b> of five <b>dyes</b> or individual <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> and each were degraded for 7 and 14  days, respectively, and the dye was extracted from the samples for the HPLC analysis. The concentration of coloring compounds in the degraded samples were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS and the color difference (ΔE) of the degraded silk was examined using a spectro-colorimeter. Alizarin and purpurin were more resistance to degradation than other coloring compounds both when in solution form and in silk dyeings. And such result was verified by the color difference measurement of the degraded silk dyed with individual <b>dye</b> <b>solution.</b> The resistance of alizarin and purpurin to thermal degradation was highly likely due to the fomation of fiber-metal-dye chelated complex by alum or iron mordanting before dyeing.|$|R
