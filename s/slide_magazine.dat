2500|$|The P7K3 is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} the P7 (inspired by the HK4 pistol) that uses straight blowback for operation. This version has a removable barrel and uses a sealed hydraulic recoil buffer {{in place of a}} gas cylinder. After swapping out the barrel and magazine it can use [...]380 ACP (9×17mm Short) or [...]32 ACP (7.65×17mm Browning SR) pistol cartridges and after replacing the <b>slide,</b> <b>magazine</b> and barrel (with floating chamber insert)—it {{can also be used to}} fire [...]22 LR (5.6mm Long Rifle) ammunition. The hydraulic recoil buffer of the P7K3 is prone to wear and causes a serious problem to operate the gun when it is worn down. Heckler & Koch does not make a replacement part for the buffer. However, there are some commercial buffers available. When the [...]22 LR slide and barrel are installed, the buffer is not engaged.|$|E
5000|$|Sabata {{carries a}} sawed off lever action rifle with a side-loading {{magazine}} containing seven [...]30/30 Remington rimfire cartridges...and one cigar. Guns {{based on a}} horizontal loading <b>slide</b> <b>magazine</b> were called harmonica guns (the magazine resembling a harmonica). There is no record of a lever action harmonica magazine rifle, so this gun was almost certainly a prop creation. Harmonica guns generally required a cocking action plus a manual advancement of the magazine, hence the lever action in this gun to cock it and the visible position of Brynner's hand to advance the magazine to the next cartridge position.|$|E

Heckler & Koch provides a special scraper tool for the [...]22 LR-barrel. The tool is needed to clean the inside of the floating chamber for save operation. An additional exchange tool is provided for all calibers to screw and unscrew the barrel nut that attaches the barrel to the frame. Both tools can be seen in one of the pictures of the P7K3 on this page. P7K3's are more rare in the U.S. than in Europe and are valued at higher prices especially when they are in good condition.|$|E

25|$|A current {{production}} Glock 17 {{consists of}} 34 parts. For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, <b>slide,</b> frame, <b>magazine,</b> and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm {{is designed for}} the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge, but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P and +P+ ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{an attempt to}} improve upon the traditional "lecture and textbook" mode of teaching, an Audio-Visual Response Teaching Machine was utilized for certain topics in gasdynamics. This teaching system was based on three elements: programmed instruction, a Question/Response/Answer technique, and continuous confirmation of answers. The teaching machine is a portable self contained unit consisting of a dual track cassette tape recorder, viewing screen, <b>slide</b> <b>magazines,</b> remote control, and a Respondex keyboard. Detailed scripts (including multiple-choice questions) were written, slides were prepared and synchronized audio-visual programmed lessons were assembled. The results are two individual packages on Reaction Propulsion Systems: The Brayton Cycle and Thrust: Power and Efficiency. Student reaction to these programs was favorable. It was concluded that this method {{should be used in}} a supplemental capacity to the course and recommended that work in this field continue. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
25|$|Polymer {{holsters}} {{in various}} configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, <b>slide</b> stops, <b>magazine</b> release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups {{are designed to}} allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.|$|R
50|$|Colt resumed {{production}} of the Woodsman in 1947. The three Models remained the same, but were built on a longer heavier frame and had a <b>magazine</b> safety, automatic <b>slide</b> stop and <b>magazine</b> release located {{at the rear of}} the trigger guard.|$|R
50|$|The {{stripping}} pin is {{retained in}} the frame when pushed to the side to strip and is separate from the slide lock, as on the Megastar. The <b>slide</b> lock lever, <b>magazine</b> release and other features are reminiscent of the Megastar as well.|$|R
2500|$|DA/SA pistols are {{versatile}} mechanisms. These firearms {{generally have}} a manual safety that additionally {{may serve to}} decock the hammer. Some have a facility (generally a lever or button) to safely lower the hammer. As a disadvantage, these controls are often intermingled with other controls such as <b>slide</b> releases, <b>magazine</b> releases, take-down levers, takedown lever lock buttons, loaded chamber indicators, barrel tip-up levers, etc. [...] These variables become confusing and require more complicated manuals-of-arms. One other disadvantage {{is the difference between}} the first double-action pull and subsequent single-action pulls.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} that the {{suggestion}} commended itself to all of them, but the trouble was that nobody seemed anxious {{to put it into}} execution. Carrie pressed down the <b>magazine</b> <b>slide</b> with one hand. It would, however, only move a very little, and she realised that the magazine was almost full. Then she laughed harshly, and the sound jarred on Eveline Annersly's ears.|$|R
50|$|The USP is {{composed}} {{of a total of}} 54 parts and is broken down into 7 major components for maintenance and cleaning: the barrel, slide, recoil spring, recoil spring guide rod, the frame, <b>slide</b> stop and <b>magazine.</b> This is done by retracting the slide back to align the slide stop axis pin with the disassembly notch {{on the left side of}} the slide and withdrawing the axis pin.|$|R
5000|$|The pistol {{features}} {{a series of}} four different calibers, including 9×19mm Luger, [...]45 ACP, 7.62×25mm Tokarev and [...]40 S&W. By changing the <b>slide,</b> barrel, and <b>magazine,</b> it can fire all the four available calibers. This concept {{can be seen in}} other designs such as Beretta Px4 Storm. The production variant of QX-04, named CS/LP6 first appeared in public during 8th China International Exhibition on Police Equipment in May 2011.|$|R
50|$|Glock {{magazines}} are interchangeable between {{models of the}} same caliber, meaning that a compact or subcompact pistol will accept magazines designed for the larger pistols chambered for the same round. However, magazines designed for compact and subcompact models will not function in larger pistols {{because they are not}} tall enough to reach the <b>slide</b> and <b>magazine</b> release. For example, the subcompact Glock 26 will accept magazines from both the full-size Glock 17 and the compact Glock 19, but the Glock 17 will not accept magazines from the smaller Glock 19 or the Glock 26. The magazines for the Glock 36, the Glock 42, and the Glock 43 are all unique; they cannot use magazines intended for another model, nor can their magazines be used in other models.|$|R

500|$|Disassembly of the Type 94 Nambu pistol is {{considered}} difficult {{and can lead}} to damage to the pistol if done carelessly. [...] After clearing the Type 94, the operator must draw the <b>slide</b> against the <b>magazine</b> follower to hold the bolt {{to the rear of the}} pistol.

2500|$|Glock pistols {{are made}} in five form factors, all modeled after the {{original}} full-sized Glock 17. [...] "Standard" [...] models are designed as full-sized duty firearms with a large magazine capacity. [...] "Compact" [...] models are slightly smaller with reduced magazine capacity and lighter weight, while maintaining a usable grip length.

25|$|The P345, {{released}} in 2004, incorporates an integrated keyed lock that locks the {{safety in the}} safe position, a loaded chamber indicator, and a magazine disconnect that blocks the firing pin when the magazine is removed. It also has many ergonomic improvements, such as a new polymer frame design (narrower than the double column derived P90 and P97) and low-profile safety levers. It does not feature an ambidextrous <b>slide</b> release or <b>magazine</b> release. Both controls are designed for a right-handed shooter. The model P345PR adds a Picatinny rail to the frame, for mounting lights and other accessories. It {{was designed to be}} legal for sale in states that require elaborate safety measures.|$|R
50|$|Handguns {{must have}} a one piece metal frame, slide with stirrup cuts and the dust cover (with or without an {{accessory}} rail) can have a maximum length of 75 mm from the leading edge {{to the rear of}} the <b>slide</b> stop pin. <b>Magazine</b> wells cannot exceed a maximum outside width of 35 mm. Permitted modifications are shaped slides (i.e. flat-top or tri-top), shaped trigger guards (i.e. squared or undercut), bob-tail backstraps, bull or coned barrels, external extractors, finger-grooves (machined, add-on, wrap-around etc.), custom magazine release buttons, triggers, hammers, single/ ambidextrous thumb safeties, any iron sights, extended slide lock levers and thumb shields provided they do not act as a thumb rest. Cosmetic modifications are permitted.|$|R

5000|$|The [...]32 ACP {{ammunition}} {{is somewhat}} under-powered for combat use. The magazine capacity of only 8 rounds and short effective range reduces the M1935 to {{a last resort}} self-defense weapon. The slide {{is not of the}} self-catching type; the magazine retains the action to the rear. When the magazine is removed the action returns forward on an empty chamber. This slows down reloading of the pistol. However, if the safety is thumbed into the safe position it also acts as a <b>slide</b> catch, the <b>magazine</b> can then be released and a full magazine can be inserted, the slide release / safety can then be released, loading a round, then the pistol can now be fired in single action.|$|R
2500|$|One motion, the {{so-called}} Hamilton-Proctor motion, involved the forensic ballistic evidence {{presented by the}} expert witnesses for the prosecution and defense. The prosecution's firearms expert, Charles Van Amburgh, had re-examined the evidence {{in preparation for the}} motion. By 1923, bullet comparison technology had improved somewhat, and Van Amburgh submitted photos of the bullets fired from Sacco's [...]32 Colt in support of the argument that they matched the bullet that killed Berardelli. In response, the controversial self-proclaimed [...] "firearms expert" [...] for the defense, Albert H. Hamilton, conducted an in-court demonstration involving two brand new Colt [...]32-caliber automatic pistols belonging to Hamilton, along with Sacco's [...]32 Colt of the same make and caliber. In front of Judge Thayer and the lawyers for both sides, Hamilton disassembled all three pistols and placed the major component parts – barrel, barrel bushing, recoil spring, frame, <b>slide,</b> and <b>magazine</b> – into three piles on the table before him. He explained the functions of each part and began to demonstrate how each was interchangeable, in the process intermingling the parts of all three pistols. Judge Thayer stopped Hamilton and demanded that he reassemble Sacco's pistol with its proper parts.|$|R
