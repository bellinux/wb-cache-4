The development of irrigation schemes is one pathway which can address water supply issues, when rains are delayed increasing the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> Lining canals can ensure that the water stored will be retained and not escape into the ground water, which can then be used in periods of delayed or scarcity of rainfall for irrigation and other domestic purposes. Irrigation schemes and lined canals have been created in countries like Sri Lanka and Portugal. In Sri Lanka, it has contributed to the availability of water not only for agriculture but also for domestic use by rural households (Meijer, et al. 2006). Investment in climate-proofed infrastructure can strengthen the adaptive capacities of rural communities, overcoming one of the likely barriers to increased entrepreneurship.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that {{high quality energy}} and protein sources in diets for newly-weaned pigs, such as milk powders, lactose and cooked cereals, promote better performance after weaning. However, their higher cost and <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> sometimes requires nutritionists to explore potential for other ingredients {{for use in the}} formulation of weaner diets. Recent research in grower pigs demonstrated that lupins could be included at up to 350 g/kg in place of soybean meal, without compromising growth, carcase composition or meat quality (Kim et al., 2007). However, the use of lupins in a weaner diet to reduce or replace more expensive protein sources, such as milk products, has not been examined to date. The hypothesis tested was that increasing the concentration of whole or dehulled Australian sweet lupins in place of milk by-products such as skim milk powder and dried whey in a diet would reduce performance of weaner pigs...|$|E

40|$|Low {{variability}} of crop production {{from year to}} year is desirable for many reasons, including reduced income risk and <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies.</b> Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the nature of yield variability, whether it is changing through time, and how it varies between crops and regions. Previous studies have shown that national crop yield variability has changed in the past, with the direction and magnitude dependent on crop type and location. Whilst such studies acknowledge the importance of climate variability in determining yield variability, it has been assumed that its magnitude and its effect on crop production have not changed through time and, hence, that changes to yield variability have been due to non-climatic factors. We address this assumption by jointly examining yield and climate variability for three major crops (rice, wheat and maize) over the past 50 years. National yield time series and growing season temperature and precipitation were de-trended and related using multiple linear regression. Yield variability changed significantly in half of the crop–country combinations examined. For several crop–country combinations, changes in yield variability were related to changes in climate variability...|$|R
