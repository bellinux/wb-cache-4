5|$|On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747-200 {{registration}} G-BDXH, {{flew through}} {{a cloud of}} volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines. The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had {{to be shut down}} again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched {{to such an extent that}} it was difficult for the pilots to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport just outside Jakarta. There were no fatalities or injuries.|$|E

25|$|As the Waterpump mission continued, it was {{attached}} to the 606th Air Commando Squadron in 1966. General Vang Pao agitated for his own Hmong pilots to support his Clandestine Army. He pointed out that the other four military regions of Laos had an RLAF squadron; that they did not share their air assets with him, and that he had need of the same. CIA case agent James William Lair began a pilot training program for him in Thailand, using scrounged light aircraft and instructor pilots scrounged from the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit, Continental Air Services, Inc, and the Royal Thai Air Force. By Summer 1967, the improvised program had graduated dozens of neophyte pilots in its three classes. Two of them were the first of 19 Hmong pilots accepted for Waterpump training. The Hmong were unlikely pilot candidates. They were unfamiliar with modern machinery, possessed little English, and were of small stature. However, wood blocks wired to the rudder pedals brought that control within reach of the short-legged cadets. Seat cushions in the T-28s boosted the Hmong high enough they could <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cockpit to fly.|$|E
500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. And now I was going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I could only <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of.</b> Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting around the table and going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a [...] "supernatural quality" [...] and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen.|$|E

50|$|Potamonautes platynotus is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab which is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, where {{it is the only}} freshwater crab outside the genus Platythelphusa.

500|$|Monitors turret {{measured}} [...] {{in diameter}} and [...] high, constructed with [...] of armor (11 inches in front at the gun ports) rendering the overall vessel somewhat top heavy. Its rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot. A pair of donkey engines rotated the turret {{through a set of}} gears; a full rotation was made in 22.5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862. Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made. The only way to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the turret was through the gun ports; when the guns were not in use, or withdrawn for reloading during battle, heavy iron port stoppers would swing down into place to close the gunports. Including the guns, the turret weighed approximately the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate. The spindle was [...] in diameter which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways. When not in use, the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal. In service, however, this proved to leak heavily, despite caulking by the crew. [...] The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several s, which used the same turret design, during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle, which could also jam the turret. To gain access to the turret from below, or to hoist up powder and shot during battle, the turret had to rotate facing directly to starboard, which would line up the entry hatch in the floor of the turret with an opening in the deck below. The roof of the turret was lightly built to facilitate any needed exchange of the ship's guns and to improve ventilation, with only gravity holding the roof plates in place.|$|E

2500|$|Kurt's main {{defense against}} his enemies is his [...] "Coil Suit", a skin-tight armor {{made of a}} Kevlar-like material, and created on a [...] "nuclear-blast proof sewing machine". This suit serves as a {{bulletproof}} vest during the combat sections of the game, and also protects Kurt from friction and heat during the atmospheric entry sections. Kurt's weapon is a chain gun, which is attached to his arm, and carries unlimited ammo. The other major weapon in the game is a sniper gun. This is created when Kurt detaches his chain gun from his arm and mounts it onto his helmet. The sniper weapon can zoom up to 100x, and has the capability of supporting five different types of ammunition, including homing missiles and mortar shells. Kurt does not actually <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the helmet, rather, he sees out of a HUD, which he uses to aim. There are also three [...] "Bullet Cams" [...] that track each projectile and linger briefly after impact, showing any damage done. However, when Kurt is in sniper mode, {{he is unable to}} move, and can thus be easily targeted by enemies.|$|E
2500|$|According to Schwarzenegger, filming was {{physically}} demanding {{as he had}} to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required heat lamps to be {{on all of the}} time. Cast and crew filmed on rough terrain that, according to the actor, was never flat, [...] "always on a hill. We stood all day long on a hill, one leg down, one leg up. It was terrible." [...] Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall, who could not see in the Predator suit. The actor remembers, [...] "so when he's supposed to slap me around and stay far from my face, all of a sudden, whap! There is this hand with claws on it!" [...] Hall stated in an interview that his experience on the film, [...] "wasn't a movie, it was a survival story for all of us." [...] For example, in the scene where the Predator chases Dutch, the water was foul, stagnant and full of leeches. Hall could not <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and then memorize where everything was. The outfit was difficult to wear because it was heavy and off-balance.|$|E

2500|$|The Taliban were {{condemned}} internationally {{for their}} brutal repression of women. In 2001 Laura Bush {{in a radio}} address condemned the Taliban's brutality to women. [...] In areas they controlled the Taliban issued edicts which forbade women from being educated, girls were forced to leave schools and colleges. Those who wished to leave their home to go shopping had {{to be accompanied by}} a male relative, and were required to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small screen to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> <b>of.</b> Those who appeared to disobey were publicly beaten. Sohaila, a young woman who was convicted of walking with a man who was not a relative, was charged with adultery. She was publicly flogged in Ghazi Stadium and received 100 lashes. The religious police routinely carried out inhumane abuse on women. [...] Employment for women was restricted to the medical sector, because male medical personnel were not allowed to treat women and girls. One result of the banning of employment of women by the Taliban was the closing down in places like Kabul of primary schools not only for girls but for boys, because almost all the teachers there were women. [...] Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital. In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul, and issued new regulations ordering people to blacken their windows, so that women would not be visible from the outside.|$|E
