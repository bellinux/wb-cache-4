50|$|Chaenodraco wilsoni, the <b>Spiny</b> <b>Icefish,</b> is {{a species}} of {{crocodile}} icefish native to the Southern Ocean where it occurs at depths of from 200 to 800 m. This species grows to a length of 43 cm TL. It is of minor importance to commercial fisheries. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
40|$|Age {{and growth}} of <b>spiny</b> <b>icefish</b> (Chaenodraco wilsoni) were {{investigated}} using counts of annual growth increments from sagittal otoliths. Samples were collected during research surveys by benthic trawl carried out off Joinville–D’Urville Islands (Antarctic Peninsula) in February–March 2006 and January 2007. A total of 218 specimens were selected for the study, consisting of 120 females and 98 males. The age of fish was estimated by counting annuli on transverse sections obtained by grinding and polishing whole otoliths embedded in epoxy resin in moulds. The precision of age estimates between readings was tested applying both the average percent error (APE) and the coefficient of variation (CV). Conversely, the accuracy of age estimates was not tested, so that present ageing data {{have to be considered}} with caution. The estimated age range was 1 – 5 years for males and 1 – 4 years for females of C. wilsoni. Applying the von Bertalanffy (VB) growth function to the age–length data, a growth curve was obtained for each sex. The estimated values of VB growth parameters L ∞ (cm) and k were respectively 32. 7 and 0. 81 for females and 32. 7 and 0. 68 for males. Age-at-sexua...|$|E
