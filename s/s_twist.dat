The paper finds: (1) Local labor market shortages raise the employment-population rate arid reduce the unemployment rate of disadvantaged youths by substantial amounts. (2) Shortages also raise the hourly earnings of disadvantaged youths. In the 19805 the earnings gains for youths in tight labor markets offset the deterioration in the real and relative earnings of the less skilled that marked this decade. (3) Youths in labor shortage areas had greeter increases in earnings as they aged than youths in other areas, implying that improved labor market conditions raise the longitudinal earnings profiles {{as well as the}} starting prospects of youths.

40|$|The {{identification}} of bast fibre samples, in particular, bast fibres used in textiles, {{is an important}} issue in archaeology, criminology and other scientific fields. One of the characteristic features of bast fibres is their fibrillar orientation, referred to as Z- or <b>S</b> <b>twist</b> (or alternatively right- and left-handed fibres). Anempirical test for determining the fibrillar orientation using polarized light microscopy has been known in the community for many years.

However, so far, no proper justification has been provided in the literature that the ‘no false results’ assumption is really correct and it has also not been clear up till now, why the method sometimes does not work. In this paper, we present an analytical model for the modified Herzog test, which explains why the test never gives a false result.

40|$|Robot {{manipulators}} {{have the}} inherent characteristics of being highly non linear and strongly coupled. The recent increasing demand for industrial robots compounded with their high complexity {{has provided the}} robot 2 ̆ 7 s designers with a new challenging and time-consuming problem. The reason behind it is that a robot 2 ̆ 7 s designer cannot easily predict the effect of changing an operational condition or a geometrical parameter on the dynamic performance. In this dissertation a comprehensive {{study was conducted to}} analyse the dynamic characteristics of robot manipulators under different operational condi tions and various structural and geometrical configurations. Therefore, both kine matic and dynamic modelling were extensively used in both iterative and closed form. The analysis was applied on two types of widely-used industrial robots: a) a SCARA type robot and b) articulated robots. The results of the study are aimed at giving further insight into robot dynamic performance in pursuit of an optimal robot 2 ̆ 7 s design. That is achievable since the results are also aimed at helping a robot 2 ̆ 7 s designer to foresee the effect of changing an operational condition (e. g. velocity or payload) or a geometrical parameter (e. g. a joint 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>twist</b> angle ora link 2 ̆ 7 s length).

40|$|The Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA) is {{the only}} soil test device that can {{facilitate}} independent control of both the magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses. The stress history and loading conditions {{at a point in}} a soil deposit can be reproduced on a Hollow Cylindrical (HC) specimen, and its constitutive behaviour and pore-pressure response measured. However, shortcomings in the equipment, instrumentation and the procedural approaches can potentially invalidate the test results obtained from existing HCAs. Measurement and process control limitations confine their operation to static testing over the strain range from 0. 0001 to 0. 20. Many of the existing HCAs are incapable of generalised stress path testing. A new HCA that can simulate the complex loading conditions at a point in a soil deposit, on a hollow cylindrical test specimen, was developed. It facilitates accurate measurements of the specimen?s constitutive and pore-pressure responses over the complete strain range during stress path testing or displacement-controlled loading. Test specimen dimensions, which limit the stress non-uniformity during testing to an acceptable level, were identified. A sample preparation apparatus was also developed and a technique was perfected to reconstitute saturated sand specimens in the new apparatus. The research and development of the new HCA?s cell, its pressure systems, the servo-mechanisms, which displace and rotate the loading piston, their instrumentation and ancillary equipment, are described. Linear actuators control the hydraulic systems, which apply the inner and outer confining pressures and the back-pressure to the specimen. Innovative servo-mechanisms, which induce an axial force and a torque across the specimen, are mounted beneath the cell {{so that it can be}} readily assembled and disassembled by an operator. The cell?s tie bars are located inside its acrylic cylinder and the load path through it is extremely stiff. The servo-mechanisms can quasi-statically or dynamically load specimens of all soil types, weak rock and pavement base materials in direct compression, extension or pure torsion, to failure. They can also apply tensile normal stresses to the test specimen to facilitate investigations into the engineering properties of materials other than soil. The mechanisms have a low inertia, zero backlash and insignificant compliance values. The axial force, torque and the confining pressures that are applied and the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s polar deformational, pore-pressure and volume change responses can be accurately measured. Its static deformational response can be measured over the specimen?s zone of uniform stress, near its mid-height using instruments located inside the cell. These instruments can be remotely relocated during a test to accommodate the specimen?s deformational response. The control sensitivity of the pressure systems and servo-mechanisms and the instruments 2 ̆ 7 resolution and accuracy values are sufficient to facilitate low amplitude cyclic testing in order to determine the soil?s quasi-elastic constitutive properties. The specimen 2 ̆ 7 s boundary displacements can also be measured using instruments located outside the cell. They facilitate dynamic measurements over the reduced strain range from the order of 10 - 4 strain, to failure. A hollow-shaft type encoder was uniquely incorporated in this instance to measure the specimen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>twist.</b> The servo-mechanisms can readily produce the high-speed response, which is necessary to facilitate accurate dynamic testing. A complementary control system was integrated in the new HCA with the aim of developing a fully automated stress path and displacement-controlled test device. Test specimens of 71 mm inner diameter, 100 mm outer diameter and 200 mm high were selected in view of theoretical and practical considerations. These dimensions also facilitate the testing of undisturbed samples. The development of the sample preparation apparatus and the technique, which employs the wet-pluviation method followed by tapping that was perfected, is described. This technique can consistently reconstitute specimens with a uniform controlled density and their dimensions have excellent repeatability...|$|E

40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{and fiber}} diffraction studies of reconstituted F-actin-tropomyosin filaments reveal the azimuthal position of end-to-end linked tropomyosin molecules {{on the surface}} of actin. However, the longitudinal z-position of tropomyosin along F-actin is still uncertain. Without this information, atomic models of F-actin-tropomyosin filaments, free of constraints imposed by troponin or other actin-binding proteins, cannot be formulated, and thus optimal interfacial contacts between actin and tropomyosin remain unknown. Here, a computational search assessing electrostatic interactions for multiple azimuthal locations, z-positions, and pseudo-rotations of tropomyosin on F-actin was performed. The information gleaned was used to localize tropomyosin on F-actin, yielding an atomic model characterized by protein-protein contacts that primarily involve clusters of basic amino acids on actin subdomains 1 and 3 juxtaposed against acidic residues on the successive quasi-repeating units of tropomyosin. A virtually identical model generated by docking F-actin and tropomyosin atomic structures into electron microscopy reconstructions of F-actin-tropomyosin validated the above solution. Here, the z-position of tropomyosin alongside F-actin was defined by matching the seven broad and narrow motifs that typify tropomyosin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>twisting</b> superhelical coiled-coil to the wide and tapering tropomyosin densities seen in surface views of F-actin-tropomyosin reconstructions.
