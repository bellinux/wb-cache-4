5|$|A {{study by}} Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel {{published}} in 2003 {{also found that}} the tyrannosaurid arctometatarsals and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a 'tensile keystone model' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus, increase the animal's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families; while still allowing resiliency that is otherwise reduced in ratites, horses, giraffids and other animals with metapodia to a single element. The study also pointed out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more elastic <b>strain</b> <b>energy,</b> which could have improved locomotor efficiency and decrease the <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> transferred to the bones. The study suggested that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well. Hence, the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals, then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs. The scientists found that arctometatarsals may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration, lateral acceleration and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods. It is also stated in their study that this may imply, though not demonstrate, that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus.|$|E

The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of elastic <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska Trench.|$|E

In recent years the Finite Element Method (FEM) {{has been applied to}} a wide range of elastic and plastic problems, however, few FEM analyses of shape memory phenomena have been reported. In this paper the FEM method has been used to model the martensitic transformation. The model assumes a two variant shear transfornation in a two dimensional grain. Plastic deformation accompanying the transformation is accounted for using the Estrin-Mecking constitutive model. The spatial distribution of elastic and plastic <b>strain</b> <b>energies</b> developed during the transformation is shown to determine variant structure.

40|$|Abstract. Vapor-, electro-, and electroless-{{deposits}} {{have usually}} strong fiber textures. When annealed, the deposits undergo recrystallization or abnormal grain growth {{to reduce their}} energy stored during deposition. The driving force for recrystallization is mainly caused by dislocations, whereas that for abnormal grain growth {{is due to the}} grain boundary, surface, interface, and <b>strain</b> <b>energies.</b> During recrystallization and abnormal grain growth, the texture change can take place. The recrystallization and abnormal grain growth textures are in general of fiber type. However, copper interconnects are subjected to non-planar stress state due to geometric constraints during room temperature and/or elevated temperature annealing. The annealing textures of the thin films and copper interconnects are discussed in terms of the minimization of the surface, interface, and <b>strain</b> <b>energies,</b> the grain boundary energy and mobility, and the strain-energy-release maximization...|$|R
25|$|The method {{assumes that}} the system (the column) is a {{conservative}} system in which energy is not dissipated as heat, hence the energy added to the column by the applied external forces is stored in the column {{in the form of}} <b>strain</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
25|$|At small strains, elastin confers {{stiffness}} to {{the tissue}} and stores {{most of the}} <b>strain</b> <b>energy.</b> The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are usually loose (wavy, crimped). With increasing tissue deformation the collagen is gradually stretched {{in the direction of}} deformation. When taut, these fibers produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is analogous to a nylon stocking, whose rubber band does the role of elastin as the nylon does the role of collagen. In soft tissues the collagen limits the deformation and protects the tissues from injury.|$|E
25|$|While {{the theory}} of FEM can be {{presented}} in different perspectives or emphases, its development for structural analysis follows the more traditional approach via the virtual work principle or the minimum total potential energy principle. The virtual work principle approach is more general as it is applicable to both linear and non-linear material behaviours. The virtual work method {{is an expression of}} conservation of energy: for conservative systems, the work added to the system by a set of applied forces is equal to the energy stored in the system in the form of <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> of the structure's components.|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of HF/ 6 - 31 G(d) {{optimized}} structures, the nonplanar distortions of 135 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been classified as splitting (S-) and arching (A-) distortions. Three bay structures are proposed as the structural origin of S-distortion. Due to the limitation of sample molecules, a set of universal motifs for molecules containing A-distortions is not available; however, a set of motifs and parameters are developed for the semiquantitative estimation of the nonplanar <b>strain</b> <b>energies</b> of PAHs containing the corannulene structure, and {{the differences between the}} E, values from quantum calculations and those from these estimations vary from - 5. 60 to 5. 51 kcal/mol.

The influence of cyclopropa(e) nation and heteroatom substitution is analyzed by a {{comparison with the}} corresponding bicyclic hydrocarbons and separate ring systems. It is shown that the strain caused by fusion with a cyclopropane {{is the sum of}} the separate rings, whereas the strain resulting from fusion with cyclopropene leads to <b>strain</b> <b>energies</b> much larger than the sum of rings, {{as a result of the}} inverted nature of the bridgehead carbon.

40|$|The <b>strain</b> <b>energies</b> in {{straight}} and bent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are calculated by taking {{account of the}} total energy of all the occupied band electrons. The obtained results are in good agreement with previous theoretical studies and experimental observations. The Young's modulus and the effective wall thickness of SWNT are obtained from the bending <b>strain</b> <b>energies</b> of SWNTs with various cross-sectional radii. The repulsion potential between ions contributes {{the main part of}} the Young's modulus of SWNT. The wall thickness of SWNT comes completely from the overlap of electronic orbits, and is approximately of the extension of π orbit of carbon atom. Both the Young's modulus and the wall thickness are independent of the radius and the helicity of SWNT, and insensitive to the fitting parameters. The results show that continuum elasticity theory can serve well to describe the mechanical properties of SWNTs. Comment: 12 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on <b>strain</b> <b>energy,</b> mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical power (work {{per unit}} time) and the {{distance}} over which that power is applied (e.g., leg length) are the key determinants of jump distance and height. As a result, many jumping animals have long legs and muscles that are optimized for maximal power according to the force-velocity relationship of muscles. The maximum power output of muscles is limited, however. To circumvent this limitation, many jumping species slowly pre-stretch elastic elements, such as tendons or apodemes, to store work as <b>strain</b> <b>energy.</b> Such elastic elements can release energy {{at a much higher}} rate (higher power) than equivalent muscle mass, thus increasing launch energy to levels beyond what muscle alone is capable of.|$|E

These methodologies occasionally formulate an optimization problem by defining an objective function based on dynamic parameters, with metaheuristics used to find the solution. In this study, damage localization and quantification is performed by an Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm, which solves the associated optimization problem. Furthermore, this paper looks at the proposed methodology’s performance when using different functions based on natural frequencies, mode shapes, modal flexibilities, modal <b>strain</b> <b>energies</b> and the residual force vector. Simple and multiple damage scenarios are numerically imposed on truss structures to assess {{the performance of the}} proposed methodology.

25|$|A hyperelastic {{material}} {{is a special}} case of a Cauchy elastic material in which the stress at any point is objective and determined only by {{the current state of}} deformation with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration (for more details on deformation see also the pages Deformation (mechanics) and Finite strain). However, the work done by the stresses may depend on the path the deformation takes. Therefore, a Cauchy elastic material has a non-conservative structure, and the stress cannot be derived from a scalar elastic potential function. The special case of Cauchy elastic materials where the work done by the stresses is independent of the path of deformation is referred to as a Green elastic or hyperelastic material. Such materials are conservative and the stresses in the material can be derived by a scalar elastic potential, more commonly known as the <b>Strain</b> <b>energy</b> density function.|$|E

500|$|Many of the foraging, {{breeding}} and signaling behaviors of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using the bill. To prevent brain {{damage from the}} rapid and repeated impacts, woodpeckers {{have a number of}} physical features evolved to protect the brain. These include a relatively small and smooth brain, narrow subdural space, little cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding it to prevent it from moving back and forth inside the skull during pecking, the orientation of the brain within the skull (which maximises the contact area between the brain and the skull) and the short duration of contact. The skull consists of strong but compressible sponge-like bone which is most concentrated in the forehead and the back of the skull. Computer simulations have shown that 99.7 percent of the energy generated in pecking was stored in the form of <b>strain</b> <b>energy,</b> which was distributed throughout the bird's body, with only a small remaining fraction of the energy going into the brain. The pecking also heats up the woodpecker's skull, {{which is part of the}} reason why they often peck in short bursts with brief breaks in between, giving the head some time to cool. During the millisecond before contact with wood, a thickened nictitating membrane closes, protecting the eye from flying debris. These membranes also prevent the retina from tearing. The nostrils are also protected; they are often slit-like and have special feathers to cover them.

500|$|The jump is a three-stage process. First, the {{grasshopper}} fully flexes {{the lower}} part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. [...] Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic <b>strain</b> <b>energy</b> by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.|$|E
