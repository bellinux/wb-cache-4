And which of these it shall be depends on both rich and poor knowing that God is their light; that in the mystery of human life, there is no other light than this by which they can see each other's faces, and live;--light, which is called in another of the books among which the merchant's maxims have been preserved, the [...] "sun of justice,"[34] of which it is promised that it shall rise at last with [...] "healing" [...] (health-giving or helping, making whole or setting at one) in its wings. For truly this healing is only possible by means of justice; no love, no faith, no hope will do it; men will be unwisely fond--vainly faithful, unless primarily they are just; and the mistake of the best men through generation after generation, has been that great one of thinking to help the poor by almsgiving, and by preaching of patience or of hope, and by every other means, emollient or consolatory, except the one thing which God orders for them, justice. But this justice, with its accompanying holiness or helpfulness, being even by the best men denied in its trial time, is by the mass of men hated wherever it appears: so that, when the choice was one day fairly put to them, they denied the Helpful One and the Just;[35] and desired a murderer, sedition-raiser, and robber, to be granted to them;--the murderer instead of the Lord of Life, the sedition-raiser instead of the Prince of Peace, and the robber instead of the Just Judge of all the world.|$|E

50|$|Most {{bird eggs}} have an oval shape, with one end rounded {{and the other}} more pointed. This shape results from the egg being forced through the oviduct. Muscles {{contract}} the oviduct behind the egg, pushing it forward. The egg's wall is still <b>shapeable,</b> and the pointed end develops at the back. Long, pointy eggs are an incidental consequence of having a streamlined body typical of birds with strong flying abilities; flight narrows the oviduct, which changes the type of egg a bird can lay. Cliff-nesting birds often have highly conical eggs. They {{are less likely to}} roll off, tending instead to roll around in a tight circle; this trait is likely to have arisen due to evolution via natural selection.

During that year, Lee also produced one of his Godret stone pieces called Godret Stone (1957). Godret stone refers to a stone that is used for tying knots when plaiting handcrafted mats in Korea. His interest in fundamental changes in physical materiality led to the production of the Godret stone series. Although Lee's shaped Godret stones seem soft and <b>shapeable,</b> they are hard and solid in essence. In 2004, Lee further explained his thinking behind the piece in Kim Yung-hee's essay Following the Godret Stone: Entangled Energy/Spiritual World with Modernity.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the development of}} materials, technologies and circuits applied for the fabrication of {{a new class of}} microelectronic devices that are relying on a three-dimensional shape variation namely <b>shapeable</b> microelectronics. <b>Shapeable</b> microelectronics has a far-reachable future in foreseeable applications that are dealing with arbitrarily shaped geometries, revolutionizing the field of neuronal implants and interfaces, mechanical prosthetics and regenerative medicine in general. <b>Shapeable</b> microelectronics can deterministically interface and stimulate delicate biological tissue mechanically or electrically. Applied in flexible and printable devices <b>shapeable</b> microelectronics can provide novel functionalities with unmatched mechanical and electrical performance. For the purpose of <b>shapeable</b> microelectronics, novel materials based on metallic multilayers, photopatternable organic and metal-organic polymers were synthesized. Achieved polymeric platform, being mechanically adaptable, provides possibility of a gentle automatic attachment and subsequent release of active micro-scale devices. Equipped with integrated electronic the platform provides an interface to the neural tissue, confining neural fibers and, if necessary, guiding the regeneration of the tissue with a minimal impact. The self-assembly capability of the platform enables the high yield manufacture of three-dimensionally shaped devices that are relying on geometry/stress dependent physical effects that are evolving in magnetic materials including magentostriction and shape anisotropy. Developed arrays of giant magnetoimpedance sensors and cuff implants provide a possibility to address physiological processes locally or distantly via magnetic and electric fields that are generated deep inside the organism, providing unique real time health monitoring capabilities. Fabricated on a large scale <b>shapeable</b> magnetosensory systems and nanostructured materials demonstrate outstanding mechanical and electrical performance.

30|$|If {{we would}} succeed in obtaining such results from both forms of “deriving” – from today’s {{knowledge}} regarding {{the future and}} from the future regarding currently pending decisions –, which clearly and with reason claim consensus then {{the search for the}} best decision would, in principle, be automatable in form of an algorithm. Troublesome and controversial debates and difficult negotiation processes would no longer be necessary. This is the latent (and technocratic!) ideal behind the mode 1 orientation by futures studies. Its basic structure can particularly be recognised {{by the fact that the}} space for the <b>shapeable</b> part – which has to be assumed first in order to be able to speak of alternative options for decision – finally disappears completely in the “derivation” chain. This is because this two-step “derivation” approach reduces the shaping to an automatable act. Or, to put it in another way: the distinction made above between one part of the future which was introduced as determined and one part which is considered as <b>shapeable</b> disappears due to the fact that the <b>shapeable</b> part is “derived” from the causal knowledge extrapolated to the future. Thus the deterministic part of the future becomes “encroaching” and also determines – via the figure of “deriving optimal decisions” – that part which was at first conceived as <b>shapeable.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{palette of}} {{materials}} {{has been developed}} by {{the oil and gas}} sector. The expected depletion of fossil resources and the stress on the climate from burning them has, however, turned the world’s attention to renewable resources. To develop competitive high quality products from renewable resources, is indeed a challenge for the research community. Cellulose is a renewable material with a variety of properties depending on source, processing and other modifications. In liquid food packaging the cellulose-based carton is combined with plastics to make the package impermeable to water. The production of carton packages with a <b>shapeable</b> cellulosic material would be an interesting way to enhance its function, reduce the amount of fossil-based material in it and to make it more competitive towards plastic bottles. In this work, cellulose was made <b>shapeable</b> through blending with moldable polyethene. Esterified cellulose was used in order to increase the interfacial adhesion and the dispersion of cellulose in composites. Esters with various hydrophobicities, carbonyl hydrogen-bonding and degree of substitution were prepared. It was concluded that the fiber dispersion in the composites could be both improved and impaired by the esterification. Moreover, the eventual benefits of esterification on the interfacial adhesion, was counteracted by weakening and fragmentation of the fibers because of the chemical treatment and the mechanical processing. Cellulose was also made <b>shapeable</b> through coagulation of the cellulose-ionic liquid solutions with a coagulation agent (e. g. water), to obtain <b>shapeable</b> three-component gels. The strength, the stiffness and the thermal degradation, were found to depend on the types and amounts of the gel constituents. By regeneration of cellulose, from the gels, stiff regenerated cellulose was obtained...|$|E
40|$|In our {{everyday}} life, we {{are surrounded by}} electronic devices designed {{in a way to}} meet requirements for a certain application, which is determined primarily by their shape, size, and rigidity of a substrate. In this respect, the natural question, which surprisingly has only recently been raised, is: can one create non-rigid electronics that can be reshaped on demand after its fabrication? The crucial aspect of this technology is the exploitation of °exible or even stretchable ultra-thin membranes in multi-func-tional devices directly integrable on-chip with cur-rently available main-stream technologies.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the benefits of}} randomization in two fundamental signal processing techniques: sampling and filtering. The first part develops randomized non-uniform sampling as a method to mitigate the effects of aliasing. Randomization of the sampling times is shown to convert aliasing error due to uniform under-sampling into uncorrelated <b>shapeable</b> noise. In certain applications, especially perceptual ones, this form of error may be preferable. Two sampling structures with are developed in this thesis. In the first, denoted simple randomized sampling, non-white sampling processes can be designed to frequency-shape the error spectrum, so that its power is minimized in the band of interest. In the second model, denoted filtered randomized sampling, a pre-filter, post-filter, and the sampling process can be designed to further frequency-shape the error to improve performance. The thesis develops design techniques using parametric binary process models to optimize the performance of randomized non-uniform sampling. In addition, a detailed second-order error analysis, including performance bounds and results from simulation, is presented {{for each type of}} sampling. The second part of this thesis develops randomization as a method to improve the performance of multiplier-less FIR filters. Static multiplier-less filters, even when carefully designed, result in frequency distortion as compared to a desired continuous-valued filter. Replacing each static tap with a binary random process is shown to mitigate this distortion, converting the error into uncorrelated <b>shapeable</b> noise. As with randomized sampling, in certain applications this form of error may be preferable. This thesis presents a FIR Direct Form I randomized multiplier-less filter structure denoted binary randomized filtering (BRF). In its most general form, BRF incorporates over-sampling combined with a tapped delay-line that changes in time according to a binary vector process. (cont) The time and tap correlation of the binary vector process can be designed to improve the error performance.

40|$|An {{overview}} on {{the underlying}} {{principles of the}} hybrid plasma wakefield acceleration scheme dubbed "Trojan Horse" acceleration is given. The concept is based on laser-controlled release of electrons directly into a particle-beam-driven plasma blowout, {{paving the way for}} controlled, <b>shapeable</b> electron bunches with ultralow emittance and ultrahigh brightness. Combining the virtues of a low-ionization-threshold underdense photocathode with the GV/m-scale electric fields of a practically dephasing-free beam-driven plasma blowout, this constitutes a 4 th generation electron acceleration scheme. It is applicable as a beam brightness transformer for electron bunches from LWFA and PWFA systems alike. At FACET, the proof-of-concept experiment "E- 210 : Trojan Horse Plasma Wakefield Acceleration" has recently been approved and is in preparation. At the same time, various LWFA facilities are currently considered to host experiments aiming at stabilizing and boosting the electron bunch output quality via a trojan horse afterburner stage.
