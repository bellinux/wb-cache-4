40|$|Recent {{years the}} {{numerical}} method of the simulation for the airbag deployment {{process has been}} improved with new material model and thermodynamic model, {{and has become a}} standard application of finite element codes. With such simulation tools, it is possible to attempt supporting the airbag module design and evaluating the injuries of dummy in airbag hazard area or out-of-position. Although the simulation model for the airbag’s deployment process is usually correlated with the static airbag deployments and reaction force results, up-to-date the numerical approach to represent the fluid flow within the airbag is both costly and time consuming. This paper will provide an overview of the correlation process for reducing the resource to be invested. The following two tests are conducted for acquiring the reference data. 1. <b>Static</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>test</b> for acquiring the airbag internal pressure during the deployment process and 2. Drop tower test for acquiring the fully deployed airbag’s reaction force. The drop tower test is simulated to determine the parameter related to the leakage of fabric and vent holes with the airbag model using the uniform pressure method offering the relatively short solving time. And then <b>Static</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>test</b> is simulated for determining the parameter related to the unfolding phase with the airbag model using the corpuscular (particle) method. These two simulations are compared to the test results and satisfactory correlation is found in both the cases. The drop tower simulation using the uniform pressure method leads to reduce the total correlation time and to easily extend the application for protection of the driver occupant while in-position. This airbag model can be used in parametric studies to investigate the effects of airbag module design changes and to study the out-of-position (OOP) load case...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new Passage Airbag (PAB) {{folding method}} which {{integrates}} simulation folding and manual folding is presented. Determining {{how to get}} a multi-layer 2 D surface is vital to PAB folding. By means of 3 D PAB flattening process simulation, 2 D surface with a minimum area loss is created. This method avoids the traditional measurement of real PAB to obtain 2 D airbag with inaccurate shape and size. After flattening PAB simulation, the 2 D surfaces are meshed with respect to the predefined folding lines. The subsequent folding steps of flat 2 D airbag are carried out according to the folding requirements. Finally, the reference geometry meshing and folded airbag are obtained accurately and rapidly. The <b>static</b> PAB <b>deployment</b> <b>test</b> is modeled using particle method for gas flow to validate this folding method. Good correlation between simulation and test results during early deployment phase of airbag is achieved. It has proven the effectiveness and feasibility of this PAB folding method...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the effectiveness of a passenger airbag can be increased by making the passenger airbag adaptive to crash conditions, such as severity and type of impact, belt use, and passenger size. Such an adaptive passenger airbag will better cover a wider range of crash situations than a conventional airbag system. In this study, mathematical modeling was performed for the optimization of an existing passenger airbag restraint system. The final solution can be used as reference for the design of an adaptive airbag system. The present study was divided into four steps: (1) a FEM airbag model was developed by using the MADYMO 3 D program based on an existing prototype of a passenger airbag; (2) the airbag model was validated against airbag <b>static</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>tests,</b> airbag drop tests, and sled tests; (3) the performance of passenger airbag systems of different volumes was evaluated in terms of injury criteria for front seat occupants of different sizes; (4) a parameter study with different impact conditions and varying levels of variables was carried out to find an optimized design of an adaptive passenger airbag restraint system. Three variables selected for passenger airbag optimization are the airbag volume, the bag pressure, and the size of the ventilation hole. Four input factors that varied in different crash conditions are the dummy size, belted/unbelted, impact speed, and rigid/deformable barrier. The HIC, chest acceleration, chest deflection, neck moment, and axial femur force were calculated in each simulation. The effectiveness of the passenger airbag models was evaluated in terms of the injury criteria of FMVSS 208 and other relevant injury parameters. The influence of the airbag variables on the dummy response was analyzed and discussed. The size of the ventilation hole was found to have the dominating influence on the performance of the airbag. The best effect of the passenger airbag system could be obtained either by using a small airbag with high initial pressure or by using a big airbag with low initial pressure. The findings in the present study indicate that a midsize volume (120 -liter) airbag with variable venthole can give front seat occupants of different sizes better protection over a range of crash severities than a conventional big (150 -liter) airbag with only one size of venthole. The results from this study can be used for the development of a future adaptive passenger airbag system...|$|R
40|$|A gas-generating {{device was}} {{developed}} to supplement the ram-air inflation of a supersonic ballute. The device is designed to initially pressurize the ballute following deployment, exposing and orienting its ram-air inlets to free-stream air for complete inflation. The supplemental pressurization decreases the total inflation time, and {{increases the likelihood of}} a successful inflation. The device contains a reservoir filled with an aqueous mixture of methanol that, when released in to the interior of the ballute, rapidly vaporizes due to the low ambient pressure. Upon activation of the device, a pair of redundant ring mechanisms initiate pyrotechnic charges that pressurize and rupture the reservoir, resulting in ejection of the methanol in to the ballute. In addition to its role in inflation, the device serves as the structural connection to the ballute. Analytical models were developed for the inflation capability of the device, which were verified using vacuum chamber testing of developmental hardware. <b>Static,</b> <b>deployment,</b> and environmental <b>testing</b> demonstrated the functionality of the ring mechanism and reservoir under several temperature and pressure conditions. Finally, the device was successfully operated during the first Supersonic Flight Dynamics Test (SFDT) of NASA's Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) project. The design architecture is scalable to accommodate different quantities of gas generation, can be adjusted to operate in a variety of temperature and atmospheric pressure regimes, and provides a robust device that may be installed with minimal risk to personnel or hardware...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{deployment}} is an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) ambulance {{management strategy}} where 911 call demand coverage is maximized continuously through time. Unlike <b>static</b> <b>deployment</b> where dispatched ambulances leave a coverage gap until {{they return to}} their home-base after service, dynamic deployment redeploys idle ambulances to different locations if that leads {{to an increase in}} demand coverage. The purpose of this dissertation was to study dynamic deployment as a viable, beneficial, and cost-effective methodology in managing EMS ambulances and crews. The literature, while rich in studies on <b>static</b> <b>deployment,</b> was lacking when it came to ambulance management strategies like dynamic deployment. Through a discrete-event simulation model, hypothetical EMS systems were simulated under dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>deployment</b> with different demand patterns, demand loads, and system sizes. Dynamic deployment was found to be as good, or often better, in emergency response metrics than <b>static</b> <b>deployment.</b> When EMS systems want to meet a certain response goal, dynamic deployment may enable them to achieve that performance with fewer vehicles than <b>static</b> <b>deployment.</b> While savings in number of vehicles translate to substantial savings in crew wages and vehicular purchasing costs, dynamic deployment may increase operating costs per vehicle because of the extra mileage involved in redeployments. Many EMS systems with average vehicular utilizations of 40 % to 50 % may find, however, that dynamic deployment may be both cost-effective and beneficial in improving response performance. Different redeployment strategies were studied to address the added travel costs of dynamic deployment and a min-sum assignment model was found to decrease redeployment travel the most without impacting response performance. Finally, a procedure and a mathematical model were developed to route vehicles intelligently such that demand coverage is maximized throughout the redeployment process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} {{application of}} wireless technologies including Wireless Sensor Actuator Networks (WSAN) in industry {{has given rise}} to a plethora of protocol designs. These designs target metrics ranging from energy efficiency to real-time constraints.
